spreading it all over the unsign evenly

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.360 
spreading it all over the unsign evenly
since<00:00:39.030> my<00:00:39.270> picture<00:00:39.930> collage<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.649> black<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
since my picture collage is in black and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.209 
since my picture collage is in black and
white<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.610> wanted<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> pop<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.680> color<00:00:43.920> so

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
white I wanted to have a pop of color so

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.130 
white I wanted to have a pop of color so
that's<00:00:44.399> why<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.700> painting<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.180> an<00:00:45.390> side<00:00:45.690> red

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
that's why I'm painting this an side red

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
that's why I'm painting this an side red
I'm<00:00:46.530> actually<00:00:47.190> not<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.910> applying

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
I'm actually not going to be applying

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
I'm actually not going to be applying
any<00:00:48.600> pictures<00:00:49.050> onto<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.039> think

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
any pictures onto this because I think

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.680 
any pictures onto this because I think
it<00:00:50.430> might<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> little<00:00:50.910> difficult<00:00:51.510> since

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it might be a little difficult since

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479 
it might be a little difficult since
it's<00:00:51.899> pretty<00:00:52.110> narrow<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.129> I'm<00:00:53.280> just

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
it's pretty narrow so here I'm just

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.010 
it's pretty narrow so here I'm just
painting<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.879> inside<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> outside<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
painting the inside and the outside of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.189 
painting the inside and the outside of
the<00:00:55.230> letter<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.559> well<00:00:56.629> since<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> red<00:00:57.930> paint

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the letter as well since the red paint

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.080 
the letter as well since the red paint
is<00:00:58.289> already<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.579> using<00:00:59.789> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is already out I'm going to be using it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
is already out I'm going to be using it
to<00:01:00.270> paint<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> rims<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> other<00:01:01.469> letters

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to paint the rims of the other letters

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.160 
to paint the rims of the other letters
and<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.910> doing<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.110> said

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and I'm doing this because like I said

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
and I'm doing this because like I said
my<00:01:04.650> collage<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.250> black<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.489> white<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.119> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
my collage is in black and white so I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.990 
my collage is in black and white so I
really<00:01:06.540> wanted<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.869> hint<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.710> color<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.909> I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
really wanted that hint of color and I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.969 
really wanted that hint of color and I
like<00:01:09.150> using<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> sponge<00:01:09.900> applicator<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.799> do

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
like using the sponge applicator to do

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.760 
like using the sponge applicator to do
this<00:01:11.130> because<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.970> has<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:12.869> thin<00:01:13.290> tip

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
this because it has a really thin tip

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.440 
this because it has a really thin tip
and<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.490> easier<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.299> around

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and so it's a lot easier to get around

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
and so it's a lot easier to get around
the<00:01:15.720> border<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.290> since<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.920> pictures<00:01:17.280> are

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the border and since the pictures are

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
the border and since the pictures are
going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.970> covering<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> letter<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.140> know

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
going to be covering the letter you know

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.749 
going to be covering the letter you know
it's<00:01:19.439> okay<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:20.400> messy

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it's okay if you're a little bit messy

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
it's okay if you're a little bit messy
so<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:22.770> couldn't<00:01:23.130> find<00:01:23.400> any<00:01:23.790> black<00:01:24.150> letters<00:01:24.689> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
so I couldn't find any black letters so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.420 
so I couldn't find any black letters so
I'm<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.860> paint<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> letters

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
I'm going to just paint the letters

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.700 
I'm going to just paint the letters
black<00:01:26.880> myself<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:28.020> doing<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.470> because

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
black myself and I'm doing this because

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.550 
black myself and I'm doing this because
when<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.400> start<00:01:29.640> applying<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.390> pictures<00:01:30.930> you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
when you start applying the pictures you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.399 
when you start applying the pictures you
might<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.820> spots<00:01:33.150> where<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
might have some spots where you know the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.590 
might have some spots where you know the
pictures<00:01:34.799> aren't<00:01:35.100> covering<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.850> because<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
pictures aren't covering but because the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.210 
pictures aren't covering but because the
background<00:01:37.049> will<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.200> black<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.979> won't<00:01:38.130> be

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
newspapers so that it doesn't dry it up

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.550 
newspapers so that it doesn't dry it up
and<00:01:45.060> stick<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> let<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.170> dry<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and stick to it and let it dry for a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800 
and stick to it and let it dry for a
couple<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.920> hours<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.149> I'm<00:01:48.240> doing<00:01:48.540> here

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
couple of hours so what I'm doing here

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.480 
couple of hours so what I'm doing here
is<00:01:48.930> trying<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.350> figure<00:01:49.619> out<00:01:49.680> where<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> want<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is trying to figure out where I want to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.120 
is trying to figure out where I want to
glue<00:01:51.180> my<00:01:51.420> arms<00:01:51.780> on

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
glue my arms on

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.370 
glue my arms on
in<00:01:52.310> between<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.729> M<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.090> J<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.689> I'm

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
in between the M and the J and I'm

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.789 
in between the M and the J and I'm
tracing<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.860> with<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.070> pencil<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.270> know

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
tracing it with a pencil just so I know

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.679 
tracing it with a pencil just so I know
where<00:01:57.799> it<00:01:58.130> will<00:01:58.250> be<00:01:58.340> placed<00:01:58.579> as<00:01:58.969> I<00:01:59.299> start

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
where it will be placed as I start

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.469 
where it will be placed as I start
gluing<00:01:59.960> my<00:02:00.259> pictures<00:02:00.700> once<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.850> cut<00:02:02.090> out<00:02:02.119> all<00:02:02.270> of

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
gluing my pictures once I cut out all of

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.510 
gluing my pictures once I cut out all of
my<00:02:02.720> pictures<00:02:02.990> I'm<00:02:03.409> going<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.890> start<00:02:04.189> placing

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
my pictures I'm going to start placing

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.060 
my pictures I'm going to start placing
it<00:02:04.909> onto<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.299> letters<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:06.020> see<00:02:06.289> where<00:02:06.649> I<00:02:06.679> want

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
it onto the letters to see where I want

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.919 
it onto the letters to see where I want
it<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.219> be<00:02:07.429> glued<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:08.269> really<00:02:08.509> helps<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> have

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
it to be glued it really helps to have

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.600 
it to be glued it really helps to have
different<00:02:09.259> sizes<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.619> pictures<00:02:10.099> as<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.489> can

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
different sizes of pictures as you can

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.610 
different sizes of pictures as you can
see<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.819> have<00:02:11.120> some<00:02:11.360> huge<00:02:11.750> ones<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.440> some

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
see I have some huge ones and some

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.290 
see I have some huge ones and some
really<00:02:12.890> tiny<00:02:13.099> ones<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.790> really<00:02:13.970> helps

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
really tiny ones and it really helps

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.000 
really tiny ones and it really helps
when<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.599> start<00:02:14.840> aligning<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.769> course

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
when you start aligning it and of course

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.650 
when you start aligning it and of course
it<00:02:16.280> can<00:02:16.370> overlap<00:02:16.849> so<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.180> don't<00:02:17.330> have<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.540> be

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
it can overlap so you don't have to be

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.660 
it can overlap so you don't have to be
so<00:02:17.840> clean<00:02:18.140> about<00:02:18.349> it<00:02:18.410> now<00:02:19.130> with<00:02:19.340> your<00:02:19.370> Maj

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
so clean about it now with your Maj

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.699 
so clean about it now with your Maj
pause<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.239> can<00:02:20.300> start<00:02:20.660> gluing<00:02:20.870> your<00:02:21.110> pictures

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
pause you can start gluing your pictures

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.370 
pause you can start gluing your pictures
one<00:02:22.069> by<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:23.000> here<00:02:23.360> I'm<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.510> lifting<00:02:23.930> up<00:02:24.260> a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
one by one so here I'm just lifting up a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.080 
one by one so here I'm just lifting up a
picture<00:02:24.590> applying<00:02:25.130> some<00:02:25.370> glue<00:02:25.640> onto<00:02:25.880> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
picture applying some glue onto the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.930 
picture applying some glue onto the
wooden<00:02:26.810> letter<00:02:27.019> and<00:02:27.319> then<00:02:27.769> just<00:02:28.190> pressing<00:02:28.849> it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
wooden letter and then just pressing it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.930 
wooden letter and then just pressing it
down<00:02:29.150> for<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> few<00:02:29.569> seconds<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.670> can<00:02:31.700> also

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
down for a few seconds you can also

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.729 
down for a few seconds you can also
apply<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.360> Mod<00:02:32.630> Podge<00:02:32.870> on<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.319> back<00:02:33.530> of

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
apply the Mod Podge on to the back of

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.259 
apply the Mod Podge on to the back of
the<00:02:33.830> picture<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.459> usually<00:02:34.849> I'll<00:02:34.940> do<00:02:35.120> this

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
the picture and usually I'll do this

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.150 
the picture and usually I'll do this
with<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.599> smaller<00:02:35.930> one<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.040> lot

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
with the smaller one so that it's a lot

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.100 
with the smaller one so that it's a lot
easier<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.760> paste<00:02:43.360> once<00:02:44.360> you're<00:02:44.569> done<00:02:44.810> modge

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
easier to paste once you're done modge

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.080 
easier to paste once you're done modge
podge<00:02:45.140> iing<00:02:45.739> everything<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.549> want<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.849> flip

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
podge iing everything you want to flip

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.150 
podge iing everything you want to flip
it<00:02:47.239> over<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.569> start<00:02:48.019> cutting<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.530> edges<00:02:48.950> with

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
it over and start cutting the edges with

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.059 
it over and start cutting the edges with
an<00:02:49.310> exacto<00:02:50.150> net<00:02:50.329> yes<00:02:51.079> I'm<00:02:51.380> using<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.829> kitchen

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
an exacto net yes I'm using a kitchen

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.740 
an exacto net yes I'm using a kitchen
knife<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:52.610> that's<00:02:52.760> only<00:02:52.910> because<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.450> couldn't

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
knife but that's only because I couldn't

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.800 
knife but that's only because I couldn't
find<00:02:53.989> my<00:02:54.230> exacto<00:02:54.739> knife<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.329> it<00:02:56.569> was<00:02:56.780> a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
find my exacto knife and it so it was a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.930 
find my exacto knife and it so it was a
lot<00:02:57.079> harder<00:02:57.350> so<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.799> definitely<00:02:58.069> recommend

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
lot harder so I definitely recommend

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.220 
lot harder so I definitely recommend
using<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.420> doctor<00:02:59.810> knife<00:03:01.359> so<00:03:02.359> now<00:03:02.600> we're<00:03:02.959> off<00:03:03.049> to

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
using a doctor knife so now we're off to

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.900 
using a doctor knife so now we're off to
the<00:03:03.290> gluing<00:03:03.799> part<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.430> want<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:04.730> make<00:03:04.880> sure

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
the gluing part so you want to make sure

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.020 
the gluing part so you want to make sure
that<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:06.109> are<00:03:06.290> gluing<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:06.980> from<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.340> back<00:03:07.639> and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
that you are gluing it from the back and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.030 
that you are gluing it from the back and
so<00:03:08.450> you'll<00:03:08.630> get<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.959> hot<00:03:09.170> glue<00:03:09.380> gun<00:03:09.410> start

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
so you'll get the hot glue gun start

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.840 
so you'll get the hot glue gun start
going<00:03:10.489> along<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.209> edges<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.959> where<00:03:12.889> both<00:03:13.609> the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
going along the edges of where both the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.780 
going along the edges of where both the
letters<00:03:14.180> meet<00:03:14.569> like<00:03:15.109> I'm<00:03:15.290> doing<00:03:15.560> here<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:16.670> can

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
letters meet like I'm doing here you can

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.460 
letters meet like I'm doing here you can
also<00:03:16.940> apply<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.359> little<00:03:17.480> bit<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.079> glue<00:03:18.290> in

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
also apply a little bit of the glue in
