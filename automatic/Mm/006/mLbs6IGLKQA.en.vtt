00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.379

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.439
 between matte reflective and touch 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.869
 or not touch display or full hd and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.269
 only hd resolution 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 but the tour will stay that way 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 always the same one here already 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.710
 chiclet keyboard nice big and comfortable 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.870
 to serve also a huge 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.360
 trackpad we are loose space for 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.730
 up to four fingers in height not 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.920
 quite as high as in 15 but very 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.399
 Convenient film and touch also entered 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.879
 optical drive may not or poor 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.469
 stream usb 2.0 2 x at the front if we 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.060
 once they handle nothing but two of me 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.890
 statistics at the front and a bridge at the reader 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.220
 and here we have headphones again 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.880
 microphone usb 3 hdmi network vega and 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.470
 Do you know the fans here that was before 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.820
 recently there we have one 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.660
 Replaceable battery of up to seven 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.630
 to keep hours 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.000
 and otherwise two speakers once 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.850
 here and once below and sd card 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.320
 or ram or hard disk 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.630
 unfortunately not easy to exchange 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.460
 The display is relatively easy 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.200
 otherwise they work very hard 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.060
 we should have gone a long way 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.320
 However, no fear only the battery 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.150
 and nothing else 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.650
 Of course we also have one here 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.869
 webcam built in the same was started 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.330
 can be found here under windows 8.1 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.220
 of course already preinstalled and 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.680
 that could see that the webcam also in 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.119
 hd has a very nice picture and also 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.790
 is fast and needed 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.650
 the displays must recognize and we 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.660
 have the option here between the 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.820
 intel processor and amd or nvidia 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.690

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.430

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.050

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.610

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.850
