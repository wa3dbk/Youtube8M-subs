personally I was a huge fan of the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.450 
personally I was a huge fan of the
original<00:01:07.049> prototype<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.950> does<00:01:08.100> anything

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
original prototype and it does anything

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
original prototype and it does anything
I'd<00:01:08.729> say<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.299> wrong<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
I'd say that was wrong with it was the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.679 
I'd say that was wrong with it was the
fact<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.799> graphically<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.790> didn't<00:01:12.180> impress

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
fact that graphically it didn't impress

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
fact that graphically it didn't impress
you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.040> had<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> lot

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you know it was very kind of had a lot

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
you know it was very kind of had a lot
of<00:01:14.880> bugs<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.270> thing<00:01:15.509> got<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> few<00:01:15.930> bugs<00:01:16.140> anyway

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
of bugs that thing got a few bugs anyway

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.899 
of bugs that thing got a few bugs anyway
here<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.369> didn't<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.729> look

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
here and there and didn't really look

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.340 
here and there and didn't really look
that<00:01:17.970> nice<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.479> textures<00:01:18.840> I'm<00:01:18.930> kind<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> nasty

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that nice of textures I'm kind of nasty

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.859 
that nice of textures I'm kind of nasty
they<00:01:20.070> looked<00:01:20.280> very<00:01:20.460> bland<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> game<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.810> I

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
they looked very bland as a game and I

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.600 
they looked very bland as a game and I
think<00:01:22.080> that's<00:01:22.229> why<00:01:22.380> infamous<00:01:23.009> excelled<00:01:23.430> over

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
think that's why infamous excelled over

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.190 
think that's why infamous excelled over
the<00:01:23.759> top<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.600> they<00:01:24.720> both<00:01:24.869> released

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the top of it because they both released

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.770 
the top of it because they both released
very<00:01:25.350> very<00:01:26.100> close<00:01:26.310> dates<00:01:26.580> um<00:01:26.880> together<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
very very close dates um together and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
very very close dates um together and
they're<00:01:27.869> both<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.320> following<00:01:29.159> kind<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
they're both kind of following kind of

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.039 
they're both kind of following kind of
superhero<00:01:29.880> kind<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.900> story<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:33.049> think

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
superhero kind of story and I think

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.050 
superhero kind of story and I think
infamous<00:01:34.710> Excel<00:01:35.100> further<00:01:35.430> than<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.820> did

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
infamous Excel further than this did

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.520 
infamous Excel further than this did
just<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.570> fact<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.840> inform<00:01:37.229> us<00:01:37.290> look

excited for this game

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.700 
excited for this game
quite<00:06:26.660> know<00:06:26.840> so<00:06:26.990> I<00:06:27.020> was<00:06:27.110> hoping<00:06:27.200> for<00:06:27.410> a<00:06:27.560> number

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
quite know so I was hoping for a number

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.170 
quite know so I was hoping for a number
two<00:06:27.920> because<00:06:28.160> I<00:06:28.340> really<00:06:28.610> want<00:06:28.790> to<00:06:28.820> see<00:06:28.940> where

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
two because I really want to see where

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.120 
two because I really want to see where
they<00:06:29.300> go<00:06:29.330> after<00:06:29.780> the<00:06:29.990> first<00:06:30.170> one<00:06:30.410> because<00:06:30.560> the

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
they go after the first one because the

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.500 
they go after the first one because the
first<00:06:31.340> one<00:06:31.460> was<00:06:31.520> great<00:06:31.790> just<00:06:31.940> had<00:06:32.120> some<00:06:32.270> flaws

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
first one was great just had some flaws

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.750 
first one was great just had some flaws
that<00:06:32.810> if<00:06:33.230> improved<00:06:33.740> could<00:06:34.370> make<00:06:34.490> a<00:06:34.520> fantastic

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
that if improved could make a fantastic

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.040 
that if improved could make a fantastic
game<00:06:35.210> so<00:06:35.360> I<00:06:35.420> was<00:06:35.510> hoping<00:06:35.600> they'd<00:06:35.810> make<00:06:35.930> a

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
game so I was hoping they'd make a

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.330 
game so I was hoping they'd make a
second<00:06:36.320> one<00:06:36.350> what's<00:06:36.890> happen<00:06:37.130> when<00:06:37.220> they

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
second one what's happen when they

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.830 
second one what's happen when they
announced<00:06:37.760> it<00:06:37.880> and<00:06:38.330> that's<00:06:38.480> a<00:06:38.570> scene<00:06:38.720> this
