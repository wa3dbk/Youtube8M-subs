 August 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.100
 ok and it's a different event from the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.979
 games events that we are 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.330
 accustomed to seeing things right is like 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.060
 it's usually a gaming event 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.100
 usually a very large place that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.840
 I'm going to attract a lot of people and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.479
 such and what usually happens the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.670
 companies will set up their booths there ok 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.280
 and released their games their 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.560
 new technologies usually know 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.119
 games are the games in the right case and the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.280
 companies have also chosen console 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.810
 the new consoles gives a look play a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.280
 Bit of a test right? 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.570
 generally this is how the big 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.920
 most of the games events that people 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.820

 Okay, just the battle of the games he's a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.040
 little different 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.780
 what his idea of his own name already 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.240
 says game battle so he's a 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.890
 profile in a tournament event because 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.689
 I 'm just not a tournament for players 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.700

 The arena is going to suck. 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.340

 Okay, you can attend up to two 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.420
 tournaments per day to participate in 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.190
 two different arenas per day then 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.989
 Give it to you, you can lose up to four 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.239
 tournaments and any awards 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.160
 award is simply the expensive console 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.170
 If you win the tournament you take the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.780
 car console is playing your xbox 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.730
 live xbox and ps3 wii ps3 and the second 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.260
 placed takes the game is the game in the car 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.570
 in which you were playing the tournament 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.160
 And as I said the coolest of all is that 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.900
 anyone can join you not 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.070
 need to be a professional player to 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.080
 that's right 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.120
 however the only safe we know 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.910
 that it is a very popular game and that 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.250
 There are professional teams in Brazil, right? 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.880
 it will work a little differently 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.790
 It's going to happen before the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.560
 battle of games a classificatory only 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.060
 for the claudio jury tournament 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.290
 it will be this classificatory but 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.810
 basically serves to me what 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.580
 will separate and professional teams 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.930
 two teams are formed at the time 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.030
 between friends and that they are not 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.830
 Let's talk professionals so, right. 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.260
 this qualifier will happen now 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.930
 in June 12 and 13 days 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.310
 It will also be in person, and for you. 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.500
 participate in the qualifier you already 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.340

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.040
 already guaranteed its presence in the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.290
 battalion of games also because 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.300
 happens is a qualifying not a 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.770
 is followed by the following 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.100
 battle of the warriors will have two 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.360
 open key and key 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.870

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.210

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.740
 sure the open key is the key to 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.720
 those teams that were formed in the 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.280

 the open key wants to play for fun and 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.650
 see how far you go you go to 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.400
 that open key there in the battalion of 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.220

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.960
 already the professional key the final key is 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.660
 the key where the tournament will really be 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.700
 really understood then what happens 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.740
 the eight best teams of the open key 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.660

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.560
 July will form the final key understood 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.020
 the professional key that we are 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.910
 calling ok then there are eight teams of 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.500
 each are eight professional teams is 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.720

 eight teams leaving open may have 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.180
 also here professionals who happens 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.410
 other teams that are not picking up 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.400
 qualifying now that you are not 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.260
 between the first eight 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.330
 will now be played 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.190
 for the holding key understood then that 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.139
 will have several teams 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.520
 and the top eight open keys and the 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.070
 eight qualifying the best 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.840
 now they will form a final key the key 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.000
 professional who are going to talk and 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.320
 grand prix of the cup championship 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.849
 of the world that will be different from 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.500
 the championship precisely because it is already a 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.650
 classificatory and has a 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.750
 different prizes are also you 6 thousand 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.389
 total prize money and 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.460
 plus three thousand reais for the champion team 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.110
 ok so it's not only the soil is not only 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.220
 game will not have cash prize 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.110
 so then it's going to be a championship 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.190
 gigantic why everyone is 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.500
 speaking that it will be the biggest championship 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.169
 cart and latin america 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.360
 Alright then if you have your team face 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.099
 sign up is your chance this year to 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.320
 people had the car had a type that was 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.120
 the official actvision decod championship 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.500
 there in los angeles we had a 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.000
 Elimination only for Brazil, the people 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.800
 has a Brazilian team representing there 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.539
 and in this championship it became clear how 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.400
 people do not have a structure that 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.469
 internally silver leading a team 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.240
 there and this championship and now you can 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:36.830
 be a great first step in proposing 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.610
 Next year, we'll have teams. 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.199
 formed and ready to face 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.939
 facing the teams out there then 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.659
 Do you have your team that does not lose this? 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:44.370
 chance 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.840
 makes your team subscribe to 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.849
 and if you simply
