 the saga of crash bandicoot good this 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.010
 in the file the game consists of five 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.740
 parts the link to the description of 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.200
 video that will direct you the blog of the

 of the channel and good here is going to be this 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.800
 the section I know that 's where the 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.030
 Most costumes games 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.770
 I have 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.080
 simply low and here you will find 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.630
 in the game the respective game with the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.190
 respective links if you realize 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.230
 vi format and is in Spanish 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.930
 suddenly because of the incident they are interested 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.579
 other games you can keep looking for 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.280
 sections are not all games 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.159
 precision not yet little by little I'm going 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.510
 going up but good once downloaded 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:55.149
 the 258 save you the game we are going to give you 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.649
 the first right click extract here and 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.199
 is going to extract this from the folder of 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.600
 casting racing where will it contain 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.699
 in 4 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.409
 files the most important one is this 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.060
 casting racing point well that is the 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.909
 game 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.560
 the point that they do not eliminate him even though he does not 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.409
 they will use but not eliminate because 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.909
 it is part of the operation of the game 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.159
 they are afraid to leave two images that is like this 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.960
 You can eliminate it if you like 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.049
 we would have at least a demonstration of 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.939
 game and a cover that is from the region 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.280
 European why the Spanish management 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.590
 good game to play it we are going to 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.050
 require an emulator that you 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.330
 have 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.020
 we just open the point that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.870
 we started 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.280
 and we hope good 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.090
 and they have to press x when 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.090
 electric image 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.810
 and I just hope not that the game starts 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:59.369
 [Music] 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.930
 but 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.930
 [Music] 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.220
 in this part where they choose the language 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.740
 so that it is already in Spanish 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.349
 [Music] 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.790
 once I say 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.090
 keep in mind that we were fast and 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.540
 whole set 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.540
 yes 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.090
 [Music] 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.980
 and well that's all the game does not contain 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.050
 no error and good if you have any 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.890
 another game to say goodbye can not be in 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.660
 the street comment 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.620
 do not forget to like it and well that's 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.620
 all goodbye
