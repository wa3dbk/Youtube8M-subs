00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
general there are destructible rocks

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.890 
general there are destructible rocks
here<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.370> here<00:03:32.640> which<00:03:32.820> cut<00:03:33.150> down<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.510> walking

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
here and here which cut down the walking

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.960 
here and here which cut down the walking
distance<00:03:34.320> between<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.489> your<00:03:35.580> opponent's

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
distance between you and your opponent's

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.390 
distance between you and your opponent's
significantly<00:03:36.540> these<00:03:37.380> are<00:03:37.620> standard<00:03:38.100> rocks

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
significantly these are standard rocks

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.910 
significantly these are standard rocks
so<00:03:38.550> they<00:03:38.670> do<00:03:38.730> have<00:03:39.060> three<00:03:39.450> armored<00:03:39.870> each<00:03:40.080> serve

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
so they do have three armored each serve

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.410 
so they do have three armored each serve
leans<00:03:41.160> Marines<00:03:41.640> will<00:03:41.850> have<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.000> very<00:03:42.120> difficult

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
leans Marines will have a very difficult

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.940 
leans Marines will have a very difficult
time<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.930> even<00:03:43.050> zealots<00:03:43.650> will<00:03:43.800> have<00:03:43.920> a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
time and even zealots will have a

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.860 
time and even zealots will have a
difficult<00:03:44.220> time<00:03:44.489> trying<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.480> take<00:03:45.690> them<00:03:45.840> down

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
difficult time trying to take them down

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.400 
difficult time trying to take them down
and<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.880> be<00:03:48.030> careful<00:03:48.390> about<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:49.019> addition

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
and so be careful about that in addition

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.650 
and so be careful about that in addition
on<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.980> far<00:03:50.250> end<00:03:50.459> of<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.700> map<00:03:50.910> there<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.420> a

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
on the far end of the map there is a

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.199 
on the far end of the map there is a
sudden<00:03:52.320> three<00:03:52.590> sets<00:03:52.920> or<00:03:53.160> there<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:53.910> goal<00:03:54.180> set

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
sudden three sets or there is a goal set

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.570 
sudden three sets or there is a goal set
of<00:03:54.390> mineral<00:03:54.660> patches<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.200> over<00:03:56.160> here<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.430> you

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.100 
of mineral patches and over here is you
know<00:03:56.670> three<00:03:56.970> mineral<00:03:57.300> patches<00:03:57.630> on<00:03:57.750> each<00:03:57.900> side

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
know three mineral patches on each side

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.560 
know three mineral patches on each side
pretty<00:03:58.650> much<00:03:58.830> standard<00:03:59.340> play<00:03:59.670> your<00:04:00.300> third

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
pretty much standard play your third

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.729 
base is going to be this set of mineral
patches<00:04:02.910> here<00:04:02.940> which<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.720> right<00:04:03.959> outside<00:04:04.170> this

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
patches here which is right outside this

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.490

is ellen ogle Watchtower outside that
doll<00:04:07.680> naga<00:04:07.860> watchtower<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.060> very<00:04:09.510> very

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
doll naga watchtower so it is very very

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.330 
doll naga watchtower so it is very very
much<00:04:09.900> exposed<00:04:10.320> there<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:10.860> also<00:04:11.070> another

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
much exposed there is also another

much exposed there is also another
expansion<00:04:11.970> hidden<00:04:12.540> behind<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:13.110> set<00:04:13.320> of

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
expansion hidden behind a set of

expansion hidden behind a set of
destructible<00:04:14.010> debris<00:04:14.400> here<00:04:14.820> but<00:04:15.690> these

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
destructible debris here but these

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.590 
destructible debris here but these
mineral<00:04:16.380> patches<00:04:16.680> only<00:04:17.010> have<00:04:17.220> seven<00:04:17.730> or<00:04:17.910> is<00:04:18.510> it

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
mineral patches only have seven or is it

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.409 
mineral patches only have seven or is it
only<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:19.019> only<00:04:19.320> has<00:04:19.530> six<00:04:19.859> ok<00:04:20.640> so<00:04:21.030> there's<00:04:21.239> only

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
only it only has six ok so there's only

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.510 
only it only has six ok so there's only
actually<00:04:22.169> six<00:04:22.500> mineral<00:04:22.860> patches<00:04:23.190> here<00:04:23.220> so

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
actually six mineral patches here so

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.700 
actually six mineral patches here so
this<00:04:23.729> as<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.060> fourth<00:04:24.570> base<00:04:24.870> is

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
this as a fourth base is

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.040 
this as a fourth base is
to<00:04:25.800> be<00:04:25.919> a<00:04:25.949> very<00:04:26.280> very<00:04:26.639> slow<00:04:27.150> base<00:04:27.419> indeed<00:04:27.870> as

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
to be a very very slow base indeed as

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.990 
to be a very very slow base indeed as
it's<00:04:28.650> only<00:04:28.919> going<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.130> return<00:04:29.699> back

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
it's only going to return back

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.610 
it's only going to return back
seventy-five<00:04:30.690> percent<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.199> maximum

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
seventy-five percent of the maximum

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.189 
seventy-five percent of the maximum
