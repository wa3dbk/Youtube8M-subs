00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
this mop which is really hard to try to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.740 
this mop which is really hard to try to
myself<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.070> couple<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> times<00:00:53.640> only<00:00:54.329> worked<00:00:54.570> out

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
myself a couple of times only worked out
for<00:00:54.899> me<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.290> time<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.829> felt<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.700> four<00:00:57.059> times

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300

four times he was stronger than me so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.040 
four times he was stronger than me so
you<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.270> good<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.640 
hell but once you kill him he will drop
a<00:01:07.950> minecart<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.390> should<00:01:10.020> hopefully

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
a minecart and I should hopefully

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
a minecart and I should hopefully
already<00:01:11.190> know<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.880> whether<00:01:12.360> skeletons

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
already know is that whether skeletons

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.649 
already know is that whether skeletons
normally<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.920> drop<00:01:14.220> my<00:01:14.460> cards<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.450> with

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
normally don't drop my cards but with

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.430 
normally don't drop my cards but with
this<00:01:15.840> mod<00:01:16.229> made<00:01:16.650> by<00:01:16.890> oppressed<00:01:17.610> apiece<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
this mod made by oppressed apiece and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.830 
this mod made by oppressed apiece and
broadband<00:01:19.440> made<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.880> he<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.600> mean<00:01:21.630> he

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
broadband made it I think he I mean he

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.190 
broadband made it I think he I mean he
created<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.920> open<00:01:23.159> shop<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.640> morning<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
created it with open shop is morning to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.920 
created it with open shop is morning to
you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.640> get<00:01:26.640> constant<00:01:27.180> mob<00:01:27.360> drops<00:01:27.659> for

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you can get constant mob drops for

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.920 
you can get constant mob drops for
example<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:29.100> num<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.479> wither

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
example if you want num and wither

skeletal or a pic to drop like thousands
of<00:01:36.030> diamonds<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.350> so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of diamonds you can do that I think so

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
of diamonds you can do that I think so
I'm<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.670> too<00:01:38.790> sure<00:01:38.939> how<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.689> if

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
I'm not too sure how you do it but if

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.719 
I'm not too sure how you do it but if
you<00:01:40.560> want<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.830> know<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.640> have

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you want to know that I think you have

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.510 
you want to know that I think you have
to<00:01:41.790> ask<00:01:41.970> broadband<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.250> kill

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
to ask broadband but like when you kill

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
to ask broadband but like when you kill
this<00:01:44.790> more<00:01:45.210> people<00:01:45.600> drop<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.930> minecart<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.860> we

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
this more people drop a minecart so we

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.880 
this more people drop a minecart so we
will<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.310> getting<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.640> minecart<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.890> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
will be getting a minecart right now and
