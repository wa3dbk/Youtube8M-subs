00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
pointless because obviously it's going

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.339 
pointless because obviously it's going
to<00:02:17.670> take<00:02:17.879> me<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.209> maybe<00:02:18.360> five<00:02:18.720> minutes<00:02:18.959> maybe

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
to take me like maybe five minutes maybe

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.020 
to take me like maybe five minutes maybe
longer<00:02:19.650> because<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.340> how<00:02:20.459> about<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.760> servers

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
longer because of how about the servers

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.059 
longer because of how about the servers
are<00:02:21.120> as<00:02:21.269> well<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.560> will<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:22.769> take

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.289 
can see coming back pretty much every
single<00:02:31.200> place<00:02:31.349> old<00:02:31.680> my<00:02:32.099> salon<00:02:32.489> all<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:33.120> these
