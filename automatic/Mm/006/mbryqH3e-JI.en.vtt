00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:09.629 

I<00:03:06.810> then<00:03:07.810> used<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.349> same<00:03:08.620> concealer<00:03:09.129> to

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
I then used the same concealer to

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.879 
I then used the same concealer to
brighten<00:03:10.329> up<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.689> dark<00:03:10.930> circles<00:03:11.469> around<00:03:11.590> my

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
brighten up the dark circles around my

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.059 
brighten up the dark circles around my
eyes<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:13.510> just<00:03:13.750> use<00:03:13.959> my<00:03:14.170> fingers<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.620> apply

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
eyes and I just use my fingers to apply

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.979 
eyes and I just use my fingers to apply
them<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.549> should<00:03:15.819> probably<00:03:15.939> maybe<00:03:16.299> use<00:03:16.689> a

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
them I should probably maybe use a

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.509 
them I should probably maybe use a
concealer<00:03:17.920> brush<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:19.000> find<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.900> easier<00:03:20.349> to

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
concealer brush but I find it easier to

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:36.060 
concealer brush but I find it easier to
just<00:03:21.519> use<00:03:21.609> my<00:03:21.909> fingers

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.610 

and<00:03:37.070> now<00:03:37.700> I'm<00:03:37.880> just<00:03:38.060> doing<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.660> same<00:03:38.870> thing<00:03:39.230> to

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
and now I'm just doing the same thing to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.090 
and now I'm just doing the same thing to
the<00:03:40.100> dark<00:03:40.700> circle<00:03:41.120> around<00:03:41.300> my<00:03:41.510> mouth<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.100> this

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
the dark circle around my mouth and this

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.520 
the dark circle around my mouth and this
is<00:03:43.250> just<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.550> get<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.030> dark<00:03:44.600> circle<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.260> be<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
is just to get the dark circle to be the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.410 
is just to get the dark circle to be the
same<00:03:45.740> color<00:03:46.070> as<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.520> rest<00:03:46.820> of<00:03:47.000> my<00:03:47.210> face<00:03:49.390> so<00:03:50.390> I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
same color as the rest of my face so I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.510 
same color as the rest of my face so I
just<00:03:50.690> blend<00:03:50.960> it<00:03:51.110> in<00:03:51.260> using<00:03:51.830> my<00:03:51.860> finger<00:03:52.340> once

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
just blend it in using my finger once

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:05.950 
just blend it in using my finger once
again

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.650 

so<00:04:06.960> while<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.710> concealer<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.640> settling<00:04:09.090> in<00:04:09.300> I

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
so while the concealer is settling in I

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.790 
so while the concealer is settling in I
use<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.830> Rimmel<00:04:11.459> London<00:04:11.850> lip<00:04:12.420> liner<00:04:12.660> in<00:04:13.260> color

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
use the Rimmel London lip liner in color

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.030 
use the Rimmel London lip liner in color
cappuccino<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.730> just<00:04:14.910> line<00:04:15.120> my<00:04:15.300> lips<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:16.040> sort

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
cappuccino to just line my lips and sort

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.530
