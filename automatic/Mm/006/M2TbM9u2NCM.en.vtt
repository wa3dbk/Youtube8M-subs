00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
bit um in the beginning of the jittery
but<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.110> managed<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.410> get<00:01:37.590> our<00:01:37.680> composure

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
but we managed to get our composure

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.470 
but we managed to get our composure
slightly<00:01:38.630> as<00:01:39.630> well<00:01:39.870> it<00:01:39.930> wasn't<00:01:40.200> enough<00:01:41.480> and

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
slightly as well it wasn't enough and

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.670 
slightly as well it wasn't enough and
what<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.110> learned<00:01:43.380> from<00:01:43.440> this

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
what have you learned from this

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.870 
what have you learned from this
tournament<00:01:45.140> not<00:01:46.220> definitely<00:01:47.220> experience<00:01:47.730> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
tournament not definitely experience is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
tournament not definitely experience is
definitely<00:01:48.690> on<00:01:49.640> something<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.820> won't<00:01:51.720> come

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
definitely on something that won't come

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.930 
definitely on something that won't come
by<00:01:52.050> so<00:01:52.229> easy<00:01:52.440> and<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.369> playing<00:01:53.790> with

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
by so easy and I think playing with

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.540 
by so easy and I think playing with
Finland<00:01:54.690> Sweden<00:01:54.810> checks<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.400> honor

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
Finland Sweden checks it's just an honor

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.520 
Finland Sweden checks it's just an honor
to<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.910> up<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.330> play<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.780> my<00:01:58.290> team's
