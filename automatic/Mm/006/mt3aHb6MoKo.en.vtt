I'm going to show a couple of things one
I<00:00:06.690> have<00:00:06.960> some<00:00:07.170> production<00:00:07.830> jewelry<00:00:08.870> castings

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
I have some production jewelry castings

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.770 
I have some production jewelry castings
and<00:00:10.730> some<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.880> them<00:00:12.000> used<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> nice

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
and some of them used to have a nice

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.779 
and some of them used to have a nice
little<00:00:14.330> round<00:00:15.379> hollow<00:00:16.379> tube<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.580> looked

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
little round hollow tube in it it looked

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.970 
little round hollow tube in it it looked
very<00:00:18.000> very<00:00:18.270> similar<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.410> except<00:00:19.859> it

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
very very similar to this one except it

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
very very similar to this one except it
was<00:00:20.100> round<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.699> I've<00:00:20.820> run<00:00:21.060> out<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.240> them<00:00:21.570> so

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
was round and I've run out of them so

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.920 
was round and I've run out of them so
now<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.020> need<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.670> solder<00:00:23.670> some<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.390> these<00:00:24.630> new

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
now I need to solder some of these new

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.609 
now I need to solder some of these new
tubings<00:00:25.490> in<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.050> put<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> color<00:00:28.349> down

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
tubings in so I can put the color down

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.200 
tubings in so I can put the color down
in<00:00:28.890> want<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> show<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:29.760> bit<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
in want to show you a little bit how I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.260 
in want to show you a little bit how I
do<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:32.090> I'm<00:00:33.090> making<00:00:33.420> some<00:00:34.370> post<00:00:35.370> earrings<00:00:35.969> so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
do that I'm making some post earrings so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.819 
do that I'm making some post earrings so
I'm<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> actually<00:00:36.870> take<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.469> i<00:00:37.680> have

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
I'm going to actually take this i have

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.180 
I'm going to actually take this i have
them<00:00:37.950> cast<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> two<00:00:38.969> little<00:00:39.920> jump<00:00:40.920> rings

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
them cast with the two little jump rings

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.369 
them cast with the two little jump rings
on<00:00:41.460> them<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.910> easier<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> cut<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.079> jump

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
on them it's easier to cut the jump

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.040 
on them it's easier to cut the jump
rings<00:00:43.649> off<00:00:43.950> than<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.829> solder<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.219> each

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
rings off than it is to solder one each

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
rings off than it is to solder one each
individually<00:00:49.050> when<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.260> need<00:00:49.559> them<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.520> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
individually when I need them so in this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.700 
individually when I need them so in this
case<00:00:50.850> I've<00:00:51.090> actually<00:00:51.270> clipped<00:00:52.079> them<00:00:52.199> off<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
case I've actually clipped them off and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.819 
case I've actually clipped them off and
I<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.660> there<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:54.809> sitting<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
I have there now sitting like this and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.110 
I have there now sitting like this and
we're<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.100> take<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.640> bit<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
we're going to take a little bit of the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.020 
we're going to take a little bit of the
tubing<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.800> solder<00:00:58.800> them<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.520> let's<00:00:59.699> show

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
tubing and solder them up so let's show

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.880 
tubing and solder them up so let's show
you<00:01:00.059> will<00:01:00.390> show<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> how<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you will show you how we do this the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.100 
you will show you how we do this the
first<00:01:02.100> thing<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.370> want<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.600> put<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
first thing I want to do is to put a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.670 
first thing I want to do is to put a
coat<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.680> solder<00:01:05.119> down<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:09.680> puzzle

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
coat of solder down on to the puzzle

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.770 
coat of solder down on to the puzzle
coating<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> solder<00:01:11.460> down<00:01:11.700> inside<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> so

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
coating of solder down inside of it so

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.609 
coating of solder down inside of it so
the<00:01:12.900> tubing<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.500> adhere<00:01:13.770> very<00:01:14.310> easily<00:01:15.150> so

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
the tubing will adhere very easily so

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.980 
the tubing will adhere very easily so
let's<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.770> ahead<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> first<00:01:18.900> I'm

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
let's go ahead and do that so first I'm

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140 
let's go ahead and do that so first I'm
going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.409> take<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:19.740> flux<00:01:20.189> I'm<00:01:21.000> going

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
going to do is take some flux I'm going

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.820 
going to do is take some flux I'm going
to<00:01:21.210> flex<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.659> front<00:01:21.960> i'm<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> flex<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to flex the front i'm going to flex the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.160 
to flex the front i'm going to flex the
back<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.340> little<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> flux<00:01:24.450> down<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.990> there

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
back a little bit of flux down in there

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.370 
back a little bit of flux down in there
and<00:01:25.939> i'm<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> use<00:01:27.360> some<00:01:27.390> medium<00:01:28.049> solder

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and i'm going to use some medium solder

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.249 
and i'm going to use some medium solder
to<00:01:29.009> grab<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.610> tubing<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> use<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> easy

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
to grab the tubing and use the easy

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.990 
to grab the tubing and use the easy
solder<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:31.979> i<00:01:32.009> put<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.909> earring<00:01:33.420> backing

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
solder when i put on the earring backing

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.280 
solder when i put on the earring backing
so<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.240> first<00:01:36.420> thing<00:01:36.450> I'm<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so the first thing I'm going to do is to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.850 
so the first thing I'm going to do is to
heat<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.710> mine<00:01:38.040> get<00:01:38.369> my<00:01:38.520> torch<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.509> running

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
heat up mine get my torch up and running

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.480 
heat up mine get my torch up and running
and<00:01:40.860> now<00:01:41.490> I'm<00:01:41.729> starting<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.329> heat<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.490> little

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and now I'm starting to heat a little

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.149 
and now I'm starting to heat a little
bit<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.850> metal<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.740> flux

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
bit of that metal and see that flux

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.620 
bit of that metal and see that flux
starting<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.229> get<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.470> bubbly<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:51.450> then

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
starting to get a little bubbly and then

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.889 
starting to get a little bubbly and then
it's<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.049> go<00:01:52.170> nice<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.409> glassy<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.520> me

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
it's going to go nice and glassy for me

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.630 
it's going to go nice and glassy for me
and<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.020> soon<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> gets<00:01:55.649> nice<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:55.920> glassy

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and as soon as it gets nice and glassy

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
and as soon as it gets nice and glassy
it'll<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.719> hot<00:01:57.960> enough<00:01:58.140> i'm<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
it'll be hot enough i'm going to just

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.760 
it'll be hot enough i'm going to just
keep<00:01:58.860> touching<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.490> solder<00:01:59.880> until<00:02:00.770> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
keep touching this solder until it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.130 
keep touching this solder until it
actually<00:02:01.820> flows<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.210> there<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> goes<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.899> flows

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
actually flows so there it goes it flows

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.359 
actually flows so there it goes it flows
right<00:02:04.320> there<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:04.799> i<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.189> little

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
right there so now i have that little

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.219 
right there so now i have that little
bit<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.640> solder<00:02:06.030> which<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.509> sitting<00:02:06.810> right<00:02:06.840> at

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
bit of solder which is sitting right at

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.100 
bit of solder which is sitting right at
the<00:02:07.649> bottom<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.280> i<00:02:09.179> don't<00:02:09.390> even<00:02:09.450> really<00:02:09.810> need

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the bottom and i don't even really need

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.510 
the bottom and i don't even really need
to<00:02:11.480> pickle<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.599> i<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.200> directly<00:02:13.680> for<00:02:14.069> my

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
to pickle it i can go directly for my

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760 
to pickle it i can go directly for my
tubing<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.120> I'm<00:02:15.270> going<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.450> go<00:02:15.600> grab<00:02:15.810> my<00:02:16.140> tuning

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
tubing so I'm going to go grab my tuning

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.070 
tubing so I'm going to go grab my tuning
now<00:02:16.920> stick<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.640> straight<00:02:17.850> down<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.300> there<00:02:18.480> so

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
now stick it straight down in there so

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.480 
now stick it straight down in there so
here's<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.440> little<00:02:19.650> bit<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.920> tubing<00:02:20.340> I've

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
here's this a little bit of tubing I've

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.360 
here's this a little bit of tubing I've
cut<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.560> then<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.830> going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.100> grab<00:02:23.250> a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
cut up then I'm just going to grab a

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.070 
cut up then I'm just going to grab a
little<00:02:23.580> piece<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.120> tubing<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.870> I'm

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
little piece of this tubing and I'm

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530 
little piece of this tubing and I'm
going<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.320> stick<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.680> tubing<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.330> throw

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
going to stick this tubing kind of throw

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.090 
going to stick this tubing kind of throw
it<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.660> little<00:02:27.690> off-center<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.710> make<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> little

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
it a little off-center to make a little

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.500 
it a little off-center to make a little
bit<00:02:29.340> more<00:02:29.660> interest<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.310> final<00:02:32.310> piece<00:02:32.610> so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
bit more interest on the final piece so

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.570 
bit more interest on the final piece so
I'm<00:02:33.570> going<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.750> heat<00:02:33.990> up<00:02:34.020> my<00:02:35.840> torch<00:02:36.840> again<00:02:37.580> and

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
I'm going to heat up my torch again and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.900 
I'm going to heat up my torch again and
then<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.240> flow<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.140> solder

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
then I just have to flow that solder

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.460 
then I just have to flow that solder
again<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.240> grabs<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.750> little<00:02:42.990> piece<00:02:43.230> it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
again so it grabs that little piece it

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.380 
again so it grabs that little piece it
doesn't<00:02:43.770> matter<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.610> what<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.000> looks<00:02:45.210> like

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
doesn't matter really what it looks like

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.030 
doesn't matter really what it looks like
because<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:45.930> all<00:02:46.050> going<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.350> hidden<00:02:46.800> by

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
because it's all going to be hidden by

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.450 
because it's all going to be hidden by
the<00:02:47.100> resin<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.030> way<00:02:48.210> anyway<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.190> kind

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
the resin in way anyway so I just kind

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.670 
the resin in way anyway so I just kind
of<00:02:50.550> go<00:02:51.150> at<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.840> haven't<00:02:52.170> sought<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.590> I

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
of go at that and I haven't sought it I

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.860 
of go at that and I haven't sought it I
haven't<00:02:52.980> flux<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.460> little<00:02:53.790> tubing<00:02:54.240> not

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
haven't flux the little tubing not

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.810 
haven't flux the little tubing not
really<00:02:55.110> necessary<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.130> point<00:02:56.490> just

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
really necessary at this point just

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.390 
really necessary at this point just
really<00:02:57.210> trying<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.570> get<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.990> solder<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.160> grab

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
really trying to get the solder to grab

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.380 
really trying to get the solder to grab
onto<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.820> which<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.210> has<00:03:00.420> now<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:00.960> I'm<00:03:01.140> all<00:03:01.380> set

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
onto it which it has now so I'm all set

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.800 
onto it which it has now so I'm all set
so<00:03:03.390> now<00:03:03.480> i'm<00:03:03.570> going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.750> go<00:03:03.930> ahead<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:05.660> put<00:03:06.660> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
so now i'm going to go ahead and put the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.920 
so now i'm going to go ahead and put the
earring<00:03:07.260> backing<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.860> there<00:03:08.520> okay<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.690> i

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
earring backing on there okay and i

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.590 
earring backing on there okay and i
actually<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.560> enough<00:03:10.920> luck<00:03:11.280> still<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:12.480> that

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
actually have enough luck still on that

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.870 
actually have enough luck still on that
back<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.860> i'm<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.010> going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.280> roll<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.550> back

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
back so i'm just going to roll that back

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.360 
back so i'm just going to roll that back
it<00:03:15.390> made<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.660> little<00:03:16.050> tiny<00:03:16.410> hole<00:03:16.950> right<00:03:17.310> there

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
it made a little tiny hole right there

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.310 
it made a little tiny hole right there
and<00:03:17.850> that's<00:03:17.940> really<00:03:18.210> to<00:03:18.450> accept<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> tubing

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
and that's really to accept the tubing

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.930 
and that's really to accept the tubing
so<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.560> has<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.709> nice<00:03:19.950> little<00:03:20.160> place<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.700> come

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
so it has a nice little place to come

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.660 
so it has a nice little place to come
and<00:03:21.200> sit<00:03:22.200> down<00:03:22.260> right<00:03:22.770> down<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.160> there<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.370> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
and sit down right down in there and the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.949 
and sit down right down in there and the
whole<00:03:23.910> earring<00:03:24.690> back<00:03:24.870> stays<00:03:25.230> nice<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.620> flat

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
whole earring back stays nice and flat

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.240 
whole earring back stays nice and flat
here's<00:03:27.959> my<00:03:30.260> earring<00:03:31.260> backing<00:03:31.530> i'm<00:03:31.860> using<00:03:32.160> a

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
here's my earring backing i'm using a

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.790 
here's my earring backing i'm using a
little<00:03:32.490> tiny<00:03:32.760> post<00:03:33.300> right<00:03:33.870> here<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.440> i'm<00:03:34.680> just

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
little tiny post right here and i'm just

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.590 
little tiny post right here and i'm just
going<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.010> use<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.220> little<00:03:35.370> tiny<00:03:35.910> bit<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.300> chips

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
going to use a little tiny bit of chips

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.780 
going to use a little tiny bit of chips
solder<00:03:36.870> we're<00:03:37.680> going<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.860> go<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.010> easy<00:03:38.340> now<00:03:38.760> i

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
solder we're going to go to easy now i

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.120 
solder we're going to go to easy now i
use<00:03:39.060> one<00:03:39.570> loop<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.170> i<00:03:40.200> know<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.500> that's<00:03:40.920> my

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
use one loop so i know that that's my

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.220 
use one loop so i know that that's my
indicator<00:03:41.700> because<00:03:42.000> it's<00:03:42.209> really<00:03:42.480> easy<00:03:42.990> to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
indicator because it's really easy to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.370 
indicator because it's really easy to
turn<00:03:43.530> one<00:03:43.920> loop<00:03:44.190> solder<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.540> it's<00:03:45.720> hard<00:03:46.230> to

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
turn one loop solder but it's hard to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.310 
turn one loop solder but it's hard to
turn<00:03:46.650> three<00:03:47.100> loops<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:47.910> using<00:03:48.900> my<00:03:49.020> easy

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
turn three loops and so I using my easy

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.800 
turn three loops and so I using my easy
solder<00:03:49.709> it's<00:03:49.950> my<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.220> way<00:03:50.490> I<00:03:50.520> market<00:03:51.090> I'm

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
solder it's my the way I market I'm
