00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
I know this is a regular nuclear but

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.910 
I know this is a regular nuclear but

laying<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.439> game<00:00:25.650> play<00:00:25.859> go<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.160> waste

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
laying this game play go to waste

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.820 
laying this game play go to waste
but<00:00:27.570> yeah<00:00:27.720> I'm<00:00:27.960> running<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> school<00:00:28.560> streak

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
but yeah I'm running the school streak

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.700 
but yeah I'm running the school streak
set<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.640> Loadstar<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.660> veto<00:00:31.080> warship<00:00:31.529> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
set up the Loadstar the veto warship and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.280 
set up the Loadstar the veto warship and
the<00:00:32.189> k-9<00:00:32.550> unit<00:00:32.579> may<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.450> wondering<00:00:33.809> why<00:00:34.230> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the k-9 unit may be wondering why is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290 
the k-9 unit may be wondering why is
using<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> k-9<00:00:35.040> unit<00:00:35.070> over<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> swarm<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
using the k-9 unit over the swarm and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.110 
using the k-9 unit over the swarm and
that<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.140> because<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.829> believe<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.340> k9<00:00:38.820> unit

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that is because I believe this k9 unit

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.979 
that is because I believe this k9 unit
does<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.600> much<00:00:39.870> better<00:00:39.899> job<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.649> swarm

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
does a much better job in a swarm

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.819 
does a much better job in a swarm
particularly<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.170> nuketown<00:00:43.770> 2025<00:00:44.149> I<00:00:45.710> know<00:00:46.710> if

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
particularly on nuketown 2025 I know if

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.619 
particularly on nuketown 2025 I know if
that<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.640> an<00:00:47.760> enemy<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> spawn<00:00:48.450> of

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that if if an enemy get a spawn of

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.150 
that if if an enemy get a spawn of
straight<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.680> thing<00:00:49.860> I'll<00:00:49.980> do

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
straight the the thing I'll do

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.799 
straight the the thing I'll do
straightaway<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.879> run<00:00:51.149> into<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> building

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
straightaway is run into the building

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
straightaway is run into the building
and<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.039> patrol<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> until<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> swarm<00:00:53.820> goes

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
and just patrol it until the swarm goes

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.750 
and just patrol it until the swarm goes
away<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.039> easy<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.489> do

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
away and it's really really easy to do

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.220 
away and it's really really easy to do
the<00:00:56.910> swarm<00:00:57.210> doesn't<00:00:57.480> target<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.930> straight

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the swarm doesn't target you straight

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.229 
the swarm doesn't target you straight
away<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.280> plenty<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.730> time<00:00:59.940> to<00:00:59.969> run

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
away and you have plenty of time to run

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
away and you have plenty of time to run
straight<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> building<00:01:01.199> over<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.920> k-9

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
straight in the building over the k-9

straight in the building over the k-9
unit<00:01:03.199> they<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> pretty<00:01:04.559> good<00:01:04.650> job<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.159> taking

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
unit they do a pretty good job of taking

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.730 
unit they do a pretty good job of taking
them<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.510> while<00:01:07.229> they're<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> building

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
them out while they're in the building

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.649 
them out while they're in the building
it's<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.159> small<00:01:08.400> map<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.850> they<00:01:09.119> take<00:01:09.360> them<00:01:09.540> out

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's a small map so they take them out

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's a small map so they take them out
they'd<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> run<00:01:10.920> far<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> take<00:01:11.640> them<00:01:11.820> out

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
they'd have to run far to take them out

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
they'd have to run far to take them out
and<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> bonus<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.350> spawn<00:01:13.680> trap<00:01:13.979> which<00:01:14.130> is

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and as a bonus they spawn trap which is

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.660 
and as a bonus they spawn trap which is
really<00:01:14.490> cool<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.830> they<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.009> down<00:01:17.189> anyone

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
really cool and they take down anyone

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.280 
really cool and they take down anyone
that's<00:01:17.909> trying<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.180> destroy<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.840> aircraft

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that's trying to destroy your aircraft

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
really is nothing interesting but if

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.330 
really is nothing interesting but if
you're<00:03:42.630> watching<00:03:42.780> gun<00:03:43.079> gun<00:03:43.860> streaks<00:03:44.190> and

and start shot to kill me three times
which<00:04:55.780> was<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.960> such<00:04:56.320> a<00:04:56.350> piss-take<00:04:56.650> but<00:04:57.550> in<00:04:57.640> the

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
which was a such a piss-take but in the

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.400 
which was a such a piss-take but in the
end<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:58.000> did<00:04:58.240> get<00:04:58.390> my<00:04:58.540> revenge<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:59.140> got<00:04:59.380> a

end I did get my revenge and got a

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.060 
end I did get my revenge and got a
nucleon<00:04:59.740> name<00:04:59.980> and<00:05:00.820> I<00:05:00.880> think<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:02.740> only<00:05:02.890> bad

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
nucleon name and I think the only bad

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.670 
nucleon name and I think the only bad
thing<00:05:03.310> about<00:05:03.370> Treyarch<00:05:04.270> is<00:05:04.510> they<00:05:05.110> they

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
thing about Treyarch is they they

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.430 
thing about Treyarch is they they
they're<00:05:06.340> excluding<00:05:06.940> this<00:05:07.090> like<00:05:07.360> game<00:05:07.930> ending

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
they're excluding this like game ending

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.360 
they're excluding this like game ending

rep<00:05:41.080> now<00:05:41.700> nothing<00:05:42.700> important<00:05:43.210> one<00:05:43.690> died<00:05:43.930> I

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
rep now nothing important one died I

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.760 
rep now nothing important one died I
just<00:05:44.380> think<00:05:44.650> I<00:05:44.890> could<00:05:44.920> do<00:05:45.310> ghost<00:05:45.580> if<00:05:46.150> they

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
just think I could do ghost if they

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.190 
just think I could do ghost if they
decide<00:05:47.770> to<00:05:48.010> bring<00:05:48.190> it<00:05:48.340> back<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:48.940> make<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:49.780> a

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
decide to bring it back and make it a

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.470 
decide to bring it back and make it a
lot<00:05:50.590> more<00:05:50.710> skillful<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.370> get<00:05:51.580> make<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.210> a<00:05:52.270> lot

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
lot more skillful to get make it a lot

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.380 
lot more skillful to get make it a lot
harder<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:53.050> get<00:05:53.230> I<00:05:54.100> don't<00:05:54.940> know<00:05:55.000> if<00:05:55.090> I'm<00:05:55.210> being

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
harder to get I don't know if I'm being

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.750 
harder to get I don't know if I'm being
like<00:05:55.600> really<00:05:55.930> mean<00:05:56.140> or<00:05:56.440> anything<00:05:56.650> but<00:05:57.070> I<00:05:57.310> just

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
like really mean or anything but I just

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.090 
like really mean or anything but I just
think<00:05:58.180> like<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:59.320> hardest<00:05:59.560> cool<00:05:59.770> street<00:05:59.980> to

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
think like the hardest cool street to

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.680 
think like the hardest cool street to
get<00:06:00.220> should<00:06:00.520> be<00:06:00.670> really<00:06:01.120> really<00:06:01.150> hard<00:06:01.510> like

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
get should be really really hard like

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.500 
get should be really really hard like
Lulu's<00:06:02.430> if<00:06:03.430> they<00:06:03.640> were<00:06:03.700> actually<00:06:04.240> a<00:06:04.270> kill

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
Lulu's if they were actually a kill

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.920 
Lulu's if they were actually a kill
streak<00:06:04.630> a<00:06:05.110> 39<00:06:05.920> streak<00:06:06.280> then<00:06:06.640> I<00:06:06.940> would<00:06:07.660> be<00:06:07.750> happy

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
streak a 39 streak then I would be happy

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.360 
streak a 39 streak then I would be happy
with<00:06:08.020> it<00:06:08.140> because<00:06:08.260> they<00:06:08.440> are<00:06:08.560> so<00:06:08.830> hard<00:06:09.130> to<00:06:09.220> get

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
with it because they are so hard to get

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.580 
with it because they are so hard to get
the<00:06:09.520> only<00:06:09.700> thing<00:06:09.960> there's<00:06:10.960> so<00:06:11.050> much<00:06:11.170> bushings

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590
