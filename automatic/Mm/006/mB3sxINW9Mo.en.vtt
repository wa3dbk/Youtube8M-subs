00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
pretty cool because i think a pain in

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.080 
pretty cool because i think a pain in
the<00:00:49.440> ass<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.039> i<00:00:50.539> also<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.760> thing

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the ass to get on i also got this thing

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.520 
the ass to get on i also got this thing
the<00:00:54.510> fuel<00:00:55.050> filter<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.930> pretty<00:00:58.170> cool<00:00:58.469> i

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the fuel filter it it's pretty cool i

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
the fuel filter it it's pretty cool i
mean<00:00:58.680> i<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> name<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> crap

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
mean i like the name for it the crap

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.689 
mean i like the name for it the crap
trap<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.379> think<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.770> pretty<00:01:01.980> cool<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
trap so I think that's pretty cool and I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.670 
trap so I think that's pretty cool and I
guess<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.809> helps<00:01:04.170> keep<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.890> carb<00:01:05.369> clean<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
guess it helps keep your carb clean so I

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.990 
guess it helps keep your carb clean so I
don't<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.250> much<00:01:08.280> maintenance<00:01:08.670> on

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
don't have to do as much maintenance on

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.320 
don't have to do as much maintenance on
that<00:01:10.189> definitely<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.460> one<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> these<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.060> was
