00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.340
 to see if it 's people at all 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.420

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.850

 lars how do you like the laundry i was 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.920

 games computer plays and that is 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.490
 of course just the reason that i 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.760
 wake up every day because I think 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.160
 I really super cool the whole idea of the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.720
 certainly my smartphone is of course something 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.060
 where we like that very much for years 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.550
 engage in energy with 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.320
 America but also eavesdropping practices 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.260

 or shifting comedy in your language 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.130
 to be 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.970
 nice in the sun for the rest 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.479

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.530
 lars what father and mother often find one 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.850
 or from your youtube channel 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.440
 here in the cool only they have 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.940
 actually no idea where we are 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.500
 is all about 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.890
 they know that I often know people 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.480
 that the polar ice in the youtube community 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.890
 only further know and done i wanted 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.420
 it's all about them and totally 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.980
 have no understanding of games have none 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.790
 understanding computers have no substance 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.070
 and laptops 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.080
 So you know you love it or they just 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.510
 it goes a bit past you 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.880
 young people freeze who asks lars motion 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.770

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.420
 must choose between what shox what i am now on 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.670
 this moment of course very often to it 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.230
 am also a play often in games and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.090
 between minecraft from minecraft 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.280
 of course also just a game that whole 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.230
 leather fits very well in my street 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.330
 are nice to get things built 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.190
 i think i minecraft or what like one 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.660
 of those two google rozema that stays 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.210
 a little bit in high school 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.650
 and evil lars that I think level you up 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.110
 high school 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.000
 louis always go to havo from start to 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.060
 seated at the end and to the hail 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.010
 first my nature and health for or 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.330
 of course not just a two and then 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.920
 economy and society 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.110
 johan nieuwenhuize i had to go all the way 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.540
 back to the beginning of often games from 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.770
 that question is why did you start with 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.720
 youtube 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.380
 johan then i think i surrendered some 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.850
 a lot of youtubers will answer 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.430
 small symbols can be very beautiful around it 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.200
 I was really bored with that 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.840
 i just think i see a lot 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.860
 american gamers on youtube why so 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.780
 not just in Dutch too 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.670
 were not there at that time 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.050
 so many Dutch gamers always 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.690
 start now then I'm not just one 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.490
 from the first and I just think pure 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.590
 boredom that that is actually the motive 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.540
 has been to start with vague desires 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.810
 so you could ever start in many 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.250
 youtube channel and maybe lead case 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.260
 we only really want to know 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.610
 favorite tomb raider game is 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.100
 and fate then you actually bring me one 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.380
 protein in a problem because I'm sitting 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.820
 very much in doubt about the question I would 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.530
 of course can say when we two or 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.480
 three since that is the game that 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.220
 used to play very hard but I think 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.320
 be a 2013 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.570
 I also really like it so if I do that 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.450
 really have to choose is already have two to 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.130
 then i would go with um brad two 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.050
 just google that and how to step here 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.370
 me that is a game that used to be in it 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.690
 what have often played 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.730
 and yet a game that is very close 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.440

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.810

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.520
