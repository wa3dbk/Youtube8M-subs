those<00:00:27.230> when<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:27.530> travel<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:28.400> know<00:00:29.270> some<00:00:29.480> people

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
those when I travel I know some people

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.210 
those when I travel I know some people
don't<00:00:29.750> like<00:00:29.960> to<00:00:30.050> try<00:00:30.289> out<00:00:30.440> new<00:00:30.470> products<00:00:30.980> when

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
don't like to try out new products when

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.250 
don't like to try out new products when
they're<00:00:31.400> traveling<00:00:31.640> but<00:00:32.149> for<00:00:32.719> me<00:00:32.870> it's<00:00:33.020> easier

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
they're traveling but for me it's easier

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.560 
they're traveling but for me it's easier
because<00:00:33.710> they're<00:00:34.430> small<00:00:34.699> packages<00:00:35.150> anyway

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
because they're small packages anyway

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.100 
because they're small packages anyway
and<00:00:36.020> my<00:00:36.829> skins<00:00:37.190> not<00:00:37.340> super<00:00:37.400> sensitive<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:38.780> i

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
and my skins not super sensitive so i

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.860 
and my skins not super sensitive so i
usually<00:00:39.380> don't<00:00:39.860> break<00:00:40.670> out<00:00:40.910> terribly<00:00:41.510> from

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
usually don't break out terribly from

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.900 
usually don't break out terribly from

exfoliator and I liked it but I like the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.029 
exfoliator and I liked it but I like the
idea<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.360> being<00:01:56.569> able<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.899> use<00:01:57.229> an<00:01:57.440> exfoliator

it and the separate cleanser as well as
the<00:05:16.490> exfoliator<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:17.330> then<00:05:17.419> they<00:05:17.510> had<00:05:17.660> two

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
the exfoliator and then they had two

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.990 
the exfoliator and then they had two
small<00:05:18.229> bottles<00:05:18.500> which<00:05:19.460> i<00:05:19.580> think<00:05:19.639> is<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.970> eye

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
small bottles which i think is the eye

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.230 
small bottles which i think is the eye
cream<00:05:20.260> night<00:05:21.260> cream<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:21.919> then<00:05:22.039> they<00:05:22.160> had<00:05:23.770> the

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
cream night cream and then they had the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.930 
cream night cream and then they had the
daytime<00:05:26.240> moisturizer<00:05:26.479> i<00:05:26.930> believe<00:05:27.260> so<00:05:27.740> if<00:05:28.639> i

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
daytime moisturizer i believe so if i

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.140
