00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.810
 Mark 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.600
 first spread the shortcrust pastry in 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.600
 obtaining a thickness of 5 mm 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.890
 inserted there in your steel circle and

 cocoa on a plate with his circle 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.160
 steel now let's go to the 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.010
 realization of the cream in the 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.750
 container of your sun gear that you 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.240
 have a good fridge for me 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.110
 half an hour in advance to seized the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.200
 liquid cream 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.870
 vanilla sugar sugar stabilizes it 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.390
 in jelly in prod and mount it all at a 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.860
 average speed until you get a 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.860
 very compact cream 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.510
 then using a piping bag 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.800
 with a beak glide insert the cream to 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.800
 inside your circle 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.030
 then using a spatula to equalize the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.030
 all this way 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.790
 to mix the nutella and the oil of 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.850
 peanuts warm slightly to 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.260
 microwave or in a water bath so as to 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.930
 fluidify so compose it at this stage 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.360
 pour the nutella on the cake in 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.980
 tilting the circle like this for 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.990
 equalize the time avoid too much 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.330
 warm the nutella 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.280
 because when you go to insert it on the 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.280
 cake the cream ondra 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.549
 once the cake has rested 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.610
 for half an hour in the fridge 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.549
 drop them on a circular container 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:31.470
 with a diameter smaller than that of 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:34.980
 cake made go down the circle of this 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.230
 way then take the cake with your 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.319

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.840
 not to pretend the biscuit base and 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.640
 sticks the hazelnuts street and on 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.640
 the sides of the cake this way 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.150
 put the cake on the dish addressed 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.150
