00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.219
 Hi there, this is a review on x rebirth 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.170
 new part this restart attempt 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.590
 series so to say rebirth 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.440
 turned liana 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.820
 rebirth let's see 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.200
 Let's start with the shell graphics and sound 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.410
 graphics engine games can issue 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.150
 stunning landscapes filled with life 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.730
 dark depths of space are combined here 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.880
 with bright neon signs of stores and 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.880
 bars 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.480
 everything related to space does not cause 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.160
 no complaints 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.850
 ship and station models as usual 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 done 5 but the interior 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.900
 a little disappoint you are waiting for boring 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.170
 running around the monotonous station and now 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.880
 you have to talk a lot with npc 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.190
 and judging by the number of polygons and 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.190
 animation they live here for several 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.020
 years worth mentioning the voice acting as well 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.630
 as in all previous episodes of this 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.960
 the game is terrible and gas supports 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:19.800
 your brand than her skills place your finger 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.280
 edges and all previous parts of the game were 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.020
 real hardcore space mom with 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.740
 battles of giant space fleets 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.330
 nimble duayt on fighters and 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.180
 magnificent economy all this 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.450
 like a rather narrow circle of people 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.810
 Now 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.860
 egosoft decided to expand its audience 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.860
 a little casual game 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.150
 what new they brought into the series 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.740
 Perhaps we will begin with walks on stations 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.260
 now you have to go out of your 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.900
 ship just have to because it is 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.790
 not voluntarily 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.890
 for example to hire a crew or buy 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.290
 any product you have to crawl out 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.780
 your cozy ship and run looking 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.460
 the right person and even though 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.920
 that all enpis at all stations 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.959
 is in the same places this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.209
 waste of time compared to previous 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.050
 parts where it was enough a couple of clicks 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.330
 menu + you like the last bum to search 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.360
 and all the boxes in the neighborhood and take everything 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.320
 things that are not nailed occupation 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.709
 worthy of a captain in my opinion is 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.280
 useless eartip 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.560
 now a little about the dialogue system sometimes 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.840
 walking past the enpis you can hear that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.720
 he is talking about some interesting 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.569
 his topic if you start a dialogue will 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.620
 several options for the development of the conversation you 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.510
 choose option 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.670
 and there is a mini game where you must 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.299
 have time to press her talk button in 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.549
 the right moment is regret to immediately say 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.480
 How enpis will respond to your options 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.910
 no answer 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.650
 and instead of getting a discount on 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.560
 the goods they offer you can 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:09.290
 get a minus to the reputation as a result 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:13.940
 conversations you learn at the very end so 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.940
 holiday makes and station ocean highway 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.610
 back to space because we will be there 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.280
 spend most of your time and 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.280
 oddly removed one thing which 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.000
 would help you save this time from 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.750
 games removed autopilot for traveling 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.730
 highways appeared between zones and sectors 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.640
 almost as in futurame you jump into the pipe 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.140
 and she carries you to the right place here 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.570
 another mini-game appeared 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.940
 if you stick to the passing ships 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.940
 you can fly much faster 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.750
 you see the space around the highway and if 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.819
 something interesting attracted your 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.240
 attention you can jump out health in 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.240
 any moment 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:12.120
 oh to travel outside the highways 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.690
 faster turbo ship appeared 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.690
 acceleration 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.169
 but to move between clusters 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.479
 there is a super highway 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.759
 everything is the same as in the ordinary highway 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.330
 only speed and number of lanes 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.330
 increased 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.700
 one more innovation we will be the whole game 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.530
 fly in the same ship 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.280
 how to developers such a hand to come in 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.650
 head is not clear there is no possibility of having 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.240
 own fleet has not been canceled and 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.600
 ship and will manage enpis 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.490
 captains on this one you to the station on 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.860
 ship and you can hire a few 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.270
 a person with different professions for example 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.950
 defense officer pilot engineer your 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.360
 big transport workers are no longer 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.690
 dock with stations 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.820
 they park not far from the station 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.750
 ship as ants begin to run 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.210
 small loaders in the game appeared 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.840
 concept up and down your ship will be 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.650
 automatically find the desired horizon and 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.730
 There are a lot of such things 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.180
 game performance is not at the highest 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:29.750
 level in the review you could see it 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:31.610
 + the game flew a couple of times unfortunately about 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.880
 modern games can not be judged by 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.840
 trailers and screenshots is like a movie 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.820
 the trailer may be much 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.680
 more interesting to the movie itself 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.160
 to understand such a big game as x 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.700
 rebirth 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.030
 8 9 hours is not enough but also to spend in 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.030
 I don't want to buy it for 50 hours 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.580
 x series games immediately after release is like 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.990
 buy a new console 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.090
 work but until the final product and 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.370
 very far 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.790
 show treats all the bugs come out more games 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:08.080
 everyone who knows egosoft also knows that 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:11.390
 the output of the game will be crooked but the same people 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.000
 real fans know this company 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.900
 bring the case to the end there will be a patch 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.910
 support will be egosoft mods one of 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.100
 few modern companies that 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.470
 support the creativity of their fans and 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.160
 Apparently we will have to postpone this game to 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:31.160
 the regiment is at least six months my total 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.880
 A score of 5 out of 10 is clearly raw. 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.190
 product 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.220
 but in the future and water saws so 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.090
 happened every game of the series what are we waiting for 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.090
 star citizen
