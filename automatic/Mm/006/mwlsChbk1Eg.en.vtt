00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.340

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.000
 an egoist like you taught me 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.239

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.309
 proof that not whole have come bad 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.510
 brutal but I had to let myself die in 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.070
 that jungle for this I would now have 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.930
 solved all my problems because 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.270
 besides being fat, he is also stupid 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.270
 as in fact under the ladies first 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.320

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.980

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.700
 push yourself against my back and look 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:58.479
 to walk along the bio-tense wall 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.500
 news you did it on purpose is not true 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.090
 if we want to save ourselves we must 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.860
 collaborate then follow mine 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.990

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.310

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.440
 he pushes me with his head I can catch 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.030
 the chapter rope and who tells me that one 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.220

 big and big beast if it wouldn't be 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.689

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.780
 I say is seen I am afraid I have caught you 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.299
 on the fly while going down like a sack 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.010
 of potatoes is the wall of a canyon 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:58.549
