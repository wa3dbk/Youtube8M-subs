00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
egg carton for one Apple you will need

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.250 
egg carton for one Apple you will need
to<00:00:24.720> cut<00:00:24.960> two<00:00:25.260> cells<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:26.010> egg<00:00:26.160> carton<00:00:26.400> I

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
to cut two cells of an egg carton I

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.990 
to cut two cells of an egg carton I
always<00:00:28.260> begin<00:00:28.500> by<00:00:28.680> separating<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.789> cells

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
always begin by separating the cells

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.930 
always begin by separating the cells
with<00:00:30.420> large<00:00:30.449> scissors<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.340> trim<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
with large scissors and then I trim the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.930 
with large scissors and then I trim the
edges<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.570> small<00:00:33.899> scissors<00:00:34.610> to<00:00:35.610> create<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
edges with small scissors to create a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.360 
edges with small scissors to create a
little<00:00:36.210> Apple<00:00:36.750> put<00:00:37.200> white<00:00:37.500> glue<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> edge

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
little Apple put white glue on the edge

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.639 
little Apple put white glue on the edge
of<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.760> cell<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:39.660> glue<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.110> two<00:00:40.350> cells

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
of a cell and then glue the two cells

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.220 
of a cell and then glue the two cells
together<00:00:40.920> by<00:00:41.670> matching<00:00:41.910> them<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.510> closely<00:00:42.899> as

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
together by matching them as closely as

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.150 
together by matching them as closely as
possible<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.100> let<00:00:44.489> dry<00:00:45.620> then<00:00:46.620> paint<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
make a red apple I suggest you first

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
make a red apple I suggest you first
paint<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> Apple<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.379> white<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.430> red<00:00:56.640> paint

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
paint the Apple in white the red paint

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.360 
paint the Apple in white the red paint
is<00:00:57.270> partially<00:00:57.899> transparent<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.160> gray<00:00:59.340> of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
is partially transparent and the gray of

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
is partially transparent and the gray of
the<00:00:59.489> egg<00:00:59.609> carton<00:00:59.910> comes<00:01:00.390> through<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> red

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the egg carton comes through the red

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.650 
the egg carton comes through the red
paint<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.739> apply<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.609> same<00:01:02.969> logic<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.480> other

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
paint I apply the same logic with other

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.649 
paint I apply the same logic with other
colors<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.580> generally<00:01:05.580> find<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.180> gives<00:01:06.479> better

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
colors I generally find it gives better

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.609 
colors I generally find it gives better
results<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> start<00:01:09.540> by<00:01:09.689> applying<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.350> coat<00:01:10.590> of

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
results so start by applying a coat of

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
results so start by applying a coat of
white<00:01:10.950> paint<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.549> when<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> paint<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.930> dry

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
white paint and when the paint is dry

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.420 
white paint and when the paint is dry
apply<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> coat<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> red<00:01:14.580> paint<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.090> let<00:01:15.570> dry

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
apply a coat of red paint and let dry

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.030 
apply a coat of red paint and let dry
then<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> pin<00:01:18.270> or<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> thick<00:01:19.020> needle<00:01:19.229> make<00:01:20.009> a
