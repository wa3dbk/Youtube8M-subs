00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
you cannot talk big three without

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.099 
you cannot talk big three without
talking<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:01.529> to<00:02:02.159> me<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.059> best<00:02:03.359> big<00:02:03.719> three

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
talking about to me the best big three

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.260 
talking about to me the best big three
of<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:04.439> big<00:02:04.619> three<00:02:04.889> ERA<00:02:04.919> and<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.849> the<00:02:05.969> San

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
of the big three ERA and that is the San

Antonio<00:02:06.509> Spurs<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:08.159> reason<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.579> say<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.819> is

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
Antonio Spurs the reason I say this is

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.699 
Antonio Spurs the reason I say this is
because<00:02:09.420> these<00:02:09.539> guys<00:02:09.750> were<00:02:09.929> not<00:02:10.079> traded<00:02:10.500> for

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
because these guys were not traded for

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.949 
because these guys were not traded for
these<00:02:11.519> guys<00:02:11.790> were<00:02:12.060> players<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.840> were

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
these guys were players that were

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.559 
these guys were players that were
coached

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
coached

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.479 
coached
together<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.170> mended<00:02:14.799> together<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.400> just

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
together and mended together and just

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.030 
together and mended together and just
meant<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:16.030> play<00:02:16.269> together<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.590> we<00:02:17.709> all<00:02:17.859> know

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
meant to play together and we all know

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.179 
meant to play together and we all know
that<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.430> Tony<00:02:18.999> Parker<00:02:19.510> Manu<00:02:19.810> Ginobli<00:02:20.379> and<00:02:20.650> of

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
that is Tony Parker Manu Ginobli and of

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.989 
that is Tony Parker Manu Ginobli and of
course<00:02:21.219> the<00:02:22.209> fundamental<00:02:22.870> Tim<00:02:23.799> Duncan<00:02:24.280> so

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:24.999 
course the fundamental Tim Duncan so

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.720 
course the fundamental Tim Duncan so
basically<00:02:25.359> the<00:02:25.599> question<00:02:26.049> is<00:02:26.400> does<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.519> new

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
basically the question is does this new

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.220 
basically the question is does this new
big<00:02:27.969> three<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.420> do<00:02:28.629> you<00:02:28.689> think<00:02:28.930> they<00:02:29.049> have

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
big three of you do you think they have

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.199 
big three of you do you think they have
the<00:02:29.260> right<00:02:29.439> to<00:02:29.980> be<00:02:30.189> put<00:02:30.609> on<00:02:30.700> top<00:02:30.909> of<00:02:31.120> that

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
the right to be put on top of that

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.300 
the right to be put on top of that
throne<00:02:31.689> and<00:02:32.109> say<00:02:32.620> they're<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:32.829> best<00:02:32.950> big

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
throne and say they're the best big

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.379 
throne and say they're the best big
through<00:02:33.519> without<00:02:33.700> even<00:02:33.939> playing<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.209> game

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
through without even playing a game

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.629 
through without even playing a game
together<00:02:34.540> well<00:02:35.379> like<00:02:35.500> i<00:02:35.620> said<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:36.159> potential

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
together well like i said the potential

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.729 
together well like i said the potential
is<00:02:36.760> definitely<00:02:37.269> there<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:38.379> i<00:02:38.439> just<00:02:38.650> think

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
is definitely there but i just think

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.319 
is definitely there but i just think
there's<00:02:38.920> been<00:02:39.099> proven<00:02:39.489> teams<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.909> kobe

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
there's been proven teams like kobe

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.720 
there's been proven teams like kobe
bryant<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.870> pau<00:02:40.900> gasol<00:02:41.469> you<00:02:42.250> know<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.609> then

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
bryant and pau gasol you know and then

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.819 
bryant and pau gasol you know and then
Tony<00:02:43.060> Parker<00:02:43.569> Tim<00:02:43.930> Duncan<00:02:44.319> mileage<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.709> I'll

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
Tony Parker Tim Duncan mileage and I'll

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.110 
Tony Parker Tim Duncan mileage and I'll
be<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.069> those<00:02:45.189> teams<00:02:45.489> are<00:02:45.639> just<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:45.939> just

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
be like those teams are just have just

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.849 
be like those teams are just have just
been<00:02:46.269> great<00:02:46.389> for<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.780> past<00:02:46.989> ten<00:02:47.230> years<00:02:47.260> it

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
been great for the past ten years it

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.709 
been great for the past ten years it
just<00:02:48.340> doesn't<00:02:48.519> feel<00:02:48.730> right<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.480> say<00:02:49.689> that

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:49.719 
just doesn't feel right to say that

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.390 
just doesn't feel right to say that
they're<00:02:50.109> worse<00:02:50.379> than<00:02:50.409> a<00:02:50.739> team<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.189> hasn't

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
they're worse than a team that hasn't

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.789 
they're worse than a team that hasn't
played<00:02:51.730> together<00:02:51.909> yet<00:02:52.329> so<00:02:53.290> let<00:02:53.439> me<00:02:53.560> know<00:02:53.680> in
