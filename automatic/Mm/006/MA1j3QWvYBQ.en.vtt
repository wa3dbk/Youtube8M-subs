00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
but I wouldn't accept that the sake of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.460 
but I wouldn't accept that the sake of
your<00:01:28.259> overall<00:01:28.530> effect<00:01:31.159> move<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> green

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
don't worry about the color balance

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.560 
don't worry about the color balance
we'll<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.119> next<00:01:36.979> same<00:01:37.979> thing<00:01:38.189> again<00:01:38.570> hold

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
we'll do that next same thing again hold

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.120 
we'll do that next same thing again hold
the<00:01:39.750> Alt<00:01:39.869> key<00:01:39.960> down<00:01:40.140> understand<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> picture

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the Alt key down understand the picture

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.410 
the Alt key down understand the picture
turns<00:01:41.340> green<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.210> black

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
turns green but we get the black

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.870 
turns green but we get the black
speckles<00:01:42.930> again<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:44.070> then<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.670> see

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
speckles again and then we can just see

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.139 
speckles again and then we can just see
the<00:01:45.060> eye<00:01:45.090> starting<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> appear<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:47.149> again

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the eye starting to appear there again

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.819 
the eye starting to appear there again
we<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> white<00:01:48.840> slider<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:52.259> then<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.649> move

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
we do the white slider and then we move

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.490 
we do the white slider and then we move
on<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> blue<00:01:54.119> channel<00:01:55.939> this<00:01:56.939> time<00:01:57.500> it's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
on to the blue channel this time it's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.410 
on to the blue channel this time it's
the<00:01:58.619> thin<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.130> starts<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.700> block<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.119> first

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the thin that starts to block out first

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.770 
the thin that starts to block out first
so<00:02:00.630> I'm<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.170> leave<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.320> there

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.990 

I'll<00:02:06.780> pee<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.940> adjust

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
I'll pee with that so now we can adjust

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.910 
I'll pee with that so now we can adjust
the<00:02:09.269> color<00:02:09.509> balance<00:02:09.569> where<00:02:10.530> I'm<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.649> blue

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the color balance where I'm the blue

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.699 
the color balance where I'm the blue
channel<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.519> if<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.700> drag<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.480> right<00:02:12.750> course

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
channel so if I drag it the right course

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.089 
channel so if I drag it the right course
yellow<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.519> drag<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:14.970> left<00:02:15.150> pause<00:02:15.540> blue

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
yellow to drag it to the left pause blue
