00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
was essentially put together and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.189 
was essentially put together and
recorded<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.500> ran<00:00:29.039> into<00:00:29.070> some<00:00:30.199> problems

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
recorded but we ran into some problems

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
once we hit um the exporting step um we

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.639 
once we hit um the exporting step um we
encountered<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> lot<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> issues<00:00:37.920> with

it's going to look basically the same as
how<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:49.890> shot<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:52.640> how<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.789> was<00:00:54.000> initially

codecs<00:01:04.320> good<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.369> look

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
codecs good as it can look

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.370 
codecs good as it can look
there<00:01:06.330> still<00:01:06.689> were<00:01:06.840> imperfections<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.979> flaws

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380

there still were imperfections and flaws
in<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> file<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.610> wasn't<00:01:11.850> quite<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
in the file and it wasn't quite up to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
in the file and it wasn't quite up to
the<00:01:12.750> standard<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> original<00:01:14.040> court

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310

the standard that the original court
recording<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.810> um<00:01:16.140> we're<00:01:16.890> double

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
recording was that so um we're double

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.240 
recording was that so um we're double

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
get a PCM audio level or layer I should

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.740 
get a PCM audio level or layer I should
say<00:01:23.729> um<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.930> PCM<00:01:25.740> audio<00:01:25.950> layer<00:01:26.340> um<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.450> video

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
say um a PCM audio layer um on the video

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.080 
say um a PCM audio layer um on the video
and<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.500> try<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> attach<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.820> through

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and and try to attach that through

through YouTube's interface it won't be
it'll<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:08.940> two<00:02:09.179> separate<00:02:09.509> files<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.080> we're

it'll be two separate files but we're

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.260 
it'll be two separate files but we're
going<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.440> use<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.739> YouTube<00:02:11.039> interface<00:02:11.310> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
going to use the YouTube interface to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.430 
going to use the YouTube interface to
attach<00:02:12.599> those

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
attach those

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.560 
attach those
um<00:02:15.350> what<00:02:16.350> we<00:02:16.560> tried<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.850> process<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.450> we

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
um what we tried it's a process that we

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.150 
um what we tried it's a process that we
tried<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.320> first<00:02:19.590> place

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
tried in the first place

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.910 
tried in the first place
arm<00:02:20.750> again<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.780> think<00:02:22.050> we<00:02:22.110> use<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.440> Sena<00:02:22.680> form

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
arm again I think we use the Sena form

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.240 
arm again I think we use the Sena form
4k<00:02:23.370> codec<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.360> when<00:02:24.630> we<00:02:24.780> insert<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.740> into<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
4k codec and when we insert it into the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.900 
4k codec and when we insert it into the
website<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.880> ran<00:02:27.090> into<00:02:27.270> some<00:02:27.570> issues<00:02:27.990> with

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
website we ran into some issues with

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.700 
website we ran into some issues with
YouTube<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.510> recently<00:02:30.930> switched<00:02:31.350> their

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
YouTube just recently switched their

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.850 
YouTube just recently switched their
video<00:02:32.190> encoding<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.360> over<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.900> from<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.650> was

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
video encoding to over to from it was

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.960 
video encoding to over to from it was
initially<00:02:35.220> flash<00:02:35.520> they<00:02:36.240> moved<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.750> over<00:02:36.870> to

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
initially flash they moved it over to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.350 
initially flash they moved it over to
html5<00:02:39.440> structure<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.880> do<00:02:42.060> there<00:02:42.330> are

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
html5 structure and you do there are

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.180 
html5 structure and you do there are
differences<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.590> way<00:02:44.930> flash<00:02:45.930> would<00:02:46.920> take

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
differences in the way flash would take

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.250 
differences in the way flash would take
those<00:02:47.400> files<00:02:47.700> versus<00:02:48.210> html5<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
those files versus html5 it's a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.860 
those files versus html5 it's a
completely<00:02:49.620> different<00:02:49.770> way<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.220> encoding<00:02:50.490> and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
completely different way of encoding and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.410 
completely different way of encoding and
so<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:52.590> found<00:02:52.890> really<00:02:53.400> um<00:02:54.110> again<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.470> uneven

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
so we found really um again just uneven

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.150 
so we found really um again just uneven
levels<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.690> all<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.080> scenes<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.770> ran<00:02:59.010> it

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
levels in all the scenes we ran it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.940 
levels in all the scenes we ran it
through<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.720> couple<00:03:00.720> D<00:03:00.990> compressors<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.770> kind

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
through a couple D compressors and kind

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.040 
through a couple D compressors and kind
of<00:03:02.010> see<00:03:02.190> what<00:03:02.400> data<00:03:02.640> was<00:03:02.820> still<00:03:03.090> there<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.540> it

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
of see what data was still there and it

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.810 
of see what data was still there and it
didn't<00:03:04.320> really<00:03:04.500> add<00:03:04.680> up<00:03:04.740> when<00:03:05.340> we<00:03:05.460> were<00:03:05.610> done

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
didn't really add up when we were done

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.540 
didn't really add up when we were done
so<00:03:06.180> what<00:03:06.930> we're<00:03:07.110> trying<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.340> go

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
so what we're trying to do now is to go

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.140 
so what we're trying to do now is to go
back<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.940> original<00:03:09.030> source<00:03:09.630> files<00:03:09.960> um<00:03:11.150> go

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
back to the original source files um go

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.520 
back to the original source files um go
to<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.510> pre<00:03:12.870> export<00:03:13.440> um<00:03:14.660> review<00:03:15.660> every<00:03:15.900> clip<00:03:16.230> and

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
to a pre export um review every clip and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.640 
to a pre export um review every clip and
make<00:03:16.800> sure<00:03:17.070> um<00:03:17.459> it's<00:03:17.970> all<00:03:18.150> there<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.380> and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
make sure um it's all there and and and

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.680 
make sure um it's all there and and and
the<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.489> footage<00:03:20.820> looks<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.540> way<00:03:21.660> that

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
the and the footage looks the way that

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.900 
the and the footage looks the way that
it<00:03:21.930> should<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.470> every<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.430> know<00:03:23.550> we're<00:03:23.760> going

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
it should and every you know we're going

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.130 
it should and every you know we're going
through<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.270> color<00:03:24.540> correction<00:03:24.959> process

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
through a color correction process

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.760 
through a color correction process
colored<00:03:26.040> spotting<00:03:26.550> where<00:03:27.260> we're<00:03:28.260> taking<00:03:28.620> each

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
colored spotting where we're taking each

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.770 
colored spotting where we're taking each
part<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.459> just<00:03:29.700> making<00:03:30.090> sure<00:03:30.360> it's<00:03:30.600> the

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
part of it and just making sure it's the

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.650 
part of it and just making sure it's the
same<00:03:30.810> color<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.680> was<00:03:31.860> on<00:03:32.160> set<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.880> that

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
same color that it was on set and that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.070 
same color that it was on set and that
it<00:03:33.780> was<00:03:33.989> um<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:35.760> know<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.060> right<00:03:36.420> tone<00:03:36.780> and

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
it was um you know the right tone and

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.330 
it was um you know the right tone and
temperature<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.709> lighting<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.130> was

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
temperature of the lighting that was

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.550 
temperature of the lighting that was
there<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.540> anyway<00:03:39.930> we<00:03:40.050> have<00:03:40.080> our<00:03:40.260> work<00:03:40.380> cut

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
there and so anyway we have our work cut

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.050 
there and so anyway we have our work cut
out<00:03:40.590> for<00:03:40.950> us<00:03:40.980> but<00:03:41.340> we're<00:03:41.520> going<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.700> get<00:03:41.820> that

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
out for us but we're going to get that

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.729 
out for us but we're going to get that
the<00:03:42.900> way<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:44.989> original<00:03:45.989> footage<00:03:46.410> in

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
the way that it is a original footage in

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.449 
the way that it is a original footage in
timeline<00:03:47.310> go<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.269> color<00:03:48.570> correction<00:03:49.459> color

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
timeline go to color correction color

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.690 
timeline go to color correction color
time<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.239> grade<00:03:51.540> every<00:03:51.989> scene<00:03:52.310> correct<00:03:53.310> what

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
time and grade every scene correct what

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.150

any<00:03:54.360> highlights<00:03:54.870> or<00:03:55.170> anything<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.769> just

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
any highlights or anything that is just

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.000

going<00:03:56.340> too<00:03:56.580> far<00:03:56.790> out<00:03:57.230> compress<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.500> into<00:03:58.980> a

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
going too far out compress that into a

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.479 
going too far out compress that into a
