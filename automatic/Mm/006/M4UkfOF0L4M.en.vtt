so<00:02:22.240> you<00:02:22.810> know<00:02:23.010> when<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.070> was<00:02:24.190> younger<00:02:24.490> Buddy

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
so you know when I was younger Buddy

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.360 
so you know when I was younger Buddy
Rich<00:02:25.150> was<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.420> big<00:02:25.690> influence<00:02:25.870> on<00:02:26.320> me<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:27.130> when

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
Rich was a big influence on me and when

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:36.490 
Rich was a big influence on me and when
I<00:02:27.400> would<00:02:27.580> see<00:02:27.760> him<00:02:27.910> doing<00:02:28.090> all<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.450> stuff

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.890 

so<00:02:37.500> later<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.220> figured<00:02:38.610> out<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.510> know<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.780> was

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
so later I figured out you know it was

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.809 
so later I figured out you know it was
just<00:02:40.020> double<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.620> single<00:02:40.770> drag<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.430> lot<00:02:41.640> of

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
just double and single drag a lot of

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.130 
just double and single drag a lot of
triplets<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.750> sounded<00:02:43.080> like

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
triplets you know it sounded like

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.960 
triplets you know it sounded like
singles<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.830> mean<00:02:43.980> he<00:02:44.069> did<00:02:44.340> play<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.580> lot<00:02:44.850> of

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
singles I mean he did play a lot of

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.210 
singles I mean he did play a lot of
singles<00:02:45.330> too<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:46.260> he<00:02:46.470> also<00:02:46.620> used<00:02:46.980> those

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
singles too but he also used those

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.309

double<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.700> single<00:02:47.850> drag<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:48.690> that's<00:02:49.020> what<00:02:49.170> we

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
double and single drag so that's what we

00:02:49.319 --> 00:06:52.790 
double and single drag so that's what we
call

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.260
