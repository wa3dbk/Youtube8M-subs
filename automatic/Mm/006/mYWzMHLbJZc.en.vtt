00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
original portal in chapter 2 it

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.850 
original portal in chapter 2 it
basically<00:00:51.270> comes<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> life<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.230> you're

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
these different type of challenges so

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.860 
these different type of challenges so
the<00:00:56.370> idea<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.059> portal<00:00:57.390> gun<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the idea is you have this portal gun you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.689 
the idea is you have this portal gun you
shoot<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.140> portal<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.160> jump<00:00:59.399> through

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
shoot a portal and you can jump through

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.420 
shoot a portal and you can jump through
it<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.329> either<00:01:00.899> set<00:01:01.230> portal<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.309> do

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it to a either set portal or you can do

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
it to a either set portal or you can do
the<00:01:02.550> secondary<00:01:03.030> portal<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:04.080> how<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the secondary portal and that's how you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.690 
the secondary portal and that's how you
work<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.500> way<00:01:04.799> through<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
work your way through so if you have to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.330 
work your way through so if you have to
you<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.150> from<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.260> know<00:01:07.409> platform

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you know get from one you know platform

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.740 
you know get from one you know platform
to<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> next<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> could<00:01:09.210> use<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> portal<00:01:09.720> gun

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to the next you could use the portal gun

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.390 
to the next you could use the portal gun
to<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.380> might<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> also<00:01:11.250> move

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to get there might have to also move

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
to get there might have to also move
some<00:01:11.610> objects<00:01:12.060> around<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.659> manipulate<00:01:13.140> lasers

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
some objects around or manipulate lasers

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.200 
some objects around or manipulate lasers
so<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> say<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> pretty<00:01:14.820> fun<00:01:15.060> little

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so like I say it's a pretty fun little

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
so like I say it's a pretty fun little
puzzle<00:01:15.420> game<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.170> pretty<00:01:16.439> challenging<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
puzzle game it's pretty challenging you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.080 
puzzle game it's pretty challenging you
have<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:17.970> bit

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
have to think about it for a little bit

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
have to think about it for a little bit
on<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> couple<00:01:18.990> days<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.200> got<00:01:19.380> stuck<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
on a couple days I got stuck on for a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.109 
on a couple days I got stuck on for a
little<00:01:20.220> while<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.580> once<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
little while but once you get in the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.969 
little while but once you get in the
groove<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.750> pretty<00:01:22.439> much<00:01:22.530> figure<00:01:22.830> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
groove you can pretty much figure this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.289 
groove you can pretty much figure this
out<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.400> let's<00:01:23.700> watch<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.939> little<00:01:24.090> gameplay

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
out so let's watch a little gameplay

00:01:24.299 --> 00:02:03.080 
out so let's watch a little gameplay
here

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.370 

remember<00:02:04.090> before<00:02:04.450> when<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.660> was<00:02:04.840> talking<00:02:05.080> about

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
remember before when I was talking about

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.320 
remember before when I was talking about
smelly<00:02:05.860> garbage<00:02:06.100> standing<00:02:06.790> around<00:02:07.000> being

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
smelly garbage standing around being

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.290 
smelly garbage standing around being
