00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.500
 hey people what's going on here is his ex 

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.210
 another comment and of course 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.589
 again another gameplay today 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.390
 you can already see it in the background 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.760
 website where so a dlc gameplay with 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.860
 The star a little bit of a race team 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.180
 deathmatch with 150 points per kilo 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.470
 and I have to honestly say that 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.370
 I always like playing mode 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.050
 better and I'll look up too 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.670
 youtube more and more often and meanwhile 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.810
 is that so I find the mode one 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.280
 between actually much better than team 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.360
 deathmatch team deathmatch is one of those 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.490
 slower the killstreaks 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.990
 not at all and everything goes like this 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.100
 trickles in this way 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.690
 but here it is actually everything 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.800
 pretty cool you get him killstreaks 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.840
 moderately fast stop without synonymous 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.370
 objectives and that's why he likes me 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.020
 always and always better and even six 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.610
 seven minutes of gameplay are actually 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.739
 very nice to comment on 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.970
 comments and therefore plays something in 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.050
 Lately, I like to be here 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.340
 difficult as I said with the ska 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.140
 actually a very good weapon i can 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.399
 recommend to anyone is in close combat good 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.110
 With laser time you can do it well 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.399
 from the hip spray and stop too 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.720
 something in a close fight but still 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.000
 of course, even on distance 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.530
 pretty good killstreaks are here we 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.090
 already can see lightning strike the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.590
 thani league ob da and the escor trainer 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.180
 and I wish you a lot of fun with that 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.190
 gameplay for I have today 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.420
 pretty cool theme about me already 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.549
 wanted to speak longer 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.319
 because electronic arts has confirmed that 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.819
 So dice the batman-film maker 

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:09.560
 a new engine works that is 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.789
 not in the frostbite 4 or immediately 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.700
 Central is just announced 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.289
 but a frostbite engine for 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.539
 mobile devices is designed that is 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.090
 for the iphone for the samsung galaxy 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.429
 So the android base for ipads for 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.409
 So in general, tablets are all possible 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.209
 becomes common mobile platforms for this 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.380
 exactly this engine just designed and 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.849
 that's exactly what I want to do today 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.170
 I'm already talking to you very much 

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:32.779
 looking forward to your opinion on the whole 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.729
 topic because that is something mine 

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:36.380
 opinion was to be expected of course 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.479
 but of course a bit pro 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.950
 and contra arguments with you 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.880
 Today I want to talk about it and 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.200
 Of course, first of all I want to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.479
 say more about that is perfect 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.740
 it is understandable that electronic arts in 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.549
 would like to penetrate this market 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.709
 Of course, perfectly clear 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.689
 everyone buys at the moment about apps and 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.700
 Anything the mobile device likes is 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.380
 just way bigger than Battlefield 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.880
 Clearly many people buy battlefield 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.459
 battlefield cost 60 euros or so 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.049
 but everyone just buys ex club on the 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.989
 normal average iphone are 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.310
 I think 40 50 or or even more 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.229
 more by average you have to 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.980
 clearly say 50 g download today 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.570
 apps is 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.420
 I have to do that again after about that 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.860
 the rotary available and that must be easy 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.810
 let's make it clear how many apps 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.040
 just downloaded virtually every day 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.840
 and you all know that too 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.770
 Everyone is in smartphone nowadays 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.110
 of course, completely understandable 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.510
 that battlefield so electronic arts in 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.420
 this huge big market and full 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.320
 would like to enter the profitable market 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.570
 but you have to say that and me 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.120
 think you all have one 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.710
 multiplayer shooter on the iphone or 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.060
 I played on some smartphone 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.710
 for example, always earlier modern combat 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.750
 played that I think yes I have 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.400
 look again then come with 1 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.170
 and 2 at that time you could quasi 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.640
 via bluetooth connect with others 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.380
 Friends have played this but you 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.060
 know that all of it is pretty pretty 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.890
 imprecise one meets almost not at all 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.480
 so that where you want to meet you want one 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.800
 blocks his own view with the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.510
 You try to finger around a bit 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.430
 fumble it is not really the true 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.530
 I believe everyone knows that and sometimes 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.510
 to the graphic to the graphic even if he 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.040
 now, of course, the whole as a model 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.660
 of course that is the frostbite 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.310
 So basically what we are talking about 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.430
 Battlefield 3 are used to it 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.140
 completely unrealistic that we really 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.850
 a battlefield graphic quasi on the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.770
 Handy thus have the whole 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.580
 Particle effects of indestructible buildings 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.560
 and everything possible 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.910
 it just will not be that way 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.530
 be realizable in course 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.280
 a few years if the smartphones 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.870
 always and always and always 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.100
 it is natural, of course, to become more efficient 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.780
 Of course it is getting better 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.330
 but in my opinion that is 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.610
 not really that true yet 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.320
 That's why I do not think so 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.489
 really what will happen if there is 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.720
 he tries so over the games and still 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.489
 nothing said but if there is an attempt 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.630
 battlefield as a multiplayer school 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.610
 or old as well as single player then 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.530
 probably even less 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.150
 the whole only on the phone to clap 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.500
 then somehow it will work 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.790
 you could play but it would be real 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.380
 not the real clear a few people 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.130
 that would download and would 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.480
 to have a look 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.640
 but I would not day that and now 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.050
 play night if you just a lot 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.820
 better alternative that much better 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.560
 model quasi at home around 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.750
 has available and that is why the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.489
 my opinion that there is something new 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.930
 should think and I have 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.790
 23 thoughts made to me today 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.930
 Also very curious what your opinion 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.489
 first end I'm very excited 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.810
 As I said, please write in 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.550
 the comments if you have any idea 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.480
 have what goes in the direction and 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.070
 also in general if you are her 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.600
 notes or something have written me 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.130
 the comments of course they all through 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.810
 and right now it's time to get started 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.220
 my idea because I have the following 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.019
 thinks about how we get it now from the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.000
 announce battlefield 4 with notice 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.500
 have yes this commander mode where 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.360
 you stop 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.740
 the whole controls where you that that 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.880
 battlefield quasi sees the multiplayer 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.710
 strike two teams fight against each other 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.110
 and as a commander you can do it all 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.090
 so to speak I say command and that 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.320
 almost as a game just on the ipad 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.120
 that would be really good in my opinion 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.590
 stop for battlefield 3 from the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.120
 battlefield 3 universes of course not 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.380
 as a multiplayer that one right 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.270
 player controls lingering naturally ki 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.100
 opponent but I think so the whole so 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.750
 as a real-time strategy game if you then 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.280
 From above, so to speak , comes with the 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.510
 ipad then you can do that too 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.950
 I believe in that very well with the 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.540
 do very well and then stop 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.730
 you hold the individual spots that way 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.780
 he is defending God and b 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.500
 I can never do all of this to anybody 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.300
 given 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.130
 I think that would be really cool 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.480
 and you could believe that mine 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.280
 opinion after quite cool sales also 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.390
 with this engine and that would be mine 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.440
 opinion after a pretty cool success 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.730
 I think I would be on everyone 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.810
 get a case because it is still too 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.700
 pretty good preparation is for 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.870
 battlefield 4 the commander mode and 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.370
 everything possible so in my opinion 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.050
 would that be something pretty cool writes 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.430
 give me your opinion on this to this 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.140
 to those games in which the comments 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.430
 and I have something else and that 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.130
 maybe a few of you, maybe 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.560
 have noticed on the e3 at the on 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.380
 the book he was standing on 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.080
 announced garden wolf-garden mosque 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.520
 is quasi plants vs zombies just stopping as 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.380
 as a shooter that you yourself so everyone 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.850
 knows plants vs zombies that one himself 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.010
 as a plant rumrennt this this 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.270
 Buds shoots and even this one 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.979
 Zombies shoots and I think so 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.090
 really cool if the country game is not 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.710
 so seriously is just like 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.510
 battlefield just play it 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.130
 is funny part in this cartoon 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.870
 man man man man shoots age 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.190
 zombies with plants and everything is just 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.080
 It's really funny and it does not really work 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.600
 where exactly you are on it but stop 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.950
 simply because it is cool in itself 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.720
 game idea is if a complete 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.860
 other genre was transmitted that are 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.780
 so my ideas as I said if you 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.560
 have other ideas or comments 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.190
 Mean like you write in the 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.990
 Comments 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.280
 I am very curious and would like to 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.360
 also like to discuss it with you 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.770
 and otherwise if you have the video 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.270
 Please give me the thumb 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.950
 up and now you can see it here 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.210
 car two videos my last two 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.169
 videos of which you maybe one 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.000
 missed above 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.650
 an ex my new series i just 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.540
 you started asking me the questions 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.800
 I answered then that was very well received 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.350
 the video with the people who saw it 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.820
 unfortunately only 600 calls say 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.169
 So I have one now 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.340
 few people have not seen you yet 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.560
 would be glad if you clicked 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.690
 opens at the new tab and below dice 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.950
 is working on a new battlefront star 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.479
 wars battlefront 3 was 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.220
 most likely and I have 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.200
 already said before he satire on the 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.550
 So e3 came if that interests you 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.969
 if nothing interested then 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.319
 could 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.549
 I definitely look at it like that 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.139
 I said if you liked the video 

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:39.579
 please give me up and otherwise 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:44.489
 I tell children to watch until 

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:44.489
