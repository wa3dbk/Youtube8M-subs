00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.359
 good afternoon dear friends today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 let's talk a little bit the same model 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.700
 called murat company kirsha nyura 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.940
 such is clearly the Russian-language name 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.670
 understandable from the fact that the designer of this 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.080
 Knife is dmitry senkevich 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.920
 Belarusian knife craftsmen designers and 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 so he did for 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.910
 for coy companies he did one more 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.020
 model for the more expensive segment for 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.640
 zero tolerance 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.090
 well, he made such a cheap one 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.160
 option 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.950
 Jurassic speaking in terms of design 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.750
 no general complaints about this knife 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.890
 It can not be this flipper frame lock 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.600
 metal that is stainless steel 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.340
 liner made or how there frame or how 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.760
 there it is correct to call it 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.580
 all metal handle 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.810
 similar design so the same plan 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.260
 as for example it was on 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.710
 cash outskirts here themselves handles 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.799
 made thinner it is lighter although the knife is bigger 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.799
 but he is not as heavy as the edges 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.350
 very beautifully made this model 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.650
 coated with titanium nitride i.e. 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.110
 blade covered with titanium nitride and handles 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.790
 were coated with titanium nitride then 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.650
 up was exactly so polished and 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.190
 there were left but inside here in these 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.050
 Here slots left such a thin 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.810
 titanium nitride is very beautiful 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:52.510
 This contrast of dark Japan turned out 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:58.030
 svetly we want to get integrated 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:02.650
 such from surfaces this flipper 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:07.060
 accordingly not here no there is 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.190
 kicks for opening also not here 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.430
 this here is the help system when opening 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.950
 special flight 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.330
 Assist so-called no I mean it 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.870
 purely mechanical, what is more to me 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.030
 like thats flip Wheaton basically 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.360
 not bad but there is such a moment that 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.310
 usually here is but finger 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.800
 superimposed on the flipper oh usually 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.769
 on many finger superimposed here and 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:38.110
 pulls back in this in this situation he 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:41.800
 grind will not house apparently by 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.580
 design made so that the top exactly on 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.920
 here it is the fin impose a finger 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.989
 fingertip and press it down smoothly 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.480
 that is exactly vertically downward to press 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.680
 then it will open until will 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.870
 fine grind i have this here 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.110
 such is the feature of this model in 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:10.090
 Basically very nicely done well there 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:13.120
 that is, but there is a great knife there 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.930
 look at the inscription and who are there to and 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.930
 kershaw 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:25.740
 then Che then the model number Sienkiewicz design 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:30.270
 there somewhere here it is not written anywhere that my 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.120
 chayna day but we inadvertently and it is written that 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.760
 there are 9 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.310
 there it means to cover a nitride 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.700
 titanium and drink means that there he is 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.470
 bearing is a proprietary system 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:51.470
 bearings 9 that is, they are unlike 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.660
 like a demon who use parquet 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.980
 command pen tool to any precisely in 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.920
 cage normal price tags 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.040
 bearings that is if i never 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.720
 assorted those knives that are on bearings 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.060
 which produces all orc tino 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.160
 as far as i know there they are if them 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.760
 disassembled not substance on spilled these 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.650
 balls and all bye 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.269
 that is, this is the problem here 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.549
 no problem, you can safely disassemble 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.770
 collect knife bearings ok 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.960
 are all these balls are in 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.850
 clip and nowhere crumbles now 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.860
 as you noticed from the inscriptions there is no 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.240
 no indication of which steel 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.240
 this knife is made and 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:44.940
 website shows as 8 front 13 o with 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.850
 8 injection pump 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.730
 vanadium that is something like aus-8 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.200
 slightly different in composition but something 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:58.110
 like aus-8 but principle 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.210
 things in general that kershi sometimes does 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:06.300
 knives and makes them of steel 3 chrome 13 and 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.260
 I will give 5 Juan 13 that is from cheaper 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.930
 become especially if these knives they sell 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.570
 through a network of shops such here 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.620
 walmart supermarkets 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.510
 that is, which here come the big ones 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.340
 supermarkets they make them cheaper and 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.130
 cheaper steel because it's for 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.820
 people who care what there is 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.010
 Stalin is 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.600
 it is quite possible that here for example in 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.040
 this particular model could be such 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.350
 knife because this knife i got from 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.950
 Anatolia from Zhytomyr 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:41.700
 Tolik these something there I would always get confused 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.790
 in the names of our youtubers, therefore, only 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.990
 I apologize in advance if I'm there 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:52.590
 turned him over in general his channel name 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.500
 Well, I can credit of course passed 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:59.430
 did he buy this knife somewhere 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.980
 and I do two tests on the ropes, he 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.730
 did and he did not like it because 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:09.780
 that the first one was completely bad 2 he 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:12.300
 dragged it again was better and here 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:16.170
 he did not hit sent asked to make him 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.420
 the blade for this knife is me for 100 on 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.580
 the present moment is a and b l only 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.040
 stainless principle i will do is a and 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:29.260
 b for this 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.300
 Forget him to do make 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.860
 maybe I'll take a couple of videos there 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.850
 oh here's how like this whole process 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.110
 occurred or how any thoughts out there 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.550
 about this will 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.550
 this video itself
