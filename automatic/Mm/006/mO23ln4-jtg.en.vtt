00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.779
 hello my name is agapov dmitri and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.610
 I'll show you now and tell you how 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.710
 thaws wheat wheat juice and 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.929
 wheat root juice which 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.500
 bind our company live 200 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.180
 juice from the freezer is necessary 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.949
 get right before 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:27.029
 swam going to take open 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.500
 containers you have there is such 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.850
 kill or that's where you start 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.530
 first in the glass 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.360
 need to pour water ratio of water to 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.969
 the volume of juice should be about one to 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.420
 three the more water the faster mother 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.039
 your cubes are melting frozen water 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 should be at room temperature 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.989
 never use microwave 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.360
 stoves or hot water if you drink and 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.359
 wheat germ juice and root juice 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.080
 wheat we recommend in one glass 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.650
 place both the cubes immediately 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.570
 it helps you brighten the taste of juice from 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.299
 wheat germ because it has 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.570
 specific taste if you mix 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.450
 it with the juice of the roots of wheat then taste 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.810
 it turns out you can even say very 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.360
 nice if you drink only green 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.150
 Wheatgrass juice, use 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.710
 only green drain but now here i am 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.610
 I will show you how I am a peony and how I can 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.610
 confuse principle does not change 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:44.220
 you put a glass 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:52.939
 let's say three cubes of juice and 1 common prostrate and 3 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:56.520
 cube of wheat roots stir 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.280
 need to buy not necessarily not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.140
 metal object quickly and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.759
 stirring speeds up the process 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.229
 defrosting ie now you see what 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.860
 we already have water 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:20.000
 turned green and already size 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:23.159
 cubes are already decreasing if you 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.080
 put the glass first water and then 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.260
 buy it and just like me you 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:33.599
 showed and it protects your cubes 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.989
 frozen juice from sticking together and then 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.310
 surface area 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.040
 which is defrosted area 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.349
 surface defrost is obtained 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.920
 very big because if you stick together 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.140
 for example, 2 dice together then area 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.040
 the growth of riding these cubes she 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.060
 decreases very important to drink this juice 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.310
 20 minutes before the meal perfect 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.810
 time to take this juice in the morning 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.349
 fasting juice when you even have it 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.640
 diluted with water and it melts 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.069
 it turns out pretty cool 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.750
 drink if you are not confident in your 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.079
 immunity to your health 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.980
 we highly recommend holding this juice 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:23.299
 in the mouth 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:27.660
 so that 1 juice warms up and second 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.419
 this way the juice is mixed with saliva and 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.560
 and it contributes to his even better 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:37.260
 assimilated by your body and here you are 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.700
 see what happened about one 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.370
 minute and the fact that we actively interfered with these 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.480
 cubes look they have become less well 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.269
 somewhere twice it's exactly when you 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.750
 see that the water is already colored 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.650
 juice 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.900
 you can drink it slowly even if you 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.150
 take your time 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.530
 Especially I start taking juice 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:08.150
 when he had already painted a little water and 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:12.290
 dissolved in water let's say you can even 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.000
 if you have such a situation for example you 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.180
 drank the contents of the glass 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.090
 which water is mixed with juice 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.430
 unfrozen 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.530
 and there are still cubes left 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.350
 add more water for even more 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:32.850
 defrost and actually melt very 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:36.610
 quickly if you are worried about the taste of juice 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.660
 especially wheatgrass juice then 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.050
 when you dilute it with water and taste 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:47.110
 let's say it is specific though it is impossible 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.990
 call him unpleasant but he will help you 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.590
 for some reason don't like that instead 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.130
 water you can fill it with your favorite 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.800
 you can add some honey to your juice 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.200
 or is there something sweet jam something 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.820
 you like the taste of juice then you do not 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:09.040
 feel all the good 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:14.310
 stay healthy 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.310
 enjoy life and live 200 thanks
