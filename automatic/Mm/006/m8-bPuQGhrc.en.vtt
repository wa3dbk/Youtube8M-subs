00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.469
 Well, this video we bring to you 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.890
 those who are undecided between the 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.660
 white and black for good to see them a 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.369
 little bit more in detail to see if you 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.320
 we can help but it is always 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.840
 advisable that good 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.640
 try to see in person for good 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.410
 decide how you see ahead 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.620
 there is a lot of difference that is to say white 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.710
 or black there we noticed it practically 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.350
 difference 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.340
 and then for example if we take them and 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.510
 we see the side we can see that in the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:51.500
 white we have matt aluminum and in the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.440
 edges so we can take it you see how it is 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.760
 with brightness let's see a little bit 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:02.970
 and there is painted black matte 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.380
 of color so a little darker 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.380
 let's go to the back 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.140
 and as you see here , yes, it is going 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.630
 changing a little more 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.220
 the same we have the aluminum in color 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.220
 matte and aluminum in black 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.369
 and well here you can see the difference to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 I personally liked the more 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.610
 black 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.830
 also for the back 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.700
 according to the lighting esteban 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.070
 phone we can see how 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.690
 the aluminum gives us a contrast 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.420
 different 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.080
 I think white has black there 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.310
 times we practically do not appreciate what 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.240
 which is the back but if 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.240
 we turn and we give him light 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.490
 I personally loved it 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.470
 to see the difference 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.470
 by putting it without light 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.510
 let's see again for example here 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.000
 the connectors you also try the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.550
 lightning connector on the white the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.880
 mini jack connector and others is in 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.090
 brightness 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.090
 and here we see them in darker color 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.500
 let's see again ahead 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.180
 and well that's basically 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.660
 the differences we have between the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.660
 white and black
