00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.500 
and you can pay that there are some
tablets<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.430> go<00:04:05.700> for<00:04:05.940> eight<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.299> nine

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
tablets that go for eight to nine

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.740 
tablets that go for eight to nine
thousand<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.519> price<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:09.239> it's

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
thousand and so on the price it's it's

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.570 
thousand and so on the price it's it's
good<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.230> doesn't<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.010> fastest

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
good it doesn't have the fastest

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.539 
good it doesn't have the fastest
processor<00:04:12.200> but<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.739> reason<00:04:13.950> for<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.310> is

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
processor but the reason for that is

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.330 
processor but the reason for that is
strategic<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.330> you<00:04:16.049> go<00:04:16.229> lighter<00:04:16.799> on<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
strategic it you go lighter on the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.310 
strategic it you go lighter on the
processor<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.209> go<00:04:18.359> deeper<00:04:18.750> on<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.989> battery

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
processor to go deeper on the battery

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.400 
processor to go deeper on the battery
power<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:19.709> this<00:04:20.099> thing<00:04:20.280> runs<00:04:20.549> on<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.820> battery

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
power so this thing runs on the battery

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.860 
power so this thing runs on the battery
they<00:04:22.410> say<00:04:22.680> nine<00:04:22.950> hours<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:24.060> would<00:04:24.270> say

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
they say nine hours I would say

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.860 
they say nine hours I would say
yeah<00:04:25.100> i<00:04:26.100> would<00:04:26.430> say<00:04:26.580> about<00:04:26.850> at<00:04:27.180> least<00:04:27.510> six

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
yeah i would say about at least six

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.570 
yeah i would say about at least six
hours<00:04:28.050> you'll<00:04:28.410> get<00:04:28.560> off<00:04:28.710> on<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.160> battery<00:04:29.490> on

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
hours you'll get off on the battery on

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.010 
hours you'll get off on the battery on
this<00:04:29.729> thing<00:04:29.940> okay<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:30.389> it's<00:04:30.540> basically<00:04:30.720> like
