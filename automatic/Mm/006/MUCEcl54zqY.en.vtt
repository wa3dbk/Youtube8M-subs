00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello and welcome on during 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.360
 photography.com today I you 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.710
 talked about polarizing filters so 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.019
 I put a polarizing filter on my 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.350
 objective be aware that the filters 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.480
 are filters that are fixed 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.369
 at the end of your goal and who 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.820
 works a circular way so 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.310
 the polarizing filter goes is a filter 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.609
 which will allow you to increase the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.460
 contrasts of your image to revive the 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.199
 colors too and mitigate the glare 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.600
 when you are going to have it by 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.819
 example here we have a water surface that 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.319
 is a river so there is not too much wind 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.120
 so we really have all the reflections of 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:45.159
 branches so we can play with them 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.179
 reflections with a polarizing filter so 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.859
 I showed you immediately how 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.030
 it works if you have to know at 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.170
 before anything else is that the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.579
 polarizing filter will you eat 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.209
 a lot of light because it's a filter 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.809
 to these probes 

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:57.129
 so be careful with that if you 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.899
 have very bad conditions of 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.449
 light uses a polarizing filter 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.100
 can be complicated sometimes so 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.950
 attention beware so I made a 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:16.810
 first test then without filter 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 polarizing here and settings by putting 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:26.230
 the polarizing thoroughly and that's so we have 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.050
 two differences we see the reflections 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.190
 in the river that moves so there what 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.340
 I'm going to do it'll be even more 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.920
 speaking I'm going to film 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.670
 here and I activate the polarizing filter 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.010
 you can see how it evolves 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.909
 it takes from the river I apologize for 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.220
 fingers but I have no choice 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:53.280
 this is how the filter works 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:53.280
 polarizing if I start doing a test 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:05.110
 with the polarizer here is then I 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:13.770
 change my polarizer setting for 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:15.880
 to say without polarizing here we have really 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.500
 two different things an image 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.820
 much colder and the image 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.830
 much hotter with the pole comes 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.090
 and you'll see that the polarizer him 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.230
 it'll be interesting if you want 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.280
 take a picture of shop windows and that 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.500
 you risk seeing yourself in this 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.060
 showcase you use the polarizer you 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.530
 settle it you will be able to disappear 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.530
 remove the reflection from the showcase there 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.360
 disappears your reflection disappear saad 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.740
 valid as well for filming or 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.910
 take pictures of characters in 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.709
 a car you will be able to remove 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.350
 the reflections of the windshield or power 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.170
 see the characters in the car 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.580
 this is the interest of the polarizing filter 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.290
 thank you all 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.150
 Feel free to leave a comment 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.230
 on the page of the article that you have 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.650
 questions or if you have any questions 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.930
 remarks 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.209
 what is your experience on the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.920
 polarizing filter polarizing filter 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.050
 also going to be very useful for everything 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.060
 who's landscape when he's going to revive the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.739
 green it tends to remove glare 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.200
 so on the lawn for example on 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.640
 the foliage of trees we will remove 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.130
 all the reflections so we will see 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.620
 really green and soft colors 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.660
 which are very beautiful so voila 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.110
 thanks to you and who says very soon 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.110
 meet again 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.620

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.140
