right about in here and then this is the
five<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.750> length<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.320> how<00:00:31.560> we're<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> do

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
five the length is how we're going to do

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.970 
five the length is how we're going to do
that<00:00:32.219> I'm<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:32.969> turn<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:34.170> cement<00:00:34.710> board

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that I'm going to turn the cement board

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.580 
that I'm going to turn the cement board
on<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.370> wall<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> go<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
on this wall and I'm going to go up and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.130 
on this wall and I'm going to go up and
it's<00:00:37.800> five<00:00:38.129> feet<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:41.300> it<00:00:42.300> lands<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.870> about

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
it's five feet and it lands to about

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.910 
it's five feet and it lands to about
right<00:00:43.320> there

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
right there

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.250 
right there
but<00:00:44.850> basically<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:45.629> saying<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.110> because

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
but basically what I'm saying is because

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.410 
but basically what I'm saying is because
this<00:00:46.680> walls<00:00:46.920> five-and-a-half<00:00:47.640> inches<00:00:47.879> are

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
this walls five-and-a-half inches are

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.630 
this walls five-and-a-half inches are
five<00:00:48.660> feet<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> half<00:00:49.379> inch<00:00:49.680> I'm<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
five feet and a half inch I'm going to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.279 
five feet and a half inch I'm going to
start<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.239> wall<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> make<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.260> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
start on this wall to make up for that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.100 
start on this wall to make up for that
half<00:00:52.620> inch<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:54.210> by<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> time<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
half inch and so by the time I get to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470 
half inch and so by the time I get to
this<00:00:55.469> wall<00:00:55.739> I'll<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> score<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> little

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
this wall I'll have to score a little

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
this wall I'll have to score a little
bit<00:00:57.629> off<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.350> ends<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
bit off of one of the ends to get it to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.400 
bit off of one of the ends to get it to
fit<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.520> there<00:00:59.699> for<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> five<00:01:00.270> feet<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.899> then

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
fit in there for the five feet and then

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.560 
fit in there for the five feet and then
we'll<00:01:01.590> finish<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.430> wet<00:01:03.059> wall<00:01:03.270> over

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
we'll finish up with this wet wall over

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.260 
we'll finish up with this wet wall over
here<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.830> we're<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
here so what we're going to do here is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
here so what we're going to do here is
I'm<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> measure<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.979> want<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
I'm going to measure and you want to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.010 
I'm going to measure and you want to
measure<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.720> bit<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
measure it so it has a little bit of a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.190 
measure it so it has a little bit of a
gap<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.799> you're<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:10.979> tight<00:01:12.200> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
gap in there so you're not tight and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.570 
gap in there so you're not tight and
we're<00:01:13.350> looking<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:13.770> thirty<00:01:14.100> two<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
we're looking at thirty two and a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.240 
we're looking at thirty two and a
quarter<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:16.170> pretty<00:01:16.470> consistent<00:01:16.680> all

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
quarter and it's pretty consistent all

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
quarter and it's pretty consistent all
the<00:01:17.280> way<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:20.570> jumps<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.110> bit<00:01:22.409> there

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the way up jumps up a little bit there

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.820 
the way up jumps up a little bit there
to<00:01:22.799> five<00:01:22.979> sixteen<00:01:24.320> okay<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:25.710> I'm

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
to five sixteen okay so what I'm

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.230 
to five sixteen okay so what I'm
actually<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.119> going

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
actually just going to do is I'm going

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.819 
actually just going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:27.299> take<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> quarter<00:01:27.810> inch<00:01:28.080> off<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.590> allows

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to take a quarter inch off that allows

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.010 
to take a quarter inch off that allows
me<00:01:29.070> an<00:01:29.159> eighth<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.490> an<00:01:29.610> inch<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.360> then

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
me an eighth of an inch here and then

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
me an eighth of an inch here and then
another<00:01:31.170> eighth<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:31.829> inch<00:01:31.950> gap<00:01:32.220> back<00:01:32.460> here

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
another eighth of an inch gap back here

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.630 
another eighth of an inch gap back here
so<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.689> force<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.400> cement<00:01:35.400> board

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
so I don't have to force my cement board

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
so I don't have to force my cement board
in<00:01:35.790> there<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.570> I'm<00:01:36.659> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> cut<00:01:37.049> this

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
in there and so I'm going to cut this

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.960 
in there and so I'm going to cut this
thirty<00:01:37.560> two<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.310> subtracted<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
thirty two and I just subtracted a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.080 
thirty two and I just subtracted a
quarter<00:01:39.240> inch<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> did<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.880> right

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
quarter inch is all I did all right

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.649 
quarter inch is all I did all right
so<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.880> when<00:01:44.880> we<00:01:45.210> look

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
so what we have here is when we look

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.149 
so what we have here is when we look
inside<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.320> we're<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> go<00:01:46.860> along<00:01:46.950> the

t-square so you just line it up if you

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.320 
t-square so you just line it up if you
have<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.570> straight<00:02:25.870> edge<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.760> just<00:02:30.970> lined<00:02:31.180> up

you<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.440> score<00:02:44.770> one<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.400> can<00:02:45.550> score<00:02:45.790> twice

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
you can score one so you can score twice

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.510 
you can score one so you can score twice
but<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.780> got<00:02:47.410> through<00:02:47.739> because<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.130> got<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> pretty

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
but I got through because I got a pretty

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.340 
but I got through because I got a pretty
decent<00:02:48.640> blade<00:02:49.150> in<00:02:49.360> here<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> first<00:02:49.840> time<00:02:50.080> then

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
decent blade in here the first time then

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.380 
decent blade in here the first time then
you<00:02:50.380> just<00:02:50.680> take<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:52.180> snap<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.540> down

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
you just take it and you snap it down

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.610 
you just take it and you snap it down
just<00:02:55.390> like<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.720> would<00:02:55.870> sheetrock<00:02:58.470> maybe<00:02:59.470> you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
just like you would sheetrock maybe you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.660 
just like you would sheetrock maybe you
can<00:02:59.830> see<00:03:00.520> this<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.500> just<00:03:02.500> took<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.890> snapped<00:03:03.459> it

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
can see this I just took it snapped it

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.330 
can see this I just took it snapped it
down<00:03:04.050> now<00:03:05.050> I<00:03:05.080> just<00:03:05.170> take<00:03:05.530> my<00:03:05.709> utility<00:03:06.310> knife

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
down now I just take my utility knife

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.530 
down now I just take my utility knife
and<00:03:07.209> I'll<00:03:07.360> run<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.780> right<00:03:07.959> down<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:10.150> cut<00:03:10.360> that

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
and I'll run it right down to cut that

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.160 
and I'll run it right down to cut that
off<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.530> comes<00:03:11.769> right<00:03:11.860> off<00:03:12.959> then<00:03:13.959> what<00:03:14.140> I

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
off and it comes right off then what I

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.340 
off and it comes right off then what I
do<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.650> I'll<00:03:15.280> kind<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.180> score<00:03:16.510> off<00:03:16.720> where<00:03:17.080> it

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
do is I'll kind of score off where it

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.190 
do is I'll kind of score off where it
needs<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.610> be<00:03:18.790> taken<00:03:19.269> off<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.600> little<00:03:19.870> bit<00:03:20.049> with

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
needs to be taken off a little bit with

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.690 
needs to be taken off a little bit with
my<00:03:20.380> knife<00:03:21.750> make<00:03:22.750> them<00:03:22.900> nice<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:24.000> smooth<00:03:25.000> here

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
my knife make them nice and smooth here

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.900 
my knife make them nice and smooth here
so<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:28.060> stays<00:03:28.390> that<00:03:29.160> 32<00:03:30.160> inches<00:03:30.549> not<00:03:30.880> more<00:03:32.910> and

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
so it stays that 32 inches not more and

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.310 
so it stays that 32 inches not more and
that's<00:03:34.150> how<00:03:34.299> you<00:03:34.360> can<00:03:34.600> do<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.989> can<00:03:35.140> use

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
that's how you can do it you can use

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.930 
that's how you can do it you can use
something<00:03:35.590> else<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:36.100> got<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.459> little<00:03:36.730> hook

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
something else I got this little hook

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
that I use but so that's it that will

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.830 
that I use but so that's it that will
bring<00:03:44.860> this<00:03:44.980> in<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.519> see<00:03:45.970> how<00:03:46.120> she<00:03:46.180> fit<00:03:48.840> okay

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
can see is going right here against the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.540 
can see is going right here against the
sheetrock<00:04:47.449> so<00:04:48.440> now<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.620> have<00:04:48.889> a<00:04:48.919> little<00:04:49.340> bit<00:04:49.520> of

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
sheetrock so now I have a little bit of

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.159 
sheetrock so now I have a little bit of
a<00:04:50.710> gap<00:04:51.710> there<00:04:52.100> or<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.370> bevel<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.780> that<00:04:53.900> I<00:04:53.930> can

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
a gap there or a bevel so that I can

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.129 
a gap there or a bevel so that I can
fill<00:04:54.440> this<00:04:54.470> in<00:04:54.800> nicely<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:56.570> now<00:04:56.750> I'm<00:04:56.900> using

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
fill this in nicely and now I'm using

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:07.150 
fill this in nicely and now I'm using
cement<00:04:57.680> board<00:04:57.949> screws<00:05:05.349> and<00:05:06.349> I'm<00:05:06.530> sinking<00:05:07.009> them

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
cement board screws and I'm sinking them

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.749 
cement board screws and I'm sinking them
in<00:05:10.690> you<00:05:11.690> don't<00:05:11.810> want<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.349> have<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.759> screw

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
in you don't want to have a screw

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.600 
in you don't want to have a screw
sticking<00:05:14.180> out<00:05:14.330> because<00:05:14.539> it<00:05:14.780> will<00:05:15.370> tilt<00:05:16.370> your

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
sticking out because it will tilt your

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.310 
sticking out because it will tilt your
tile<00:05:17.979> so<00:05:18.979> you<00:05:19.070> want<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.340> make<00:05:19.460> sure<00:05:19.490> you<00:05:19.789> get

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
tile so you want to make sure you get

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.960 
tile so you want to make sure you get
that<00:05:21.320> in<00:05:21.380> nice<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:22.160> flush<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:24.820> sink<00:05:25.820> it

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
that in nice and flush and sink it

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:38.529 
that in nice and flush and sink it
actually<00:05:26.419> a<00:05:27.490> little<00:05:28.490> bit<00:05:37.060> now<00:05:38.060> if<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:38.330> have<00:05:38.510> a

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
actually a little bit now if you have a

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.870 
actually a little bit now if you have a
spot<00:05:38.930> where<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.409> cement<00:05:39.949> board<00:05:40.190> breaks<00:05:40.550> or

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
spot where the cement board breaks or

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.939 
spot where the cement board breaks or
chips<00:05:41.810> out<00:05:41.930> you<00:05:42.110> want<00:05:42.320> to<00:05:42.409> just<00:05:42.560> get<00:05:42.740> that<00:05:42.889> out

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
chips out you want to just get that out

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.830 
chips out you want to just get that out
because<00:05:43.400> we<00:05:43.520> can<00:05:43.669> just<00:05:43.699> fill<00:05:44.150> that<00:05:44.180> then<00:05:44.630> with

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
because we can just fill that then with

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:59.320 
because we can just fill that then with
some<00:05:45.050> thin<00:05:45.770> set<00:05:46.070> later<00:05:46.310> on

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.180 

you<00:06:00.330> just<00:06:00.540> want<00:06:00.690> to<00:06:00.780> find<00:06:01.050> your<00:06:01.200> studs<00:06:01.470> and

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
you just want to find your studs and

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.230 
you just want to find your studs and
then<00:06:02.670> we're<00:06:02.850> going<00:06:02.970> to<00:06:03.000> measure<00:06:05.000> mark<00:06:06.000> them

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
then we're going to measure mark them

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.780 
then we're going to measure mark them
and<00:06:06.480> then<00:06:07.020> we'll<00:06:07.140> draw<00:06:07.320> some<00:06:07.620> lines<00:06:07.890> to<00:06:08.280> be

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
and then we'll draw some lines to be

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.410 
and then we'll draw some lines to be
able<00:06:08.820> to<00:06:09.090> see<00:06:09.300> exactly<00:06:09.660> where<00:06:09.960> they're<00:06:10.110> at

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
able to see exactly where they're at

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.820 
able to see exactly where they're at
okay<00:06:12.420> so<00:06:13.350> I<00:06:13.380> know<00:06:13.560> that<00:06:13.920> I<00:06:13.950> have<00:06:14.250> I<00:06:15.590> have<00:06:16.590> one

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
okay so I know that I have I have one

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.330 
okay so I know that I have I have one
here<00:06:18.140> which<00:06:19.140> actually<00:06:19.740> goes<00:06:19.860> all<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.130> way<00:06:20.250> to

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
here which actually goes all the way to

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.690 
here which actually goes all the way to
there<00:06:20.640> got<00:06:21.060> another<00:06:21.360> one<00:06:21.570> here<00:06:21.990> I<00:06:22.520> got<00:06:23.520> one

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
there got another one here I got one

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:30.740 
there got another one here I got one
here<00:06:24.710> there<00:06:26.600> so<00:06:27.600> 10<00:06:29.300> I'll<00:06:30.300> go<00:06:30.450> from<00:06:30.630> the

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
here there so 10 I'll go from the

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.270 
here there so 10 I'll go from the
sheetrock<00:06:31.020> it's<00:06:31.410> 10<00:06:31.800> 25<00:06:32.460> and<00:06:32.520> 1/2<00:06:34.280> make

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
sheetrock it's 10 25 and 1/2 make

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:45.470 
sheetrock it's 10 25 and 1/2 make
another<00:06:35.550> mark<00:06:35.790> down<00:06:36.030> here<00:06:41.990> 25<00:06:42.990> and<00:06:43.200> 1/2<00:06:44.480> now

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
another mark down here 25 and 1/2 now

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480 
another mark down here 25 and 1/2 now
you<00:06:45.630> could<00:06:45.780> also<00:06:45.960> mark<00:06:46.380> these<00:06:46.590> studs<00:06:46.920> maybe<00:06:47.280> on

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
you could also mark these studs maybe on

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.970 
you could also mark these studs maybe on
the<00:06:47.640> top<00:06:47.910> here<00:06:48.180> and<00:06:48.390> with<00:06:48.780> a<00:06:48.810> pencil<00:06:49.320> that's

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
the top here and with a pencil that's

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.530 
the top here and with a pencil that's
going<00:06:50.280> to<00:06:50.340> get<00:06:50.490> covered<00:06:50.820> up<00:06:50.910> anyway

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
going to get covered up anyway

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.000 
going to get covered up anyway
before<00:06:52.260> you<00:06:52.730> go<00:06:53.730> along<00:06:54.500> so<00:06:55.500> you<00:06:55.560> know<00:06:55.710> exactly

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
before you go along so you know exactly

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.590 
before you go along so you know exactly
where<00:06:56.250> they're<00:06:56.400> at<00:06:56.520> but<00:06:57.120> we'll<00:06:57.270> just<00:06:57.450> draw

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
where they're at but we'll just draw

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.880 
where they're at but we'll just draw
some<00:06:57.870> lines<00:06:58.050> here<00:06:58.200> and<00:06:58.440> then<00:06:58.560> we'll<00:06:58.680> put<00:06:58.860> some

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
some lines here and then we'll put some

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.810 
some lines here and then we'll put some
screws<00:06:59.400> every<00:06:59.760> eight<00:07:00.300> inches<00:07:01.460> now<00:07:02.460> I'm<00:07:02.640> just

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
screws every eight inches now I'm just

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.370 
screws every eight inches now I'm just
going<00:07:03.000> to<00:07:03.060> take<00:07:03.300> it<00:07:03.330> on<00:07:03.570> the<00:07:03.750> measure<00:07:03.960> again

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
going to take it on the measure again

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.200 
going to take it on the measure again
and<00:07:04.410> I<00:07:04.740> know<00:07:04.800> I'm<00:07:05.070> still<00:07:05.370> at<00:07:05.460> the<00:07:05.490> 32<00:07:06.030> and<00:07:06.180> a

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
and I know I'm still at the 32 and a

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.550 
and I know I'm still at the 32 and a
quarter<00:07:06.540> because<00:07:06.780> I<00:07:06.870> measured<00:07:07.230> all<00:07:07.350> the<00:07:07.470> way

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
quarter because I measured all the way

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.320 
quarter because I measured all the way
up<00:07:07.680> to<00:07:07.830> the<00:07:07.950> ceiling<00:07:08.190> but<00:07:08.580> now<00:07:08.730> I<00:07:08.760> want<00:07:09.060> to<00:07:09.150> see

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
up to the ceiling but now I want to see

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.590 
up to the ceiling but now I want to see
what<00:07:10.320> this<00:07:10.500> is<00:07:10.860> and<00:07:11.790> we're<00:07:11.940> looking<00:07:12.240> at<00:07:12.360> about

what this is and we're looking at about
16<00:07:13.230> and<00:07:13.260> a<00:07:13.640> 3/4<00:07:14.640> of<00:07:14.670> an<00:07:14.820> inch<00:07:14.910> big<00:07:16.730> it's<00:07:17.730> the

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
16 and a 3/4 of an inch big it's the

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.700 
16 and a 3/4 of an inch big it's the
same<00:07:18.210> down<00:07:18.480> here<00:07:18.510> so<00:07:18.990> we're<00:07:19.110> pretty<00:07:19.260> level

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:19.710 
same down here so we're pretty level

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.060 
same down here so we're pretty level
well<00:07:20.670> 16<00:07:21.150> and<00:07:21.300> 3/4<00:07:21.750> of<00:07:21.780> an<00:07:21.960> inch<00:07:22.050> big<00:07:22.410> means<00:07:22.740> a

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070 
well 16 and 3/4 of an inch big means a

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.570 
well 16 and 3/4 of an inch big means a
sixteenth<00:07:23.580> over<00:07:24.560> 3/4<00:07:25.560> of<00:07:25.590> an<00:07:25.770> inch<00:07:25.860> it<00:07:26.160> can<00:07:26.340> be

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 
sixteenth over 3/4 of an inch it can be

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.850 
sixteenth over 3/4 of an inch it can be
a<00:07:26.820> half<00:07:27.360> inch<00:07:27.570> big<00:07:27.960> it<00:07:28.320> could<00:07:28.440> be<00:07:28.530> a<00:07:28.560> quarter

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
a half inch big it could be a quarter

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.190 
a half inch big it could be a quarter
inch<00:07:29.010> big<00:07:29.250> it's<00:07:29.460> just<00:07:29.730> a<00:07:29.880> sixteenth<00:07:30.630> over<00:07:31.020> and

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.200 
inch big it's just a sixteenth over and

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.670 
inch big it's just a sixteenth over and
then<00:07:31.650> it's<00:07:31.940> like<00:07:32.940> 3/4<00:07:33.540> inch<00:07:33.690> small<00:07:34.020> means<00:07:34.410> a

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
then it's like 3/4 inch small means a

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.090 
then it's like 3/4 inch small means a
sixteenth<00:07:35.250> of<00:07:35.400> an<00:07:35.520> inch<00:07:35.640> less<00:07:36.090> than<00:07:36.960> 3/4<00:07:37.890> of<00:07:37.920> an

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.100 
sixteenth of an inch less than 3/4 of an

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.560 
sixteenth of an inch less than 3/4 of an
inch<00:07:38.220> or<00:07:38.520> a<00:07:38.550> half-inch<00:07:39.000> whatever<00:07:39.390> you're

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.570 
inch or a half-inch whatever you're

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.040 
inch or a half-inch whatever you're
going<00:07:39.660> to<00:07:39.720> say<00:07:39.810> 16<00:07:40.500> and<00:07:40.680> a<00:07:40.740> quarter<00:07:40.920> small<00:07:41.340> or

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
going to say 16 and a quarter small or

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.250 
going to say 16 and a quarter small or
16<00:07:43.050> and<00:07:43.230> 3/4<00:07:43.710> small<00:07:44.990> whatever<00:07:45.990> it<00:07:46.110> would<00:07:46.200> be

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260 
16 and 3/4 small whatever it would be

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.120 
16 and 3/4 small whatever it would be
but<00:07:46.620> anyway<00:07:46.950> that's<00:07:47.130> just<00:07:47.310> some<00:07:47.610> trade<00:07:47.850> talk

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.130 
but anyway that's just some trade talk

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.000 
but anyway that's just some trade talk
so<00:07:50.130> we<00:07:50.280> need<00:07:50.430> 16<00:07:50.910> and<00:07:51.150> 3/4<00:07:51.630> big<00:07:51.900> for<00:07:52.620> an<00:07:52.680> exact

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.010 
so we need 16 and 3/4 big for an exact

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.100 
so we need 16 and 3/4 big for an exact
measurement<00:07:53.220> and<00:07:53.970> I<00:07:54.000> do<00:07:54.090> want<00:07:54.480> to<00:07:54.540> have<00:07:54.750> this

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.110 
measurement and I do want to have this

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.430 
measurement and I do want to have this
tight<00:07:55.440> somewhat<00:07:56.100> in<00:07:56.340> a<00:07:56.940> gap<00:07:57.180> up<00:07:57.450> there<00:07:57.780> so<00:07:58.410> I

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 
tight somewhat in a gap up there so I

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.380 
tight somewhat in a gap up there so I
can<00:07:58.530> fit<00:07:58.980> it<00:07:59.130> in<00:07:59.250> there<00:07:59.400> nicely<00:07:59.610> so<00:08:00.060> I'm<00:08:00.210> just

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.390 
can fit it in there nicely so I'm just

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:07.490 
can fit it in there nicely so I'm just
going<00:08:00.570> to<00:08:00.600> cut<00:08:00.870> this<00:08:01.230> at<00:08:01.800> 16<00:08:02.670> and<00:08:02.850> five-eighths

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.500 

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.500 

okay
