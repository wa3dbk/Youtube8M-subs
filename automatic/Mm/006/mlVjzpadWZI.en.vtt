00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.359
 attention this budget is simply 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.700
 My opinion there are 100 different and another 100 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.620
 variables comment with respect always 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.840
 is well received and throw a cable with 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.570
 that little hand up if you liked the video 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.440
 it's always a great reward and now 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.510
 well I wait late for the video bit or the 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.030
 girl roma si gm 2 what I bring you 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.730
 the new budget of 500 euros for 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:31.580
 start we start with the asus motherboard 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:34.780
 rog 980 of 33 s 3 voucher brings a pci slot 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:39.500
 Express 2.0 x16 for the graphics card 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.480
 3 pc and is 32 points 0 x 1 to put 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.890
 another kind of cards that we can use 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.690
 also the pc and of x 16 and 3 pc and four 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.880
 Slots for four memory modules 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.370
 ram ddr3 1888 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.070
 good as you can see socket am3 plus 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.180
 here the central audio and video already 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.430
 we have generated by the processor 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:07.010
 chosen an amd fx series fx 6.300 to 3.5 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.530
 gigahertz are 66 cores sorry 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.940
 physical as opposed to what intel uses 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.980
 ok but it is true that it is interesting that 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.240
 to greater performance with this we do not have 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.920
 problem nor will they be short 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.200
 current is that many people say it is not 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.570
 that I have a friend who has a f x8 and 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.490
 it's doing better than me nowadays 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.350
 operational states are prepared 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.800
 to get the performance that is 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.060
 Deserves 8 physical memory cores 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.869
 ram some shearing is ddr3 1600 ps3 a 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.520
 12,800 8 GB are two modules of four 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.970
 chairs each with a latency of 9 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.979
 ok it's ram memory ddr3 of the reader already 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.720
 you know for the steal most rhythm nothing that 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.490
 you are then of kids of 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.040
 cooling for the processor a 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.869
 color master hyper tx three cpu köhler 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.580
 köhler fan is worth this goes for 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.590
 reflect the processor in this 500 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.060
 days and that we only put so that it does not 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.190
 we warm up a lot since we know that 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.510
 Well, it's something warm, it's not 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.240
 it's a little 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.240
 I would like heating 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.910
 of power supply we will have the 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.730
 core 65 vsd 550 550 watts that would give us 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.440
 more than enough to move everything is 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.060
 ordered and enough energy from 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.970
 hard drive we will have a 6 that is for the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.030
 cure 7 thousand 200 points 12 of medium 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.530
 Terabytes up to 3 is worth convenient 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.150
 the one that we have more than enough in a 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.340
 future apply an SSD to see the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.610
 difference that there is the box we have chosen 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.250
 tx command once phoenix USB 3.0 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.010
 white voucher is a pretty pretty box 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.900
 quite cool too that are what 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.310
 that we care and a very detail 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.080
 important that you have this here that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.690
 is so that the source does not enter much 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.430
 powder is valid and finally the card 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.340
 graph that we have chosen a sapphire 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.870
 r7 of 160 x or be 2 gb of 5 is not that 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.370
 be one of the best graphic cards 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.900
 but this will allow us to play 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.700
 enough games quietly without 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.380
 no kind of problem the generation 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.030
 happening to the will surely move to ultra 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.970
 the present generation this one that we have 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.850
 now that everyone is fine and 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.030
 well rather it's the presence 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.750
 we can play high or 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.160
 medium-high 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.800
 even some applications we can 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.000
 stop ultra forgiving so good 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.830
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.300
 good hope forgiveness forgiveness Forgiveness 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.290
 total price of everything came before 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.470
 500 225 remember that the video is 12 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.890
 of 2 of 2014 you will surely see it on 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.600
 13 of 2 of 2014 you know what you 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.440
 have liked to give like favorites and until 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.440
 soon chao chao
