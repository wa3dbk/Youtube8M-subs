00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.540

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.340

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.180

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:27.440

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.400

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.150

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.160

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.590
 come god that have nothing within reach 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.030
 I do not give 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.020
 I think he took it from the back and from the back 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.020
 we go 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.440
 they are where they are 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.699
 I hate myself I stayed there four or five 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.180

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.869
 they were not 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.100

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.850

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.360

 we go 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:35.780
 and it's worth 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.780
 the position I have behind you 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.479

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.399

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.280
 from easily come no and I have to 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.069

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.030
 high or something 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:03:02.350

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.180

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.080
 pull this takes the rapid fire me 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.250

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.250
 pillan haiti or from behind 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.490
 How juice moves and stays without 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.490
 super fast ammo 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.220
 this is to kill 12 maximum to see us 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.220
 it seems that this does not play 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.670
 no not that there was not going to leave anything 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.620
 all right 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.140
 fuck is that this is uncontrollable 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.750
 over with silencer and with fire 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:04.610
 fast not fast fire can not carry 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.480
 and muffler and fire are not worth w 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.210
 I am 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.440
 I like it better not to fuck it wrong with what 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.630

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.140

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.140
 OK 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.160

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.390
 uy 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.390
 no this 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.229
 although it fell on him 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.530
 this is around here spinning and I do not 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.530
 I trust nothing 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.529
 do not 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.560
 go Go 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.280
 wow, let's go 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.080
 it is expandable what things go wrong to what 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.080
 things do not 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.310
 is that I did not know is that as he has 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.000
 bundled 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.180
 go Go 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.020
 he does not look uncle he can not follow half 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.570
 point to create it easy to see if 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.370
 they come out here at least it takes me to 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.090
 the time but that has gone crazy 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.090
 we are going to shoot 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.649
 but lighter I have to look 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.270
 come, gave 49, come on, come on, come on 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.810
 at 50 casualties I could have been bloated 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.660
 very much if you get to touch a good weapon 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.450
 and at the last minute and bring the points 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.610
 these for 4 I was pretty good at a 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.910
 rhythm and the incredible beginning but 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.770
 After this, I was already 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.970
 costing the life of killing someone who 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.880
 was going with the expandable scope is not 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.830
 pretty bad the franc over they put 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.350
 that looks that the audio does not I can not with 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.240
 she but good 50 casualties has been 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.390
 pretty cool a super low I think 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.920
 that has been with the shotgun there is like that 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.640
 that nothing I hope you liked and 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.640
 until next time
