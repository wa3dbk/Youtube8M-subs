00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.280 
through there's a lot of different types
of<00:01:56.040> wireless<00:01:56.280> routers<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.780> can't

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
of wireless routers out there so I can't

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.679 
of wireless routers out there so I can't
really<00:01:58.409> go<00:01:58.680> over<00:01:58.729> you<00:01:59.729> know<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.030> specifics<00:02:00.570> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
really go over you know the specifics of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.719 
really go over you know the specifics of
each<00:02:00.930> type<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> manufacturing<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.670> know

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
each type of manufacturing you know

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.780 
each type of manufacturing you know
there's<00:02:02.939> d-link<00:02:03.390> there's<00:02:03.750> linksys<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
there's d-link there's linksys so on and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.040 
there's d-link there's linksys so on and
so<00:02:05.820> forth<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:07.759> basics<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> fix<00:02:09.750> is

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so forth the basics of the fix is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.640 
so forth the basics of the fix is
however<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:12.330> when<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.200> upgrade

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
however the when you upgrade

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.619 
however the when you upgrade

seems to be the network that people have

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.490 
seems to be the network that people have
the<00:02:20.430> most<00:02:20.579> problems<00:02:20.819> with<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.689> I<00:02:22.200> asked<00:02:22.470> a

available and see if you can't get on
well<00:02:36.450> ironically<00:02:36.750> they<00:02:37.230> would<00:02:37.379> go<00:02:37.560> there<00:02:37.769> and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
well ironically they would go there and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.399 
well ironically they would go there and
boom<00:02:38.579> they<00:02:38.879> would<00:02:39.000> instantly<00:02:39.510> connect<00:02:40.019> to

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
boom they would instantly connect to

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.559 
boom they would instantly connect to
that<00:02:40.530> Network<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.519> then<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.239> would<00:02:42.359> come

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
that Network so then they would come

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.660 
that Network so then they would come
back<00:02:42.750> then<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.739> would<00:02:43.890> kind<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.159> help<00:02:44.280> them<00:02:44.519> go

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
back then I would kind of help them go

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.819 
back then I would kind of help them go
through<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.000> process<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.680> resetting<00:02:46.680> their
