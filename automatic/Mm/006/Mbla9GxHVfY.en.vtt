00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
but junglers are a lot less likely to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
levels in this example if you were to

and<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.439> final<00:01:48.799> example<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.220> when<00:01:49.369> I<00:01:49.400> most

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
and the final example of when I most

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.190 
and the final example of when I most
commonly<00:01:49.790> use<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.270> trick<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.750> when<00:01:50.960> my<00:01:51.049> own

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
commonly use this trick is when my own

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.230 
commonly use this trick is when my own
jungler<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.710> coming<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.040> visit<00:01:52.100> my<00:01:52.430> lane<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.090> if

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
jungler is coming to visit my lane so if

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.820 
jungler is coming to visit my lane so if
we<00:01:53.390> again<00:01:53.689> use<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.990> concept<00:01:54.409> of<00:01:54.530> playing<00:01:54.710> a

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
we again use the concept of playing a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.230 
we again use the concept of playing a
melee<00:01:55.009> hero<00:01:55.340> against<00:01:55.729> Teemo

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
melee hero against Teemo

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.850 
melee hero against Teemo
there<00:01:56.479> was<00:01:56.570> extra<00:01:56.720> 5<00:01:56.990> seconds<00:01:57.439> where<00:01:57.560> team<00:01:57.770> a

he has to overextend

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.490 
he has to overextend
this<00:02:02.420> means<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:02.869> there<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.140> bigger<00:02:03.409> chance

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
this means that there is a bigger chance
