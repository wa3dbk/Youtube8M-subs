00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
how come had gone from brewing

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.160 
how come had gone from brewing
five-gallon<00:03:26.860> compras<00:03:27.490> to<00:03:27.730> now<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:27.940> put<00:03:28.240> now

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
five-gallon compras to now you put now

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.890 
five-gallon compras to now you put now
about<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:29.800> thousand<00:03:30.220> gallons<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.640> batch<00:03:30.819> so<00:03:31.660> how

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
about a thousand gallons a batch so how

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.580 
about a thousand gallons a batch so how
was<00:03:32.020> that<00:03:32.280> concept

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
was that concept

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.440 
was that concept
there's<00:03:35.220> definitely<00:03:35.640> been<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.910> bit<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.360> a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
there's definitely been a bit of a

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.030 
there's definitely been a bit of a
learning<00:03:36.599> curve<00:03:36.840> there's<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.800> little<00:03:37.920> bit

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
learning curve there's a little bit

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.650 
learning curve there's a little bit
different<00:03:38.340> dynamics<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.090> doing<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.450> large

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
different dynamics and doing a large

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.420 
different dynamics and doing a large
batch<00:03:39.959> compare<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.709> small<00:03:41.010> batch<00:03:41.190> the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
batch compare it to a small batch the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.479 
batch compare it to a small batch the
process<00:03:41.819> remains<00:03:42.180> almost<00:03:42.390> unchanged<00:03:43.489> it's

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
process remains almost unchanged it's

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.650 
process remains almost unchanged it's
even<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.730> little<00:03:44.819> bit<00:03:44.910> easier<00:03:45.090> because<00:03:45.390> now<00:03:45.599> we

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
even a little bit easier because now we

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780 
even a little bit easier because now we
have<00:03:45.750> some<00:03:46.019> nice<00:03:46.170> new<00:03:46.379> toys<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.590> play<00:03:46.769> with<00:03:46.950> but

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
have some nice new toys to play with but

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.809 
have some nice new toys to play with but
it's<00:03:48.360> definitely<00:03:49.340> been<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.370> little<00:03:50.459> bit<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.700> a

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
it's definitely been a little bit of a

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.369 
it's definitely been a little bit of a
learning<00:03:50.940> curve<00:03:51.150> learning<00:03:51.629> the<00:03:51.750> system<00:03:51.930> kind

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
learning curve learning the system kind

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.690 
learning curve learning the system kind
of<00:03:52.500> getting<00:03:52.680> everything<00:03:52.980> down<00:03:53.310> from<00:03:53.610> a
