00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:12.760
 So I show 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:19.220
 once again a transformer but in another 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:21.080
 his condition I reduced his power 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.390
 in order to still 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.960
 to focus on one simple 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.960
 process 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:36.519
 so what we have we have power supply 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.519
 connected to bypass transformer 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.039
 Multimeter small shows 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:47.089
 voltage entering the transformer 2 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.399
 multimeter shows voltage on 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.350
 exit 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.620
 this multimeter shows us the current on 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.620
 exit 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 So 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:12.100
 his power at the sword and on specifically to 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:14.620
 everyone has seen how it works including 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.620
 turned on 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
 So 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:35.650
 let's put on here now on 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.650
 just in case 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.360
 so I will increase the voltage 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.390
 let's see how the current pride behaves 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.920
 voltage increase 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.570
 so light bulb have this multimeter 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.150
 this is where the current is taken 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:07.620
 it is connected in series to the lamp 220 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:07.620
 volt 60 watts here it is 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.260
 I do not know whether it is visible or not 220 volts 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:27.129
 60 watts so well let's start serving 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.129
 voltage 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:48.590
 and 10 amps were many first from scratch 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.590
 so from zero to two voltage 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.760
 so it is clear that the light comes on 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.760
 interesting 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.930
 and large transformer vibrato 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.960
 that is, your sage voltage rises 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.960
 it rises here too 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:43.440
 so now now I will do the following 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:49.620
 video for you where a little bit increase it 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.150
 power for you to see it 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.050
 there will be an average power between this 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.310
 power and power which was previously 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.570
 make the average power and we'll see 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:04.910
 how will the current lead try 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:09.390
 make today or tomorrow post a video 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:15.230
 the connection you saw a light bulb 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:21.090
 connected in series and 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:25.220
 consistently measured current total 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.220
 goodbye to the next meetings
