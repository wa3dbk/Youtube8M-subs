second role to steer the board it's made
up<00:00:43.219> of<00:00:43.340> two<00:00:43.399> major<00:00:44.030> parts<00:00:44.570> one<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.379> base

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
up of two major parts one is the base

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.620 
up of two major parts one is the base
plate<00:00:45.920> which<00:00:46.190> we<00:00:46.340> are<00:00:46.489> right<00:00:46.700> here<00:00:46.730> this<00:00:47.480> is

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
plate which we are right here this is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.590 
plate which we are right here this is
the<00:00:47.690> part<00:00:47.930> that<00:00:47.990> amount<00:00:48.760> on<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:50.000> board<00:00:50.240> itself

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
the part that amount on the board itself

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.360 
the part that amount on the board itself
then<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.140> elements<00:00:51.530> what's<00:00:51.680> called<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.980> hanger

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
then the elements what's called a hanger

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.310 
then the elements what's called a hanger
and<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:53.150> hanger<00:00:53.480> will<00:00:53.690> mount<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.020> wheels

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
and the hanger will mount the wheels

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.400 
and the hanger will mount the wheels
that<00:00:55.010> wheel<00:00:55.520> at<00:00:55.730> each<00:00:55.850> end<00:00:56.120> where<00:00:56.780> our<00:00:56.960> trucks

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
that wheel at each end where our trucks

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.260 
that wheel at each end where our trucks
are<00:00:58.040> made<00:00:58.400> in<00:00:58.790> two<00:00:59.390> processes<00:01:00.079> one<00:01:00.920> is<00:01:01.760> the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
are made in two processes one is the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.319 
are made in two processes one is the
sand<00:01:02.989> cast<00:01:03.290> process<00:01:03.950> then<00:01:04.489> we<00:01:04.670> also<00:01:04.820> make

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
sand cast process then we also make

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.260 
sand cast process then we also make
trucks<00:01:06.140> out<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.649> permanent<00:01:07.009> system<00:01:07.490> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
trucks out of a permanent system the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.679 
trucks out of a permanent system the
permanent<00:01:08.720> system<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.530> steel<00:01:10.310> mode<00:01:10.700> where

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
permanent system is a steel mode where

addition is closed it has a cycle time

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.629 
addition is closed it has a cycle time
is<00:02:04.219> which<00:02:04.429> is<00:02:04.579> approximately<00:02:05.270> two<00:02:05.990> minutes

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:06.639 
is which is approximately two minutes

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:10.600 
is which is approximately two minutes
during<00:02:07.639> the<00:02:07.759> cycle<00:02:08.090> time<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:09.080> metal<00:02:09.610> hardens

during the cycle time the metal hardens

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.770 
during the cycle time the metal hardens
and<00:02:10.849> then<00:02:11.540> were<00:02:12.440> able<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.830> open<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:14.240> most

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
and then were able to open it the most

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.490 
and then were able to open it the most
and<00:02:15.730> pull<00:02:16.730> out<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.569> parts<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.050> parts<00:02:18.349> come

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and pull out the parts the parts come

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.740 
and pull out the parts the parts come
out<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:18.800> what's<00:02:18.980> called<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.459> tree<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:20.510> take

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
out in what's called a tree so we take

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.500 
out in what's called a tree so we take
the<00:02:20.900> tree<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.440> then<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:22.700> place<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.239> into<00:02:23.360> a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the tree and then we place it into a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.910 
the tree and then we place it into a
cool

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
cool

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.400 
cool
area<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.550> wait<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.420> metal<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.140> fully

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
area and wait for the metal to fully

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.160 
area and wait for the metal to fully
Harden<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:27.209> then<00:02:28.209> were<00:02:28.390> able<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.630> handle<00:02:29.050> it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
Harden and then were able to handle it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.410 
Harden and then were able to handle it
again<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.680> cut<00:02:30.040> each<00:02:30.280> individual<00:02:30.940> quart<00:02:31.180> off

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
again and cut each individual quart off

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.339 
again and cut each individual quart off
at<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.170> time<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:33.010> aluminum<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.640> at<00:02:34.120> a

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
at this time the aluminum is at a

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.500 
at this time the aluminum is at a
semi-soft<00:02:35.349> state<00:02:35.739> where<00:02:36.610> we<00:02:36.730> need<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:36.940> harden

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
semi-soft state where we need to harden

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.040 
semi-soft state where we need to harden
the<00:02:37.630> metal<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.920> what<00:02:39.099> we<00:02:39.190> do<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.430> we<00:02:39.870> send<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.020> to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
the metal so what we do is we send it to

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
part of the design process is the input

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.940 
part of the design process is the input
that<00:03:26.380> we<00:03:26.530> get<00:03:26.799> from<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:28.269> actual<00:03:28.600> riders<00:03:29.049> we

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
that we get from the actual riders we

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.490 
that we get from the actual riders we
can't<00:03:30.220> design<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.730> skateboard<00:03:31.299> truck<00:03:31.570> by<00:03:32.170> what

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
can't design a skateboard truck by what

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.370 
can't design a skateboard truck by what
I<00:03:32.769> feel<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.579> an<00:03:33.730> improvement<00:03:34.150> without<00:03:34.810> having

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
I feel is an improvement without having

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.770 
I feel is an improvement without having
their<00:03:35.530> input<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:36.220> ultimate<00:03:36.850> test<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.329> what

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
their input the ultimate test is what

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.680 
their input the ultimate test is what
the<00:03:37.930> skateboarders<00:03:38.500> say<00:03:39.310> about<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.730> sometimes

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
the skateboarders say about it sometimes

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.050 
the skateboarders say about it sometimes
they<00:03:41.500> will<00:03:41.680> come<00:03:41.859> up<00:03:41.890> with<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.250> idea<00:03:42.579> saying

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
they will come up with the idea saying

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.690 
they will come up with the idea saying
this<00:03:43.540> should<00:03:43.750> be<00:03:43.870> changed<00:03:44.320> because<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:45.519> will

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
this should be changed because it will

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.270 
this should be changed because it will
improve<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.989> performance<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.859> school<00:03:48.070> or

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
improve the performance of the school or

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.210 
improve the performance of the school or
truck<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:48.910> it's<00:03:49.510> really<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.620> comes<00:03:50.829> from<00:03:51.130> the

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
truck so it's really it comes from the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.880 
truck so it's really it comes from the
skateboarders<00:03:51.850> more<00:03:52.239> than<00:03:52.420> from<00:03:52.680> us<00:03:53.680> as

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
skateboarders more than from us as

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.340 
skateboarders more than from us as
manufacturers
