00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.510 
look at the battle details oh I thought
it<00:07:14.410> would<00:07:14.500> say<00:07:14.650> how<00:07:14.740> many<00:07:14.800> men<00:07:15.009> they<00:07:15.130> lost<00:07:15.370> I

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 
it would say how many men they lost I

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.650 
it would say how many men they lost I
think<00:07:15.550> he<00:07:15.789> had<00:07:15.880> like<00:07:16.110> 318<00:07:17.110> out<00:07:17.320> 335<00:07:18.250> crude<00:07:19.240> so

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:19.660 
think he had like 318 out 335 crude so

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.760 
think he had like 318 out 335 crude so
yeah<00:07:20.349> very<00:07:20.650> ineffective<00:07:21.780> this<00:07:22.780> is<00:07:22.960> like<00:07:23.349> one

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
yeah very ineffective this is like one

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.379 
yeah very ineffective this is like one
of<00:07:23.860> the<00:07:23.949> earliest<00:07:24.370> navies<00:07:24.849> you<00:07:24.970> can<00:07:25.150> construct

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:25.389 
of the earliest navies you can construct

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:27.120 
of the earliest navies you can construct
so<00:07:25.750> maybe<00:07:25.960> you<00:07:26.080> get<00:07:26.229> some<00:07:26.289> like<00:07:26.560> fire<00:07:26.800> ships

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
so maybe you get some like fire ships

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.589 
so maybe you get some like fire ships
later<00:07:27.340> I<00:07:27.490> don't<00:07:27.639> know<00:07:27.849> I<00:07:27.880> don't<00:07:28.150> actually<00:07:28.300> play

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 
later I don't know I don't actually play

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:31.170 
later I don't know I don't actually play
the<00:07:28.720> game<00:07:28.900> all<00:07:29.050> that<00:07:29.169> much<00:07:29.320> but<00:07:29.620> uh<00:07:29.970> yep
