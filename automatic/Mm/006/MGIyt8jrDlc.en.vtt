00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.220
 when using RAM 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.129
 often pose the task of improving it 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.750
 Kalinin characteristics 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.390
 boost post speed 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.600
 that is, increase the limit so 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.119
 get the status that you can 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.070
 record information fall and 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.050
 read information to sleep 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.970
 the most common is not 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.579
 the easiest solution to increase 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.469
 memory speed is 

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.759
 applying a shift to a register 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.809
 increase in speed 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.559
 memory is achieved by shifts 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.270
 the registers are very simple 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.850
 decrease several times 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.480
 tire dimensions 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.850
 in memory allows the same amount of time 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.520
 increase the frequency 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.570
 information recording downturn 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.410
 or reading information and st 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.760
 eg 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.980
 if nessesary 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.150
 increase the frequency of general information from 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.890
 of memory 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.000
 then you need to sit the right amount of chips 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.970
 memory to increase times to achieve 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.510
 data eight times 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.530
 and then 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.600
 apply on exits 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.659
 eight-digit smoln system 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.790
 bytes 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.690
 thanks for the last year we read from memory 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.490
 written in shift register then 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.100
 here plays are retinue times clean 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.430
 eight times more than cleanliness 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.460
 of questions 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.119
 and cost zik produced one 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.160
 signal stage with generator 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.509
 clock trial 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.780
 report 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.410
 humble calculations 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.620
 to manage workers by working 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.620
 shift register applied 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.370
 future positive 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.460
 impulses during the first 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.490
 one eighth is so easy for him 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.249
 this signal is used as 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.010
 up to 4 pp 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.300
 with his western front he connects 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.590
 to address 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.540
 if necessary 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.640
 increase the frequency of recording pandas one 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.710
 shift register 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.870
 not enough 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.150
 the fact 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.640
 what information memory to write 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 not on the front signal to levels that is 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.009
 on information dollars 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.470
 stored at the entrance to the bank certain 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.129
 time 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.409
 poet 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.419
 here are your moves to say here is necessary 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:16.779
 overwriting memory 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.919
 rewrite box 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.909
 where it will be kept stored 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.239
 during the whole period sargsyan 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.310
 presented schemes accelerate 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.079
 clean recording sleep four times 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.549
 in this case as a tourist 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.459
 it is convenient to use the run 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.459
 parallel register itself get baku 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.010
 The three discharges of pork itself are the inputs of the following 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.009
 sizes 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.619
 from vietnam eight-bit 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:46.939
 rivers country gets 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.069
 escaping squad Transnistria 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.459
 two squads one information 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.409
 recorded in these 2 4 percent 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.519
 and articles per share 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.679
 write off with hardware 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.679
 and only then that as recognized 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.469
 I want to 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.269
 clock generator applied up to two times 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.449
 in a row something else on two jacks 3 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.429
 included counts solve 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.049
 allowing several 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.859
 improve performance by 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.549
 compared to the start 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.289
 IC Chips 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.789
 always you this race track thriller 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:23.599
 writes information to 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.129
 parallel register 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.019
 and 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.779
 used as a sling 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:30.329
 write memory 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.659
 big lack of RAM 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:33.769
 will be 100 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.730
 what's the information recorded in the world 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.730
 disappears attracting source 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.149
 often using additional 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.350
 power supplies which 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.310
 and then when connected 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.890
 power supply only 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.589
 microcircuits 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:52.429
 the result is 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:54.699
 called energy independent 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.639
 operational 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.449
 content that can easily 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.209
 recorded but not lost when 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.709
 power off 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.509
 to after
