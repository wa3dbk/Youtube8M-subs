best we print out of both these tens I
was<00:00:44.070> more<00:00:44.280> excited<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:44.820> maybe<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.149> quasar

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
maybe a emergency teleport reprint but

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
maybe a emergency teleport reprint but

that<00:01:36.810> card<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:38.070> was<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> jump<00:01:38.759> card<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that card was it was a jump card so a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.190 
that card was it was a jump card so a
little<00:01:39.240> bit<00:01:39.390> difficult<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.049> i<00:01:40.079> think

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
little bit difficult to get so i think

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.130 
little bit difficult to get so i think
that<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.740> fantastic<00:01:41.659> reprint<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.960> like

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that is that fantastic reprint but like

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.020 
that is that fantastic reprint but like
i<00:01:43.170> said<00:01:43.259> i<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.649> quasar<00:01:44.189> or<00:01:44.460> something<00:01:44.939> like

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
i said i think quasar or something like

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.010 
i said i think quasar or something like
ever<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.450> teleport<00:01:45.720> would<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.899> been<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
ever just teleport would have been a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.410 
ever just teleport would have been a
cool<00:01:46.409> reprint<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:46.890> well<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:48.090> far<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.299> value

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
cool reprint as well but as far as value

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.999 
cool reprint as well but as far as value
i<00:01:48.720> think<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> tempest<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.710> i<00:01:49.770> said<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
i think the tempest in like i said is

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.249 
i think the tempest in like i said is

some ability to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.270 
some ability to
however<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.870> feel<00:02:14.320> like<00:02:14.440> van<00:02:14.650> Dee's<00:02:14.830> emptiness

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
however I feel like van Dee's emptiness

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280 
however I feel like van Dee's emptiness
is<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.700> more<00:02:16.390> versatile<00:02:16.840> card<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.170> mean

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
is just a more versatile card I mean

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.390 
is just a more versatile card I mean

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
obviously you can use that in like

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.430 
obviously you can use that in like
multiple<00:02:18.850> decks<00:02:19.200> obviously<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.260> great

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
multiple decks obviously in great

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.540 
multiple decks obviously in great
Cooper's<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.710> don't<00:02:20.860> spell<00:02:21.040> some<00:02:21.220> too<00:02:21.400> much

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
Cooper's you don't spell some too much

mediocre<00:02:24.970> what<00:02:25.690> really<00:02:25.810> comes<00:02:25.990> down<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.650> I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
mediocre what really comes down to is I

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.710 
mediocre what really comes down to is I
like<00:02:27.160> vanities<00:02:27.670> emptiness<00:02:28.000> because<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:28.300> the

emptiness<00:02:46.660> obviously<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.200> still<00:02:47.290> has<00:02:47.530> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
emptiness obviously it still has the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.500 
emptiness obviously it still has the
same<00:02:47.770> downside<00:02:48.220> but<00:02:48.730> because<00:02:49.030> it's<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.240> frog

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
same downside but because it's a frog

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.570 
same downside but because it's a frog
right<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.110> chainable<00:02:50.680> but<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.430> know<00:02:51.520> you

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
right it is chainable but you know you

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.010 
right it is chainable but you know you
can<00:02:51.760> argue<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.450> card<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.720> good<00:02:52.840> because

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
can argue that this card is good because

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.180 
can argue that this card is good because
then<00:02:53.170> they<00:02:53.230> can't<00:02:53.410> drop<00:02:53.560> glowers<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.010> can't

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
then they can't drop glowers you can't

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.290 
then they can't drop glowers you can't
grow<00:02:54.280> up<00:02:54.340> trigo<00:02:54.610> do<00:02:54.760> or<00:02:54.880> something<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.210> that

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
grow up trigo do or something like that

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.600 
grow up trigo do or something like that
so<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.560> argue<00:02:56.770> both<00:02:57.010> ways<00:02:57.250> but<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.520> way<00:02:57.580> I

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
so you can argue both ways but the way I

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.310 
so you can argue both ways but the way I
look<00:02:57.790> at<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:57.940> not<00:02:58.330> being<00:02:58.480> able<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.690> drop<00:02:58.840> go

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
look at it not being able to drop go

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.470 
look at it not being able to drop go
over<00:02:59.470> godia<00:02:59.920> battle<00:03:00.370> fader<00:03:00.580> or<00:03:00.940> like<00:03:01.180> sue<00:03:01.300> ser

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
over godia battle fader or like sue ser

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.450 
over godia battle fader or like sue ser

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
crow I agree oh well you can still drop

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.710 
crow I agree oh well you can still drop

event<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.160> finesse<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.550> much<00:03:09.700> better<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
event and finesse is much better in the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.910 
event and finesse is much better in the
aspect<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.660> can<00:03:10.780> chain<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.350> like<00:03:11.770> if

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
aspect that you can chain to it like if

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.850 
aspect that you can chain to it like if
they<00:03:12.010> activate<00:03:12.370> something<00:03:13.380> like<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.410> Miss<00:03:14.650> may
