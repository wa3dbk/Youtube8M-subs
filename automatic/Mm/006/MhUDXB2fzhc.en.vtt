about something a little bit different

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.430 
about something a little bit different
usually<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.670> has<00:00:11.820> two<00:00:12.030> focuses<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.719> physical

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
usually it has two focuses on physical

today<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.320> want<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> talk<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.100> about<00:00:17.160> brain

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
today I want to talk to you about brain

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.790 
today I want to talk to you about brain
training<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.440> something<00:00:19.770> that

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
training so this is something that

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.950 
training so this is something that
Claudia<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.550> think<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.939> lot<00:00:21.179> about<00:00:21.449> because

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
Claudia and I think a lot about because

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.839 
Claudia and I think a lot about because
we<00:00:22.169> have<00:00:22.289> loved<00:00:22.560> ones<00:00:22.890> who've<00:00:23.160> suffered<00:00:23.400> from

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
we have loved ones who've suffered from

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.820 
we have loved ones who've suffered from
Alzheimer's<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.839> other<00:00:25.169> neurodegenerative

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.999 
Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative
diseases<00:00:26.699> now<00:00:27.599> brain<00:00:27.990> training<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.859> help

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
diseases now brain training can help

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.279 
diseases now brain training can help
slow<00:00:29.249> cognitive<00:00:30.089> decline<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.779> overall<00:00:31.259> just

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
slow cognitive decline and overall just

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
slow cognitive decline and overall just
help<00:00:31.890> keep<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.189> shut<00:00:32.490> so<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.300> definitely

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
help keep you shut so it's definitely

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.360 
help keep you shut so it's definitely
something<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.110> recommend<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.950> people<00:00:35.310> of

all ages so we really want to encourage
you<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.390> start<00:00:39.570> thinking<00:00:39.750> about<00:00:39.990> brain

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you to start thinking about brain

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.980 
you to start thinking about brain
training<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.400> same<00:00:41.640> way<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.450> your

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
training the same way you do as your

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.140 
training the same way you do as your
physical<00:00:43.470> training<00:00:43.830> your<00:00:44.430> brain<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.910> just

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
physical training your brain is just

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.180 
physical training your brain is just
like<00:00:45.270> any<00:00:45.480> other<00:00:45.690> muscle<00:00:45.990> the<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.830> you<00:00:46.980> use

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
like any other muscle the more you use

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.860 
like any other muscle the more you use
it<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.580> you<00:00:47.760> use<00:00:47.970> certain<00:00:48.240> functions

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
it the more you use certain functions

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.430 
it the more you use certain functions
the<00:00:49.320> stronger<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:51.170> now<00:00:52.170> there<00:00:52.320> are<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the stronger they get now there are a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.780 
the stronger they get now there are a
few<00:00:52.500> different<00:00:52.890> ways<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.220> there<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.550> train

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
few different ways out there to train

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.280 
few different ways out there to train
your<00:00:53.940> brain<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.630> a<00:00:54.690> couple<00:00:54.900> of<00:00:55.020> different

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
your brain and a couple of different

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.290 
your brain and a couple of different
apps<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> share<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.150> you

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
apps but I want to share one with you

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.180 
apps but I want to share one with you
that<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.930> found<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.470> both<00:00:58.620> really<00:00:58.980> like

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
that we found that we both really like

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.410 
that we found that we both really like
but<00:00:59.400> we've<00:00:59.520> been<00:00:59.670> using<00:00:59.700> I<00:01:00.210> don't<00:01:00.360> know

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
but we've been using I don't know

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.210 
but we've been using I don't know
anywhere<00:01:00.720> between<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.020> 10<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> 20<00:01:01.830> minutes<00:01:02.130> a

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
anywhere between like 10 to 20 minutes a

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.100 
anywhere between like 10 to 20 minutes a
day<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.670> mean<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.060> cool<00:01:03.300> thing<00:01:03.540> about<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.960> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
day I mean the cool thing about it is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.420 
day I mean the cool thing about it is
it's<00:01:04.500> something<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it's something that you can just kind of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.859 
it's something that you can just kind of
do<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:05.909> you're<00:01:06.030> sitting<00:01:06.330> around<00:01:06.390> your<00:01:06.659> phone

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
do when you're sitting around your phone

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.690 
do when you're sitting around your phone
maybe<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:07.650> some<00:01:08.070> time<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.520> kill

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
maybe you have some some time to kill

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
maybe you have some some time to kill
that<00:01:08.939> maybe<00:01:09.119> you'd<00:01:09.270> normally<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.869> wasting

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that maybe you'd normally be wasting

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
that maybe you'd normally be wasting
away<00:01:10.859> on<00:01:11.130> Facebook<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.299> half<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.689> called

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
away on Facebook so the half is called

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.789 
away on Facebook so the half is called
tidepool<00:01:14.390> it's<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.539> secret<00:01:15.929> agent<00:01:16.259> style<00:01:16.469> game

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
tidepool it's a secret agent style game

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.300 
tidepool it's a secret agent style game
that's<00:01:17.280> designed<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.909> work<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.299> five<00:01:18.539> core

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
that's designed to work your five core

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.410 
that's designed to work your five core
cognitive<00:01:20.310> functions<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:20.999> you<00:01:21.090> should<00:01:21.240> look

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
cognitive functions so you should look

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.239 
cognitive functions so you should look
at<00:01:21.569> them<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.289> would<00:01:22.319> you<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:23.039> like

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
at them just as you would you know like

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.950 
at them just as you would you know like
you're<00:01:23.429> like<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.060> five<00:01:24.329> core<00:01:24.719> body

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you're like if you have five core body

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.899 
you're like if you have five core body
parts<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.499> they<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.799> need<00:01:26.069> to<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.310> trained<00:01:26.609> and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
parts so they all need to be trained and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.849 
parts so they all need to be trained and
they<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.149> kind<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.079> work<00:01:28.140> together<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.770> they

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
they all kind of work together but they

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.550 
they all kind of work together but they
also<00:01:28.890> work<00:01:29.130> separately<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.420> their<00:01:30.600> memory

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
also work separately so their memory

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.160 
also work separately so their memory
focus<00:01:32.399> speed<00:01:33.289> adaptability<00:01:34.289> and<00:01:34.679> a<00:01:35.009> reason

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
focus speed adaptability and a reason

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.840 
focus speed adaptability and a reason
these<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.469> fundamental<00:01:38.249> cognitive

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
these are the fundamental cognitive

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.929 
these are the fundamental cognitive
building<00:01:39.240> blocks<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> gameplay

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
building blocks and the gameplay

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.760 
building blocks and the gameplay
specifically<00:01:41.939> targets<00:01:42.420> each<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:43.109> of<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
specifically targets each one of the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.859 
specifically targets each one of the
five<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.789> a<00:01:44.819> neuroscientist<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
five so they have a neuroscientist that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.809
