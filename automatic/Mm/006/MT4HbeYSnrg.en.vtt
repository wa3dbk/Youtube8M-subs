00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.030
 this video game of the year 2008 is based on the movie of the same name 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.080
 published by sega and available for xbox 360 and this one is two 3 and portable 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.080
 nintendo ds wii pc 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.600
 but numan the video game basically tries to protect the weapons created 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.350
 by Tony Stark and destroy those that are in the wrong hands as well as others created to 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.000
 from your technology 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.600
 the game is full of action challenges and many explosions although it leaves 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.900
 much to be desired 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.890
 the graphs are regular 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.200
 It could be said that the superhero's plagiarism armor looks bad 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.190
 since it is not very prominent 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.370
 strange aspect since the concept of a superhero with an armor of 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.370
 Advanced technology offers for much more 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.280
 the gameplay may be difficult at first but already getting into the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.090
 game does not give many problems since what he uses the most will be the resource 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.580
 you can redirect the energy of the suit to the propulsion the armor or the weapon 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.210
 that is being the network resource this for when the energy is going down in 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.910
 one of these three aspects or if you simply want them to be more 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.280
 effective 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.570
 Throughout the game you will be able to unlock new improvements either for 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.350
 the resource rumbles explosively your armor also as you go forward 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.409
 appearing different models of the superhero's armor 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.369
 the story of the game is similar to the movie consists of 13 missions that do not 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.399
 last a long time 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.439
 in general it does not offer many hours of play but in the end you can complete 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.259
 any mission as many times as you want with different armor and improvements 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.120
 the sounds of explosions and shots are not very good to say 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.170
 but as for music, it proposes an atmosphere of tension and heroism to the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.639
 time to face the enemy forces 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.749
 although sometimes you will not notice it since you will spend it exploding weapons and 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.199
 combat vehicles which can make the game repetitive 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.439
 in conclusion on a scale of 1 to 10 I give the game a 6 points 5 and 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.009
 I recommend only to people who are a fan of this superhero and who 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.159
 they liked the movies
