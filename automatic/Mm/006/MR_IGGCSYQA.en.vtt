this is the Jedi first blade and he
asked<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.350> area<00:00:43.590> modified<00:00:44.129> as

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
asked to have this area modified as

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.520 
asked to have this area modified as
opposed<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> two<00:00:45.600> little<00:00:45.840> bars<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
opposed to the two little bars on the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
opposed to the two little bars on the
side<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.789> wanted<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> go<00:00:48.210> ahead<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.480> just

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
side if you wanted to go ahead and just

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200 
side if you wanted to go ahead and just
wrap<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.260> whole<00:00:49.440> section<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.910> make<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
wrap the whole section to make it a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.020 
wrap the whole section to make it a
little<00:00:51.329> less<00:00:51.510> dinner<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:53.399> that's<00:00:53.730> basically

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
little less dinner and that's basically

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.670 
little less dinner and that's basically
it<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> sound<00:00:55.469> which<00:00:57.680> when

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it and then we have the sound which when

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.709 
it and then we have the sound which when
you<00:00:58.770> tap<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.190> will<00:00:59.340> turn<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.090> he<00:01:00.420> asked

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you tap it will turn it on and he asked

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.630 
you tap it will turn it on and he asked
to<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.079> rewired<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.219> way<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
to have it rewired so that way it's a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.370 
to have it rewired so that way it's a
green<00:01:02.940> LED<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.750> notice<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> neutrino<00:01:10.320> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
green LED and notice how the neutrino is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.440 
green LED and notice how the neutrino is
a<00:01:10.470> pretty<00:01:10.740> good<00:01:11.010> bored<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.729> pretty

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
a pretty good bored it's pretty

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
a pretty good bored it's pretty
inexpensive<00:01:13.110> compared<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> most<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.920> them<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
inexpensive compared to most of them and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
inexpensive compared to most of them and
it's<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> game<00:01:15.990> with

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it's going to get you in the game with

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.359 
it's going to get you in the game with
sound<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:17.520> saber<00:01:20.540> now<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> access<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
sound and your saber now to access or to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.499 
sound and your saber now to access or to
turn<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.610> off<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:23.880> hold<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> button

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
turn it off you just hold the button

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.999 
turn it off you just hold the button
down<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.970> can't<00:01:27.330> accidentally<00:01:28.259> tap<00:01:28.829> it

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
down so you can't accidentally tap it

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.800 
down so you can't accidentally tap it
and<00:01:29.159> turn<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.430> off<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.420> there's<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> lot<00:01:30.780> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and turn it off I know there's a lot of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
and turn it off I know there's a lot of
people<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.290> who<00:01:31.470> think<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
people out there who think you know you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.399 
people out there who think you know you
just<00:01:33.060> tap<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.360> save<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.900> it'll<00:01:34.079> turn<00:01:34.229> off

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
just tap your save and it'll turn off

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.020 
just tap your save and it'll turn off
that's<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> case<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> hold<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
that's not the case you have to hold it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.749 
that's not the case you have to hold it
down<00:01:37.100> now<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> access<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.890> electronics<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
down now to access the electronics to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.100 
down now to access the electronics to
get<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.090> recharge<00:01:42.450> poor<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> has

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
get to the recharge poor because it has

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.080 
get to the recharge poor because it has

point<00:01:59.939> where<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.360> starts<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> slide<00:02:00.930> out<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
point where it starts to slide out and

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.240 
point where it starts to slide out and
it's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> basic<00:02:02.969> electronics<00:02:03.479> setup<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.799> i<00:02:04.829> did

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it's a basic electronics setup but i did

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.690 
it's a basic electronics setup but i did
add<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:06.619> plastic<00:02:07.619> shroud<00:02:07.860> around<00:02:08.129> all<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
add a plastic shroud around all the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.130 
add a plastic shroud around all the
electronics<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.509> way<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.720> doesn't<00:02:09.899> hit

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
electronics so that way it doesn't hit

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.830 
electronics so that way it doesn't hit
the<00:02:10.289> wall<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> hilt

the wall of the hilt

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.780 
the wall of the hilt
but<00:02:13.319> essentially<00:02:13.590> there<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.980> go<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
but essentially there you go and the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.820 
but essentially there you go and the
recharge<00:02:15.120> ports<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.540> there<00:02:15.750> now<00:02:16.560> basically

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
recharge ports in there now basically

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.589 
recharge ports in there now basically
all<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.430> would<00:02:17.550> need<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.879> do<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:19.019> slide<00:02:19.560> this

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
all you would need to do is slide this

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.740 
all you would need to do is slide this
plastic<00:02:21.599> shroud<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:23.090> access<00:02:24.090> your<00:02:24.269> recharge

your<00:03:32.700> electronics<00:03:33.239> are<00:03:33.359> pretty<00:03:33.540> solid<00:03:33.930> in

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
your electronics are pretty solid in

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.809 
your electronics are pretty solid in
there<00:03:34.200> as<00:03:34.349> you<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.680> hear<00:03:37.010> there's<00:03:38.010> no<00:03:38.340> jiggle

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
there as you can hear there's no jiggle

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.870 
there as you can hear there's no jiggle
really<00:03:39.090> at<00:03:39.299> all<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.500> that's<00:03:43.950> pretty<00:03:44.280> solid<00:03:44.549> I

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
really at all so that's pretty solid I

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
really at all so that's pretty solid I
like<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:46.530> also<00:03:46.799> set<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.430> saber<00:03:47.669> up<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
like that and also set the saber up the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.129 
like that and also set the saber up the
