week or so then we will what we're now
working<00:05:37.630> on<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:37.960> design<00:05:38.350> at<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.680> station

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
working on the design at the station

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.920 
working on the design at the station
building<00:05:39.160> that<00:05:40.030> will<00:05:40.180> have<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.389> go<00:05:40.539> through

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
building that will have to go through

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.110 
building that will have to go through
not<00:05:41.830> full<00:05:42.160> planning<00:05:42.580> permission<00:05:42.970> but

not full planning permission but

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.110 
not full planning permission but
certainly<00:05:43.600> building<00:05:43.960> regulation<00:05:44.530> checks<00:05:45.120> as

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
well as a very detailed design we need a

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.409 
well as a very detailed design we need a
toilet<00:05:50.500> block<00:05:50.800> and<00:05:51.460> there<00:05:51.669> was<00:05:51.789> never<00:05:51.970> a

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
significant toilet block here before

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.230 
significant toilet block here before
just<00:05:54.669> one<00:05:54.850> toilet<00:05:55.150> reach<00:05:56.039> person<00:05:57.039> in<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.850> old

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
just one toilet reach person in the old

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.420 
just one toilet reach person in the old
building<00:05:58.600> there<00:05:58.840> will<00:05:59.830> be<00:05:59.860> a<00:05:59.949> separate<00:06:00.250> toilet

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
building there will be a separate toilet

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.760 
building there will be a separate toilet
block<00:06:00.729> with<00:06:00.940> modern<00:06:01.240> facilities<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:02.650> of

block with modern facilities and of

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.730 
block with modern facilities and of
course<00:06:02.919> we<00:06:03.100> took<00:06:03.220> our<00:06:03.370> pop<00:06:04.440> anybody<00:06:05.440> who<00:06:05.530> turns

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
course we took our pop anybody who turns

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.520 
course we took our pop anybody who turns
up<00:06:05.919> will<00:06:06.460> want<00:06:06.639> to<00:06:06.669> park<00:06:06.910> their<00:06:07.030> car<00:06:07.380> so<00:06:08.380> we

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
up will want to park their car so we

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.100 
up will want to park their car so we

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
volunteers here as we progress from site

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.379 
volunteers here as we progress from site
clearance<00:06:21.250> and<00:06:21.460> preparation<00:06:22.030> to<00:06:22.060> site

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
clearance and preparation to site

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.620 
clearance and preparation to site
construction<00:06:22.860> then<00:06:23.860> the<00:06:24.330> the<00:06:25.330> type<00:06:25.599> of

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
construction then the the type of

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.010 
construction then the the type of
volunteer<00:06:26.169> may<00:06:26.440> shift<00:06:26.770> rather<00:06:27.570> but<00:06:28.570> always

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
volunteer may shift rather but always

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.779 
volunteer may shift rather but always
there'll<00:06:29.710> be<00:06:29.740> the<00:06:29.860> need<00:06:30.099> to<00:06:30.250> maintain<00:06:30.430> the

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
there'll be the need to maintain the

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.790 
there'll be the need to maintain the
site<00:06:31.000> so<00:06:31.510> we'll<00:06:31.660> always<00:06:31.810> have<00:06:32.139> it<00:06:32.260> people<00:06:32.530> who

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
site so we'll always have it people who

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.640

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
if people want to lay bricks design

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.860 
if people want to lay bricks design
people<00:06:39.270> and<00:06:42.210> we<00:06:43.210> need<00:06:43.360> to<00:06:43.449> look<00:06:43.539> at<00:06:43.630> the<00:06:43.690> site

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
people and we need to look at the site

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.659 
people and we need to look at the site
safety<00:06:44.289> as<00:06:44.380> well<00:06:44.530> so<00:06:45.070> our<00:06:45.160> next<00:06:45.310> step<00:06:45.520> is<00:06:45.639> to

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
safety as well so our next step is to

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.150 
safety as well so our next step is to
start<00:06:45.940> construction<00:06:46.300> and<00:06:46.810> we<00:06:47.380> have<00:06:47.560> the<00:06:47.770> balsa

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
start construction and we have the balsa

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.719 
start construction and we have the balsa
Bement<00:06:48.580> to<00:06:48.760> start<00:06:49.210> building<00:06:49.389> platform<00:06:49.930> 1<00:06:50.110> and

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
Bement to start building platform 1 and

Bement to start building platform 1 and
we<00:06:51.729> have<00:06:52.800> materials<00:06:53.800> a<00:06:53.949> mix<00:06:54.190> of<00:06:54.340> recovered

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
we have materials a mix of recovered
