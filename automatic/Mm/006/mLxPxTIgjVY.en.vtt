00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.380
 - not our process of structure defeats lun previously 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.990
 it was a process involves a lot of manual work had to be built 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.420
 a database with all the information related to the clients and 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.990
 that way we calculated 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.500
 indebtedness 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.440
 not specialized for these purposes 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.010
 how are p 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.330
 irma pinto 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.540
 a restructure I could take is just building the database and 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.650
 volume validation surely a week 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.470
 i the design 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.640
 then between one and two weeks depending on the volume of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.300
 He said that we have a manual in front of us 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.060
 it meant a lot of time i 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.900
 it seems much more flexible 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.030
 we had to look for a tool that was powerful enough 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.150
 for us what we need is to say that it was very dynamic 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.500
 and that could handle large amounts of information 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.850
 lamented the triumph of the planet 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.520
 I have supported a lot in the creation of scenarios and it helps you a lot to 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.710
 select the best designs 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.580
 ordinations 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.200
 in any type of distribution center 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.480
 It makes it very easy to choose the best income distribution struggles and it is 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.560
 great help to make the best decisions less visits 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.720
 from there we started working with the territory of the 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.240
 we designed a new process to make the structures 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.090
 from the operation indicators analysis 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.150
 the execution and the structural design 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.650
 and the follow-up 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.400
 thing is very clear the way 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.960
 before presenting information with which he spoke for him 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.040
 see the user because the pnv follows clearly 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.690
 number of routes with winning a tournament in terms of customers 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.059
 in terms of volume 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:15.159
 This encounter distances traveled previously although I would like 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.000
 the delivery routes of a distribution center go out to distribute 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.709
 the demand matters 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.170
 we know that the demand is variable no matter the demand that had to 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.209
 distribute each route they all went to the market 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.280
 now what we try to do that come out to hand out only the votes 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.189
 necessary to cover the demand of the day 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.879
 the most benefits 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.409
 tangible that we have definitely found is the speed with the 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.459
 what can we do the analyzes 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.830
 the amount of information we can handle and analyze simultaneously 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:44.789
 we have 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.649
 a lot of scenarios 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.649
 and people or logistics teams can find better solutions 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.819
 to a particular problem 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.650
 basically it has been that they are mileage which has produced 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.819
 around 22% 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.679
 the time in the market per day therefore which has increased because 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:07.509
 previously the jack they left poetry to distribute three hundred cajasur a truck 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:11.149
 which has a capacity to distribute up to twelve hundred boxes then the 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.149
 Market time per route also increased by around 12% 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.009
 and for that reason there are also intangible benefits, not like the reduction of 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:20.489
 the day the worker 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.029
 the workers have a more equitable workload because that's what you 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.450
 come out more balanced now with this year with the use of this show in this 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.809
 planning scheme 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:33.169
 the advantage that we have the same process 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.309
 given the speed you do not doubt 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:36.779
 we can analyze 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.350
 much more excesses in the same time ii conclude 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.039
 photo manu micÃ³ decision 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:45.729
 between eating or dining few were we the best 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.829
 industry tool that governing body and plans and we decided to buy
