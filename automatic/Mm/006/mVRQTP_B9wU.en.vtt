00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.120
 Hi all right with you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.320
 We're going to learn a new sheikh. 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.289
 told sheik 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.630
 I found that before hunger there are several 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.660
 checks described by the internet but 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.849
 because because of hunger because this 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.849
 will take strawberry 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.730
 we will use to give'll take 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.290
 to speak the benefits of what we are going to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.450
 use these ingredients 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 let's use eight medium strawberries one 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.710
 tablespoon of sesame and a spoon 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.420
 of flax soup may be the line can 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.120
 any linseed I chose the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.809
 golden wedding ring and 200 ml 250 ml of water 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.670
 is a sheikh of hunger because the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.930
 foods are high in fiber as 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.820
 Strawberry 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.820
 they help our intestines 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.280
 work harder and this increases the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.710
 metabolism and causes this 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.220
 Strawberry degradation and other foods 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.290
 rich in memory fibers and this makes 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.080
 with which we also do not disappear 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.330
 What if we start a plate of a 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.840
 carbohydrate like any other 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.640
 thing is like the white bread carbohydrate 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.150
 a house a white 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.890
 so always invest in rich foods 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.270
 in fibers that really are the foods 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.130
 more natural and wealthier 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.880
 in fats that only flaxseed and sesame 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 among others 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.640
 this check we will use the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.930
 he will unleash the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.049
 awesome all eight strawberry one 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.030
 tablespoon flaxseed 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:04.799
 I used the golden 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:08.600
 a tablespoon of sesame and 250 ml 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.600
 filtered water 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:18.420
 If you want you can add 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.270
 sweetener but need not but I think 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.880
 that everyone is already accustomed to the 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.489
 felt the taste of the juice 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.489
 chinese town 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:32.340
 without advancing any other objective but 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.709
 the people that the public needs then stays 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.330
