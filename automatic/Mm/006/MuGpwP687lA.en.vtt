00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
change your your cubic engine on your

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.859 
change your your cubic engine on your
engine<00:00:17.749> so<00:00:18.740> my<00:00:19.249> engines<00:00:19.579> at<00:00:19.730> 355<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:20.749> we're

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
engine so my engines at 355 so we're

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.189 
engine so my engines at 355 so we're
going<00:00:20.989> to<00:00:21.079> leave<00:00:21.259> it<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:21.999> I<00:00:22.999> want<00:00:23.869> to<00:00:23.929> tell<00:00:24.109> you

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
never read an instruction book for the

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.420 
never read an instruction book for the
system<00:00:29.509> yet<00:00:30.009> which<00:00:31.009> a<00:00:31.810> lot<00:00:32.810> of<00:00:32.960> guys<00:00:33.430> aren't

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
system yet which a lot of guys aren't

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.759 
system yet which a lot of guys aren't
going<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.789> and<00:00:35.180> they<00:00:35.269> don't<00:00:35.449> want<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.410> it's

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
going to and they don't want to so it's

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.910 
going to and they don't want to so it's
it's<00:00:37.039> a<00:00:37.160> self<00:00:37.489> learning<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.120> easy<00:00:38.710> why<00:00:39.710> do<00:00:39.769> you

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
it's a self learning so easy why do you

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.549 
it's a self learning so easy why do you
need<00:00:40.129> anything<00:00:40.399> else<00:00:40.699> so<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.929> system<00:00:42.320> as<00:00:42.469> you

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
need anything else so the system as you

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.930 
need anything else so the system as you
can<00:00:42.679> see<00:00:42.829> does<00:00:43.070> down<00:00:43.250> logging<00:00:45.309> everything<00:00:46.309> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
can see does down logging everything and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.729 
can see does down logging everything and
I'm<00:00:47.690> gonna<00:00:47.809> go<00:00:47.989> back<00:00:48.230> up<00:00:48.589> to<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.550> dashboard

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
I'm gonna go back up to the dashboard

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.520 
I'm gonna go back up to the dashboard
get<00:00:51.739> error<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:53.300> that's<00:00:53.749> going<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.050> show<00:00:54.289> me

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
get error and that's going to show me

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.430 
get error and that's going to show me
what<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.670> engine<00:00:56.059> is<00:00:56.149> capable<00:00:56.449> of<00:00:56.929> doing<00:00:57.339> rpm

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
what the engine is capable of doing rpm

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.910 
what the engine is capable of doing rpm
the<00:01:00.460> vacuum<00:01:01.460> system<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:02.629> map<00:01:02.899> sensor<00:01:03.199> which

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
the vacuum system the map sensor which

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.770 
the vacuum system the map sensor which
is<00:01:03.949> built<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:04.550> an<00:01:05.390> air<00:01:05.690> fuel<00:01:05.990> ratio<00:01:06.340> okay<00:01:07.340> now

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
is built in an air fuel ratio okay now

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.740 
is built in an air fuel ratio okay now
we're<00:01:08.780> gonna<00:01:08.870> try<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.140> start<00:01:09.500> this<00:01:10.420> this<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
we're gonna try to start this this the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.950 
we're gonna try to start this this the
engine<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.230> ice-cold<00:01:13.330> we've<00:01:14.330> never<00:01:14.540> started

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
engine is ice-cold we've never started

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.480 
engine is ice-cold we've never started
this<00:01:15.050> yet<00:01:15.320> we're<00:01:15.620> gonna<00:01:15.740> try<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.100> right<00:01:16.190> now

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
this yet we're gonna try it right now

00:01:16.490 --> 00:02:11.270 
this yet we're gonna try it right now
and<00:01:16.670> see<00:01:16.820> what<00:01:17.030> happens

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.340
