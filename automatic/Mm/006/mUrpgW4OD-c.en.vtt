00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.719 
health they were done with bovine
derived<00:04:42.010> products<00:04:42.790> from<00:04:43.360> cows<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:44.729> those

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
derived products from cows and those

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.390 
derived products from cows and those
products<00:04:46.180> contain<00:04:46.630> DHA<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.530> fatty<00:04:47.830> acid<00:04:48.370> that

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
products contain DHA the fatty acid that

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.000 
products contain DHA the fatty acid that
is<00:04:48.669> so<00:04:49.030> beneficial<00:04:49.479> to<00:04:50.020> brain<00:04:50.320> health<00:04:50.620> and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
is so beneficial to brain health and

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.480 
is so beneficial to brain health and
we're<00:04:51.880> not<00:04:52.090> getting<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:53.080> from<00:04:53.440> sunflower<00:04:53.770> or

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
we're not getting that from sunflower or

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.689 
we're not getting that from sunflower or
from<00:04:54.850> soy<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:56.410> we're<00:04:56.979> not<00:04:57.190> going<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.460> see

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
from soy so we're not going to see

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.750 
from soy so we're not going to see
phosphatidylserine<00:04:58.889> anytime<00:04:59.889> soon<00:05:00.340> on<00:05:00.610> the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
phosphatidylserine anytime soon on the

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.930 
phosphatidylserine anytime soon on the
market<00:05:01.240> from<00:05:01.690> bovine<00:05:02.020> sources<00:05:02.889> because<00:05:03.550> of

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
market from bovine sources because of

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.659 
market from bovine sources because of
mad<00:05:04.600> cow<00:05:04.630> disease<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.860> it's<00:05:06.160> not<00:05:06.400> going<00:05:06.610> to

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
mad cow disease so it's not going to

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.030 
mad cow disease so it's not going to
happen<00:05:06.850> but<00:05:07.840> what<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.050> am<00:05:08.260> hoping<00:05:08.710> is<00:05:08.860> we're

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
happen but what I am hoping is we're

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.980 
happen but what I am hoping is we're
going<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.190> soon<00:05:09.460> see<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.990> phosphatidylserine

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
going to soon see a phosphatidylserine

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.310 
going to soon see a phosphatidylserine
from<00:05:11.650> eggs<00:05:12.010> or<00:05:12.280> fish<00:05:13.000> because<00:05:13.690> that<00:05:14.020> would<00:05:14.200> be

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
from eggs or fish because that would be

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.710 
from eggs or fish because that would be
so<00:05:14.710> much<00:05:14.979> better<00:05:15.040> from<00:05:15.760> soy<00:05:16.060> or<00:05:16.450> other

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
so much better from soy or other

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.670 
so much better from soy or other
plant-based<00:05:17.530> sources<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.960> my<00:05:20.320> last<00:05:20.530> question

of the brain shrinkage is the honolulu
aging<00:05:40.720> study<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.470> that's<00:05:42.220> about<00:05:42.460> tofu<00:05:43.330> and
