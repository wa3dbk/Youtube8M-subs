00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
this is the basic game in our math

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.550 
this is the basic game in our math
transport<00:00:29.400> series<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.330> also<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> rounding

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
transport series we also have a rounding

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.490 
transport series we also have a rounding

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
integer version which is very similar

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.389 
integer version which is very similar
this<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> deals<00:00:36.630> with<00:00:36.750> both<00:00:37.739> negative<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
this but it deals with both negative and

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.119 
this but it deals with both negative and
positive<00:00:38.489> numbers<00:00:39.350> okay<00:00:40.350> let's<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.680> ahead<00:00:40.770> and
