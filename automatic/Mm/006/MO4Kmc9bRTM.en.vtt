00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.609
 hello and welcome here so 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.650
 matthias I am on the mwc on the stand 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.570
 from sony and they have the new one here 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.690
 release 7 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.640
 this is this mint green though 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.300
 on the whole really, really 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.369
 nice smartphone and it's supposed to be for 399 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.759
 come on the market 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.109
 then probably about other partners 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.069
 because of them not with your own 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.419
 brand in germany will occur and 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:35.180
 yes, the special thing this time is it 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.650
 not so insanely slim at least 5.5 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.450
 millimeter is of course still 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.940
 very thin but at least it does not 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.730
 in it all are all record 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.640
 neat hardware is built for 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.370
 For example, paco has every bigger one 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.830
 Capacity of 2750 milliamp hours 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.080
 So personally I find it okay 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.430
 for the cell phone is so thin only then 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.050
 again half a millimeter thinner 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.340
 would have been clear again 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.110
 went down millipairs 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.000
 but we say that they give us that now 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.829
 always a little up close 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.609
 here forward we first see the 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.609
 really nice 52 inch display that 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:13.429
 synonymous with full hd resolution so it means 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:19.670
 with 1920 x 1080 pixel it comes up 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:21.409
 a pixeldichte of 424 ppg and it 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.590
 looks very, very nice too 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.179
 So you have to be honest 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.049
 a little bit inside 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.450
 contact jucker co processor 1 here 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.299
 gigahertz cpu of 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.329
 from mediatex and that is one of the 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.850
 latest is supported by those 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.610
 the whole of 2 gb ram come internally 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.369
 two gigabytes of ram to use if me 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.630
 You can not be fooled, unfortunately 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.729
 not with micro usb expand micro sd 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.829
 of course, here on the side we have 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.659
 here the zones are happy 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.250
 I really find side protect and 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.860
 this right up here is wonderful 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.869
 milled and that can be composed 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.670
 aluminum this frame and looks 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.649
 really very very chic and 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.750
 you can see me on the right side yes 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.509
 the quieter key and as always 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.630
 us down here to have to be 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.010
 really nice to sell well on 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.519
 On the lower side we have one here 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.860
 small grill for the mono speaker 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.140
 jack and marco and of course 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.970
 the microphone input and here too 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.360
 again the classic recesses for 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.829
 the mobile phone for antennas the left side 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.069
 we have not worried the first 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.599
 Steps for the sim card and on the 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.459
 We also do not have the upper side 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.290
 if we now even the back 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.350
 turn, we also see that much we 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.880
 have glass that is corinna class 3 so 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.850
 the same track on the front 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.590
 was so reminding me of the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.130
 Design student may be different 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.760
 even 460 sz 3 above we have the 3 10 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.310
 Megapixel snaps with a simple one 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.349
 light on the front the knips 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.520
 By the way, opens with 5 megapixels 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:09.920
 I think so far actually quite 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:13.520
 okay from the values ago maybe 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.349
 the android 5.0 is running on the device and 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.200
 that's me overall i like it 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.920
 really good and i am always 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.120
 again surprised with which 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.650
 Accuracy yet so Chinese 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.420
 companies are doing really well 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.950
 to make devices I believe there can 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.900
 We will do so in the next few months 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.400
 Expect a lot what to expect 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.069
 here from china 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.940
