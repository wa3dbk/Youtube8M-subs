00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello today these videos held so 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.410
 I will introduce you to nail art 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.080
 matched with an outfit so I'll you 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.859
 very quickly presents the outfit for 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.359
 the top I put a striped sweater on 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.380
 little bag is really too hot it's 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.330
 an owl bag the team raw and small 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.240
 heeled boots with small nails 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.850
 so for the first nail art it's a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 very easy tutorial a tutorial very 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.450
 easy to make 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.649
 I just just made an axis 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.020
 untenable with stadiums 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.500
 so for the material will we have to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.399
 a base a nail polish a nail polish 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.340
 beige golden stadiums a low top coat 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.110
 range that's not necessarily mandatory 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.390
 and a fast drying top coat of 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.010
 preference 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.629
 so I'll start by asking my base 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.340
 it's really important to ask 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 a base before applying the nail polish 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.359
 color it will protect your nails 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.309
 my natural ones are a little bit 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.310
 yellow because I ask a lot of 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.600
 polish so to avoid that to the maximum 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.920
 obviously poses his ball all the time 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 then I'll start by asking a 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.180
 first layer of polish so on the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.530
 most of the nails it's going to be the nail polish 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.530
 dark brown 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.119
 then on my ring finger instead of 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.049
 ask brown varnish I will ask 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.270
 Belgian polish 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.759
 it will allow to focus on 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.579
 this angle and brushes varnish 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.079
 essie are super convenient I find a 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.789
 once that will have a little bit dried up I 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:51.079
 I will put a second coat of varnish 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:52.939
 like that it will be good we not that we are 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.429
 again a little bit dry then 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.989
 we will put the top coat so that's the 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.759
 top coat that does not dry very 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:03.890
 quickly so I put my little ones 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.599
 stages on a sheet and I'm going to them 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.069
 catch with the must so you the 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.750
 catch a little bit as you can 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.970
 I like doing it like that and 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.799
 then I'm going to reposition it with a 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.870
 little stick so this is the advantage 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.970
 to use a top coat that does not sit 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.530
 quickly because you will be able to ask all 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.049
 your stadiums in one go 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.540
 and as long as the top coat will not be dry 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.310
 you can reposition them with the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.660
 early morning 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.989
 so here I am doing a 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.489
 first line on my booth nail 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.700
 so that makes the whole width of my 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.530
 nail 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.750
 then I'll do another line 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.190
 just below but that will be less 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.380
 wide so I always use the same 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.700
 technique to ask them you can 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.410
 do the pattern you want with 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.200
 your help you can make lines 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.910
 horizontal vertical diagonals 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.349
 you can do triangles or 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.450
 other reasons you can also 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.819
 use stadiums because and there are 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.970
 different shapes so it's up to you to 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.440
 see there are plenty of possibilities 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.150
 then to finish the last step 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.669
 it is to pose the top coat 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.669
 so I like to use a top 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:12.829
 quick drying type coat or dry poach 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.870
 very quickly and that also dried up the 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.940
 varnish that below so like that 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.440
 will be able to do what we just want 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.379
 after his manicure is not really needed 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.660
 to wait until the varnish dries and I 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.099
 also want to come and put it on the nail 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.879
 Belgian over the stadiums 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.139
 by catches made against paying attention 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.970
 it tends to make little bubbles 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.709
 sometimes when we go on stage so 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.669
 Attention is said going well in 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.669
 every nook and cranny 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.030
 so that's the result it's really 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.010
 something very easy that all the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.599
 world can do is fast enough too 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.980
 so I think we'll go to the outfit 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.110
 for makeup and hairstyling 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.019
 first of all so for the hairstyle it's very 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.970
 very simple I just put an it bag and 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.830
 for makeup is rather focused on 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.750
 the eyes so I started by putting 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.290
 foundation and then a powder 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.450
 compact bluff and for the eyes I 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.549
 laid a base also for makeup 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.610
 in itself I used my palette nike 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.680
 is of durban indicated of beige in corner 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.820
 internally then I used a little bit 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.440
 of walleye is a little bit of marrans and 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.570
 colors I also used a red seal 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.010
 lower and a little touch of 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.040
 black in outer corner 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.630
 I ended up with mascara and for the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.180
 mouth I used a lipstick 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.240
 nude since the eyes are still a 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.780
 little bit loaded so that's it 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.160
 gives for makeup I wanted 10 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.960
 for the hairdressing I used a 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.960
 headband so he comes from pimkie 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.580
 for the top it's a little sweater 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.039
 scratches that I bought h &amp; m the year 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:19.110
 last it is super nice to wear 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:21.389
 I love them a lot and I had a little 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.639
 favorite for this bag 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.989
 so it's an owl bag that I bought 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.149
 on the bang site or two points like 

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:27.929
 I really fell in love when I saw them 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:31.550
 on the site 

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:31.550
 he is really too much of a cabbage 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.120
 it is available in several colors 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.010
 I choose them a brown he is 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.810
 still a little small but we 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.310
 can put a lot of things still 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.620
 inside moment portfolio is 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.040
 hyper tall and he easily returns to 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.780
 interior 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.300
 then for jeans and basic jeans 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.300
 a raw jean that I bought h &amp; m too 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:18.110
 and finally for the shoes I put 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.509
 little heeled boots that I have 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.060
 bought so it's a shop 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:25.460
 that there is the polygon with beziers I 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.949
 had spotted last year and this 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.539
 year she was in the ground so I have not 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.539
 resisted I bought them this year 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.530
 and here is the second assorted nail art 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.780
 at this outfit to sneijder I got 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.430
 especially inspired by the owl bag and for 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.500
 other angles I used varnish 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.410
 textures and to call a little bit the 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.970
 pull so to see the tutorial videos of 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.830
