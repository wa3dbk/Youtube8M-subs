00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.250 

and<00:05:55.490> then<00:05:55.940> I'll<00:05:56.060> choose<00:05:56.240> my<00:05:56.300> file<00:05:56.830> choice<00:05:59.260> how

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
and then I'll choose my file choice how

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.650 
and then I'll choose my file choice how
about<00:06:01.900> 180<00:06:02.900> upload<00:06:03.380> where<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:04.360> like<00:06:05.360> I<00:06:05.450> went<00:06:05.600> the

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
about 180 upload where I like I went the

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.810 
about 180 upload where I like I went the
wrong<00:06:05.810> way<00:06:05.870> and<00:06:06.320> then<00:06:07.250> you<00:06:07.340> just<00:06:07.550> choose<00:06:07.790> your

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
wrong way and then you just choose your

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.230 
wrong way and then you just choose your
file<00:06:08.150> location<00:06:09.340> if<00:06:10.340> one<00:06:10.550> doesn't<00:06:10.880> work<00:06:10.970> try

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
file location if one doesn't work try

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:20.140 
file location if one doesn't work try
another<00:06:18.820> sometimes<00:06:19.820> you'll<00:06:20.000> have<00:06:20.060> a

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
another sometimes you'll have a

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.510 
another sometimes you'll have a
captioner<00:06:20.660> and<00:06:20.840> those<00:06:21.560> tend<00:06:21.800> to<00:06:21.890> work<00:06:22.070> so

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
captioner and those tend to work so

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.630 
captioner and those tend to work so
