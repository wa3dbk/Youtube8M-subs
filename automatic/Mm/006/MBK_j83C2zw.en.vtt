 May 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.270
 Hello dear readers and welcome to the Guild 2 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.629
 Means of all life to mutations 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.609
 in the strum the goal is to build up the family dynasty and become one 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.489
 turn for a game or in scenarios then stop 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.509
 others have a million shares 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:25.830
 detach 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.679
 or with Mr. or unfair means 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.229
 to assert oneself against these 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.100
 of it so Marr was played then still far away because I'm the smart 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.309
 Home that we start small with our craftsman and now I have 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.949
 bought as a first time on the farm and now start using raw materials 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.250
 always warm in the case of our first employee 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.340
 and yes raw materials were cheaper to buy and sell that expensive 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.740
 Water the basic principle if you are relatively no matter the matter and the money 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.860
 one therefore serves 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.680
 one uses stop then for example also around 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 Dignitaries change certain bribe to halt yourself political 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.000
 Make a career and thus take influence or they take the money and 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 build theirs 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.080
 of the farms or even in the private home from their mom insight into this in this 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.740
 to family propos the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.439
 and here you see on the screen that you have different levels of expansion 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.290
 and in that case we would now be Dieter Pawlik's window with it 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.770
 Complaint is initially pointless because little eaten house warm but he is 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 thought again very example 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.820
 yes, the marketplace is the center for the trade they then differentiated 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.270
 In Karelia the Tobias and Brain Injuries at each operation can come with two slots 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.600
 laden and now sell because the brothers 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.909
 and as much cold as possible led 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.070
 and on the other hand, I buy the whole thing again 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.360
 according to but very comprehensible economic cycle speak per cent 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.330
 if somehow we buy strong demand or commodity commodity again 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.490
 Price for it rise and also in return if we are the same 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.030
 Produce and sell things 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.420
 then at some point we will only get very little money for that very much 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.250
 nicely done, too, with each raw material entitled to eleven members 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.599
 actually now he defends Sylvie Ã¶lkreide pay for it 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.249
 and on the whole it is of course very very nice also the economic topics 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.909
 Variety of businesses and manufactured goods we have already liked very much 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.169
 we have a dynasty Greens of course not alone from the port 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.589
 But they also work off a partner for the consumer 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:33.019
 Partner and 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.549
 the young Garmin we keep and new continents and gifts as much as in the 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.509
 real life around them and they get 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.199
 and if we then manage to be in the top of her favor 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:48.069
 the childrens are ours in the house spend a night together and 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.969
 Here the two partners were young and healthy if I gave in as well 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.109
 a trunk holder 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.909
 and yes this is similar to this Rossini's with these actions the 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.809
 can be brought out about that is also very nice and made 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.119
 yes also works very well 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:07.799
 To whom life as honest citizens is too boring can also be a crook 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.960
 And especially as the game robs passers-by of how we make it here 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.849
 to show fights in Mali 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.369
 very clever are the club can not afford standing standing left 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:21.229
 relatively young involved are all witnesses and then the Wern at some point 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.579
 Charge and then we will the public viewing and scaffolding warning 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.759
 be summoned 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.749
 and if so, then it's time for outlawed and beneficial 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:30.509
 just so attacked and 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.099
 be done so cold 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.679
 you have to be careful every year Euro per person is that is another 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:42.129
 Play as with the craftsmen or scholars but that's also a lot 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.999
 contract 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.130
 the speech was already partly before our good time 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.810
 because it is not just an economic and rational probably this 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.040
 Economic part very very good or very well it just worked 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.140
 These Jebens come to us or end up separating and these things are the family 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.170
 Reasons and in the port of call and to keep evolving that is 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.719
 just what should the whole thing 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.279
 I made a unique product and I'm looking forward to the penultimate round
