00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090

of<00:02:40.270> suiciding<00:02:41.260> each<00:02:41.380> other<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:41.800> your<00:02:41.950> dates

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
of suiciding each other so your dates

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.970

are<00:02:42.310> really<00:02:42.900> november<00:02:43.900> eighth<00:02:44.080> November

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
are really november eighth November

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.520 
are really november eighth November
fifth<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.660> don't<00:02:46.660> think<00:02:46.720> they'll<00:02:46.960> do<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.200> 12th

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
fifth I don't think they'll do the 12th

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.900 
fifth I don't think they'll do the 12th
so<00:02:47.620> it's<00:02:47.740> basically<00:02:47.890> 58<00:02:48.640> 19<00:02:49.420> or<00:02:49.540> 22<00:02:50.520> my<00:02:51.520> initial

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
so it's basically 58 19 or 22 my initial

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.430 
so it's basically 58 19 or 22 my initial
prediction<00:02:52.240> was<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.480> fifth<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.080> go<00:02:53.170> alongside

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
prediction was the fifth to go alongside

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.930 
prediction was the fifth to go alongside
called<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.070> go<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.310> I'm<00:02:54.520> sure<00:02:54.700> if<00:02:54.850> they

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
called you to go so I'm sure if they

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.370 
called you to go so I'm sure if they
could<00:02:55.090> get<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.390> ready<00:02:55.570> in<00:02:55.690> time<00:02:55.930> they'd<00:02:56.140> love

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
could get it ready in time they'd love

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.170 
could get it ready in time they'd love
to<00:02:56.440> do<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.709> but<00:02:56.920> based<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.820> everything<00:02:57.970> I'm

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
to do that but based on everything I'm

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.490 
to do that but based on everything I'm
hearing<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.600> think<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.959> this<00:02:59.080> november

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
hearing I think that this november

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.660 
hearing I think that this november
eighth<00:02:59.620> day<00:02:59.830> is<00:03:00.010> still<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> placeholder

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
eighth day is still a placeholder

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.580 
eighth day is still a placeholder
they're<00:03:01.420> pegging<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:01.959> there<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.350> ready

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
they're pegging it in there to be ready

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.230 
they're pegging it in there to be ready
in<00:03:02.680> case<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:03.310> launches<00:03:03.730> before<00:03:04.150> the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
in case it launches before the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.570 
in case it launches before the
