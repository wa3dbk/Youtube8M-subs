00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.450
 the ng boys and girls i really hope 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.070
 that you are well today we will 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.380
 find for information 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.570
 complementary to the dlc that could 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.330
 to arrive because simply March 4 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.770
 you will have more content on 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.439
 call of duty ghost 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.880
 so it will be a really stiff pack 4s 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.129
 sinister because there will be 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.830
 two character customizations 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.360
 bad guys and that his sheets etc and me 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.949
 personally I find that he is 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.780
 really very very well done because 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.239
 it is true that we always think of having 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.739
 iconic characters from the game 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.600
 ie whole characters etc 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.830
 etc but here it gives a little bit of 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 renewal to hand characters 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.089
 bad guys that's true it gives you a 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.769
 original side to the thing and that's fine 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.150
 its benefits from treyarch 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.339
 so what would I really like 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.930
 also would your opinions be on this 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.909
 pack which we will start all of 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.710
 following first we will have a 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.010
 playable character in multi which is 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.170
 other than zac aref zakhaev sorry the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.130
 soft famous bad traffickers and 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.229
 Russian terrorists 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.119
 appeared for the first time nan rated 4 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.770
 I do not know at all if you reminded of 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.540
 zakayev but in any case we can 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.690
 embody it you will always have a 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.850
 little photo in background on the gameplay 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.610
 Moreover it is a case m for those who 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.530
 would then ask themselves second 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.170
 we can embody on the multi 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.350
 roarke ex-leader of the group 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.740
 ghost who was king sorry pardon at 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.210
 the enemy 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.950
 so I do not know if you remember 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.860
 in the countryside 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.409
 we had rock that was an ex leader 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.110
 as I say from the bost group and he has 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.030
 had one he underwent brainwashing and 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.820
 that's what made him supporters 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.240
 of a certain group that drives him wants 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.090
 fight his ex allies here is in 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.880
 third we will embody in multi 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.290
 in asmat skin that's how they 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.790
 are called it's just a 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.280
 character who is in a combination 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.930
 anti nuclear me personally I the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.650
 really really cool, especially 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.560
 on the image 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.849
 it gives a really beautiful effect 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.290
 I would like to see what 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.019
 it gives in multiplayer it must be 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.280
 really great great frankly I do not 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.739
 do not you know me what you think 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.020
 but having a guy on bail like that 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.630
 it's really cool and last 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.670
 we will have a pack makarov legends 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.990
 easter that's how they're called 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.849
 remember we embodied in the 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.069
 mission or give away or the 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.290
 civilians in the air at the gates of mw2 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.180
 and that's where we could embody him 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.160
 makarov and I do not know if you 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.959
 remember this mission that - 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.760
 personally I thought she 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.550
 was really hard to cash 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.230
 he arrives at airports shot at 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.739
 the hand all that and we can touch all 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.020
 the civilians who passes me personally 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.330
 mw2 this is the only game that for the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.830
 campaign deserve are peggy 18 months me 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.880
 that's what I find after others 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.760
 blah blah blah 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.769
 and in this name this pack you'll have a 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.630
 special makarov gift that is really 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.209
 very very beautiful me me I i you 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.220
 advise to buy a special crest 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.910
 a reticle player card and a 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.440
 background 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.390
 So that's all you'll have 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.500
 in the easter legends this is a 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.700
 little bit everything we could have 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.530
 March 4 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.970
 I really want to know you there 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.190
 on me personally I find that 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.450
 it impacts very very very promising and 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.430
 me what I recommend you to buy 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.720
 it would be the MCS took down john easter 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.269
 which is really very very advantageous 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.350
 because you can embody makarov 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.209
 and also bought the hazmat skin that 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.980
 for me is very very cool 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.019
