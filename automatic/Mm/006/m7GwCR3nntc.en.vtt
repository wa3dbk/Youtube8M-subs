00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello people and welcome back to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.849
 another consequence let's play offers 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.540
 yes today while we are natural 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.089
 again on the testing web and me 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.980
 try as little satisfied because 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.240
 you are right as determined 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.350
 pretty boring is the train okay 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.590
 But flying times but totally found and yes 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.349
 you also have the last one at merck 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.890
 follow everything a bit asynchronously 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.230
 was 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.010
 and that's true and I wonder why 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.309
 I hope these are followers of the students 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.800
 the 7th 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.800
 Gerrit sign is here now I come 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.219
 hope that it will follow in the next 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.579
 not again but we will see 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.430
 at the aaron eckhart one today 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.800
 I also made a good suggestion 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.789
 wants to perform the same 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:05.580
 namely the daddy bigger bracke mumok 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.200
 derby on the moon map and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.300
 everything and that should be pretty 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.050
 be interesting with 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:18.610
 but that's not just gravity or with 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.610
 our customer 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.400
 I think normal 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.280
 software gone through now is 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.280
 everything again 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.729
 james is just overjoyed 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.729
 captures 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.540
 so god the map is not for this tube 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.640
 procure 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.390
 very little stuttering once for that 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.390
 Part breaks out 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.149
 and in the morning in a row of old there 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.490
 then probably only 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.759
 probably 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.440
 The rocket was also often times 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.429
 required 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.130
 then I will do that here too 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.040
 hears speak for Monday 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.640
 you split like that too 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880
 becomes 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880
 jo 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.310
 is the beautiful on ball slammed on us 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.750
 but he attracts and has suzuki 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.990
 Engine is the idea 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.990
 the trunk 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.100
 No 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.300
 No 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.610
 whether that in the reliably no 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.270
 tailgate but 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.200
 trunk lid 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.080
 has us 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.560
 made 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.640
 maybe here 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:56.390
 ok cube on this map 0 are therefore 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.390
 take the way well the beta version 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.470
 that makes a lot more on this map 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.510
 are as the variant is iv variant 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.439
 easy 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.439
 not taxable 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.560
 so 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.560
 times 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.330
 so actually over it and then but 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.330
 not something like that 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.810
 extens 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.120
 of course very flat here 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.280
 but not so good, everything will be fine 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.940
 but actually is not ill 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.030
 really meaningful 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.250
 the car too 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.250
 test what is still open 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.040
 later, when we have the podium 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.040
 the bfd mettmach how should be 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.330
 if you are quite a bit pretty 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.330
 different in a different way 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.620
 somehow can concentrate 0 short 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.880
 Stop recording then I will see us 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.000
 immediately again and sees himself on the left 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.200
 We will build two more cars 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.050
 also use immediately 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.450
 Before that , I just want to show you just a moment 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.290
 that I have three new objects 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.380
 made for her so for you 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:38.270
 just a short update for the 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.370
 people who are interested in it so here 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.950
 is anything else a goal 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.270
 that I have now by dredge 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.919
 a reason i just have straight 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.419
 forget what set differently so 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.200
 In the game you have to go with the officer 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.540
 consist 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.590
 but that's not much there 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.610
 has to change so it's just because here 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.430
 but somehow looks quite funny 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.530
 find 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.000
 is also quite interesting to crash only 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.850
 from the one side of the right side 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.850
 is it fertilizer then this part 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.160
 it has always nice to nasty car I 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:19.599
 it is not fast there but in the car 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:22.470
 already destroying speeds like that 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:25.370
 and this is a professional like 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.250
 arose 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.960
 everything has been created somehow 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.980
 my creativity then just flows 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.310
 is however determined that has in 1 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.500
 bulges denkste I think normal 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:48.000
 I did not drive and did not 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:48.980
 converted so do not pay attention 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.280
 that you can not be by 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.200
 but otherwise I am really nice 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.450
 think as I said there will eventually 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.660
 give 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.660
 or what 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.430
 just here everything is not finished 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.610
 we will just take a course 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.790
 rally the next in the turbo variant 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.970
 will also take over easily 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:24.370
 the advertises the 50 sportline series 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:27.030
 of which the sport variant if simple 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.030
 shortly behind 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.039
 and then we do chelsea player and 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:42.979
 now that will do that i hope the 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:42.979
 least against small we already 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.900
 both of them are already packing 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.900
 Interesting 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.650
 the pads car was bad but it always was 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.690
 broken down there so I'm off 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.790
 provided the nut got me 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:06.680
 said that he is not locked 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:08.390
 and therefore runs the recording is 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.030
 Of course , the episode also expands 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:14.660
 make this place now so well 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:17.330
 Stop pausing and then leave 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.160
 tomorrow with the rocket should continue 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:24.620
 but longer are the consequences than smaller 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.760
 evaluation recognize compensation to one 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.130
 I may be that we do today 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.590
 do not even somehow follow with now 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.730
 0 satisfied why no 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.490
 real meaning is really happening now 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.410
 to record more because then I only 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.480
 I'm upset about myself 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.250
 exciting i can speak but 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.170
 anyway you can just down below 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.700
 in the description maybe the 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:48.160
 second paragraph 

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:53.000
 there is a link to a countdown in it 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.560
 and yes, he could see what 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.430
 with the channel I find with benji and 

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.800
 could guess a bit what happened 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.140
 this countdown has expired 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.490
 yes I hope that has the full value 

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.110
 Nevertheless , thanks for saying 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.200
 watch and bye to the next 

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.200
 times
