welcome<00:00:09.270> back<00:00:09.450> we're<00:00:10.260> going<00:00:10.350> to<00:00:10.410> go<00:00:10.530> over<00:00:10.800> in

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:10.890 
welcome back we're going to go over in

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.070 
welcome back we're going to go over in
this<00:00:11.040> video<00:00:11.220> it's<00:00:11.610> really<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> last<00:00:12.180> step<00:00:12.750> to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
this video it's really the last step to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.320 
this video it's really the last step to
creating<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.100> beautiful<00:00:14.250> albumen<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.030> that's

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
creating a beautiful albumen and that's

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.359 
creating a beautiful albumen and that's
having<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.780> great<00:00:16.020> negative<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:17.070> there's<00:00:17.279> lots

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
having a great negative now there's lots

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.429 
having a great negative now there's lots
of<00:00:17.610> ways<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.790> generate<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.330> negative<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.290> we're

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
of ways to generate a negative but we're

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.870 
of ways to generate a negative but we're
going<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.710> focusing<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.340> making<00:00:20.730> digital

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
going to be focusing on making digital

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.540 
going to be focusing on making digital
negatives<00:00:21.540> obviously<00:00:22.380> having<00:00:22.710> access<00:00:23.040> to<00:00:23.099> a<00:00:23.279> 4

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
negatives obviously having access to a 4

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.269 
negatives obviously having access to a 4
by<00:00:23.669> 5<00:00:23.849> or<00:00:23.910> 8<00:00:24.240> by<00:00:24.419> 10<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:24.930> also<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:26.040> know<00:00:26.099> making

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
by 5 or 8 by 10 or also you know making

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.269 
by 5 or 8 by 10 or also you know making
wet-plate<00:00:26.550> collodion<00:00:26.910> x'<00:00:27.239> is<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.419> great<00:00:27.689> way<00:00:27.900> to

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
wet-plate collodion x' is a great way to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.880 
wet-plate collodion x' is a great way to
to<00:00:29.279> kind<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.939> expose<00:00:30.360> and<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:31.169> print<00:00:31.710> your

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
to kind of expose and then print your

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.889 
to kind of expose and then print your
albumins<00:00:32.400> but<00:00:32.700> most<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.120> us<00:00:33.239> don't<00:00:33.720> have

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
albumins but most of us don't have

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.080 
albumins but most of us don't have
access<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> all<00:00:34.560> the<00:00:34.860> equipment<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.880> do

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
access to all the equipment and we do

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.479 
access to all the equipment and we do
have<00:00:36.899> access<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.470> digital<00:00:37.829> cameras<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
have access to digital cameras and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.420 
have access to digital cameras and
Photoshop<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.809> printers<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.039> we're<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.340> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
Photoshop and printers so we're going to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.060 
Photoshop and printers so we're going to
focus<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.809> digital<00:00:43.199> negative<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.980> other

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
focus on the digital negative the other

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040 
focus on the digital negative the other
great<00:00:44.370> thing<00:00:44.579> about<00:00:44.670> digital<00:00:45.329> negatives<00:00:45.929> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
great thing about digital negatives that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
great thing about digital negatives that
they're<00:00:46.199> scalable<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.550> print<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
they're scalable so you can print the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.740 
they're scalable so you can print the
same<00:00:48.090> image<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:48.719> 4<00:00:49.289> by<00:00:49.410> 5<00:00:49.620> 8<00:00:49.980> by<00:00:50.190> 10<00:00:50.429> and<00:00:50.699> even<00:00:51.300> 16

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
same image at 4 by 5 8 by 10 and even 16

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.430 
same image at 4 by 5 8 by 10 and even 16
by<00:00:51.870> 20<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.000> there's<00:00:54.000> no<00:00:54.440> interpretation

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
by 20 and there's no interpretation

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.060 
by 20 and there's no interpretation
maybe<00:00:56.100> once<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.670> create<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.089> good<00:00:57.739> curve<00:00:58.739> that's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
maybe once we create a good curve that's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.250 
maybe once we create a good curve that's
used<00:00:59.429> for<00:00:59.609> adjustments<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.899> print<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
used for adjustments we can print the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
used for adjustments we can print the
same<00:01:01.469> image<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.949> any<00:01:02.100> size<00:01:02.429> there's<00:01:02.969> no<00:01:03.120> more

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
same image at any size there's no more

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.170 
same image at any size there's no more
testing<00:01:03.839> required<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.739> done<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.820> basic

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
testing required to be done so the basic

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.360 
testing required to be done so the basic
process<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.870> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.440> be<00:01:07.500> first<00:01:07.770> determining

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
process is going to be first determining

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.640 
process is going to be first determining
what<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.210> maximum<00:01:09.720> density<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.440> paper

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
what is the maximum density of the paper

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
what is the maximum density of the paper
where<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> true<00:01:11.610> black<00:01:11.930> once<00:01:12.930> we

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
where do we get a true black once we

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.540 
where do we get a true black once we
know<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> we're<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:13.980> printing<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
know that we're going to be printing a

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.970 
know that we're going to be printing a
step<00:01:15.090> curve<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.660> a<00:01:15.720> step<00:01:15.990> test<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.800> will

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
step curve or a step test which will

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.230 
step curve or a step test which will
give<00:01:17.100> us<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.400> sorts<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.820> different<00:01:17.970> values

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
give us all sorts of different values

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.380 
give us all sorts of different values
that<00:01:18.480> the<00:01:18.960> printer<00:01:19.410> is<00:01:19.530> able<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.010> produce<00:01:20.390> once

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that the printer is able to produce once

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.080 
that the printer is able to produce once
we've<00:01:21.620> exposed<00:01:22.620> that<00:01:22.950> taking<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> through<00:01:23.760> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
we've exposed that taking it through the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.150 
we've exposed that taking it through the
development<00:01:24.630> process<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.200> dried<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.620> will

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
development process and dried it will

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.000 
development process and dried it will
then<00:01:26.340> look<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.540> once<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.530> been<00:01:28.680> scanned

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
then look and see once it's been scanned

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.980 
then look and see once it's been scanned
what<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> values<00:01:29.880> actually<00:01:30.090> came<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.750> at

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
what the values actually came out at

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.660 
what the values actually came out at
then<00:01:31.710> from<00:01:32.010> there<00:01:32.190> we'll<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.370> able<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
then from there we'll be able to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.120 
then from there we'll be able to
determine<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.900> difference<00:01:34.320> by<00:01:34.530> creating<00:01:35.010> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
determine the difference by creating a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.280 
determine the difference by creating a
curve<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.030> adjustment<00:01:36.510> curve<00:01:36.840> will

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
curve and that adjustment curve will

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.550 
curve and that adjustment curve will
then<00:01:37.470> help<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.490> images<00:01:39.120> that<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.360> create<00:01:39.750> fit

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
then help the images that we create fit

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.130 
then help the images that we create fit
or<00:01:40.800> match<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.820> ability<00:01:42.300> of<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> albumen<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
or match the ability of the albumen to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.860 
or match the ability of the albumen to
deliver<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.740> image<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.700> once<00:01:45.660> we've<00:01:45.840> done

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
deliver the image so once we've done

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.260 
deliver the image so once we've done
that<00:01:46.080> we<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.160> whatever<00:01:47.400> adjustments<00:01:47.670> in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that we can make whatever adjustments in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.750 
that we can make whatever adjustments in
Photoshop<00:01:48.840> make<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.590> image<00:01:49.950> look<00:01:50.160> however<00:01:50.430> we

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
Photoshop make the image look however we

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.090 
Photoshop make the image look however we
want<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.750> expect<00:01:52.260> that<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> values

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
want and we can expect that the values

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.260 
want and we can expect that the values
that<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.370> see<00:01:53.550> on<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> screen<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that we see on the screen of the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.880 
that we see on the screen of the
computer<00:01:54.480> are<00:01:54.900> then<00:01:55.050> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> come<00:01:55.530> out<00:01:55.710> in

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
computer are then going to come out in

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.090 
computer are then going to come out in
the<00:01:56.310> same<00:01:56.580> way<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.690> album<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:58.200> print<00:01:58.470> so

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the same way in the album in print so

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.560 
the same way in the album in print so
the<00:01:59.400> first<00:01:59.670> thing<00:01:59.820> we<00:01:59.910> need<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.390> start

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the first thing we need to do is start

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.950 
the first thing we need to do is start
making<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.460> maximum<00:02:02.790> density<00:02:03.120> test<00:02:03.660> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
making the the maximum density test and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.110 
making the the maximum density test and
so<00:02:04.080> we'll<00:02:04.200> go<00:02:04.380> over<00:02:04.650> how<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.830> do<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.190> in<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
so we'll go over how to do that in this

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.429 
so we'll go over how to do that in this
next<00:02:06.420> part

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:11.439 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.869 

so<00:02:12.439> in<00:02:12.709> order<00:02:12.829> to<00:02:13.010> create<00:02:13.310> our<00:02:13.370> maximum

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
so in order to create our maximum

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.009 
so in order to create our maximum
density<00:02:14.060> test<00:02:14.510> what<00:02:14.659> we're<00:02:14.750> going<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.900> be

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
density test what we're going to be

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.720 
density test what we're going to be
doing<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.409> simply<00:02:15.680> taking<00:02:16.010> an<00:02:16.129> unexposed

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
doing is simply taking an unexposed

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.360 
doing is simply taking an unexposed
piece<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.629> albumin<00:02:18.379> paper<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> had<00:02:19.159> some

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
piece of albumin paper that I had some

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.789 
piece of albumin paper that I had some
scrap<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.000> cutting<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:20.989> into<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.230> small<00:02:21.530> piece

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
scrap and cutting it into a small piece

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.390 
scrap and cutting it into a small piece
the<00:02:22.250> other<00:02:22.280> thing<00:02:22.549> that<00:02:22.579> we<00:02:22.790> need<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:24.400> small

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
the other thing that we need is a small

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.309 
the other thing that we need is a small
piece<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.359> material<00:02:27.019> that<00:02:27.079> we're<00:02:27.200> going

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
piece of the material that we're going

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.259 
piece of the material that we're going
to<00:02:27.409> be<00:02:27.470> using<00:02:27.829> to<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.129> our<00:02:28.430> digital<00:02:28.849> negatives

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
to be using to do our digital negatives

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.750 
to be using to do our digital negatives
it<00:02:30.170> does<00:02:30.409> block<00:02:30.680> some<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.250> light<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.609> it's

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
it does block some of the light so it's

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.240 
it does block some of the light so it's
important<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.299> we<00:02:32.480> use<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:33.230> as<00:02:33.470> well<00:02:33.680> what

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
important that we use this as well what

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.349 
important that we use this as well what
I'm<00:02:34.310> gonna<00:02:34.400> be<00:02:34.489> doing<00:02:34.730> is<00:02:34.819> kind<00:02:34.939> of<00:02:35.060> putting<00:02:35.269> in

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
I'm gonna be doing is kind of putting in

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.449 
I'm gonna be doing is kind of putting in
half<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.780> half<00:02:35.930> over<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.409> paper<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.920> then

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
half and half over the paper and then

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.970 
half and half over the paper and then
putting<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.939> inside<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.629> our<00:02:38.840> exposure<00:02:39.680> box

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
putting it inside of our exposure box

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.710 
putting it inside of our exposure box
and<00:02:40.629> securing<00:02:42.519> then<00:02:43.519> since<00:02:44.480> we're<00:02:44.569> going<00:02:44.659> to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
and securing then since we're going to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.970 
and securing then since we're going to
be<00:02:44.810> doing<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.109> step<00:02:45.319> test<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.680> I'm<00:02:45.739> going<00:02:45.859> to<00:02:45.889> do

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
be doing a step test so I'm going to do

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.349 
be doing a step test so I'm going to do
is<00:02:46.099> take<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> piece<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.549> cardboard<00:02:46.909> that<00:02:47.209> will

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
is take a piece of cardboard that will

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.300 
is take a piece of cardboard that will
block<00:02:47.569> all<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.810> light<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.409> I<00:02:48.739> have<00:02:48.889> some<00:02:49.129> tape

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
block all the light and I have some tape

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.860 
block all the light and I have some tape
on<00:02:49.459> here<00:02:49.669> that<00:02:49.700> will<00:02:49.879> hold<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.269> in<00:02:50.329> place<00:02:50.599> and

on here that will hold it in place and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.129 
on here that will hold it in place and
I'm<00:02:51.260> simply<00:02:51.590> going<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.989> covering<00:02:53.989> a

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
I'm simply going to be covering a

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.289 
I'm simply going to be covering a
section<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:54.859> and<00:02:55.010> only<00:02:55.549> exposing<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.120> just

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
section of it and only exposing it just

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.479 
section of it and only exposing it just
like<00:02:56.419> you<00:02:56.540> do<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.079> enlarger<00:02:58.040> for<00:02:58.459> a

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
like you do in the enlarger for a

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.339 
like you do in the enlarger for a
black-and-white<00:02:59.060> print<00:02:59.510> so<00:03:00.049> I'm<00:03:00.109> going<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.290> go

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
black-and-white print so I'm going to go

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.429 
black-and-white print so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:00.409> and<00:03:00.590> slide<00:03:00.769> that<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.189> and<00:03:02.079> do<00:03:03.079> my<00:03:03.230> first

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
ahead and slide that in and do my first

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:11.050 
ahead and slide that in and do my first
exposure<00:03:03.980> for<00:03:04.280> one<00:03:04.489> minute<00:03:09.579> okay<00:03:10.579> our<00:03:10.849> first

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
exposure for one minute okay our first

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.309 
exposure for one minute okay our first
minute<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.659> up<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:11.959> I'm<00:03:12.019> going<00:03:12.139> to<00:03:12.169> go<00:03:12.260> ahead

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
minute is up so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.009 
minute is up so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:12.470> turn<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.739> off

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
and turn that off

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.050 
and turn that off
open<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.109> bar<00:03:15.319> tray<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.949> then<00:03:16.549> just<00:03:16.819> simply

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
open that bar tray and then just simply

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:25.050 
open that bar tray and then just simply
move<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:17.479> back<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:18.049> small<00:03:18.409> amount<00:03:22.569> hit<00:03:23.569> start

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
move this back a small amount hit start

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.199 
move this back a small amount hit start
and<00:03:26.060> reset<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.629> timer<00:03:26.840> for<00:03:27.139> one<00:03:27.290> minute<00:03:28.209> so

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
and reset the timer for one minute so

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.399 
and reset the timer for one minute so
I'm<00:03:29.269> just<00:03:29.389> going<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.599> do<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.780> several<00:03:30.169> times

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
I'm just going to do that several times

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.559 
I'm just going to do that several times
until<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.769> get<00:03:31.069> it<00:03:31.549> maybe<00:03:31.819> eight<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.359> ten

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
until I get it maybe eight to ten

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.199 
until I get it maybe eight to ten
minutes<00:03:32.690> worth<00:03:33.139> of<00:03:33.349> exposure<00:03:33.889> on<00:03:34.220> our<00:03:34.940> test

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
minutes worth of exposure on our test

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.000 
minutes worth of exposure on our test
strip<00:03:37.449> now<00:03:38.449> that<00:03:38.629> our<00:03:38.750> exposure<00:03:39.109> time<00:03:39.500> is<00:03:39.530> done

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
strip now that our exposure time is done

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.830 
strip now that our exposure time is done
I'm<00:03:40.519> going<00:03:40.699> to<00:03:40.760> go<00:03:40.849> ahead<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.299> remove<00:03:41.449> this

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.839 
I'm going to go ahead and process this
this<00:03:54.829> sheet<00:03:55.099> just<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.489> way<00:03:55.579> that<00:03:55.699> we've<00:03:55.819> done

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
this sheet just the way that we've done

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.210 
this sheet just the way that we've done
all<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.180> our<00:03:56.359> other<00:03:56.510> ones<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.949> one<00:03:58.099> thing

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
all of our other ones and the one thing

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.399 
all of our other ones and the one thing
that<00:03:58.370> I'm<00:03:58.459> not<00:03:58.609> going<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:58.879> do<00:03:59.030> is<00:03:59.239> wait<00:04:00.169> for<00:04:00.199> it

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
that I'm not going to do is wait for it

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.439 
that I'm not going to do is wait for it
to<00:04:00.560> dry<00:04:00.829> I'm<00:04:00.979> going<00:04:01.099> to<00:04:01.220> use<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.699> hairdryer<00:04:01.909> to

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
to dry I'm going to use the hairdryer to

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.599 
to dry I'm going to use the hairdryer to
completely<00:04:02.989> dry<00:04:03.199> it<00:04:03.260> quickly<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.189> that<00:04:04.220> we<00:04:04.400> can

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
completely dry it quickly so that we can

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.610 
completely dry it quickly so that we can
start<00:04:04.849> to<00:04:04.970> determine<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.510> exposure<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.530> we'll

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
start to determine the exposure so we'll

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.030 
start to determine the exposure so we'll
take<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:06.829> look<00:04:07.040> at<00:04:07.159> that<00:04:07.280> in<00:04:07.400> just<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.639> second
