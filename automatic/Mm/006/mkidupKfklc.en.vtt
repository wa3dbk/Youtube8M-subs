00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.240
 this is the most important premiere of 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.870
 year when volkswagen presents a new 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.869
 Golf 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.000
 everyone looks just came out the 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.910
 seventh generation of a car that gave 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.360
 name a whole class now aspires to 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.210
 perfection in terms of weight emission 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.660
 comfort and safety 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.610
 Golf 7 is the first wagen folks on 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.239
 the base of the modular transverse matrix 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.640
 m bq that makes production simpler 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.790
 and reduce costs 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.399
 the transverse matrix allows that over 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.980
 the same architecture we can build 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.800
 different architecture models 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.590
 also means that its principles 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.440
 they adapt to all the factories what we 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.720
 It gives great flexibility so we can 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.350
 build the vehicles that mark are 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.350
 defendants 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.970
 the most important innovation the weight of 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.340
 auto the goal 7 100 kilos lighter than 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.260
 his predecessor and them without resorting to 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.260
 Expensive materials such as aluminum magnesium 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.480
 or carbon generally an increase in the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.540
 safety and comfort goes hand in hand with 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.370
 more weight not like that in golf 7 that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.920
 weighs the same as the model of the fourth 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.400
 generation a technical milestone in the class 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.400
 compact 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.180
 we resort to appropriate technologies to the 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.400
 costs of a golf in its manufacture not 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.070
 We can use expensive materials to 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.080
 reduce weight we achieve with steel 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.150
 High strength and new procedures 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.160
 of manufacturing we are very proud 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.560
 manufacturing steel parts 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.040
 highly resistant and stamped on 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.220
 hot is advanced technology the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.070
 steel is heated to 980 degrees led 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.520
 hot to the press and then cooled to 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.830
 180 degrees in less than 6 seconds the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.310
 Hot stamped parts are six 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.020
 times more rigid than conventional 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.720
 the material can be thinner and for 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.760
 therefore also used lighter 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.090
 custom-made sheets of different thicknesses 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.220
 so material is placed only there where 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.900
 you need it the production is so 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.430
 precise that the tolerance is of a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.500
 tenth of a millimeter 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.250
 so they saved 23 kilos in the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.650
 structure of the body 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.050
 the rigid sheets we use 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.900
 they require a welding technique 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.330
 advanced the parts are already very 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.880
 precise so the benefit is 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.340
 double on one hand weight reduction by 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.830
 other great rigidity of the vehicle both 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.780
 because of the materials like the technique 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.260
 of manufacture and the procedure of 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.260
 welding 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.390
 thus the consumption of the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.209
 golf 7 the most thrifty models 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.610
 They need almost 25% less 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.470
 fuel will also be offered with 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.500
 the whole range of alternative engines 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.660
 from gas going through the hybrid to 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.209
 the electric one that stands out the most is 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.239
 again the bluemotion golf with a 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.269
 Co2 emission of only 85 grams per 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.090
 kilometer and an average consumption of 3.2 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.940
 liters of diesel per 100 kilometers 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.489
 they mark new patterns in their class 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.130
 doubt the new golf 7 is a tip of 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.390
 technology launches both outside and 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.730
 in 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.980
 Martin Winterkorn the president of the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.980
 directory is proud folks wagen 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.990
 in this car nothing rattles
