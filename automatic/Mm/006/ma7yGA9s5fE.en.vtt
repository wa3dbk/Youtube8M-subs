00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
I'll probably only get one male and

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.430 
I'll probably only get one male and
maybe<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.040> few<00:00:38.100> females<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> I'm<00:00:40.140> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.320> keep

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
maybe a few females so I'm going to keep

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.430 
maybe a few females so I'm going to keep
the<00:00:40.559> mail<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.070> tank<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:42.270> because<00:00:42.629> it's

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the mail in this tank just because it's

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.810 
the mail in this tank just because it's
the<00:00:43.530> only<00:00:43.590> thing<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.129> really<00:00:44.250> keep<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.670> in

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the only thing I can really keep it in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.160 
the only thing I can really keep it in
that<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.270> sort<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> monitor<00:00:45.930> everything

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that I can sort of monitor everything

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.290 
that I can sort of monitor everything
and<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.710> will<00:00:46.829> probably<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.190> frightened<00:00:48.090> as

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and this will probably be frightened as

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.520 
and this will probably be frightened as
well<00:00:48.710> what<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.570> breed<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.600> so

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
well what I actually do breed them so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.010 
well what I actually do breed them so
the<00:00:53.190> female<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.329> kept<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.899> in

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the female is going to be kept here in

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
the female is going to be kept here in
the<00:00:55.110> main<00:00:55.289> tank<00:00:55.820> that's<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:56.969> bit

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the main tank that's a little bit

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.990 
the main tank that's a little bit
overexposed<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.930> moment<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:59.000> that's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
overexposed at the moment but that's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.520 
overexposed at the moment but that's
going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.020> I'll<00:01:01.109> quickly<00:01:01.260> to

comes up on the screen there and this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.260 
comes up on the screen there and this
will<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> mail<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.790> well<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.939> might<00:01:21.150> be

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
will be the mail so well this might be

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.310 
will be the mail so well this might be
the<00:01:21.360> mail<00:01:21.540> I'm<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.750> sure<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the mail I'm not sure if I'm going to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
the mail I'm not sure if I'm going to
choose<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.420> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
choose that one but that's just one of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.320 
choose that one but that's just one of
the<00:01:24.509> photos<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:26.100> person<00:01:26.490> sent<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> me<00:01:27.000> so

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the photos that the person sent to me so

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.390 
the photos that the person sent to me so
I'm<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> photo<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.280> this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I'm you can see in the photo that this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460 
I'm you can see in the photo that this
guy's<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.790> she<00:01:29.970> started<00:01:30.450> building<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> bubble

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
guy's like she started building a bubble

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.609 
guy's like she started building a bubble
nest<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.630> hopefully<00:01:33.630> breeding<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.380> well

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
nest so hopefully breeding will go well

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.310 
nest so hopefully breeding will go well
so<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.130> will<00:01:35.369> most<00:01:35.579> likely<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.030> my<00:01:36.750> mail<00:01:36.990> well

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
so this will most likely be my mail well

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.679 
so this will most likely be my mail well
this<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.740> will<00:01:37.829> definitely<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> female

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
this one will definitely be the female

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.300 
this one will definitely be the female
and<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.869> might<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> mail<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.040> choose

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and this might be the mail that I choose

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
and this might be the mail that I choose
so<00:01:41.700> yeah<00:01:42.570> hopefully<00:01:42.810> everything<00:01:43.200> goes<00:01:43.350> well

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so yeah hopefully everything goes well

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.510 
so yeah hopefully everything goes well
