00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hi everyone knows or thunderstorms then 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.180
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.069
 tutorials videos on minecraft seven 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.260
 Tutorial videos will aim to 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.549
 show you how to make this pony a 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.520
 zombie horse or skeleton then 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.359
 can be mounted on it using a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.320
 saddle so of course we will not use 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.170
 no third-party software or mode that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 let's do that but we're going 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.250
 use a command that was 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.100
 introduced in version 1.7 of a thousand 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.590
 leaflets the command this mode that allows 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 to summon creatures or entities 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.539
 object so that's why we're going 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.489
 so use the simone command that will 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.780
 come in this form so slash 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.180
 this mode so that's basic then 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.550
 that's the name of the entity so that's it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:04.430
 the horse entity so a horse titi like 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:08.400
 then we will use the symbol 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.600
 tilde the tilde symbol basically this is the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.270
 little wave that lies that is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.400
 found the green 2 above the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.610
 letter a to z on your keyboard 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.270
 so to make this symbol ild 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.820
 just keep alt gr and two at 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.000
 above the z key and then from 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.240
 to make a space where to use control 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.110
 alt 2 and then make a space to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.720
 nothing in May - alt gr or control alt de 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.540
 return to the same so in my example I 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.439
 will use alt gr spaces and then 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.869
 we will put zero 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.909
 so that's the position x the position 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.270
 x which is actually on our 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.710
 character to us since 7 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.659
 this position helps to say 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.290
 that the spawn horse reassures us so we 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.080
 will do the same thing for y tac and the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.130
 same thing for z 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.770
 then we will make a space and we will 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.620
 open a brace so alt gr more 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.770
 the hug on the 4 above the lld 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:27.860
 letter e and r so we will put times 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:29.000
 tame two dots 1.6 so for 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.360
 show you that this command 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.209
 works we will use a type 0 so 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.709
 there I'm going to come on on the title on 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.140
 the types of horses of which there are five 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.620
 types of horses that range from 0 to 4 so 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.560
 it's 5 so the zero is the horse 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.060
 the 1 selanne 2 is the mule 3 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.570
 it's the zombie and leucate it's the 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.910
 skeleton 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:55.400
 so we'll go first try the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:01.720
 command with type 0 then we go 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:05.180
 say saddle i-stem so that's basically the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:10.329
 lacelle and we will put the idea of ​​the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.040
 saddle idea brace idea of ​​points 329 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.560
 so we close the hug once 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.350
 and twice since we had opened it 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.360
 for the beginning of the order that is 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.590
 find here 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.180
 so there once we typed the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.989
 command on press enter 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.820
 and we can see that a normal horse 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.560
 appeared that we can quite 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:36.140
 show and use it like that so we 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.930
 will use this same principle to make 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.200
 this pony a zombie horse for 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.190
 start so for that so what 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.350
 you do it is that you return 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.850
 in the chat with the commands you 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.290
 press the up arrow and you're fine 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.989
 give you the order previously 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.769
 back so we'll change the type 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.600
 so to start in three is so 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.790
 the zombie 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.970
 so here we press enter and we see 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.690
 a zombie horse 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.780
 this pony with a saddle and we can everything 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.210
 to get on 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.970
 we can even walk around with so 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.970
 a normal horse exactly the same 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.209
 thing 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:21.540
 here and so we're going to do yet 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:26.460
 the same with the skeleton horse 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:29.490
 so flash duet pussy is there instead of 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.790
 put type 3 we'll put type 4 and 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:37.200
 so there the skeleton horse appears on 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.870
 can ride on it can be mounted on it 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.020
 and walk around with both 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.310
 other previous 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.070
 so that was a pretty tutorial 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.750
 short anyway is relatively simple 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.940
 to understand the commands are in the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.610
 description of the video 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.180
 so you can copy and paste the 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.789
 commands to be 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.100
 to control these controls going 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:04.300
 control is on the command and 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.460
 control go on the cat to copy and 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.120
 paste the command directly on your 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.070
 game and not having to retype 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.720
 the entire order 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.050
 as I showed you deaf if you 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.870
 really want and you master rather 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.580
 well what kind of orders so thank you 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.710
