left-hand side facing the base and you
get<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> these<00:00:32.969> computer<00:00:33.360> panels<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.930> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
get the these computer panels in a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.310 
get the these computer panels in a
certain<00:00:34.290> order<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> you'll<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:36.079> colors<00:00:37.079> flash

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
certain order so you'll see colors flash

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.749 
take away bend you want to shoot it at
the<00:01:14.490> tippy<00:01:15.479> top<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> satellite<00:01:16.740> that's<00:01:17.610> on

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the tippy top of the satellite that's on

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.999 
the tippy top of the satellite that's on
top<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> base<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.229> knock<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
top of the base and that will knock a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.300 
top of the base and that will knock a
rock<00:01:20.340> down<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.210> want<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.070> knife<00:01:23.070> or

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
shoot the rock and you follow the rock

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.380 
shoot the rock and you follow the rock
through<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> tunnel<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.299> once<00:01:30.299> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
through the tunnel and so once you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.630 
through the tunnel and so once you
follow<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> rock<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.439> way<00:01:31.650> he<00:01:32.250> comes

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
follow the rock all the way he comes

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.090 
follow the rock all the way he comes
over<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.530> once<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> rock<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.979> in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
over here and then once the rock is in

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.910 
over here and then once the rock is in
place<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.700> hit<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> button<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> then

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
place you then hit a button and then

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.780 
place you then hit a button and then
what<00:01:40.920> happens<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
what happens is that you get the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.230 
what happens is that you get the
cylinder<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> fills<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.979> then<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.189> fill<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
cylinder that fills up then you fill the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
cylinder that fills up then you fill the
cylinder<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:45.750> killings<00:01:46.170> 25<00:01:46.530> zombies<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
cylinder up by killings 25 zombies that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.190 
cylinder up by killings 25 zombies that
aren't<00:01:47.310> near<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.610> area<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.869> once<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
aren't near this area and once the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.410 
aren't near this area and once the
cylinder<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.619> fully<00:01:49.829> filled<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:51.149> then

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
cylinder is fully filled up you then

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.770 
cylinder is fully filled up you then
can't<00:01:51.720> hit<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> switch<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.320> wall<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.689> so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
can't hit a switch on the wall and so

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.209 
can't hit a switch on the wall and so
once<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.020> happens<00:01:55.350> everyone<00:01:55.740> gets<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
once that happens everyone gets the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.859 
once that happens everyone gets the
