00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.480
 Is 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.629
 This time is called real guitar 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.940
 It's as the name suggests. 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:21.210
 After all 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:26.250
 It's OK. For those who can not play 8 guitars, that pattern was included or something 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.200
 It will be converted automatically in the voicing of the guitar by the action that I did 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.410
 Well there are so many so I would like to introduce a little 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.930
 First of all, even if you have to go to the final garden, you can even play the keyboard 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.750
 There is no sound 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.370
 So give me a select guitar here 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.380
 I used a pick, a finger or something like this, but I've written that it's not steel, but it 's a reduced material 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.720
 is not it 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:51.510
 Please give to here Nde consisting of acoustic guitar Dubai Steel 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.920
 Then there are 12 cases after that, but with the pick Tilney 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.129
 is inside 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.000
 Right now 4 colors 4 positive 19 people are very light 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.150
 a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.800
 Now if you listen to it on the keyboard already, you know 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.960
 When it comes to the voicing of a guitar, this is a cross on the right, right ? 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.470
 What is this , yes 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.680
 A tooth and heard another really easy and now of miso 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.310
 When it becomes minor when e flat is made 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.090
 It feels like this is this except in code mode 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.850
 The square and does not come, for example, here keep the Toka solo mode when the turn is not the act 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.590
 Become 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.170
 It is town but 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.220
 It is already good if it is to act 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.700
 It is the position that I want you to keep in mind. 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.180
 nice meet not a little expensive move 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 There will be another one day Restoration will change 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.460
 pane 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.869
 It looks like this 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.760
 It will be multiplied by the six-string limit from 1 string at Yes 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.920
 When listening along the weak now stop 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.900
 All strings are supposed to sound 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.900
 Limit this new 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.420
 I have only one or three issues 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.320
 This is by putting restrictions here 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.819
 I feel light 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.300
 Conversely, one string three strings now 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.260
 4-string 6-string Toka Then say 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.410
 A do not come out only above 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.620
 I'm great good Yes Aeyo around here where 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.920
 I think where you want to go and remember 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.739
 In a 8 it's the next but I will do it 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:36.090
 I feel like Tteyuu immediately practiced contains considerable pattern it is in the er guitar 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.930
 It is this pm This is the abbreviation of the pattern mode, but click it like this 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.730
 Please give me 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.610
 Then, because you have a body in that first this pattern library this state 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.840
 Yes 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:50.220
 Click this to open the pattern library 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.610
 For example, every genre, Imp Basic 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.090
 It's a really basic step 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.600
 Let's go look jazz 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.830
 Hydrochloric acid zone 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.520
 It is why we choose this favorite pattern from this 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.930
 Now if this way and let's go Basic Pikki 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:16.750
 Yes I will represent that of which 3/4 of out 943 points 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:20.130
 56 blown and 16 parts is there I form of the eighth Street toward the ride of door value ordering Tteee 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.760
 8 is it's not going to look at the registration 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.540
 If you do this, there will be lots of different patterns even at such a meeting and you will be choosing 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.020
 It is 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.020
 If this is pulled 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.730
 But it is not turned on only bridge of croton is Yappa was error 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.850
 This putter mode to say why 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.660
 It's did not put here 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.660
 If you put it here 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:48.180
 Looks like this is convenient by high that 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.220
 Because voicing is arranged by hand, it is not necessary to think about voicing to hold down with the keyboard 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.370
 I think it's pretty easy Yes 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.120
 You can choose what you like in Hirosaka , but I'm a woman 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.060
 It is that of this stroke to the story 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.060
 8 process rubber stamp basic poisoning or paint this etc 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.000
 I feel like this 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 It is why me become the pattern to avoid action on the keyboard 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.860
 Destruction 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.860
 Say this 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.510
 I wondered if you like this pattern and drag and drop it as it is 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.320
 Please give 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.660
 Enter the place you want to drive 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.830
 And in I asked to try this play now 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.160
 Then it is not the sound that it is favored , but I can not suppress the voice when it comes to land 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.470
 From 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.910
 I see that after this, please associate this kind of pattern now 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.620
 Only the governor entered 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.940
 later 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.780
 This 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.780
 It is that month 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.620
 a minor 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.320
 It should came out 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.320
 This alone boots 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.610
 How are you 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.500
 In it's terrible stop as after that a little while ago also showed 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.920
 I to this 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.580
 Here are the patterns we heard from the pattern mode 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:12.780
 You can paste 4 patterns according to the situation if you stick 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.550
 Only in a variety of overlapping pitch in on this a little while ago as after Is not it not entering 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.620
 An expression is given 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:23.250
 In the meaning that I said, this guitar's up to now is equivalent to driving 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:28.569
 It is quite often because you can reduce 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.009
 This this to say over eq pump without over Patty really 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.910
 Tei was 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.790
 I think it would be pretty good if the processing 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.670
 I think yes 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:43.470
 It is easy, but this is how to use explanations etc. 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:47.760
 If you are in trouble with the guitar a little bit I think you want to try it 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.450
 Yes I will raise it like this today Thank you very much 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.450
 I did the name of love 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.139
 Hmm 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.219
 Ah ah ah ah
