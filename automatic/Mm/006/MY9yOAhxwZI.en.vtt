00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.710
 consider complex number z equality 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:09.380
 2 upi rooms or z we have their 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:14.150
 polar form they ask us to calculate the 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.160
 dynamic form of zy for it then of 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.270
 the polar form is that the module is 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.340
 2 and the argument is fourth after that 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.560
 you can easily get the shape 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.850
 Trigonometric of zeta which is always 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.050
 the module by parentheses or sin of the 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.050
 argument more 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.320
 sine of the argument 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.570
 I feel more comfortable when I calculate 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.650
 trigonometric ratios of angles that 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.420
 these are in degrees 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.060
 sexagesimal is and therefore it is 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.030
 adequate to pass for me to pass and 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.660
 rooms to degrees and quarters as we know 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.000
 in several options, we translate the foot 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.970
 by 180 degrees in several options 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 also a rule of three and 180 between 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.180
 four then it is 45 degrees then this 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.550
 would be cosine of 45 degrees and sin of 45 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.460
 degrees then well then this then 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.220
 would be 2 and now cosine depp and quarters 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.020
 cosine 45 degrees then that's root of two 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.940
 matches two more and sine of 45 degrees that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.920
 it would also be two party root by 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.950
 two he simply apply the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.979
 distributive property two by root of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.880
 two parties two we would be two root 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.710
 of two parties two more and now two by 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.760
 root of two parties 22 root of 2 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.790
 match for 2 2 and 2 is also going here 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:50.500
 because it's the same we would be part 2 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.230
 following two by the root and this would be 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.740
 the mica wine form of the complex number 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.740
 zeta
