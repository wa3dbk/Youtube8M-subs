00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
first I started off by peeling back some

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.870 
first I started off by peeling back some
of<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.420> black<00:02:28.600> tape<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.290> had<00:02:29.470> some<00:02:29.830> room<00:02:30.670> to

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
of the black tape so I had some room to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.150 
of the black tape so I had some room to
work<00:02:30.910> with<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.870> new<00:02:32.080> plug<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.010> old

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
work with on the new plug and on the old

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.470 
work with on the new plug and on the old
room<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:34.019> know<00:02:35.019> there's<00:02:35.260> probably<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.830> way<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
room I know there's probably a way to

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.949 
room I know there's probably a way to
check<00:02:38.100> which<00:02:39.100> wire<00:02:39.459> goes<00:02:39.489> where<00:02:39.850> I'm<00:02:40.750> kind

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
check which wire goes where I'm kind

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.509 
check which wire goes where I'm kind
just<00:02:41.290> gonna<00:02:41.410> play<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.620> matching<00:02:42.130> game<00:02:42.310> and

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
just gonna play the matching game and

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.990 
just gonna play the matching game and
hope<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.820> works<00:02:43.320> yes<00:02:44.320> there<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:44.739> go<00:02:44.940> all<00:02:45.940> right

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
hope it works yes there we go all right

hope it works yes there we go all right
so<00:02:46.510> I'm<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.320> old<00:02:47.500> one<00:02:47.709> there's<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.070> half

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
so I'm on the old one there's a half

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.810 
so I'm on the old one there's a half
black<00:02:49.150> half<00:02:49.209> white<00:02:49.480> wire<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.320> white<00:02:51.280> wire<00:02:51.519> and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
black half white wire a white wire and

black half white wire a white wire and
now<00:02:52.450> black<00:02:52.870> wire<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:54.640> I'm<00:02:55.120> gonna<00:02:55.360> go<00:02:55.510> ahead<00:02:55.630> and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
now black wire so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.040 
now black wire so I'm gonna go ahead and
connect<00:02:56.380> as<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.590> black<00:02:56.920> one<00:02:57.130> on<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:57.940> new<00:02:58.150> one<00:02:58.330> to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
connect as a black one on a new one to

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.020 
connect as a black one on a new one to
the<00:02:59.140> half<00:02:59.320> black<00:02:59.620> half<00:02:59.920> white<00:03:00.070> on<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.790> old<00:03:00.940> one

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
the half black half white on the old one

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.830 
the half black half white on the old one
and<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.500> green<00:03:02.680> one<00:03:02.800> on<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.850> new<00:03:04.000> one<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.810> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
and the green one on the new one to the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.020 
and the green one on the new one to the
black<00:03:05.170> one<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:07.030> old<00:03:07.209> one<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.680> then<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
black one on the old one and then the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.250 
black one on the old one and then the
red<00:03:10.420> one<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.739> white<00:03:12.010> wire<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.930> Oakland

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
red one to the white wire on the Oakland

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.440 
red one to the white wire on the Oakland
and<00:03:14.590> we'll<00:03:14.769> see<00:03:14.950> how<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.130> goes<00:03:16.230> all<00:03:17.230> right

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and we'll see how that goes all right

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.820 
and we'll see how that goes all right
cut<00:03:19.170> off<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.680> old<00:03:20.010> wire<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.550> mean<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.880> old

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
cut off the old wire I mean the old

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.210 
cut off the old wire I mean the old
sensor<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:24.020> expose<00:03:25.020> some<00:03:25.530> wire<00:03:25.740> on<00:03:26.040> both

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
sensor and expose some wire on both

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.150 
sensor and expose some wire on both
sides<00:03:26.520> so<00:03:26.850> have<00:03:27.470> room<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.650> splice<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.069> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
sides so have room to splice in the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.830 
sides so have room to splice in the
other<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.640> I'll<00:03:29.790> just<00:03:29.970> tape<00:03:30.180> them<00:03:30.270> up<00:03:30.420> and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
other and I'll just tape them up and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.390 
other and I'll just tape them up and
connect<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.500> start<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:31.920> car<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.160> we'll

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
connect it and start the car and we'll

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.740 
connect it and start the car and we'll
see<00:03:32.550> how<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.760> goes<00:03:32.940> from<00:03:33.060> there<00:03:35.090> all<00:03:36.090> right<00:03:36.270> so

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
see how it goes from there all right so

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.350 
see how it goes from there all right so
as<00:03:36.990> you<00:03:37.020> can<00:03:37.200> see<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.680> went<00:03:37.920> ahead<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.360> splice

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
as you can see I went ahead and splice

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.820 
as you can see I went ahead and splice
them<00:03:39.540> together<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.260> then<00:03:40.530> held<00:03:40.709> them

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
them together and then held them

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.170 
them together and then held them
together<00:03:40.980> with<00:03:41.370> electrical<00:03:42.060> tape<00:03:42.230> and

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
together with electrical tape and

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.400 
together with electrical tape and
continually<00:03:45.180> checking<00:03:45.420> on<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.750> referencing

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
continually checking on the referencing

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.520 
continually checking on the referencing
referencing<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.390> old<00:03:49.489> sensor<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:52.170> yeah

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
referencing to the old sensor and yeah

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.690 
referencing to the old sensor and yeah
I'm<00:03:52.709> gonna<00:03:52.830> go<00:03:52.920> ahead<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.130> tape<00:03:53.280> for<00:03:53.580> this

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
I'm gonna go ahead and tape for this

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.610 
I'm gonna go ahead and tape for this
last<00:03:53.940> one<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.510> connect<00:03:55.050> up<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.230> battery<00:03:55.530> and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
last one and connect up the battery and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.280 
last one and connect up the battery and
see<00:03:55.770> how<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:55.980> goes

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
see how that goes

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.800 
see how that goes
all<00:03:58.290> right<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.950> sensor<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.790> plugged<00:04:00.510> back

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
all right so the sensor is plugged back

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.810 
all right so the sensor is plugged back
in<00:04:01.430> my<00:04:02.430> battery<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.820> all<00:04:03.000> connected<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.780> uh

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
in my battery is all connected and uh
