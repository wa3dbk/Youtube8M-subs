00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.910 
comes up on planes so you never come up
and<00:01:23.950> have<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.310> slam<00:01:24.700> through<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.240> waves<00:01:25.420> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and have to slam through the waves and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.320

because it's a displacement hull it can

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.270 
because it's a displacement hull it can
carry<00:01:28.660> an<00:01:28.840> amazing<00:01:29.410> amount<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.709> weight<00:01:29.860> we
