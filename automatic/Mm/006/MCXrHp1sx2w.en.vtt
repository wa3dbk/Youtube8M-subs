that to you so we're gonna go over the
cosmetics<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> lane<00:00:37.110> right<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:38.340> have

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
cosmetics of the lane right now you have

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.180 
cosmetics of the lane right now you have
the<00:00:38.610> dots<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.420> arrows<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.680> dots<00:00:40.920> is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
the dots and you have arrows the dots is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.400 
the dots and you have arrows the dots is
where<00:00:41.370> people<00:00:41.760> set<00:00:42.030> up<00:00:42.060> this<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.900> called<00:00:43.080> a<00:00:43.200> set

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
where people set up this is called a set

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.560 
where people set up this is called a set
up<00:00:43.530> area<00:00:43.920> where<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.730> ready<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.150> go<00:00:45.300> bold

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
up area where you get ready to go bold

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.050 
up area where you get ready to go bold
so<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.380> is<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> approach<00:00:47.040> we're<00:00:47.730> standing

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
so this is the approach we're standing

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.430 
so this is the approach we're standing
on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.330> approach<00:00:48.710> each<00:00:49.710> dot<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.520> five<00:00:50.880> boards

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
on the approach each dot is five boards

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.390 
on the approach each dot is five boards
so<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.490> wanted<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> stand<00:00:54.770> 20<00:00:55.770> you'll

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
so if if you wanted to stand 20 you'll

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.640 
so if if you wanted to stand 20 you'll
be<00:00:56.580> standing<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.630> on<00:00:57.990> the<00:00:58.110> middle<00:00:58.350> dot

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
be standing right here on the middle dot

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.440 
be standing right here on the middle dot
because<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.640> ten<00:00:59.850> boards<00:01:00.060> from<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
because you have ten boards from the

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.360 
because you have ten boards from the
ball<00:01:00.630> every<00:01:00.780> turn<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.860> yet<00:01:02.070> each<00:01:02.340> one

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
ball every turn and then yet each one

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.179 
ball every turn and then yet each one
after<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.240> five<00:01:03.420> boards<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.070> were

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
after that is five boards so if you were

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.830 
after that is five boards so if you were
standing<00:01:05.400> 20<00:01:05.729> you'd<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.180> stealing<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.690> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
standing 20 you'd be stealing on the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.560 
standing 20 you'd be stealing on the
third<00:01:07.050> dot<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.910> stand<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> third

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
third dot and if you stand on the third

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.410 
third dot and if you stand on the third
dot<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.080> stand<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.530> 20<00:01:10.920> well<00:01:11.730> if<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
dot now you stand in 20 well if you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.900 
dot now you stand in 20 well if you
stand<00:01:12.690> in<00:01:12.780> 20<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.410> lay<00:01:14.190> down<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.730> any

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
stand in 20 the lay down for any

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.570 
stand in 20 the lay down for any
structure<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.660> bowlers<00:01:15.960> any<00:01:16.620> any<00:01:17.040> individual

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
structure of bowlers any any individual

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.350 
structure of bowlers any any individual
bola<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.210> 7<00:01:19.140> boards<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.520> stand<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.940> 20

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
bola is 7 boards so if you stand in 20

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
bola is 7 boards so if you stand in 20
that<00:01:21.960> means<00:01:22.260> when<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.010> ball<00:01:23.190> comes<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.580> of
