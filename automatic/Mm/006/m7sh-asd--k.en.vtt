00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.450
 book made by the culture fund 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.229
 economic that he did because of his 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.930
 80 years and good to me to underline it to put 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.940
 post-its I wanted even if I had thousands and 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.090
 thousands of beautiful phrases I did not want 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.369
 scratching or touching it I also have other 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.679
 the wild books then I'm 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.270
 I'm short and now we're going to 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.130
 talk a little bit about what the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.429
 good story the wild book us 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.159
 A 13-year-old boy talks about Juanito 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.009
 who lives with her parents and her sister 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.560
 but one day everything changes and for question 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.020
 that little problem of his sister 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.539
 they have to go live with their 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.780
 best friend and john you have to go to 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.450
 live with an uncle with Uncle you for it 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.480
 this is a little uncomfortable because uncle 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.760
 Tito is a weirdo among us 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.670
 quotes because he is one of those people who 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.459
 they have their house made a library 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.130
 literally living in books you walk and 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.280
 stumbles on books you sleep on books 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.530
 there are books in the bathroom everything is books is 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.360
 a labyrinth of books and good one 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.970
 I would like to be there and johnito 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.400
 despising him is a great challenge for 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.769
 joanito go live with uncle tito without 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.079
 But you have to do it and once you 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.420
 tito uncle arrives received and given 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.950
 realize that there is a change that 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.090
 He realizes he has a power power 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.970
 of doing 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.640
 the books take life to Juanito not him 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.790
 Interested in reading or have you ever been called 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.530
 attention reading but uncle tito 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.720
 is the one who is going to start introducing 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.300
 in this wonderful world of books 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.160
 and the best part is that when I play 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.680
 I start to get into this world what 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.959
 shares with a girl who knows that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.239
 lives in front of tito tito's house 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.280
 good works in front of the house of 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.959
 tito uncle who is called catalina with her 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.030
 even if it's a little bigger 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.489
 chiquilla shares her love for 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.950
 reading and start to see how a 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.709
 very nice friendship between them two no 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.010
 catalina is that person is that reader 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.799
 that always brings some stories not 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.260
 because when you read something but catalina you 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.959
 something else then it's there when 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.700
 you say to see the book is changing or 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.980
 the readers are contributing something to the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.569
 story I do not know is a very very father roll 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.970
 then Uncle Titus when he realizes 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.680
 that joanito already likes to read what 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.629
 like to get lost in the house because 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.879
 literally it was lost like twenty times 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.829
 and had to carry a cow bell 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.660
 to find it he realizes that a 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.300
 Juanito likes to read 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.940
 a mission gives you a job you have to 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.360
 look for a lost book and one would say no 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.000
 Well, not easy if that happens but the 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.400
 thing is that this book does not even have 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.900
 name nobody has read that book is 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.750
 waiting for a person to arrive 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.970
 special and read it is not how it is 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.820
 saying indirectly that book does not 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.820
 you are worthy to read me then it goes more 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.950
 or less this story you as a lover of 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.410
 the books are going to say what else so 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.570
 beautiful not that you see the process of 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.520
 introduction to reading not this to 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.430
 sometimes put work not introduce you the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.830
 reading if most of the time this 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.450
 it tells me there is that you are bored and that 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.670
 they say it because they have not found the 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.280
 book indicated no and this book talks more 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.930
 or less than that of getting into the world of 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.330
 the books to find the book 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.720
 indicated not because the books choose you 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.720
 to you 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.300
 and now it's time to talk about conferences 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.460
 about the rain by juanmi and good this 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.860
 booklet I love the edition is 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.920
 precious is like every little one has 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.080
 60 pages then it's a very reading 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.050
 simple very fluid that is enjoyed 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.510
 enough is read in less than a day I'll 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.340
 I read twice of the same day and well 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.960
 what is it about lectures about the rain 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.350
 this story starts with a 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.060
 lecturer of 50 60 years out there is 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.070
 a lovers librarian is very 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.020
 related to the world of books and 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.210
 everything is he is going to give his lecture not 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.550
 but once he arrives he realizes 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.310
 that he lost his papers where he had all 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.350
 the guide or the ideas that I was going to 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.810
 develop in the talk then it 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.330
 It makes everything nervous but still continues 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.690
 with the conference is already giving its 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.690
 conference 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.600
 he sent me 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.580
 does not have nor is it I started the 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.230
 conference and I start to edit several 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.840
 outstanding works of literature 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.690
 I begin to quote several very cool phrases 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.360
 by the way of my favorites and in that 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.610
 begins to reflect things in your life 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.950
 staff starts talking about the 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.750
 rain on poetry how is it that 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.450
 people or how is it with the poets 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.730
 they begin to distort the sky so 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.800
 it says and in some way or another it starts to 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.080
 replicate what lives day by day we 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.940
 would have personal his love life how is 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.500
 that the books have influenced him 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.270
 then the story starts to take 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.480
 like several roads 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.090
 However, they follow the same idea 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.190
 love the rain the books everything not 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.200
 I want to talk more about the book is very 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.050
 short as to tell you what's going 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.870
 totally in a few words is more than 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.570
 nothing a story of a speaker 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.150
 that from the conference starts to 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.220
 reflect his personal life but still 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.650
 his personal life is related to the 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.480
 conference has phrases of those that 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.240
 you have to reread that you go back to 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.320
 analyze that to see them what sense does not have 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.020
 it's a book 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.270
 short but despite this he says 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.060
 enough stuff that fills you up or is not you 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.520
 you remain unsatisfied so to speak 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.500
 from being a conference it becomes 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.720
 a conversation with a friend or you are no longer 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.300
 You feel like you are talking to a 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.240
 quite broad public you do not feel that 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.920
 you are with him in a cafecito not that you 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.230
 is telling several stories not 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.030
 then this is the magic of the book this 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.300
 is what I love the whole story 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.550
 I think that has been all for today I hope 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.120
 that has not exceeded me as always in 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:28.550
 the reviews are pretty light books 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.950
 pretty simple but at the same time 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.480
 fill do not leave you with this good taste 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.910
 from another I hope you enjoyed 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.190
 much the reviews that give you a 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.870
 opportunity to these two books and then 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.080
 we will be seeing each other more often 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.820
 let's hope that yes, yes, they do 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.819
 that I love you very much I send you a 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:51.530
 huge kiss care bye 

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:51.530
 it's the classic 

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.420
 ace
