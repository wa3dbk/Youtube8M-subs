00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it down the B I'm holding it up at a bit

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.330 
it down the B I'm holding it up at a bit
of<00:00:51.270> an<00:00:51.420> angle<00:00:51.629> running<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.590> down<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.190> you'll

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
of an angle running it down and you'll

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.639 
of an angle running it down and you'll
see<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:54.870> starting<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.410> make<00:00:55.620> a
