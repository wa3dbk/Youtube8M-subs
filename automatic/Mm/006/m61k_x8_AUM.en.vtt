00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.170
 if the stasi I would like there to be a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.690
 word for artists for the purpose 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.420
 the obsession is to make answer and get 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.600
 confuse the arts without borders 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.600
 kind 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.510
 I was originally a musician but 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.769
 playing these are tables I see in 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.519
 painting I am inhabited by music 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.519
 as well as writing 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.360
 I first felt the need to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 to devote myself to several arts to find 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.840
 who deserved to wear at best 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:14.100
 my intentions for me an artist is 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.280
 first a smuggler an antenna the world 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.710
 crosses and what they restore door 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.200
 a trace of subjectivity whatever 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.750
 the tool whatever the material this 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.910
 that I return for my part is a 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.450
 mirror shifted from the real a world that is 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.259
 ours 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.360
 and yet unveils an enchantment a 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.479
 mystery my art is an art that revere 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.899
 nature but as theater of the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.330
 synesthesia the mineral meets the plant 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.290
 the animal 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.290
 nature is embodied 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.530
 my art is in the mythologies 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.840
 but it is Puppets of rigor 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.409
 only transcendence remains 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.899
 mysteries the shadows that rub shoulders with 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.899
 lights and we guess slower 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.040
 my painting is technically based on 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.510
 teaching Flemish but well 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.120
 that value is above all I am looking for a 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.200
 emotional experience of color in 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.410
 working on very palettes 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.310
 marked as in the period of 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.860
 elite programs 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.920
 I consider the work of the cade as 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.080
 part of a whole work there 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.530
 continues and flourishes in three 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.530
 dimensions 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.420
 in parallel painting I work 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.700
 to works in volume stone glass 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.080
 metal wood fabrics 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.910
 my desire would be that with time and the 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.209
 mastery I can conjugate them in 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.209
 symbiosis
