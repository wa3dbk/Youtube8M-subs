00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
there it is right there I like it to be

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.490 
there it is right there I like it to be
it<00:05:36.520> maybe<00:05:36.640> it<00:05:37.450> was<00:05:37.630> if<00:05:37.900> it<00:05:38.020> would<00:05:38.140> look<00:05:38.260> more

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
it maybe it was if it would look more

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.409 
it maybe it was if it would look more
like<00:05:38.560> this<00:05:38.890> red<00:05:39.160> it<00:05:39.310> might<00:05:39.430> show<00:05:39.760> out<00:05:39.940> a<00:05:39.970> little

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
like this red it might show out a little

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.810 
like this red it might show out a little
better<00:05:40.660> but<00:05:41.229> it's<00:05:41.500> kind<00:05:42.190> of<00:05:42.250> just<00:05:42.400> a<00:05:42.520> pointing

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
better but it's kind of just a pointing

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.630 
better but it's kind of just a pointing
not<00:05:42.970> to<00:05:43.150> be<00:05:43.270> able<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.630> see<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.169> ring<00:05:44.380> but<00:05:44.710> you

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
not to be able to see the ring but you

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.420 
not to be able to see the ring but you
know<00:05:45.760> it's<00:05:45.970> quickly<00:05:46.660> overlooked<00:05:47.260> but<00:05:48.100> of

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
know it's quickly overlooked but of

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.780 
know it's quickly overlooked but of
course<00:05:48.669> he's<00:05:48.790> got<00:05:49.950> rotation<00:05:50.950> in<00:05:51.100> his<00:05:51.250> shoulder

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
course he's got rotation in his shoulder

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.030 
course he's got rotation in his shoulder
but<00:05:52.630> it<00:05:52.750> can<00:05:52.870> only<00:05:52.960> go<00:05:53.169> so<00:05:53.410> far<00:05:53.650> because<00:05:53.860> of

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
but it can only go so far because of

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.469 
but it can only go so far because of
this<00:05:54.310> little<00:05:55.270> plate<00:05:55.810> he's<00:05:56.020> got<00:05:56.200> here<00:05:57.270> head<00:05:58.270> go

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
this little plate he's got here head go

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.080 
this little plate he's got here head go
side<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:58.810> side<00:05:59.100> no<00:06:00.100> up<00:06:00.250> and<00:06:00.430> down<00:06:00.580> but<00:06:00.760> it's

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
side to side no up and down but it's

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.580 
side to side no up and down but it's
limited<00:06:01.540> to<00:06:01.570> how<00:06:01.780> much<00:06:01.990> he<00:06:02.110> can<00:06:02.200> go<00:06:02.290> side<00:06:02.560> to

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
limited to how much he can go side to

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.990 
limited to how much he can go side to
side<00:06:02.890> so<00:06:03.190> like<00:06:03.820> I<00:06:03.940> said<00:06:04.560> if<00:06:05.560> you're<00:06:05.970> okay<00:06:06.970> with

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
side so like I said if you're okay with

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.320 
side so like I said if you're okay with
statue<00:06:07.660> figures<00:06:08.169> and<00:06:08.440> he<00:06:08.620> is<00:06:08.740> perfect<00:06:09.150> not<00:06:10.150> too

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
statue figures and he is perfect not too

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.490 
statue figures and he is perfect not too
much<00:06:10.450> articulation<00:06:11.970> there<00:06:12.970> is<00:06:13.150> rotation<00:06:13.900> in

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
much articulation there is rotation in

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.300 
much articulation there is rotation in
the<00:06:14.620> wrist<00:06:14.860> but<00:06:15.850> it's<00:06:16.000> really<00:06:16.690> limited<00:06:16.900> so<00:06:17.320> and

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
the wrist but it's really limited so and

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.570 
the wrist but it's really limited so and
I'd<00:06:18.400> be<00:06:18.550> careful<00:06:18.820> with<00:06:19.060> these<00:06:19.180> guys<00:06:19.240> because

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
I'd be careful with these guys because
