this<00:00:06.149> is<00:00:06.300> my<00:00:06.479> crabapple<00:00:07.200> so<00:00:07.379> today<00:00:07.680> I'm<00:00:07.799> going

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
this is my crabapple so today I'm going

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.590 
this is my crabapple so today I'm going
to<00:00:08.100> work<00:00:08.400> with<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:09.230> and<00:00:10.340> I<00:00:14.330> like<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.389> very

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
to work with this and I like this very

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.109 
to work with this and I like this very
much<00:00:15.809> because<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.529> routing<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
much because it is routing and this is

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.270 
much because it is routing and this is
just

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 
just

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.349 
just
boom

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
boom

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.630 
boom
previously<00:00:23.230> and<00:00:23.849> this<00:00:24.849> fruits<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:26.590> one<00:00:26.890> it's

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
previously and this fruits this one it's

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.990 
previously and this fruits this one it's
green<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.240> then<00:00:28.449> it<00:00:28.480> becomes<00:00:28.990> red<00:00:29.759> turns<00:00:30.759> to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
green and then it becomes red turns to

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.360 
green and then it becomes red turns to
yellow<00:00:31.239> then<00:00:31.599> red<00:00:31.630> so<00:00:32.140> but<00:00:32.920> what<00:00:33.190> I'm

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
yellow then red so but what I'm

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.369 
yellow then red so but what I'm
dissatisfied<00:00:33.579> with<00:00:34.269> this<00:00:34.480> in<00:00:34.750> this<00:00:34.899> third

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
dissatisfied with this in this third

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:43.439 
dissatisfied with this in this third
base<00:00:35.890> it's<00:00:36.190> that<00:00:38.519> it's<00:00:39.519> coiling<00:00:40.030> up<00:00:40.210> and<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:42.449> I

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
base it's that it's coiling up and and I

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.299 
base it's that it's coiling up and and I
would<00:00:43.780> like<00:00:43.900> to<00:00:43.930> create<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.589> new<00:00:44.680> bar<00:00:44.980> in<00:00:45.159> here

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
would like to create a new bar in here

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.259 
would like to create a new bar in here
so<00:00:45.489> I<00:00:46.559> guess<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.769> thing<00:00:48.190> that<00:00:48.370> will<00:00:48.879> be<00:00:49.059> done

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
so I guess the thing that will be done

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.599 
so I guess the thing that will be done
here<00:00:49.540> is<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:51.600> ground<00:00:52.600> layer<00:00:52.809> so<00:00:53.680> does<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.190> work

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
here is to ground layer so does the work

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.869 
here is to ground layer so does the work
for<00:00:54.640> today<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:56.160> although<00:00:57.160> this<00:00:57.609> needs

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
for today now although this needs

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.630 
for today now although this needs
cleaning<00:00:58.500> so<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:01.239> I'll<00:01:01.420> do<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.640> only

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
cleaning so but I'll do the only

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.999 
cleaning so but I'll do the only
reinforce<00:01:08.550> they<00:01:09.550> only<00:01:10.030> clean<00:01:10.270> this<00:01:10.479> part

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
reinforce they only clean this part

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.040 
reinforce they only clean this part
which<00:01:12.009> where<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:12.759> am<00:01:13.000> going<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.570> make<00:01:13.840> the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
which where I am going to make the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.560 
which where I am going to make the
ground<00:01:14.289> layering<00:01:14.910> so<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:17.500> going<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.130> depart

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
ground layering so I'm going to depart

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.200 
ground layering so I'm going to depart
this<00:01:19.570> edge<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:19.869> that<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.380> roots<00:01:20.619> will<00:01:20.800> be

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
this edge so that the roots will be

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.570 
this edge so that the roots will be
coming<00:01:22.210> from<00:01:22.360> here<00:01:22.979> growing<00:01:23.979> here<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.220> then

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
coming from here growing here and then

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.699 
coming from here growing here and then
eventually<00:01:24.759> I<00:01:25.240> will<00:01:25.360> chop<00:01:25.869> this<00:01:26.020> off<00:01:26.080> the

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
eventually I will chop this off the

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.290 
eventually I will chop this off the
original<00:01:27.160> roots<00:01:27.399> so<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:27.880> will<00:01:29.819> remove<00:01:30.819> the<00:01:31.030> bark

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
original roots so I will remove the bark

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:55.920 
original roots so I will remove the bark
here

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:09.310 

so<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.350> is<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.830> great<00:01:58.250> news

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.830 

this<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.619> just

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
this is just

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.720 
this is just
you<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.620> be<00:02:12.739> patient<00:02:12.980> though<00:02:13.370> in

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.820 

removing<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.530> bar<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.260> bonsai

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
removing the bar this is bonsai

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.850 
removing the bar this is bonsai
Patience's<00:02:24.700> GCN's<00:02:25.700> meticulousness<00:02:27.940> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
Patience's GCN's meticulousness the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.009 
Patience's GCN's meticulousness the
characteristics<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:32.239> need<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.569> have<00:02:32.810> in

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
characteristics that you need to have in

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:45.520 
characteristics that you need to have in
your<00:02:33.049> organ<00:02:34.599> boxes

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.670 

so<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:47.060> important<00:02:47.510> side<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.290> top<00:02:48.320> side

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
so the important side is the top side

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.960 
so the important side is the top side
because<00:02:49.070> you<00:02:49.340> have<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.610> make<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:49.910> clean<00:02:50.360> cut

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
because you have to make a clean cut

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.370 
because you have to make a clean cut
yep<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.240> really<00:02:53.510> have<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.840> make<00:02:53.960> a<00:02:54.020> clean<00:02:54.350> cut

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
yep you really have to make a clean cut

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.920 
yep you really have to make a clean cut
at<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.980> stop<00:02:55.370> size<00:02:55.610> because<00:02:56.000> that's<00:02:56.660> where

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
at the stop size because that's where

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.300 
at the stop size because that's where
the<00:02:57.080> roots<00:02:57.320> will<00:02:57.970> grow<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.160> to

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
the roots will grow and you have to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.960 
the roots will grow and you have to
ensure<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.810> have<00:03:02.840> enough<00:03:03.110> gap<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.940> that

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
ensure that you have enough gap so that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.640 
ensure that you have enough gap so that
it<00:03:05.600> will<00:03:05.810> not<00:03:05.990> bridge<00:03:08.410> then<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.620> have<00:03:09.800> to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
it will not bridge then you have to

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.380 
it will not bridge then you have to
scrape<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.710> little<00:03:13.160> bit<00:03:13.370> right<00:03:13.880> after<00:03:14.240> the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
scrape a little bit right after the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.630 
scrape a little bit right after the
green<00:03:14.660> for<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.710> signing<00:03:16.130> one<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.370> have<00:03:16.520> to

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
green for the signing one you have to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.330 
green for the signing one you have to
scrape<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:18.380> ensure<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:21.530> vascular

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
scrape to ensure that the the vascular

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.900 
scrape to ensure that the the vascular
system<00:03:22.520> de<00:03:23.740> vascular<00:03:24.740> city<00:03:24.980> system<00:03:25.640> that<00:03:25.790> is

system de vascular city system that is

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.870 
system de vascular city system that is
going<00:03:25.940> up<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:26.950> forget<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.010> name<00:03:28.220> either<00:03:28.520> silent

going up I forget the name either silent

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.230 
going up I forget the name either silent
or<00:03:29.150> fluent<00:03:29.830> should<00:03:30.830> be<00:03:31.190> removed<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:34.240> the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
or fluent should be removed so that the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.630 
or fluent should be removed so that the
energy<00:03:35.450> produced<00:03:36.290> from<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.650> leaves<00:03:37.390> will<00:03:38.390> I

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
energy produced from the leaves will I

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.710 
energy produced from the leaves will I
need<00:03:40.640> to<00:03:40.790> come<00:03:40.970> over<00:03:41.180> here<00:03:41.330> okay

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.910 

the<00:03:45.720> energy<00:03:46.200> through<00:03:47.210> photosynthesis<00:03:50.209> will

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
the energy through photosynthesis will

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.140 
the energy through photosynthesis will
cannot<00:03:53.240> go<00:03:54.240> down<00:03:54.590> okay<00:03:55.620> cannot<00:03:56.610> go<00:03:56.819> down<00:03:56.970> to

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
cannot go down okay cannot go down to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.949 
cannot go down okay cannot go down to
the<00:03:57.270> roots<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:59.010> energy<00:03:59.370> will<00:03:59.550> be<00:03:59.810> stack<00:04:00.810> up

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
the roots so the energy will be stack up

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.140 
the roots so the energy will be stack up
up<00:04:01.950> here<00:04:02.220> above<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:04.190> will<00:04:05.190> be<00:04:05.490> converted<00:04:06.060> into

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
up here above and will be converted into

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.370 
up here above and will be converted into
loosely<00:04:07.130> then<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.959> since<00:04:09.959> there<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.260> so

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
loosely then the since there is so

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.620 
loosely then the since there is so
you'll<00:04:10.530> hear<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:11.420> okay<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:14.150> that's<00:04:15.150> growling

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
you'll hear this okay so that's growling

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:24.340 
you'll hear this okay so that's growling
Brown<00:04:16.590> leaving<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:19.489> think<00:04:20.489> it's<00:04:20.850> clean<00:04:21.150> enough

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.450 

this<00:04:25.350> needs<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.680> be<00:04:25.740> buried<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.460> ground

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.370 

this<00:04:32.460> one<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.110> Ruthie<00:04:35.100> can<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.400> course

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
this one so that Ruthie can of course

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.180 
this one so that Ruthie can of course
okay<00:04:37.380> so<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.810> options<00:04:40.169> are<00:04:40.290> you<00:04:40.740> can<00:04:40.770> remove

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
okay so the options are you can remove

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.560 
okay so the options are you can remove
this<00:04:41.340> in<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.700> path<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.060> put<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.480> the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
this in this path and put it in the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.920 
this in this path and put it in the
ground<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:43.190> this<00:04:44.190> will<00:04:44.370> have<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.760> do<00:04:44.850> but<00:04:45.780> my

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
ground but this will have to do but my

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.240 
ground but this will have to do but my
choosing<00:04:46.110> option<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:46.680> I'll<00:04:46.860> just<00:04:47.040> put

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
choosing option is I'll just put

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:54.800 
choosing option is I'll just put
something<00:04:49.430> here<00:04:50.430> an<00:04:50.669> extension<00:04:51.390> of<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.650> path

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
something here an extension of the path

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.000 
something here an extension of the path
so<00:04:55.380> that<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:57.750> is<00:04:57.960> still<00:04:58.200> can<00:04:58.440> stay<00:04:58.680> in<00:04:58.889> the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
so that this is still can stay in the

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.430 
so that this is still can stay in the
bends<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.610> do<00:05:00.210> not<00:05:00.450> like<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.810> put<00:05:00.990> this<00:05:01.170> in<00:05:01.320> the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
bends I do not like to put this in the

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.840 
bends I do not like to put this in the
ground<00:05:01.530> because<00:05:01.889> I<00:05:01.980> could<00:05:02.130> not<00:05:02.250> monitor<00:05:02.700> with

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
ground because I could not monitor with

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.570 
ground because I could not monitor with
us<00:05:03.560> maybe<00:05:04.700> it<00:05:05.700> will<00:05:05.970> get<00:05:06.240> some<00:05:06.510> diseases<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.260> I

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
us maybe it will get some diseases and I

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.290 
us maybe it will get some diseases and I
could<00:05:08.580> have<00:05:08.960> easily<00:05:09.960> see<00:05:10.440> it<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:10.830> I'd<00:05:11.639> like

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
could have easily see it so I'd like

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:21.240 
could have easily see it so I'd like
this<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.600> be<00:05:12.810> still<00:05:13.230> on<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.470> bench

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.950 

so<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.729> thing<00:05:22.909> that<00:05:22.940> I'm<00:05:23.180> going<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.539> do<00:05:23.659> is<00:05:23.780> I

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
so the thing that I'm going to do is I

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.610 
so the thing that I'm going to do is I
will<00:05:24.080> put<00:05:24.259> an<00:05:24.500> extension<00:05:24.830> here<00:05:26.349> it's<00:05:27.349> not

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
will put an extension here it's not

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.969 
will put an extension here it's not
enough<00:05:27.949> but<00:05:28.580> anyway<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.210> concept<00:05:29.629> is

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
enough but anyway the concept is

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.260 
enough but anyway the concept is
supposedly<00:05:30.979> put<00:05:31.280> an<00:05:31.400> extension<00:05:31.729> like<00:05:32.060> that

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
supposedly put an extension like that

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.629 
supposedly put an extension like that
and<00:05:32.659> it<00:05:33.379> should<00:05:33.500> be<00:05:33.650> covered<00:05:33.830> so<00:05:34.159> the<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:34.520> it

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
and it should be covered so the so it

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:35.110 
and it should be covered so the so it
shall<00:05:34.789> be

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
shall be

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.219 
shall be
I'll<00:05:35.360> make<00:05:35.720> another<00:05:35.840> one<00:05:36.159> this<00:05:37.159> is<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.490> shoot

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
I'll make another one this is to shoot

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.040 
I'll make another one this is to shoot
anyway<00:05:39.229> that's<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.740> sorry<00:05:40.099> hello<00:05:40.280> make

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
anyway that's the sorry hello make

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:48.580 
anyway that's the sorry hello make
finish<00:05:42.550> clearing<00:05:43.550> this<00:05:46.539> graph<00:05:47.539> or<00:05:48.229> the

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
finish clearing this graph or the

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.020 
finish clearing this graph or the
ground-living<00:05:50.800> so<00:05:51.800> these<00:05:52.250> are<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:52.699> routes

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
ground-living so these are the routes

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.330 
ground-living so these are the routes
that<00:05:53.090> I<00:05:53.330> did<00:05:53.479> not<00:05:53.599> want<00:05:53.770> this<00:05:54.770> one<00:05:55.009> have<00:05:55.219> this

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
that I did not want this one have this

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.270 
that I did not want this one have this
one<00:05:55.840> so<00:05:56.840> if<00:05:57.050> I<00:05:57.199> will<00:05:57.319> have<00:05:57.500> new<00:05:57.710> routes<00:05:58.009> here

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
one so if I will have new routes here

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.200 
one so if I will have new routes here
this<00:05:58.490> will<00:05:58.699> be<00:05:58.879> a<00:05:59.090> new<00:05:59.419> branch<00:05:59.750> and<00:06:00.969> it<00:06:01.969> might

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
this will be a new branch and it might

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.510 
this will be a new branch and it might
appear<00:06:02.569> a<00:06:02.690> municipal<00:06:03.229> trunk<00:06:06.009> so<00:06:07.009> now<00:06:07.159> I<00:06:07.190> have

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
appear a municipal trunk so now I have

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.180 
appear a municipal trunk so now I have
installed<00:06:07.969> the<00:06:08.539> plastic<00:06:10.180> like<00:06:11.180> that<00:06:11.389> point

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
installed the plastic like that point

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
installed the plastic like that point
can<00:06:13.190> be<00:06:13.430> removed<00:06:14.229> but<00:06:15.229> then<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:16.009> next<00:06:16.370> tasty

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
can be removed but then the next tasty

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:38.200 
can be removed but then the next tasty
soil<00:06:24.969> and<00:06:26.409> ensure<00:06:27.409> that<00:06:31.840> that<00:06:32.840> grafted<00:06:37.210> that's

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
soil and ensure that that grafted that's

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.240 
soil and ensure that that grafted that's
the<00:06:38.389> way<00:06:38.509> to<00:06:38.569> do<00:06:39.819> so<00:06:40.849> growly<00:06:41.569> ring<00:06:41.930> and<00:06:42.259> that's

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
the way to do so growly ring and that's

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.180 
the way to do so growly ring and that's
the<00:06:43.550> solution<00:06:43.909> for<00:06:44.449> this<00:06:46.090> problem<00:06:48.009> and<00:06:49.009> the

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
the solution for this problem and the

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.159 
the solution for this problem and the
next<00:06:49.400> is<00:06:49.490> watering<00:06:49.759> and<00:06:50.000> then<00:06:50.360> back<00:06:50.659> to<00:06:50.870> decide

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
next is watering and then back to decide

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.389 
next is watering and then back to decide
this<00:06:51.349> can<00:06:51.590> immediately<00:06:52.250> give<00:06:52.729> up<00:06:52.879> to<00:06:53.000> the<00:06:53.120> Sun
