00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
here my thoughts my feelings my ratings

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.970 
here my thoughts my feelings my ratings
etc<00:00:26.000> so<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.510> look<00:00:27.630> off<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> bat<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.500> does

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
etc so if you look off the bat it does

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400 
etc so if you look off the bat it does
essentially<00:00:29.970> look<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> normal<00:00:30.869> deck<00:00:31.260> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
essentially look like a normal deck of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.870 
essentially look like a normal deck of
cards<00:00:31.830> except<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.309> fact<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.640> it's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
cards except for the fact that it's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.470 
cards except for the fact that it's
green<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.800> normal<00:00:35.100> v<00:00:35.309> decks<00:00:35.550> would<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.910> red<00:00:36.210> or

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
green the normal v decks would be red or

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.650 
green the normal v decks would be red or
blue<00:00:37.020> not<00:00:37.649> exactly<00:00:38.160> green<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.510> main

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660

let's<00:03:17.709> get<00:03:17.889> into<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.220> back<00:03:18.370> design<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:19.329> back

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
let's get into the back design this back

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.710 
let's get into the back design this back
design<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.079> very<00:03:20.169> interesting<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.160> very<00:03:21.720> well

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
design is very interesting and very well

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.370 
design is very interesting and very well
made<00:03:23.349> and<00:03:23.620> thought<00:03:24.220> out<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.660> from<00:03:25.900> here<00:03:26.169> it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
made and thought out so from here it

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.780 
made and thought out so from here it
just<00:03:26.410> looks<00:03:26.709> like<00:03:26.889> there's<00:03:27.069> basically<00:03:27.310> like

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
just looks like there's basically like

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.170 
just looks like there's basically like
little<00:03:28.739> squiggly<00:03:29.739> lines<00:03:29.950> throughout<00:03:30.730> a

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
little squiggly lines throughout a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.559 
little squiggly lines throughout a
mirrored<00:03:32.109> image<00:03:32.349> across<00:03:32.590> here<00:03:33.359> then<00:03:34.359> you<00:03:34.540> have

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
mirrored image across here then you have

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.890 
mirrored image across here then you have
an<00:03:35.019> SWE<00:03:36.060> swe<00:03:37.169> 1902<00:03:38.169> 1900<00:03:39.329> but<00:03:40.329> if<00:03:40.389> you<00:03:40.480> take<00:03:40.720> a

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
an SWE swe 1902 1900 but if you take a

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.220 
an SWE swe 1902 1900 but if you take a
little<00:03:41.109> bit<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.349> a<00:03:41.560> closer<00:03:42.099> look<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:44.019> can

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
little bit of a closer look you can

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.110 
little bit of a closer look you can
actually<00:03:44.440> see<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:45.190> those<00:03:45.370> our<00:03:45.489> hands

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
actually see that those our hands

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.780 
actually see that those our hands
performing<00:03:46.690> different<00:03:47.790> motions<00:03:50.190> with<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.220> deck

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
performing different motions with a deck

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.089 
performing different motions with a deck
of<00:03:52.030> cards<00:03:52.120> all<00:03:52.900> over<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.370> back<00:03:54.609> of<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:56.739> actual

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
of cards all over the back of the actual

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.069 
of cards all over the back of the actual
card<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.699> I<00:03:58.150> think<00:03:58.329> that's<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.569> very<00:03:58.840> nice

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
card and I think that's a very nice

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.909 
card and I think that's a very nice
touch<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.150> perfect<00:04:01.150> for<00:04:01.419> this<00:04:01.629> deck<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.199> cards

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
now as I mentioned before this deck is

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.199 
now as I mentioned before this deck is
an<00:04:05.260> ivory<00:04:05.590> finished<00:04:06.370> deck<00:04:06.699> it's<00:04:06.910> not<00:04:07.060> the
