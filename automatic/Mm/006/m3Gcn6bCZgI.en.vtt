number<00:01:27.810> three<00:01:28.020> well<00:01:28.590> seeing<00:01:29.130> how<00:01:29.159> movie

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
number three well seeing how movie

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.039 
number three well seeing how movie
number<00:01:29.909> three<00:01:30.090> has<00:01:30.299> them<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.539> Europe<00:01:30.899> I<00:01:31.020> think

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
number three has them in Europe I think

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
number three has them in Europe I think
it's<00:01:31.469> kind<00:01:31.649> of<00:01:31.709> a<00:01:31.740> safe<00:01:31.920> bet<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.189> assume<00:01:32.340> what's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it's kind of a safe bet to assume what's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.519 
it's kind of a safe bet to assume what's
gonna<00:01:32.850> happen<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.420> again<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:34.139> makes<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:34.529 
gonna happen but again what makes it

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:36.709 
gonna happen but again what makes it
good<00:01:34.679> is<00:01:34.889> in<00:01:35.069> what<00:01:35.219> comedic<00:01:35.670> ways<00:01:35.999> it<00:01:36.299> happens

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
good is in what comedic ways it happens

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.719 
good is in what comedic ways it happens
and<00:01:36.959> once<00:01:37.409> again<00:01:37.529> the<00:01:37.799> movie<00:01:38.069> really<00:01:38.279> shines

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and once again the movie really shines

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.209 
and once again the movie really shines
in<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.029> comedy<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.689> animation<00:01:40.349> it's<00:01:40.979> got

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
in the comedy and the animation it's got

of the first one I don't think the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.170 
of the first one I don't think the
second<00:03:34.769> one<00:03:34.860> will<00:03:35.040> really<00:03:35.220> sway<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.730> at<00:03:36.030> all

but if you do like the first one the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.470 
but if you do like the first one the
second<00:03:38.370> one<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.610> more<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.030> same<00:03:39.209> great
