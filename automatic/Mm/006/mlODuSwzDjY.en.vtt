00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hi Guys, I'm wondering about the neighborhood that 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.790
 I'm going to record a non- existent tag today. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.290
 details his life in books and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.570
 watch for the first time on the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.429
 justice that is the book the globe route and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.139
 was a North American blogger I did not 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.910
 I know her name no more clothes channel 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.260
 who knows the link down here for you 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.300
 a home information bank without 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.920
 also want to make new credit 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 Who translated the tag into Portuguese? 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 by tactics the final training the team take 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.660
 the sneakers 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.789
 come on the first question of the tag is 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.949
 choose a book for each of your 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.150
 very special care is not 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.009
 because it seems that all the books that the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.570
 sought with my name is maria eduarda 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.180
 I want to get into the books of the program. 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.100
 with mr bm it repeats itself 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.719
 there did not rise from the shelf 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.410
 mysteriously then the first one I 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.210
 I chose 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.670
 I think my homeland because the month 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.120
 runner ran to die if i'm not mistaken 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.550
 same name of the colombo series is the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.070
 first book but it 's pretty big here 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.870
 Mm, right then and there, I think 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.100
 I bought a book a long time ago. 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.890
 very long time 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.840
 Let me put it is October 2010 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.699
 It's beautiful to my face that still does not read. 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.650
 I'm crazy beyond the cast I 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.320
 when I read the synopsis in the bookstore 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.700
 Hail and near my home I 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.710
 I fell in love with the book, I do not have 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 who carry a book and read well in the game and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.010
 You never lived like that. 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.330
 I want to subscribe just do not know when 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.680
 now how I told you already 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.930
 interviewed a reading list one 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.759
 madness but surely it is a series that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.920
 I want to read I do not know how much in volume 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.290
 Vicente received the first is the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.600
 second book for a book that I love 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.310
 it's the scandal of those I adore 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.290
 that heat is a great structure of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.630
 some stories in a synthetic and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.850
 climbing the best of it is also 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.030
 super super cute this book then me 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.189
 I think it will well represent the letter of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.509
 my name is the junk business both she 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.520
 I also picked up another book that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.259
 I love the best feliciana books. 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 which I loved is the great as law of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.590
 red with the blood of Alessandro 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.869
 Veiga already also our 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.610
 preferred he has already released both books 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.380
 They give as milk and corn as dream 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.210
 things that no one knows about 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.070
 reveals in the personal blog down here 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.520
 home someone cares if it's a 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.829
 super super book 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.810
 cool, very good indeed and today I 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.630
 I have a book that I want to read is the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.280
 madame bovary by gustave courbet eu 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.440
 I remember that I got this book, no, no. 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.569
 this is it here is my 13 recently 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.000
 kitchen beirã pernambuco still show 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.310
 in another video but I got this book 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.890
 a bomb in the university library 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.959
 when I got there at the time I did not even 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.430
 reading what other things and such who 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.860
 got the movie, Mandela is over 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.170
 that finished free worshiped is from 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.810
 then return the book to the library 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.970
 obvious ribery for virtuosity reads and there 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.489
 now I bought the book FUNDEB 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.560
 I just want to read, I do not know how much to 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.450
 next is with parade of the video bands 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.400
 of your bookshelf and what is the book is this 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.440
 here I'll make a cut to show 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.970
 For you it's all out of time that she 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.099
 Do not trade in books that are 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.200
 in the fiscal mesh are horizontal 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.040
 I preferred to choose the shelf that is 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.510
 more organized it is this one that gives 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.030
 to start with a street of more 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.890
 specific and for you to train is this 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.379
 the most organized and talking there 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.760
 top of the acit moment will fall on a book 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.819
 by agatha christie because all this one here 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:13.389
 is the collection of the crisis so let's go there 1 2 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:21.190
 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:24.040
 19 21 22 23 and 24 in five months 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.780
 a case of the radar at the same time has already read 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.639
 This book is very cool too. 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.730
 as well as all listings as apple 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.980
 she only pays the author, continuing the next 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.560
 it's a book that's set 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.389
 in your city state or country 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.069
 I chose a book that is set in the 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.130
 my city is in my state and my country 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.900
 at 3min it's only if they come around town 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.489
 bound for clarice lispector is a 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.519
 book chronicles tales 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.380
 anyway the first one that is 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.540
 just clandestine advertising if 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.639
 passes on the reef because the smart collection 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.160
 lived when she was younger and also 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.050
 there are other tales of the book that space 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.180
 in olinda 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.220
 but then I think if it serves a book 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.960
 super cool also next question is 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.630
 choose a book that goes on the site 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.150
 What would you like to know was also 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.190
 super super easy i chose obviously 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.170
 assumed since it is happening in barcelona 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.210
 I'm crazy to meet vaccinating there. 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.400
 much wind shadow of the case of 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.799
 books to fucking make city can be 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.600
 wonderful in the eyes of the reader 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.090
 then this is a place that is very very 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.680
 visiting the next one also has some 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.420
 because it's a book that you choose 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.850
 chose a cover from a googled book 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.680
 Preferred I have not uttered I adore 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.480
 pink gold green on golden flying 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.320
 black I do not really have one 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.910
 preferred 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.650
 so I chose what I think 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.990
 I think it has a beautiful color on the cover that 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.650
 the thigh is an attention that was the bride of the 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.180
 tiger gaucho white tel nor does it remember 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.890
 yet also bought the culture reminds 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.800
 Then comes promotion several times more 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.000
 I bought for the normal price and not 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.770
 I still read it. 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.170
 but his color is very good, he's a 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.480
 orange or red orange like her 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.340
 It was really cool the mixture of colors and 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.200
 next book that brings good memories 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.910
 here was also relatively 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.210
 easy to choose a book relating to 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.830
 dj oxy eyes er this book a lot 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.050
 very cool people are fantasy 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.210
 wonderful I did not even think it was 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.890
 I like it so much back then I just 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.870
 I fell in love with history is one of five 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.190
 star is ours that is geared toward the 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.050
 the juvenile public but it is a 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.450
 very very cool and exciting story 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.190
 so initials great memories because 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.600
 reminds me of my childhood I think 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.520
 Everyone who reads this book is a 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.350
 childhood taste is very cool a lot 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.110
 The book was up for promotion 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.460
 on the website of the hail of the week 9 90 and 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.919
 remembering that you do not know, just look at the 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.050
 people this delivery in the bookstore they do not 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.520
 credit only today for the name of the 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.140
 same thing I do a lot to talk about 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.850
 It's on the side of my house I always ask 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.950
 to deliver to the next is a book that 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.810
 I had trouble admitting good 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.970
 It was also easy because I think 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.080
 I spent about three months has so much still read 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.080
 the cyprus rally 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.150
 Sergio usually blog in a negative way 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.690
 I think it's a business of this book. 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.430
 because the rest and I saw it, I took time to read 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.470
 because I was not going through the story 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.510
 You know what will happen, you know the end. 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.130
 they were not doing me any good with the 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.930
 characters and with what things go 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.730
 So I took five 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.220
 more book if it were not the same south and 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.740
 2 was not able so was 2008 and the last one is 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.840
 which unread book will bring the 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.290
 greater sense of mission accomplished 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.890
 I chose five books. I know everything. 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.320
 good 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.880
 even if you can not five books the 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.700
 first you will get a sense of 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.920
 mission that is the series of 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.020
 matthew young man's ice and fire chronicles 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.270
 I won this box at the end of the year. 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.190
 past of mine had January that I 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.650
 I did not show in an email box any 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.690
 video because I was doing special 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.490
 only to him that never came so i just 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.930
 never showing I'm going to show it all 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.790
 Right and right, I think that everything 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.220
 world already knows but show better 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.260
 Then when I read the books, I do not know. 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.300
 if there where it does not happen then 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.100
 when he read the war of thrones game 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.160
 I was feeling great. 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.080
 fulfilled already written in his and five 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.660
 books in the series I think that you 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.400
 Wonderful feeling and hey, I do not want 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.900
 know who is included in agenda 12 but 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.500
