00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
at a machinist level it's kind of hard

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.880 
at a machinist level it's kind of hard
to<00:02:59.660> seem<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.080> glare<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:03.080> with<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.260> machinist

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
to seem to glare and with a machinist

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.640 
to seem to glare and with a machinist
level<00:03:04.990> you<00:03:05.990> can<00:03:06.200> see<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.800> baby<00:03:07.130> is

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
level you can see that that baby is

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.980 
level you can see that that baby is
three<00:03:09.650> tick<00:03:10.040> marks<00:03:10.400> over<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.880> way<00:03:11.150> and

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.180 

basically<00:03:14.990> this<00:03:15.590> thing<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:16.040> extremely

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
basically this thing is extremely

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.910 
basically this thing is extremely
precise<00:03:16.970> um<00:03:17.830> but<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.950> big<00:03:19.190> deal<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:21.590> has<00:03:21.770> to

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
precise um but the big deal is it has to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.290 
precise um but the big deal is it has to
be<00:03:22.040> leveled<00:03:22.370> with<00:03:22.400> itself<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:22.910> I'm<00:03:23.120> going<00:03:23.270> to

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
be leveled with itself so I'm going to

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.410 
be leveled with itself so I'm going to
get<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.570> leveled<00:03:24.080> up<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.640> then<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:26.060> got<00:03:26.300> to

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
get this leveled up and then I got to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.180 
get this leveled up and then I got to
make<00:03:26.540> sure<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:27.019> turns<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.560> cylinder<00:03:29.950> well<00:03:30.950> this

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
make sure it turns a cylinder well this

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.479 
make sure it turns a cylinder well this
is<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.370> main<00:03:31.700> shaft<00:03:31.970> out<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.420> remote-control

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
is a main shaft out of a remote-control

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.070 
is a main shaft out of a remote-control
helicopter<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:34.730> this<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.209> balancer<00:03:35.810> for

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
helicopter and this is the balancer for

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.470 
helicopter and this is the balancer for
it<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:37.400> just<00:03:37.580> wanted<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:37.940> see<00:03:38.090> if<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.269> got<00:03:38.420> a

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
it and I just wanted to see if I got a

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.830 
it and I just wanted to see if I got a
true<00:03:38.780> shaft<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.560> do<00:03:40.030> it's<00:03:41.030> all<00:03:41.330> be<00:03:41.480> using

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
true shaft and I do it's all be using

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
true shaft and I do it's all be using
this<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.170> calibrate<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.070> delay<00:03:44.530> also<00:03:45.530> this

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
this to calibrate the delay also this

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.100 
this to calibrate the delay also this
one<00:03:46.100> here<00:03:46.370> came<00:03:46.580> out<00:03:46.760> of<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.060> printer<00:03:47.600> or<00:03:47.780> the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
one here came out of a printer or the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.250 
one here came out of a printer or the
guys<00:03:48.290> say<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.680> can<00:03:48.950> get<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.130> printer<00:03:49.550> shaft<00:03:50.260> and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
guys say you can get a printer shaft and

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
guys say you can get a printer shaft and
sure<00:03:51.620> enough<00:03:54.070> this<00:03:55.070> thing<00:03:56.830> can<00:03:57.830> check<00:03:58.100> the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
sure enough this thing can check the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.320 
sure enough this thing can check the
ends<00:03:58.519> but<00:03:59.150> it's<00:03:59.330> it's<00:04:00.230> true<00:04:00.769> too<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:01.970> if<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.180> can

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
ends but it's it's true too so if I can

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.729 
ends but it's it's true too so if I can
get<00:04:02.390> those<00:04:02.540> true<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.080> lathe<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.440> know<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
get those true in the lathe I know the

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.650 
get those true in the lathe I know the
lathe<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:03.950> true<00:04:05.920> well<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:08.000> is<00:04:08.180> it

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
lathe is true well this is it

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.340 
lathe is true well this is it
and<00:04:09.590> all<00:04:09.739> our<00:04:09.950> glory<00:04:10.100> my<00:04:10.610> dad's<00:04:10.880> lathe<00:04:11.630> finally

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
and all our glory my dad's lathe finally

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.130 
and all our glory my dad's lathe finally
put<00:04:12.590> back<00:04:12.620> together<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.430> running<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:14.140> still

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
put back together and running I still

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.719 
put back together and running I still
have<00:04:15.350> some<00:04:15.560> tweaking<00:04:15.920> on<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.310> get<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.580> all

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
have some tweaking on it to get it all

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.300 
have some tweaking on it to get it all
set<00:04:17.060> up<00:04:17.090> properly<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:17.989> some<00:04:18.410> decals<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.130> put

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
set up properly and some decals to put

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.150 
set up properly and some decals to put
on<00:04:19.459> but<00:04:19.900> I've<00:04:20.900> got<00:04:21.080> everything<00:04:21.200> painted<00:04:21.739> put

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
on but I've got everything painted put

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.090 
on but I've got everything painted put
back<00:04:22.370> together<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.500> what<00:04:24.800> she<00:04:24.919> looks

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
back together and this is what she looks

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.060 
back together and this is what she looks
like<00:04:25.160> I<00:04:25.580> know<00:04:26.330> it's<00:04:26.570> not<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.870> original<00:04:27.290> you

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
like I know it's not the original you

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.180 
like I know it's not the original you
know<00:04:28.220> machine<00:04:29.180> color<00:04:29.510> but<00:04:30.320> my<00:04:30.500> son<00:04:30.770> liked<00:04:31.039> it

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
know machine color but my son liked it

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.460 
know machine color but my son liked it
and<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:31.490> do<00:04:31.550> i<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:32.390> board<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.870> got<00:04:33.050> from<00:04:33.229> Lowe's

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
and so do i the board I got from Lowe's

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.990 
and so do i the board I got from Lowe's
and<00:04:33.800> just<00:04:33.950> stained<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.640> put

like I said I might start a version of a
series<00:06:20.870> called<00:06:21.169> pimp<00:06:22.160> my<00:06:22.400> lathe<00:06:22.669> and<00:06:23.260> where<00:06:24.260> I

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
series called pimp my lathe and where I

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.320 
series called pimp my lathe and where I
try<00:06:24.620> to<00:06:24.680> get<00:06:24.890> this<00:06:25.010> thing<00:06:25.280> to<00:06:25.910> make<00:06:26.090> it<00:06:26.240> as

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330
