 but that I love so much what is the 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.450
 kingdom not what after frank being what 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.820
 what is inside that is an album of 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.310
 interactive photos or at least so 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.320
 I have titled myself a photo album 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.120
 interactive so if you want to know 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.650
 how is it inside and how to do it 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.230
 I invite you to keep watching this video 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.030
 although you wind as you see decorating the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.860
 box in the form of a clock and counting its 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.410
 parts on cardboards and I've put a 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.620
 bow with Christmas colors to give 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.420
 a more original touch 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.250
 and good when we open it then we 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.980
 We found this beautiful town 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.690
 Christmas and the bottom of the box that is 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.599
 I made heaven with cardboard 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.810
 Glitter the blue color gives you some 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.340
 little stars and a santa claus flying and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.000
 Well, that's how it would look like 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.310
 sight in general and good the town 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.129
 our with 3-d holiday stickers 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.989
 that some I bought them so after 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.390
 I had to cut out of postcards 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.180
 Christmas because I did not find stickers 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.890
 of houses and well what this has 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.650
 been for leaving the whole box 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.660
 forming a town and our background 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.940
 with artificial ice and with white glue 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.670
 good inside because tucked cards 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.340
 Christmas a gift and just when 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.799
 we remove the gift there is a phrase that 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.140
 put me open I do not know with rubber letters 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.909
 eva of colors and the sky another document 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.780
 in the artificial one that we stick with glue 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.780
 white school 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.629
 the truth that I love how it has been 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.310
 As you can see the stickers are in 3-d for 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.310
 want like a real sea effect 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.080
 and well once seen like this in general 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.150
 What we do is follow the line that 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.690
 to brief and what we found are already 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.640
 photos and I have to have the little arrows 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.489
 to see each piece of paper so what 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.170
 it happened a color bond and well I have 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.370
 put in order as you are seeing from 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.470
 different colors 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.019
 and in addition to putting exposed also by 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.870
 the increase madrileños like this that 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.950
 I feel here 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.349
 and I left my feet from the leaves we have 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.409
 meaning we can create like others 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:13.760
 openings for example the medium in form 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:16.720
 of the book upwards downwards already 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.720
 your imagination 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.640
 and well this is how it has been left to me 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.800
 has been delighted I hope you liked it 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.130
 the idea is to try in the next 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.130
 video 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.060
 as you have seen girls has been a 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.620
 super super original idea at least to 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.890
 I think it 's an original idea 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.440
 and is a very different way of seeing 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.930
 give photos to your friends to you 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.330
 familiar what it is also serves us 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.030
 to put what is another gift and 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.830
 complement the main gift I of 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.020
 I really loved the result 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.490
 is that when I was doing, I said 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.430
 I think I'm going to keep it 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.140
 instead of giving it away it's precious to me 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.850
 I loved it, I really loved it and 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.860
 you can not only use it for Christmas 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.720
 because it has already happened you can also 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.250
 use for the wise men and instead 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.590
 to put a kingdom here, then you can put 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.570
 I do not know a crown of the wise men 'a 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.510
 camel and you can also use it 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.980
 let's go for valentine which is about 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.290
 until the lack of rent and san 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.360
 valentine for a birthday instead of 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.220
 put you can not leave balloons a cake 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.110
 whatever it is really that is a very idea 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.270
 original and that you already know that I opt for 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.190
 the gifts made at the hands of 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.900
 personalized gifts so I hope 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.780
 that you have liked this idea and now 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.900
 wrap it up another one is an idea is something 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.550
 very simple that like this it costs 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.180
 in returning a gift paper always 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:39.150
 put in a Christmas bag simply 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.110
 so that it is the size of the box what 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.110
 we put inside I'll see if I can 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.110
 forgive me 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.750
 and tell me that it's not a very idea 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.050
 original to me I love I found a 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.050
