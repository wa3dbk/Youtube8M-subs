00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
were moving pretty quickly and now they

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:39.520 
were moving pretty quickly and now they
slowed<00:00:31.909> down<00:00:37.359> they<00:00:38.359> don't<00:00:38.570> look<00:00:38.750> like<00:00:38.809> planes

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.010 

I<00:00:52.010> never<00:00:52.670> seen<00:00:53.059> anything<00:00:53.390> like<00:00:53.660> it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.200 

look<00:00:59.650> at<00:00:59.770> that<00:00:59.950> one<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:00.220> back<00:01:00.700> though<00:01:01.030> it's

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
look at that one and back though it's

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.750 
look at that one and back though it's
fading<00:01:01.660> out<00:01:01.810> now<00:01:02.970> and<00:01:03.970> it's<00:01:04.330> like<00:01:04.600> gone<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
fading out now and it's like gone the

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.490 
fading out now and it's like gone the
one<00:01:06.940> in<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.150> front<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:07.600> starting<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.050> fade<00:01:08.290> now

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
one in the front is starting to fade now

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.920 
one in the front is starting to fade now
too<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:11.110> gone<00:01:11.440> now<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:13.360> breeze<00:01:13.660> has

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
too and that's gone now the breeze has

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.320 
too and that's gone now the breeze has
picked<00:01:14.230> up<00:01:14.440> so<00:01:14.740> I<00:01:14.800> suppose<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.520> could<00:01:15.820> be<00:01:15.850> some

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
picked up so I suppose it could be some

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.900 
picked up so I suppose it could be some
sort<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.750> weather<00:01:17.050> balloon<00:01:17.979> or<00:01:18.340> something

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
sort of weather balloon or something

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.810 
sort of weather balloon or something
like<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.090> but<00:01:19.800> I've<00:01:20.800> never<00:01:21.130> seen<00:01:21.490> anything

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
like that but I've never seen anything

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.170 
like that but I've never seen anything
like<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.300> before<00:01:22.570> it's<00:01:23.440> weird<00:01:23.979> real<00:01:24.729> weird

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.830 

I'll<00:01:30.870> can<00:01:31.050> still<00:01:31.800> see<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> another<00:01:33.180> pretty
