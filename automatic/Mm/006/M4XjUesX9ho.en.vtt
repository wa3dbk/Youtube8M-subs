00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:08.210
 and again in this video I will teach you 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.320
 how easy overclocker in the gp 350 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.690
 optimum 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.969
 as long as you have the resignation 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.690
 we do not see or just any solar 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.470
 that has cyanogenmod 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:26.220
 good that is about the club the overclock 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:31.310
 it's a way to emulate at speed 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.310
 that runs the cell processor 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:39.120
 and what this causes the cell phone to go 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.220
 faster if there is any disadvantage 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.550
 obviously 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.940
 that can lower the life or performance of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.740
 his cell phone good to do this we 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.960
 let's go to cyanogenmod settings 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.050
 and here we can see several options like 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.170
 applications screen interface entry 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.270
 protector and down producer is 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.940
 performance we 're going to adjustments of 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.180
 performance will send us a message 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.800
 that says attention threats outside is a 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.330
 your customers who see the performance of the 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.630
 possibly worse system and we give it 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.520
 in accept to see block it we go 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.689
 to cpu settings 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.350
 and we're going to cpu minimum frequency 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.810
 Here we can see that he offers us good 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.820
 you can see well but it offers us 480 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.270
 megahertz which is what is is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.380
 the default 600 600 52 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:46.299
 until 2006 and decided not to 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.070
 I recommend that they exceed 800 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:56.530
 I really do not like to see it blocked 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.530
 but I advise you to put it in 672 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.940
 and they go to the maximum frequency and what 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.940
 they put that in 691 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.019
 and at the minimum frequency 672 gives us a 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.440
 option that says activate the boot no 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.989
 I recommend that you put it because 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.540
 there will always be that frequency now 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.810
 that if you want it to be more 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.680
 fast you can increase it 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.730
 a few you give me the branch 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.109
 how can you do it good you go to tan 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.390
 bmw stack bathroom what does this mean 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:41.090
 it means virtual memory what it does 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.189
 this is simply creating a folder 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.849
 say when said megabytes of 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:50.579
 size and aysÃ©n handle salman that the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.769
 cache of the applications that are in 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.810
 working the only thing that we have to 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:59.880
 to do is give battery changes 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.670
 mv and put 48 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.250
 in this way we select it in 48 and 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.560
 we reset the phone and when 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.130
 restart we can appreciate that it goes more 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.130
 Quick 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.640
 as well as we can use ram with which 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.710
 What does he do 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.840
 compress memory to increase the 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.170
 virtual capacity 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.480
 I do not recommend that you use it because 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.480
 goes 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.670
 to lower or increase my internet mode 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.980
 phone but it will go down ram 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.700
 in this way we can make 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.790
 our phones fontaine order mod 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.349
 go faster 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.349
 well this would be all 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.960
 until next time
