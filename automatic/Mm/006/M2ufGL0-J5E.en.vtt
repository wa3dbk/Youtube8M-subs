00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.440 
have a good idea what you want to do now
if<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:11.099> look<00:00:11.519> at<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.700> screen<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.030> I've<00:00:12.269> got

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
if you look at the screen here I've got

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.850 
if you look at the screen here I've got
two<00:00:12.990> picture<00:00:13.320> boxes

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
two picture boxes

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.560 
two picture boxes
all<00:00:14.219> right<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.610> example<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.330> did<00:00:15.480> in

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
all right the example that we did in

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.529 
all right the example that we did in
class<00:00:15.690> called<00:00:16.139> flip<00:00:16.470> book<00:00:16.710> had<00:00:17.279> one<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.300> what

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
class called flip book had one so what

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.820 
class called flip book had one so what
you<00:00:18.660> would<00:00:18.750> do<00:00:18.900> next<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.320> obviously<00:00:19.650> make

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
you would do next is obviously make

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.439 
you would do next is obviously make
another<00:00:20.039> picture<00:00:20.220> box<00:00:20.550> give<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.090> name<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
another picture box give it a name I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.689 
another picture box give it a name I
called<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> pick<00:00:22.109> new<00:00:22.320> player<00:00:22.529> all<00:00:23.340> right<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
called it pick new player all right and

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.269 
called it pick new player all right and
then<00:00:24.150> let's<00:00:24.300> take<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.480> look<00:00:24.660> at<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.779> code<00:00:25.279> now

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
then let's take a look at the code now

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.990 
then let's take a look at the code now
in<00:00:26.670> your<00:00:27.330> game<00:00:27.710> if<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.800> use<00:00:29.099> two<00:00:29.400> completely

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
in your game if you use two completely

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.640 
in your game if you use two completely
different<00:00:30.269> images<00:00:30.900> you're<00:00:31.140> gonna<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
different images you're gonna have to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.740 
different images you're gonna have to
have<00:00:31.769> another<00:00:32.040> array<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:32.880> gonna<00:00:33.149> cheat<00:00:33.510> here

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
have another array I'm gonna cheat here

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.910 
have another array I'm gonna cheat here
because<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.989> don't<00:00:34.140> want<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> extra

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
because I don't want to do the extra

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.470 
because I don't want to do the extra
work<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.430> I'm<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:35.969> still<00:00:36.239> stick

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
work and I'm just going to still stick

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
work and I'm just going to still stick
with<00:00:36.510> my<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.050> array<00:00:37.350> I'm<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.010> use<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
with my one array I'm going to use that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.100 
with my one array I'm going to use that
for<00:00:38.670> both<00:00:38.850> people<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.390> are<00:00:39.600> racing<00:00:39.989> across

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
for both people that are racing across

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290 
for both people that are racing across
the<00:00:40.320> screen<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.340> would<00:00:41.460> make<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> totally

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the screen you would make a totally

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.440 
the screen you would make a totally
different<00:00:42.719> array<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:44.309> seven<00:00:45.239> eight

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
different array here with seven eight

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.850 
different array here with seven eight
whatever<00:00:45.660> number<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.230> characters<00:00:46.649> you're

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
whatever number of characters you're

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.520 
whatever number of characters you're
going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.430> image<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:49.170> counter

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
going to have in your image the counter

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.869 
going to have in your image the counter
would<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.829> different<00:00:50.160> also<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> had<00:00:50.700> two

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
would be different also if you had two

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.689 
would be different also if you had two
different<00:00:51.320> arrays<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.710> might<00:00:52.920> start<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.489> one

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
different arrays one might start at one

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
different arrays one might start at one
one<00:00:53.910> might<00:00:54.090> start<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.420> something<00:00:54.600> else<00:00:54.870> okay

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
one might start at something else okay

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.880 
one might start at something else okay
but<00:00:55.860> again<00:00:55.980> use<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> different<00:00:56.640> variable<00:00:56.850> there

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
but again use a different variable there

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.860 
but again use a different variable there
when<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.039> load<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.820> your<00:01:00.000> images<00:01:00.420> there

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
when you load it in your images there

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.170 
when you load it in your images there
would<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.379> loops<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.940> for

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
would be two loops here not one one for

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
would be two loops here not one one for
the<00:01:03.270> first<00:01:03.570> picture<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> second

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the first picture and one for the second

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.120 
the first picture and one for the second
now<00:01:05.880> look<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.150> these<00:01:06.240> lines<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.830> would

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
now look at these lines here this would

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.330 
now look at these lines here this would
load<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.430> first<00:01:09.030> picture<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> first<00:01:10.619> set

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
load the first picture of the first set

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.039 
load the first picture of the first set
of<00:01:11.490> pictures<00:01:11.869> into<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.799> player<00:01:14.040> number<00:01:14.430> one

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
of pictures into the player number one

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
of pictures into the player number one
this<00:01:16.049> because<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.619> getting<00:01:16.770> lazy<00:01:17.159> I'm<00:01:17.610> just

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
this because I'm getting lazy I'm just

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
this because I'm getting lazy I'm just
taking<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> same<00:01:18.630> image<00:01:18.960> array<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.530> feeding

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
taking the same image array and feeding

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.850 
taking the same image array and feeding
the<00:01:20.100> first<00:01:20.340> picture<00:01:20.729> into<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.810> player<00:01:22.140> okay

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the first picture into this player okay

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.050 
the first picture into this player okay
so<00:01:22.920> that's<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> second<00:01:23.610> person<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
so that's the second person on the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760 
so that's the second person on the
screen<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.380> different

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
screen so you would have a different

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.160 
screen so you would have a different
name<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.390> resize<00:01:27.840> them

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
name there then you would resize them

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.260 
name there then you would resize them
here<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.890> ready<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> go<00:01:29.340> now<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
here and you're ready to go now in the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.719 
here and you're ready to go now in the
timer<00:01:30.680> because<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.979> two<00:01:32.310> people

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
timer because now you have two people

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.359 
timer because now you have two people
this<00:01:33.420> takes<00:01:33.930> care<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> dancing<00:01:34.950> person

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
this takes care of the dancing person

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.499 
this takes care of the dancing person
for<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> first<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.390> guy

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
for the first one this is a guy

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.020 
for the first one this is a guy

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.000 
I'll comment out for a second but let's
see<00:02:47.510> if<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.780> actually<00:02:47.990> gets<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.500> guys<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.890> go

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
see if this actually gets the guys to go

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
see if this actually gets the guys to go
across<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.460> screen

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.840 

okay<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:58.780> when<00:02:58.990> I<00:02:59.050> press<00:02:59.230> start<00:02:59.680> here<00:03:00.280> they<00:03:00.430> go

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
okay so when I press start here they go

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.580 
okay so when I press start here they go

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
little bit in a second area okay so

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.560 
little bit in a second area okay so
let's<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.710> again<00:03:06.240> all<00:03:07.240> right<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:07.450> that's

let's do it again all right so that's

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
let's do it again all right so that's
the<00:03:07.750> basic<00:03:08.140> game<00:03:09.390> let's<00:03:10.390> do<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.690> again<00:03:13.590> all

where it's red yellow and green and then
when<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.210> turns<00:04:34.419> green<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:34.900> starts<00:04:35.320> so<00:04:35.860> then

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
when it turns green it starts so then

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.190 
when it turns green it starts so then
you<00:04:36.130> don't<00:04:36.310> use<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.520> button<00:04:36.850> okay<00:04:37.419> then<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:38.050> got

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
you don't use a button okay then you got

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.840 
you don't use a button okay then you got
to<00:04:38.320> figure<00:04:38.560> out<00:04:38.680> with<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:38.890> set<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.160> third<00:04:39.520> timer

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
to figure out with a set a third timer

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.180 
to figure out with a set a third timer
when<00:04:40.450> this<00:04:40.660> timer<00:04:40.930> is<00:04:41.080> finished<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.979> kick

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
when this timer is finished to kick

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.580 
when this timer is finished to kick
start<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.669> other<00:04:42.760> timers<00:04:43.210> anyway<00:04:44.110> that

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
start the other timers anyway that

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.860 
start the other timers anyway that
hopefully<00:04:45.130> is<00:04:45.340> some<00:04:45.820> more<00:04:46.030> hints<00:04:46.390> on<00:04:46.630> how<00:04:46.660> you

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
hopefully is some more hints on how you

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.130 
hopefully is some more hints on how you
can<00:04:47.169> make<00:04:47.380> your<00:04:47.860> game
