 in the case is to write 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.610
 Let's select the file to select here 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.040

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.979

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.090
 file at root to omm says we saved the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.340
 archive 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.340
 soon after that soon after that 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.290
 this page 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.270
 soon after that this part here in 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.150
 bass is going to be enabled 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.700
 then you can put it in test mode 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.130
 to verify the data are correct 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.780
 time that will only take the process longer 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.070
 But this can do the way you do. 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.080
 you want to find it better 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.930
 here you will choose the speed 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.360
 I always advise you to choose not to 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.340
 speed does not need to be smaller either 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.280
 but the more low speed the better 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.200
 It's going to be the recording of your dvd, I 'm telling you. 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.870
 Are you going to make you have an original dvd? 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.780
 and you want to preserve it then you do 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.010
 a copy for you to use and preserve the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.200
 So in case you do with 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.690
 speed as small as possible. 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.110
 the lower the higher the recording quality 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.020
 in the media and this will make your 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.090
 your player anywhere you want to 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.520
 you're put this media has a 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.490
 greater use and greater agility and 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.490
 less media wear 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.450
 then you will put the your dvd 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.480
 virgin on drive click here it looks like 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.750

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.080
