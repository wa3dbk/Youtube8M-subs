00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.500
 honey 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.359
 I have not even loved you very much 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.689
 linda is orangina and neither with easy but 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.670
 everything from cadel so is a hairstyle that 

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:57.129
 you looking so looks hard but 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.920
 It's not hard, you just need 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.619
 few comb or brush materials 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.570
 elastic and drops and a little bit of 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:08.429
 Patience, you do it quickly. 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.429
 How about a new look 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.960
 so let's go to the hairstyle I already did 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.390
 Morellia divided the hair into three parts 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.420
 you can do this with the help of a 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.390
 try cable that facilitates a lot of 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.979
 Well, the mouse has this part of the middle and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.039
 this other side 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.220
 so now I'm going to make the other ear of the 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.259
 miley you untangle it right 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.899
 hair you can put it a little 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.270
 moistened with a little gel to 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.819
 that the wires fit well 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.090
 you put on a shawl and pull 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:46.450
 in front of it leaving a bit like this 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.959
 we are going to shape the mini ear 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.700
 this rest of hair that is left 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:56.769
 we'll split it in half so hide 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.160
 your dots to make it look good 

00:01:56.769 --> 00:02:02.940
 Perfect, very well, you twist and 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.940
 puts it into the ear 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.090
 hiding all the hair so now 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.310
 you will pull down and fasten with 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.590
 the color clip of your hair if you 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.010
 have dark hair put grampinho 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.319
 black if you have light hair you 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.050
 places a smaller group that 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.409
 It gets very delicate and not quite straight. 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.200
 looks good you hold you can 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.510
 use one or two staples to stay the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.750
 A very good company will do the same 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.299
 thing with the other marchinha remembering 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.159
 that the size of the ear and the lace will 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.650
 vary according to the size of your 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.650
 hair the bigger your hair is bigger 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.319
 will it stay the ear and the tie to dell 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.190
 had a hair but she decided to donate 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.010
 for children with cancer 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.690
 just as I had a hair now 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.880
 we have smaller hair for that 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.480
 reason but we are super happy for 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.860
 that 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.710
 good now let's do the mining tie 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.720
 You take that middle wick puts the 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:11.180
 elastic science for a little bit 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.360
 turns the elastic and attaches another 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.530
 piece of the same size forming the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.170
 your tie 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.990
 Now we're going to work on that lapse. 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.480
 to make it look perfect 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.550
 the next step is to hide this stain 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.400
 who stayed ahead you will put there 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.830
 back and secure with the grampinhos 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.640
 color of your hair and the hairstyle is 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.700
 ready 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.220
 This little bit requires that affection. 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.820
 that we always have to have for what 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.040
 everything is well done very well 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.990
 you are arranging the sides of your 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.070
 so one is pulling at those 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.170
 well-defined format and the hairstyle is 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.080
 It's not hard to do. 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.520
 You do it because I'm talking. 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.890
 explaining then it takes another 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.950
 A little more if you do it in your house. 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.560
 you take 15 minutes and yesterday theater 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.050
 that everyone thinks you're only hours away 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.020
 doing that it took a lot of work and 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.930
 truth is easy fast now with help 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.720
 brush or a very thin comb 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.680
 you put the tips in the sciences 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.330
 little rebels to stay well 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.550
 right and if you're going to get enough 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.130
 time away from home if you were 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.200
 move quite a lot 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.720
 It is interesting that you put a 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.430
 a little spray so that the fixing 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.200
 get even better 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.390
 but if you were not going to move a lot 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.810
 no need because the hairstyle itself 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.840
 safe and that's it I hope 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.260
 did you like the result? 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.820
 so it 's an easy-to-do hairstyle 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.360
 just have a little patience that 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:54.940
 you then can this en double 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.940
 It's very beautiful, I look like my 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:06.590
