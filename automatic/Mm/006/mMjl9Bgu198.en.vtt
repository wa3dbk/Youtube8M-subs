hello guys welcome to the next tutorial
for<00:00:05.339> Visual<00:00:06.210> C++<00:00:06.480> windows<00:00:07.440> form<00:00:07.740> application

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
for Visual C++ windows form application

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.700 
for Visual C++ windows form application
in<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.330> video<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.750> will<00:00:09.929> show<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.290> how<00:00:10.679> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
in this video I will show you how to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.320 
in this video I will show you how to
play<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.400> beep<00:00:11.700> sound<00:00:12.290> with<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.440> help<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.889> your

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
play a beep sound with the help of your

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.010 
play a beep sound with the help of your
application<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.760> would<00:00:18.539> need<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
application so for that I would need a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:34.940 
application so for that I would need a
button<00:00:19.820> which<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.210> will<00:00:21.510> call<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:29.539> lay<00:00:31.820> deep<00:00:33.920> ok

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
button which I will call it lay deep ok

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.360 
button which I will call it lay deep ok
and<00:00:35.719> when<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.750> press<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.290> button<00:00:37.370> sound

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and when I press this button sound

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.200 
and when I press this button sound
should<00:00:38.760> come

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
should come

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.250 
should come
so<00:00:40.079> now<00:00:40.820> just<00:00:41.820> select<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.360> button<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so now just select this button and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.389 
so now just select this button and
double<00:00:43.680> click<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.379> will<00:00:46.590> lead<00:00:46.739> us<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
double click it so this will lead us to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.840 
double click it so this will lead us to
the<00:00:48.440> event<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.980> button<00:00:50.879> click<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.850> here

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the event of this button click and here

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.460 
the event of this button click and here
you<00:00:54.180> need<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> write<00:00:59.300> console<00:01:00.440> double<00:01:01.440> colon

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
you need to write console double colon

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.940 
you need to write console double colon
beep<00:01:04.700> and

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.569 

break<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.210> break<00:01:10.509> it<00:01:10.539> closed<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.579> now

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
break it and break it closed and now

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.690 
break it and break it closed and now
when<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:13.030> run<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.450> program<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:18.009> will<00:01:18.280> give

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
when you run the program it will give

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
when you run the program it will give
you<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.619> beep<00:01:20.829> zone<00:01:23.460> did<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.640> hear<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:26.939> okay

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
you the beep zone did you hear that okay

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.880 
you the beep zone did you hear that okay
so<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:29.679> is<00:01:29.890> your<00:01:30.130> beep<00:01:30.399> sound<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:35.469> make<00:01:35.860> a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
so this is your beep sound so to make a

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.690 
so this is your beep sound so to make a
good<00:01:36.100> more<00:01:36.939> interesting<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:38.890> will<00:01:39.219> do<00:01:39.429> is

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
good more interesting what I will do is

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.800 
good more interesting what I will do is
I<00:01:40.119> will<00:01:41.250> play<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.459> sound<00:01:43.319> few<00:01:44.319> times<00:01:44.619> by<00:01:45.130> using

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
I will play the sound few times by using

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.880 
I will play the sound few times by using
for<00:01:46.810> loop<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.349> close<00:01:50.679> your

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
for loop like this so in and close your

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.749 
for loop like this so in and close your
beep<00:01:51.130> sound<00:01:51.459> in<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.819> for<00:01:52.060> loop<00:01:52.289> for<00:01:53.289> int<00:01:53.679> I<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.369> is

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
beep sound in a for loop for int I I is

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.490 
beep sound in a for loop for int I I is
equal<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.119> 0<00:01:55.599> and<00:01:56.489> then<00:01:57.489> I<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:57.880> smaller<00:01:58.869> than<00:01:59.229> or

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
equal to 0 and then I is smaller than or

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.179 
equal to 0 and then I is smaller than or
equal<00:01:59.829> to<00:02:00.009> 10<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.759> plus<00:02:01.119> plus<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:06.130> is

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
equal to 10 and I plus plus and this is

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.740 
equal to 10 and I plus plus and this is
your<00:02:06.579> beep<00:02:07.440> sound<00:02:08.440> code<00:02:08.829> and<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:10.149> here<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.720> can

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
your beep sound code and in here you can

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:19.080 
your beep sound code and in here you can
write<00:02:12.060> sleep<00:02:14.639> and<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.750> can<00:02:17.430> sleep<00:02:18.430> for<00:02:18.459> one

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
write sleep and you can sleep for one

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.759 
write sleep and you can sleep for one
second<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:21.269> thousand<00:02:22.269> milliseconds<00:02:25.440> or<00:02:26.440> let's

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
second so thousand milliseconds or let's

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.650 
second so thousand milliseconds or let's
make<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.549> without<00:02:28.650> sleep<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.850> will<00:02:31.090> be<00:02:31.209> faster

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
make it without sleep it will be faster

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.819 
make it without sleep it will be faster
for<00:02:31.690> us<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.950> follow<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.750> beep<00:02:34.989> sound<00:02:35.019> will

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
for us so in follow the beep sound will

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:42.990 
for us so in follow the beep sound will
play<00:02:35.859> ten<00:02:36.700> times<00:02:36.970> let's<00:02:37.600> see<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:41.819> program<00:02:42.819> is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
play ten times let's see and program is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.830 
play ten times let's see and program is
running<00:02:43.389> and<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.920> plays<00:02:48.220> ten<00:02:48.609> times<00:02:48.880> so

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
running and and it plays ten times so

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.720 
running and and it plays ten times so
you<00:02:49.900> can<00:02:50.170> use<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:52.200> application<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:54.370> example

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
you can use this application for example

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.240 
you can use this application for example
if<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.389> have<00:02:55.630> some<00:02:56.130> error<00:02:57.130> or<00:02:57.910> some<00:02:59.519> danger

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
if you have some error or some danger

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.009 
if you have some error or some danger
sign<00:03:03.250> or<00:03:03.579> something<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.109> can<00:03:05.290> use<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:07.019> so

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
sign or something then you can use it so

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.080 
sign or something then you can use it so
I<00:03:08.049> hope<00:03:08.349> you<00:03:08.799> have<00:03:08.919> learned<00:03:09.639> something<00:03:09.940> new
