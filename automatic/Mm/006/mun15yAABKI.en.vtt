00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:14.209
 Good morning, everyone. Today, we are in the picture. 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:18.860
 Or accessories related to photography , lenses or their peripheral devices 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.939
 Generally a lot to talk about today is the deuryeotneundeyo a little bit of a different story once 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.730
 Let's go. 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:28.279
 What I'm talking about as a hobby is the fact that I just titled my convenience 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.410
 When I came across the narrative, I got stuck. 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.590
 Why is it so mostly in Bucheon who is a just, uh, you have a hobby Photo 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.800
 There are a lot of photographers who write 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.940
 Some people blame Dubai for their friend and hobby of udomon racing 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.060
 I will. 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.260
 Some of you are stuck in ladies, 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.970
 I have a versatile hobby, and in the meantime, 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.620
 Most of the members 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.340
 Is it coming even if you release the majority of these people who photographs as a hobby 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.120
 If you do this more 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.120
 I think I can do a little more hobbies. 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:09.550
 There are many cases that fail 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:13.240
 So we keep coming back to our Site Photo 153 site 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:18.130
 You listen and watch and you encourage me a lot . 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.830
 So , if you look at some aspects of those who are hard-working, I am very enthusiastic. 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.520
 The most frightening thing about me is that I 'm an enthusiast. 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:29.080
 The two are theoretically real. 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:33.690
 Actually, professional photographers are crossing the line of pro- visa guards. 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.360
 It's also good enough to go in and out, 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.530
 Pray for a substantial portion of the children 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.240
 Do you think that swimming should be a little bit of a lesson, or is it a novice ? 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.390
 Will you give me a lesson ? 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:51.220
 I'll give you two , but I can not get two . 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.330
 I can not control that much time because I have a relationship 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.600
 I'm talking. 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.369
 So today I wanted to point out once overlooked this one is used as a guide 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.550
 How good is the picture 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.940
 You guys used to say these things in the old days. 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:08.350
 What do you mean, if you take pictures as a hobby, you need something. 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:13.810
 Because of the fact that it was time to write a film about it 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 I usually Hobby Filling value first, then I tip my collar as 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.099
 Murcia has behind yes, then go to the black-and-white photo 5 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.120
 I do not know where to go. 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:28.840
 It's no exaggeration to say that ez is the digital age of the cards these days . 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.349
 The film camera was scrap enough to fit in the hair removal museum. 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.080
 How would you like a word fur in the camera movement, I still film camera, 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.430
 I'm telling you that I think there's more to it. 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.280
 It's kind of fast and slow, and I have to leave the place, 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.000
 I do not think it's a bad feeling for a digital camera. 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.170
 That cover camera is bad or good. That's not it. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.030
 It's a story. 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:56.920
 Obviously once you can think and shoot more , 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.540
 Go and buy a business camera or a compatible camera on a tripod and buy it slowly. 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.160
 Such a taste 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:07.689
 I could keep drinking, or I could have a creative way in my head, 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.220
 For those who write it as a hobby, it is not a point pro. 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:14.030
 I'm talking to you guys. 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.930
 Oh, I did not get time constraints paid the main entrance photographers 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.190
 That's because there's a lot of impatience, because it's going to fit in until the next hour . 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.830
 But when you take a picture as a hobby, those are the things that are diagnosing Haitai. 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.470
 Think of someone you once again far 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:35.360
 There are indeed nicely spread Plus tripod is perfect Landscape sewonotgo corresponding camera 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.220
 Wearing a little movement to put something like a film score Take the cable release 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.380
 Point out kkotah 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.360
 This is why professional photographers are in fact the most envied part of the area 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.780
 You do not need time constraints. 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:53.520
 I'm not too burdened with the practice. 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.720
 Also those who has made three photographs as a hobby is that because the photo-friendly 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.230
 I'm talking. 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.500
 On the other hand, photography is art . 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:08.989
 Where should you go or what Jesus Art Photo Art 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:13.430
 Some people say that some people are not arts . 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:18.979
 It's a mosquito repellent . 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:23.160
 My hobbies are my satisfaction, so the information is even more expensive than just one car 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:27.030
 There's no money, no bike, 30 million won. 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.090
 I did not do anything else . I do not. 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.860
 So how happy are you to photograph as a hobby? 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.990
 Sometimes I have a picture these days and the fact that I'm eating antagonism is a present 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.949
 I do not 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:45.120
 I then studied the past, now picture has been mixed peppers growing professional photos 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:49.259
 I lived with them, and I do not really have a professional photographer. 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.759
 But now, quite the land that I am giving act take pictures receive money 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:55.650
 That's it. 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:05:00.599
 It's been more than a decade since I moved my profession to an advertising agency. 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.190
 So why are so happy every time I talk about dealing with these days, I now picture 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.580
 It 's a photographer. 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:10.030
 If you talk easily, there is a stone wall. 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.270
 So there's no burden on my portfolio 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.430
 But so we want to make the effort to call Kotori every year and yet 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.270
 I am told to do it. 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:23.740
 How happy are you as a friend? 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.740
 This is happening to anyone who works on art as some sort of action. 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.760
 I'm not happy that even in the seam music 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:35.710
 Rather, amateurs who appeal to the 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.940
 I like to say something like this , but I also speak French, but I write it as a hobby. 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.870
 I envy you 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.980
 Because I can do everything I want 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:46.500
 There'll be one that he can be creative pictures Let 's put a picture saliva 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.110
 I can divide it into two . 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:55.390
 I can do creative work 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:06:00.280
 That you have a mind to, I can not live outdoors in an accident and that the window 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:02.930
 Acting like sticking to ask what you can balance how a drill can be anything 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.919
 Secondly, 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.919
 It's a camera. 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.340
 lens 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:19.350
 Is the e-Let's meet that opportunity with this camera anyway electronic machinery 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:23.910
 It's been a while since I've been telling you, 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:28.980
 I gather these things and try to write these again, and this is also a great 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:31.650
 As a hobby, I can boldly say, 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:35.850
 I liked it, and the photos were soft. 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:40.770
 I have also studied the picture is not much, but the study Photo 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:44.460
 I'm rather had this side of the camera equipment and more enthusiasts 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:48.090
 I guess you would have had 2 apartments if you had money . 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.180
 I do not regret it anyway. I did everything I wanted to write. 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.810
 I'm talking about are going to want to rip saw Rip 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:59.130
 So now we can do this lecture. 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:04.920
 This is to speak out after my experience now, our site coater 153 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:09.570
 co.kr more ads haebolkkayo Bar is perfect the first time Lee Ho-seong usually get co.kr 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.320
 Now the lecture itself, here is the baby from depending on what textbooks 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.700
 Not. 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:18.840
 Or rather a lesson in the school for ipsisaeng 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:23.370
 Wherever you are in the wrong category 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.770
 I'm telling you things that came out of my real experience. 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.830
 I think it will be a bigger help. 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:32.820
 Although the total term is different and the term is different from us 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:34.200
 Because I thought these practical experiences would help you more, 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:39.060
 Boldly 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:42.660
 I mean, I jumped into this. 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:46.950
 In front of now , I went to the 2 of Cy and swallowed the saliva. 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:51.150
 Do not let this happen to my staff as I do this. 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:55.200
 Because viewers do not like it so lately. 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.460
 So I have always called the shots side by side within 10 minutes 

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.980
 is 

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.980
 So why do you keep talking on the second part?
