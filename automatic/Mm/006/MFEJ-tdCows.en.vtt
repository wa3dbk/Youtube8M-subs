00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.120
 yes 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello welcome to pokemon shuffle 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.830
 Well, you asked me to show you the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.070
 phases that are called extra with these 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.990
 extra phases have the peculiarity of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840
 that go for time then we have a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.320
 limited time to be able to capture 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.660
 the pokemon then you have to do 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.629
 many eat very fast and I tell you 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.960
 I'm really bad but we're going for 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.610
 Where I'm crazy, I put the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.489
 automatic itself we already see this guy 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.420
 struggles and that psychics and such are going to 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.420
 go legs 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.460
 and I tell you that I'm not very good at doing 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.430
 this kind of phases but good and two 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.510
 minutes above it seems that we are going with 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.300
 weather 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.699
 and I tell you that it's about making many 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.070
 of blows and you do as well better than 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.989
 best 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.989
 if it does not happen to scrub 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.950
 I've already taken that the truth if it's not going to 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.200
 do nothing 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.270
 and I start talking to make the moron 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.700
 then it's normal 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.469
 nothing works and we're hoping that 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.090
 is calling super good if you lose 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.890
 an excuse 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.290
 plus 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.770
 skype the sky that is the curse not 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.049
 addiction 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.509
 good good this is already in super plan 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.820
 good warrior is always good to have a 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.820
 super warrior out there good the question 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.259
 As you can see, I have a friend of mine, it was from the event 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.479
 Well, what do I know if we had it? 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.039
 or because I would do it because I'm not good at it 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.140
 to me is these parts of both where 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.409
 you have to make combos very fast because 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.959
 a fairly simple reason and that is that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.299
 I know another in some degree of color blindness already 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:01.610
 sometimes I see pokemon the same then 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.610
 Of course I have a small problem 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.489
 and look, all I need is that I'm missing the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.360
 pull me for this I would have to invest 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.930
 coins to catch more seconds 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.910
 it's nothing patience that one day I'll do more 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.910
 the rhythm there I do not see anything here 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.400
 I have broken the combo because I am a 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.050
 blanket 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.890
 basically mainly for that 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.890
 to me 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.770
 the truth is that it has surprised me 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.760
 I like it, I like it a lot 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.050
 well to lie down is a few games and 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.120
 over is free is that we really 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.920
 you have to spend a hard time on it and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.120
 Milk that is always very good 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.070
 As you can see, time is ending 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.520
 the fine in the super badly called and that 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.770
 catch skype 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.640
 it's like this you can not work I have a couple 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.640
 of super always 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.480
 look has not missed all of that all of that if 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.880
 you lack good that you can do as me 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.280
 Now, as you can see, I have three jewels 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.840
 it's worth investing it does not deserve the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.660
 I'm sorry I invited the three jewels 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.690
 I'm reserving everything for the future that 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.090
 you can do simply train 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.130
 you know what to put me for example 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.410
 they will go well for the psychic type 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.300
 then train the psychic type 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.160
 to be more powerful in a way 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.920
 that when I hit him jce you will make him more 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.810
 damage is even possible I do not know that 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.090
 get some mega stone that is from 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.640
 psychic type so if I return to 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.930
 it will give you better tuning then it is 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.030
 an example of a little bit of what 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.100
 you can do to avoid having to invest 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.870
 the jewels you already know that jewels is what 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.370
 what is paid for are the micropayments 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.510
 it simply has at stake also you 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.210
 they give them for example every time 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.760
 you get a mega stone they give you one 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.460
 jewel then it's worth it that 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.620
 reserves for the future because if there 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.720
 someone that you want too much and you are 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.730
 costing a lot to get ya 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.280
 I say in this case you have two minutes 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.100
 between nothing to your own 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.840
 make them gain experience for 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.530
 hit harder if you get 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.880
 some pokemon that damages those of fight with 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.070
 mega stone then better than better 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.530
 try to evolve me very fast 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.850
 to justly hurt him in this is 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.290
 what to do is as it is very 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.930
 fast very fast very fast surely 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.310
 Super is very good at doing it 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.020
 super maybe he would have caught 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.120
 directly or at least focused on the 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.889
 capture phase so nothing think 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.650
 released a roll that you do not see to say 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.180
 that you continue training whether they are new or 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.919
 social networks we see ourselves here in the 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.050
 Youtube channel is for you and as 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.050
