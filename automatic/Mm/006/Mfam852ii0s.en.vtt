freaking awesome I want to show you guys
this<00:00:19.630> map<00:00:19.810> this<00:00:19.990> is<00:00:20.170> a<00:00:20.200> halo<00:00:20.950> map<00:00:21.250> there's<00:00:22.090> no

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
this map this is a halo map there's no

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.760 
this map this is a halo map there's no
like<00:00:22.600> Hunger<00:00:22.930> Games<00:00:23.110> to<00:00:23.290> it<00:00:23.380> or<00:00:23.440> anything<00:00:23.590> like

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
like Hunger Games to it or anything like

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.859 
like Hunger Games to it or anything like
this<00:00:23.920> but<00:00:24.160> I<00:00:24.340> did<00:00:24.610> a<00:00:24.640> map<00:00:24.820> like<00:00:24.970> this<00:00:25.119> before<00:00:25.330> it

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
this but I did a map like this before it

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.330 
this but I did a map like this before it
was<00:00:26.020> a<00:00:26.050> halo<00:00:26.380> map<00:00:26.560> and<00:00:26.740> it<00:00:26.800> had<00:00:26.920> kind<00:00:27.130> of<00:00:27.189> like<00:00:27.310> a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
was a halo map and it had kind of like a

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.070 
was a halo map and it had kind of like a
survival<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:27.939> just<00:00:28.090> went<00:00:28.240> all<00:00:28.419> the<00:00:28.689> way<00:00:28.779> around

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
survival it just went all the way around

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.420 
survival it just went all the way around
like<00:00:29.169> that<00:00:29.410> which<00:00:29.500> I<00:00:29.619> think<00:00:29.800> it's<00:00:30.130> just<00:00:30.340> a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
like that which I think it's just a

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.609 
like that which I think it's just a
really<00:00:30.880> really<00:00:31.419> cool<00:00:31.599> design<00:00:31.930> problem<00:00:32.529> with

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
really really cool design problem with

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.350 
really really cool design problem with
that<00:00:32.770> map<00:00:32.920> though<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.220> it<00:00:33.310> was<00:00:33.460> one<00:00:33.790> ring<00:00:34.120> and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
that map though is it was one ring and

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.050 
that map though is it was one ring and
it<00:00:35.020> was<00:00:35.050> very<00:00:35.440> very<00:00:35.650> thin<00:00:36.400> I<00:00:36.430> mean<00:00:36.760> it<00:00:36.820> was<00:00:36.940> like

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
it was very very thin I mean it was like

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.470 
it was very very thin I mean it was like
maybe<00:00:37.780> six<00:00:38.290> blocks<00:00:38.680> then<00:00:39.010> so<00:00:39.579> I<00:00:39.610> it's<00:00:40.390> just

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
maybe six blocks then so I it's just

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.420 
maybe six blocks then so I it's just
something<00:00:40.870> that<00:00:40.900> this<00:00:41.170> is<00:00:41.230> kind<00:00:41.650> of<00:00:41.680> a<00:00:41.829> more

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
something that this is kind of a more

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.099 
something that this is kind of a more
improved<00:00:42.850> on<00:00:43.090> that<00:00:43.270> so<00:00:43.420> if<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:43.600> saw<00:00:43.719> that<00:00:43.750> map

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
improved on that so if you saw that map

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.689 
improved on that so if you saw that map
and<00:00:44.379> you<00:00:44.620> enjoyed<00:00:44.890> it<00:00:45.010> this<00:00:45.100> is<00:00:45.250> definitely

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
and you enjoyed it this is definitely

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.130 
and you enjoyed it this is definitely
one<00:00:45.879> for<00:00:46.090> you<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.570> cool<00:00:46.719> thing<00:00:46.870> about<00:00:46.899> this

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
one for you the cool thing about this

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.360 
one for you the cool thing about this
one<00:00:47.289> it's<00:00:47.500> awesome<00:00:47.800> not<00:00:47.949> only<00:00:47.980> do<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.340> have

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
one it's awesome not only do you have

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.930 
one it's awesome not only do you have
kind<00:00:49.000> of<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.269> you<00:00:50.019> know<00:00:50.079> default<00:00:50.859> look<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.820> it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
kind of the you know default look to it

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.520 
kind of the you know default look to it
here<00:00:52.149> what<00:00:52.269> we<00:00:52.329> call<00:00:52.539> it<00:00:52.629> forest<00:00:52.989> look<00:00:53.230> I<00:00:53.320> guess

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
here what we call it forest look I guess

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.680 
here what we call it forest look I guess
you<00:00:53.949> also<00:00:54.070> have<00:00:54.340> kind<00:00:54.550> of<00:00:54.640> an<00:00:54.760> ice<00:00:55.000> biome<00:00:55.510> as

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
you also have kind of an ice biome as

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.000 
you also have kind of an ice biome as
well<00:00:56.350> as<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:57.300> desert<00:00:58.300> so<00:00:58.660> just<00:00:59.199> really<00:00:59.710> really

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
well as a desert so just really really

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.470 
well as a desert so just really really
cool<00:01:00.250> I<00:01:00.309> think<00:01:00.399> it's<00:01:00.730> survival<00:01:01.179> with<00:01:01.269> maybe

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
cool I think it's survival with maybe

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.329 
cool I think it's survival with maybe
like<00:01:01.719> three<00:01:02.199> people<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:02.710> each<00:01:02.829> person<00:01:03.160> gets

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
like three people and each person gets

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.189 
like three people and each person gets
their<00:01:03.460> own<00:01:03.550> ring<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:04.089> has<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.330> kind<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.510> survive

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
their own ring it has to kind of survive

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.170 
their own ring it has to kind of survive
I<00:01:05.410> think<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.680> would<00:01:05.800> be<00:01:05.830> really<00:01:06.580> cool<00:01:06.940> to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
I think that would be really cool to

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.110 
I think that would be really cool to
watch<00:01:07.360> but<00:01:07.750> with<00:01:08.680> that<00:01:08.860> said<00:01:09.070> just<00:01:09.880> want<00:01:10.060> to

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
watch but with that said just want to

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.760 
watch but with that said just want to
show<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.300> one<00:01:10.660> quick<00:01:10.870> thing<00:01:11.170> before<00:01:11.530> I<00:01:11.560> end

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
show you one quick thing before I end

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.380 
show you one quick thing before I end
this<00:01:11.830> video<00:01:12.010> about<00:01:12.370> this<00:01:12.580> map<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:13.030> don't<00:01:13.330> know

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
this video about this map I don't know

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.520 
this video about this map I don't know
if<00:01:13.480> it's<00:01:13.600> just<00:01:13.660> me<00:01:13.960> if<00:01:14.140> it's<00:01:14.290> because<00:01:14.410> I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
if it's just me if it's because I

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.890 
if it's just me if it's because I
spawned<00:01:14.920> out<00:01:15.189> in<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.610> middle<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.390> ocean<00:01:16.540> I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
spawned out in the middle of the ocean I

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.819 
spawned out in the middle of the ocean I
don't<00:01:17.140> know<00:01:17.200> if<00:01:17.259> it's<00:01:17.380> because<00:01:17.500> I<00:01:17.619> chose

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
don't know if it's because I chose

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.550 
don't know if it's because I chose
freaking<00:01:18.600> creative<00:01:19.600> or<00:01:19.780> what<00:01:20.020> but<00:01:20.290> I<00:01:20.350> did<00:01:20.530> I

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
freaking creative or what but I did I

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.319 
freaking creative or what but I did I
was<00:01:20.799> like<00:01:20.829> underwater<00:01:21.610> in<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.939> middle<00:01:22.150> of<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
was like underwater in the middle of the

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.090 
was like underwater in the middle of the
ocean<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.810> one<00:01:23.140> thing<00:01:23.290> about<00:01:23.409> this<00:01:23.530> water<00:01:23.799> I

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
ocean and one thing about this water I

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.530 
ocean and one thing about this water I
don't<00:01:24.430> know<00:01:24.490> if<00:01:24.579> it's<00:01:24.670> gonna<00:01:24.759> be<00:01:24.939> right<00:01:25.119> here<00:01:25.150> I
