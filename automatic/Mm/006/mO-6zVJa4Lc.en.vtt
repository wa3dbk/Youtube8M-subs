should know actually you know what it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.610 
should know actually you know what it
has<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.300> little<00:00:41.630> so<00:00:41.900> many<00:00:42.079> more<00:00:42.200> features<00:00:42.440> that

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
has a little so many more features that

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.010 
has a little so many more features that
we<00:00:43.010> bumped<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:43.460> up<00:00:43.579> to<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.899> the

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
we bumped it up to the to the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.319 
we bumped it up to the to the
recreational<00:00:45.980> trail<00:00:46.250> adventure<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.120> let<00:00:47.239> me

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
recreational trail adventure and let me

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.340 
recreational trail adventure and let me
tell<00:00:47.449> you<00:00:47.539> why<00:00:47.660> because<00:00:47.809> it's<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:48.230> know

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
tell you why because it's you know

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.779 
tell you why because it's you know
sometimes<00:00:48.710> a<00:00:48.829> little<00:00:48.920> bit<00:00:49.039> difficult<00:00:49.280> to

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
sometimes a little bit difficult to

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.209 
sometimes a little bit difficult to
differentiate<00:00:50.539> between<00:00:50.809> these<00:00:51.620> lower<00:00:51.920> end

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
differentiate between these lower end

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.709 
differentiate between these lower end
models<00:00:52.670> but<00:00:52.850> I'm<00:00:52.940> gonna<00:00:53.059> just<00:00:53.329> point<00:00:53.539> out<00:00:53.660> a

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
models but I'm gonna just point out a

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.900 
models but I'm gonna just point out a
few<00:00:53.809> features<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.829> frontier<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.730> why

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
few features of the frontier and why

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.569 
few features of the frontier and why
maybe<00:00:56.239> it's<00:00:56.449> a<00:00:56.510> step<00:00:56.750> up<00:00:56.960> from<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.590> Explorer

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
maybe it's a step up from the Explorer

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.240 
maybe it's a step up from the Explorer
model<00:00:59.030> which<00:00:59.149> is<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.390> basic<00:00:59.719> beginner<00:01:00.250> first

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
model which is the basic beginner first

the control wing technology in the rear

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.950 
the control wing technology in the rear
which<00:01:12.710> actually<00:01:13.190> is<00:01:13.370> more<00:01:13.790> substantial<00:01:14.090> and
