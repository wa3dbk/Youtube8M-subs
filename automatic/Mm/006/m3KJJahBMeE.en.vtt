Myriad<00:00:14.639> Genetics<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.179> think<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.420> were<00:00:15.540> telling

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
Myriad Genetics I think you were telling

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.010 
Myriad Genetics I think you were telling
me<00:00:15.839> before<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.320> program<00:00:17.300> regarding<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.630> the

bracket G in the breast cancer gene how
is<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> impact<00:00:22.859> 23andme<00:00:23.640> moving

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
is this going to impact 23andme moving

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.339 
is this going to impact 23andme moving
forward<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.650> these<00:00:25.859> patents<00:00:26.369> that

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
forward if we have these patents that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.200 
forward if we have these patents that
basically<00:00:28.349> say<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.220> can't<00:00:29.519> tell<00:00:29.849> people

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
basically say you can't tell people

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.700 
basically say you can't tell people
about<00:00:30.330> their<00:00:30.599> own<00:00:30.779> breast<00:00:31.050> cancer<00:00:31.410> gene<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
about their own breast cancer gene you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.900 
about their own breast cancer gene you
can't<00:00:31.949> tell<00:00:32.189> people<00:00:32.550> about<00:00:32.640> their

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
can't tell people about their

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.310 
can't tell people about their
Alzheimer's<00:00:33.480> gene<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.719> can't<00:00:33.930> tell<00:00:34.140> them

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
Alzheimer's gene you can't tell them

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.350 
Alzheimer's gene you can't tell them
about<00:00:34.440> different<00:00:35.190> aspects<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.059> their<00:00:36.210> own

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
about different aspects of their own

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.729 
about different aspects of their own
genomic<00:00:36.719> map<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.590> already

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
genomic map because it's already

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.069 
genomic map because it's already
patented<00:00:38.329> yeah<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.600> think<00:00:39.780> that's<00:00:39.930> why

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
patented yeah and I think that's why

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.420 
patented yeah and I think that's why
it's<00:00:40.200> being<00:00:40.350> challenged<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.250> now

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it's being challenged now because now

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.340 
it's being challenged now because now
we're<00:00:41.610> seeing<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> advent<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.540> people<00:00:43.079> having

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
we're seeing the advent of people having

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.170 
we're seeing the advent of people having
access<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.190> lot<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.520> information<00:00:45.030> across

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
access to a lot of information across

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.299 
access to a lot of information across
all<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.539> their<00:00:45.809> genes<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.410> far<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> think

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
all of their genes and if far I think

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.369 
all of their genes and if far I think
people<00:00:47.969> say<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.480> been<00:00:48.660> twenty<00:00:48.989> percent<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
people say it's been twenty percent of

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.709 
people say it's been twenty percent of
the<00:00:49.440> genome<00:00:49.680> has<00:00:49.739> been<00:00:49.980> patented<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.570> can

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the genome has been patented now you can

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.540 
the genome has been patented now you can
see<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.410> too<00:00:52.620> far<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> future<00:00:52.980> when

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
see and not too far in the future when

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.160 
see and not too far in the future when
you<00:00:54.239> won't<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.510> able<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.719> learn<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.020> about

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
you won't be able to learn a lot about

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.560 
you won't be able to learn a lot about
your<00:00:55.829> genome<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.430> you're<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.239> like

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
your genome because you're you know like

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
your genome because you're you know like
a<00:00:57.600> company<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.050> 23<00:00:58.469> me<00:00:58.649> we'd<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.039> go

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
a company like 23 me we'd have to go

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.430 
a company like 23 me we'd have to go
license<00:00:59.609> every<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.750> from<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.289> these

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
license every bit from all these

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
license every bit from all these
different<00:01:01.620> organizations<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> lot<00:01:02.879> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
different organizations and a lot of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
different organizations and a lot of
them<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.180> universities<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:04.049> all

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
them are universities it's not all

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
them are universities it's not all
companies<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.010> universities<00:01:05.220> did<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
companies a lot of universities did a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
companies a lot of universities did a
land<00:01:06.450> grab<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.200> grabbed<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.710> lot<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
land grab and grabbed a lot of the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.260 
land grab and grabbed a lot of the
intellectual<00:01:08.549> property<00:01:08.939> that's<00:01:09.060> being

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
intellectual property that's being

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.570 
intellectual property that's being
discovered<00:01:09.659> through<00:01:10.110> our<00:01:10.619> tax<00:01:11.010> dollars<00:01:11.130> which

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
discovered through our tax dollars which

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.890 
discovered through our tax dollars which
we<00:01:11.760> also<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.630> bit<00:01:12.750> dubious

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
we also think is a little bit dubious

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
we also think is a little bit dubious
but<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.580> problem<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.330> be

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
but you know the the problem will be

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.539 
but you know the the problem will be
that<00:01:15.600> companies<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.320> 23andme<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.400> won't

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that companies like 23andme just won't

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.190 
that companies like 23andme just won't
be<00:01:17.640> able<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.909> afford<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
be able to afford to do all of that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
be able to afford to do all of that
licensing<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.610> won't<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:20.970> able<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.270> gain

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
licensing and we won't be able to gain

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450 
licensing and we won't be able to gain

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
access to a broad set of our information

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460 
access to a broad set of our information
because<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.360> Daniel<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.259> do<00:01:25.380> on

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
because of that Daniel what can we do on

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
because of that Daniel what can we do on
a<00:01:25.530> public<00:01:25.830> policy<00:01:26.009> level<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> address<00:01:26.670> some<00:01:27.000> of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
a public policy level to address some of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.050 
a public policy level to address some of
these<00:01:27.180> issues<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> specifically<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
these issues so specifically the the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.580 
these issues so specifically the the
patenting<00:01:30.450> issues<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.020> there<00:01:31.140> are<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> lot

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
patenting issues I think there are a lot

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
patenting issues I think there are a lot
of<00:01:31.619> questions<00:01:32.009> about<00:01:32.280> whether<00:01:32.549> gene<00:01:33.299> should

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
of questions about whether gene should

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.990 
of questions about whether gene should
ever<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.930> patented<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> first<00:01:34.740> place<00:01:35.000> but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
ever be patented in the first place but

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090 
ever be patented in the first place but
that<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> fact<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.590> banned<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
that the fact is they have banned and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.810 
that the fact is they have banned and
now<00:01:38.159> they're<00:01:38.369> there<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
