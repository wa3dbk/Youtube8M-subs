00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.370
 regular since I wake up with 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.619
 very cold and I do not like to be 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.699

 and to get rid of the cold I put on 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.340
 to dance I do not know if you have listened 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.300

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.070

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.360
 I usually like to take a bath 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.400
