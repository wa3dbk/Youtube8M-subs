00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
healthier version of that so let's see

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.930 
healthier version of that so let's see
it<00:03:49.350> salty<00:03:49.740> which<00:03:49.920> I'm<00:03:50.070> not<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.220> big<00:03:50.280> fan<00:03:50.550> of<00:03:50.580> salt

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940
