00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
lucky craft d20 but some of my favorites

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.270 
lucky craft d20 but some of my favorites
are<00:01:12.080> in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.230> more<00:01:13.470> bright<00:01:13.740> chartreuse<00:01:14.250> color

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
are in the more bright chartreuse color

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
are in the more bright chartreuse color
is<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:14.730> the<00:01:14.880> peacock<00:01:15.300> color<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.290> crack<00:01:16.650> and

is like the peacock color the crack and
this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.190> probably<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:17.820> favorite<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> the

more<00:03:33.500> water<00:03:33.769> it's<00:03:34.459> easier<00:03:34.909> to<00:03:35.030> get<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.269> the

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
more water it's easier to get to the

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.969 
more water it's easier to get to the
depth<00:03:35.629> where<00:03:35.840> you're<00:03:36.169> cramming<00:03:36.409> needs<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.829> be

depth where you're cramming needs to be

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.129 
depth where you're cramming needs to be
quicker<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.699> stays<00:03:38.269> there<00:03:38.299> much<00:03:38.659> longer<00:03:38.930> and

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
quicker and stays there much longer and

the depths you can scratch with the

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.750 
the depths you can scratch with the
super<00:03:42.470> long<00:03:42.620> cast<00:03:42.889> I've<00:03:43.069> gotten<00:03:43.340> these<00:03:43.430> baits

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
super long cast I've gotten these baits

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.330 
super long cast I've gotten these baits
down<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.209> his<00:03:44.299> deepest<00:03:44.629> 25<00:03:45.049> feet<00:03:45.319> on<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.590> super

long<00:03:46.459> cast<00:03:46.790> howto<00:03:47.569> tailwind<00:03:48.049> so<00:03:48.229> I<00:03:48.290> have<00:03:48.500> to

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
long cast howto tailwind so I have to

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.159 
long cast howto tailwind so I have to
catch<00:03:48.859> it<00:03:49.069> extra<00:03:49.310> far<00:03:49.519> but<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:50.629> bait<00:03:50.930> will

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
catch it extra far but this bait will

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.339 
catch it extra far but this bait will
get<00:03:51.349> down<00:03:51.500> there<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.709> get<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.010> job<00:03:52.220> done<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.849> I

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
get down there and get the job done so I

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.969 
get down there and get the job done so I
usually<00:03:54.349> throw<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.650> on<00:03:54.799> 10<00:03:55.069> or<00:03:55.159> 12<00:03:55.370> pound<00:03:55.609> line

wrench winch revo but I just use a six
to<00:04:12.319> one<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.680> gives<00:04:13.159> me<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.310> little<00:04:13.400> bit<00:04:13.519> more

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
to one and gives me a little bit more

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.610 
to one and gives me a little bit more
variability<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.389> sometimes<00:04:14.930> actually<00:04:15.439> the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
variability and sometimes actually the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.289 
variability and sometimes actually the
fish<00:04:15.799> like<00:04:15.979> it<00:04:16.159> moving<00:04:16.400> pretty<00:04:16.609> fast<00:04:16.759> actually

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
fish like it moving pretty fast actually

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.539 
fish like it moving pretty fast actually
kind<00:04:18.259> of<00:04:18.320> halfway<00:04:18.500> burn<00:04:18.799> them<00:04:18.919> sometimes<00:04:19.310> so

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
kind of halfway burn them sometimes so

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.640 
kind of halfway burn them sometimes so
let<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.180> fish<00:04:20.329> tell<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:20.690> how<00:04:21.169> they<00:04:21.349> want<00:04:21.469> the
