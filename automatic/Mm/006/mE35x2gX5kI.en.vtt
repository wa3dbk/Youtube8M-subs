so<00:03:50.350> what<00:03:50.530> do<00:03:50.620> we<00:03:50.680> learn<00:03:50.920> here<00:03:51.070> guys<00:03:51.340> we<00:03:51.640> learned

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
so what do we learn here guys we learned

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.030 
so what do we learn here guys we learned
that<00:03:52.030> subtle<00:03:52.570> movements<00:03:53.200> here<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.650> there<00:03:53.830> and

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
that subtle movements here and there and

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.470 
that subtle movements here and there and
everywhere<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:55.540> make<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:56.110> lettering<00:03:56.770> style

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
everywhere can make a lettering style

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.580 
everywhere can make a lettering style
not<00:03:58.480> much<00:03:58.750> different<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.590> control<00:04:00.520> movements

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
not much different and control movements

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.830 
not much different and control movements
precision<00:04:03.270> calculating<00:04:04.270> every<00:04:04.510> move<00:04:04.690> you're

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.200 
precision calculating every move you're
make<00:04:05.130> really<00:04:06.130> makes<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.490> difference<00:04:06.520> not<00:04:07.120> just

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
make really makes a difference not just

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.840 
make really makes a difference not just
rushing<00:04:07.810> through<00:04:07.990> it<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:09.460> tell<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.760> the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.020 
genesis of me taking it to a whole new
level<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.920> when<00:04:12.070> I<00:04:12.100> really<00:04:12.430> start<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.790> slow

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
level is when I really start to slow

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.020 
level is when I really start to slow
down<00:04:13.060> take<00:04:13.570> my<00:04:13.630> time<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.440> really<00:04:15.030> really

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
down take my time and really really

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.300 
down take my time and really really
calculate<00:04:16.600> things<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.110> that's<00:04:17.980> when<00:04:18.280> I

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
calculate things and that's when I

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.970 
calculate things and that's when I
really<00:04:18.700> started<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.090> learn<00:04:19.269> more<00:04:19.480> and<00:04:19.980> you

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
really started to learn more and you

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.880 
really started to learn more and you
know<00:04:21.130> it's<00:04:21.280> common<00:04:21.790> sense<00:04:22.060> stuff<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:23.530> take<00:04:23.710> it

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
know it's common sense stuff you take it

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.160 
know it's common sense stuff you take it
to<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.040> new<00:04:24.220> level<00:04:24.430> we<00:04:24.700> go<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.840> new<00:04:25.990> level

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
to a new level we go to a new level

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.510 
to a new level we go to a new level
that's<00:04:26.440> what<00:04:26.620> it's<00:04:26.740> all<00:04:26.830> about<00:04:26.860> trying

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
that's what it's all about trying

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.180 
that's what it's all about trying
something<00:04:27.790> new<00:04:28.170> slowing<00:04:29.170> down<00:04:29.290> relaxed<00:04:29.860> and

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
something new slowing down relaxed and

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.010 
something new slowing down relaxed and
sometimes<00:04:30.580> we're<00:04:30.760> rushed<00:04:31.540> throughout<00:04:31.840> our

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
sometimes we're rushed throughout our

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.930 
sometimes we're rushed throughout our
day<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.380> we<00:04:32.740> don't<00:04:32.920> take<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.340> time<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.670> relax

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
day and we don't take the time to relax

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.200 
day and we don't take the time to relax
and<00:04:34.270> take<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.540> easy<00:04:34.690> well<00:04:35.640> we<00:04:36.640> do<00:04:36.820> that<00:04:37.000> and

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
and take it easy well we do that and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.610 
and take it easy well we do that and
that's<00:04:37.570> when<00:04:37.780> things<00:04:37.960> really<00:04:38.230> start<00:04:38.560> to

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
that's when things really start to

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.430 
that's when things really start to
happen<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:40.170> that's<00:04:41.170> what<00:04:41.410> it's<00:04:41.530> all<00:04:41.650> about
