00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 they are welcome a new 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.529
 video tutorial on this occasion is I'm going to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.870
 teach what is success so 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.120
 let's start very well let's start defining 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 what is a memory saturated a memory 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.700
 saturated is basically the memory that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 no longer offers the same benefits 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:23.279
 same speed as before offered thus 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.670
 as an example I have this memory if and if 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.220
 for example, any movie happened 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.430
 let's move on to several three I think it's 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.350
 good for this example and as you will see 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.040
 has a speed of 13 to 15 megabytes 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.890
 on average so when a memory is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.140
 very saturated sometimes this may rise 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 a lot and go down and stay down a good 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.110
 time if in this memory is not found 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.750
 so saturated by that information 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.289
 is always going on an average of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.120
 13 to 15 megabytes per second and they 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.190
 I said yes to check if they have a 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.630
 saturated memory should only check 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.930
 this if the line is not constant 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.420
 it's because it's saturated but good 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.270
 I will teach how 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.600
 can remove that saturation what 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.810
 they should do is very simple 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.930
 right click and format the thing is that 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.630
 a fast format what it does is 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.119
 delete all files obviously 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.970
 but if we uncheck the moth and 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.729
 we would create a slow format and a format 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.090
 slow is a format in which 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.750
 basically repair the logical drives 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.000
 your memory is repaired , this is rebuilt 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.440
 It may take a long time depending on the level 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.020
 of saturation and the amount of gigas that 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.649
 store your memory if for example I 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.770
 I have a removable hard disk of some 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:03.289
 300 chairs and to make a format 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.600
 slow you would need about 3 days if you 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.209
 it takes a long time but it would look like new 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.569
 so once this is done we give it to 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.530
 start accepting and we simply wait 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.690
 format to the slow finish as 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.150
 they will see me it does not take me long because 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.740
 this memory as I told you is not 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.480
 so saturated 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.550
 so I hope this video tutorials 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.760
 have served and liked it 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.760
 next
