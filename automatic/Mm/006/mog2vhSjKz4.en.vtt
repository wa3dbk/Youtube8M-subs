00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:13.800
 what happens from seven to five titles like 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
 troya gta online this is only one 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.610
 in a thousand ways if you like this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 video and they want more sunny maybe 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.900
 upload other episodes episodes two or 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.449
 different parts but look at the only thing 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.490
 What you need here is to buy pumps and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.680
 grab cars that look like they look 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.779
 decent not that they look good carlos that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.610
 are not yours if they are yours this was worth 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.199
 mother you do not have to grab cars that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.390
 be from the street cars there 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.860
 find this make sure they are 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.809
 cars that you find cars that do not 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.309
 have a lot of value because there are times 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.200
 If they are personal they will be 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.149
 charging since these expensive ones we are going to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.160
 be exploding if you have any 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.260
 another way to trolling and you have to 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.059
 have the credit tell me there are some 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.890
 comments some other way to walk 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.600
 spoiling but well this is a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.120
 that they sometimes with some friends that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.309
 I went up to the local they know it gave the water not 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.559
 they know so against parents or they exploited them 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.660
 notice all you need to do is grab 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.300
 a car you put on a shore where 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.759
 you can throw the bombs down or 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.410
 bombs where they can not see them 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.520
 what because if you put it on a door 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.950
 will be bastards 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.469
 bring a bomb there you can put them on 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.969
 the tires notice this in this guy 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.890
 of cars disappear when the 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.840
 you put on the rim they do not do what other 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.850
 type of tires but only in this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.189
 car and this car has worked 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.780
 I bring the bomb and down the only bad thing is 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.640
 that is going to be painting you have to go 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.619
 making noise if they have a microphone 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.299
 you have to go talking or just 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.610
 you have to go removing after that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.750
 you have to find your victim make sure 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.909
 from someone who is not moving 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.039
 someone who needs help as if 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.959
 someone is doing a good run 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.179
 which bands connect to the police or that 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.399
 the one running around another person sees 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.409
 save it look here I bring the bomb in 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.599
 the click mobile u and went back 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.220
 I thought that the guy is going to see the bomb and 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.349
 I think he did not see her because he got on 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.390
 normal already when you hear that the oxen 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.549
 they scream or they say they could go through 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.159
 may when you grab a little flight 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.739

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.200
 just look at the fucking link of everything 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:09.629

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.510
 all my friends 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.670

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.349

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.090
 He said to 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.069

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.580
 if you do not notice, I think they voted there are three 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.860
 thousand and the other two thousand five hundred I know that 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.720
 There lost five thousand five hundred 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.519
 to explode personal cars because 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.050
 I'm telling you, you have to grab cars 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.060
 from the street because if you do not go you're going to 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.739
 cost a lot or if you're one of the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.780
 people who make the clichés that you 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.890

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.140
 I did it 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.269
 Without money, it does not matter, do not look 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.130

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.930

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.090
 they ask why are you bringing a bomb already 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.250
 we have to throw something index of the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.200

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.630
