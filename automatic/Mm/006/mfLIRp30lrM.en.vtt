00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
that I use for my manga leader comic

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.100 
that I use for my manga leader comic
book<00:00:33.530> paper<00:00:33.910> has<00:00:34.910> all<00:00:35.210> this<00:00:35.390> Japanese<00:00:35.840> stuff

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
book paper has all this Japanese stuff

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.250 
book paper has all this Japanese stuff
that<00:00:36.350> I<00:00:36.530> cannot<00:00:37.160> read<00:00:37.539> but<00:00:38.539> I<00:00:38.570> buy<00:00:38.809> you<00:00:39.140> know

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
that I cannot read but I buy you know

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.509 
that I cannot read but I buy you know
type<00:00:39.500> a<00:00:39.770> be<00:00:40.370> for<00:00:41.530> your<00:00:42.530> different<00:00:42.949> weights<00:00:43.159> and

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
type a be for your different weights and

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.479 
type a be for your different weights and
I<00:00:43.789> think<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.030> heavier<00:00:44.329> it<00:00:44.390> is<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:45.249> less<00:00:46.249> like

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
I think the heavier it is the less like

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.739 
I think the heavier it is the less like
it<00:00:46.699> that's<00:00:47.059> likely<00:00:47.390> it<00:00:47.629> is<00:00:47.719> to<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.350> know<00:00:49.749> jerk

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
it that's likely it is to you know jerk

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.189 
it that's likely it is to you know jerk
off<00:00:51.019> or<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.679> know<00:00:51.769> it's<00:00:51.920> here<00:00:52.329> any<00:00:53.329> racing<00:00:53.899> and

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
off or you know it's here any racing and

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.319 
off or you know it's here any racing and
stuff<00:00:54.379> like<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:55.670> heavier<00:00:55.909> it<00:00:55.999> is<00:00:56.149> the

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
stuff like that the heavier it is the

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.529 
stuff like that the heavier it is the
better<00:00:56.479> but<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:56.989> think<00:00:57.409> heavier<00:00:57.829> paper<00:00:58.579> just

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
better but I think heavier paper just

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.979 
better but I think heavier paper just
costs<00:00:59.960> just<00:01:00.679> a<00:01:01.129> little<00:01:01.729> bit<00:01:01.879> more<00:01:02.089> so<00:01:02.749> I'm<00:01:02.870> just

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
costs just a little bit more so I'm just

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.810 
costs just a little bit more so I'm just
going<00:01:03.139> to<00:01:03.199> open<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:03.499> up<00:01:03.679> and<00:01:03.949> I'll<00:01:04.640> show<00:01:04.670> you

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
like you're no guidelines on it so you

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.169 
like you're no guidelines on it so you
can<00:02:06.649> still<00:02:06.799> use<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.039> but<00:02:07.219> generally<00:02:07.909> I<00:02:07.939> like<00:02:08.030> to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
so I cut it off on a computer and I work

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.010 
so I cut it off on a computer and I work
with<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.870> know<00:02:37.900> from<00:02:38.320> here<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:40.330> from<00:02:40.870> before

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
goes obviously goes around the paper and

say if I pick a I pick a tool and that
there<00:02:53.740> is<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.890> shoe<00:02:54.550> at<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.790> bottom<00:02:55.650> then<00:02:56.650> you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
there is a shoe at the bottom then you

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.590 
there is a shoe at the bottom then you
know<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.459> know<00:02:57.610> it's<00:02:57.790> straight<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.240> helps<00:02:58.450> you
