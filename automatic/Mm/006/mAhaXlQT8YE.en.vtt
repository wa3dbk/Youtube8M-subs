00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
but I probably logged at least three

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.780 
but I probably logged at least three
hours<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.940> gameplay<00:01:27.300> on<00:01:27.690> this<00:01:27.870> one<00:01:28.790> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
hours of gameplay on this one and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.550 
hours of gameplay on this one and
there's<00:01:29.940> pretty<00:01:30.090> fun<00:01:30.390> good<00:01:30.660> I<00:01:30.690> do<00:01:30.900> die<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:31.290> lot

there's pretty fun good I do die a lot
you'll<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.700> bottom<00:01:32.850> right<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.210> did

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
you'll see on the bottom right I did

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.660 
you'll see on the bottom right I did
have<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.660> buy<00:01:33.870> a<00:01:33.900> prom<00:01:34.290> okay<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.370> guess<00:01:35.550> I

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
have to buy a prom okay and I guess I

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.070 
have to buy a prom okay and I guess I
could<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.910> telling<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.270> how<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.420> play<00:01:36.630> Christ

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
could be telling you how to play Christ

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.190 
could be telling you how to play Christ
um<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.400> touch<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.240> screen<00:01:39.480> and<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:40.020> it's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
um you touch the screen and then it's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
um you touch the screen and then it's
gonna<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> circle<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.640> longer<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
gonna make a circle and the longer that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.090 
gonna make a circle and the longer that
you<00:01:42.240> hold<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.660> further<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.230> circle<00:01:43.620> expands

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you hold the further the circle expands

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.180 
you hold the further the circle expands
and<00:01:44.580> then<00:01:45.150> all<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.510> units<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.740> circle

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
and then all the units in that circle

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.220 
and then all the units in that circle
you<00:01:47.490> command<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> tell<00:01:48.570> them<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.050> do

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
you command and you tell them what to do

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.650 
you command and you tell them what to do
so<00:01:50.130> most<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.940> times<00:01:51.120> it's<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.510> more

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
so most of times it's going to be more

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.000 
so most of times it's going to be more
efficient<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.260> take<00:01:52.440> like<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.620> small

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
efficient just to take like a small

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.430 
efficient just to take like a small
little<00:01:53.040> tap<00:01:53.490> cluster<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.300> have<00:01:54.810> them<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.170> pick

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
little tap cluster and have them go pick

way<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.680> like<00:03:37.860> pinch<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.340> zoom<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.790> shows

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
way to like pinch to zoom and it shows

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.930 
way to like pinch to zoom and it shows
the<00:03:39.150> whole<00:03:39.180> screen<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:40.010> do<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.280> it's

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the whole screen so do that it's

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.610 
the whole screen so do that it's
probably<00:03:42.150> not<00:03:42.360> even<00:03:42.390> anything<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:43.110> secret

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
probably not even anything like secret

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.550 
probably not even anything like secret
but<00:03:43.860> whatever<00:03:44.780> okay<00:03:45.780> look<00:03:45.959> at<00:03:46.110> this<00:03:46.200> freaking

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
but whatever okay look at this freaking

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.860 
but whatever okay look at this freaking
worm<00:03:46.769> i<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.850> sent<00:03:48.000> like<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.239> good<00:03:48.450> cluster<00:03:48.840> of

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
worm i just sent like a good cluster of

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.660 
worm i just sent like a good cluster of
ants<00:03:49.230> at<00:03:49.320> him<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.620> he<00:03:49.980> just<00:03:50.190> shook<00:03:50.400> them<00:03:50.519> all

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
ants at him and he just shook them all

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.970 
ants at him and he just shook them all
off<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.269> he's<00:03:51.930> killing<00:03:52.350> them<00:03:52.380> at<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.709> rate<00:03:52.950> of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
off so he's killing them at a rate of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.830 
off so he's killing them at a rate of
like<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.459> don't<00:03:53.519> know<00:03:53.700> like<00:03:53.790> two<00:03:54.150> per<00:03:54.360> second<00:03:54.750> or

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
like I don't know like two per second or

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.240 
like I don't know like two per second or
something<00:03:55.140> like<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.739> wasn't<00:03:56.070> sending

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
something like that and I wasn't sending

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.809 
something like that and I wasn't sending
enough

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
enough

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.890 
enough
overwhelm<00:03:57.390> him<00:03:57.629> try<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.290> actually<00:03:58.469> damage<00:03:59.069> him

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
overwhelm him try to actually damage him

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.929 
overwhelm him try to actually damage him
so<00:04:00.900> he<00:04:01.409> gets<00:04:01.620> all<00:04:01.769> up<00:04:01.920> in<00:04:02.040> my<00:04:02.159> bass<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.819> was

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
so he gets all up in my bass and I was

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.280 
so he gets all up in my bass and I was
trying<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.209> send<00:04:03.389> those<00:04:03.480> ants<00:04:03.689> to<00:04:03.780> attack<00:04:03.870> them

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
trying to send those ants to attack them

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.949 
trying to send those ants to attack them
but<00:04:04.469> they<00:04:04.590> ended<00:04:04.739> up<00:04:04.829> saving<00:04:05.069> their<00:04:05.310> friends

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
but they ended up saving their friends

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.679 
but they ended up saving their friends
you<00:04:06.959> use<00:04:07.139> stupid<00:04:07.799> ants<00:04:08.129> your<00:04:08.999> family<00:04:09.359> is<00:04:09.450> dead

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
you use stupid ants your family is dead

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.280 
you use stupid ants your family is dead
to<00:04:09.870> preserve<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.560> colony<00:04:11.719> it's<00:04:12.719> weird<00:04:13.049> being

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
died get with the program there's a

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.870 
died get with the program there's a
caterpillar<00:04:24.000> coming<00:04:24.240> at<00:04:24.330> your<00:04:24.449> base<00:04:25.880> not

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
caterpillar coming at your base not

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.790 
caterpillar coming at your base not
right<00:04:27.060> now<00:04:27.090> actually<00:04:27.419> there<00:04:27.750> was<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:28.650> was

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
right now actually there was and I was

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.080 
right now actually there was and I was
looking<00:04:28.919> up<00:04:29.160> at<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.340> top<00:04:29.460> right<00:04:29.699> thinking

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
looking up at the top right thinking

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.730 
looking up at the top right thinking
like<00:04:30.330> Oh<00:04:30.539> where's<00:04:30.810> this<00:04:30.870> credit<00:04:31.289> Roberto<00:04:31.440> to

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
like Oh where's this credit Roberto to

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.980 
like Oh where's this credit Roberto to
come<00:04:31.979> from<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:33.090> came<00:04:33.240> from<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.509> bottom<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:33.840> it

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
come from it came from the bottom and it

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.960 
come from it came from the bottom and it
doubled<00:04:34.320> down<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:35.039> this<00:04:35.310> game<00:04:35.520> is<00:04:35.550> kind<00:04:35.880> of

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
doubled down so this game is kind of

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.900 
doubled down so this game is kind of
like<00:04:36.090> random<00:04:36.509> super<00:04:36.810> crazy<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.320> where<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.919> don't

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
like random super crazy to where I don't

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.939 
like random super crazy to where I don't
know<00:04:38.970> it's<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.300> not<00:04:39.479> like<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.990> game<00:04:40.620> where<00:04:40.830> you

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
know it's just not like a game where you

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.249 
know it's just not like a game where you
can<00:04:41.099> go<00:04:41.400> through<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.669> exact<00:04:42.000> same<00:04:42.030> oops<00:04:42.960> I

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
can go through the exact same oops I

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.990 
can go through the exact same oops I
think<00:04:43.590> they<00:04:43.800> might<00:04:43.979> change<00:04:44.190> each<00:04:44.460> time<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:44.849> do

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
think they might change each time you do

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.629 
think they might change each time you do
it<00:04:45.229> look<00:04:46.229> at<00:04:46.320> all<00:04:46.410> these<00:04:46.530> slugs<00:04:46.830> this<00:04:47.280> is<00:04:47.430> bad

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
I got the green power up green it gives

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.450 
I got the green power up green it gives

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.610 
you the super coke mode and then you're
just<00:04:56.490> like<00:04:56.789> spamming<00:04:57.180> around<00:04:57.630> killing<00:04:58.410> things

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
just like spamming around killing things

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.980 
just like spamming around killing things
and<00:04:58.949> if<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.460> have<00:04:59.610> berries<00:05:00.150> or<00:05:00.419> whatever<00:05:00.720> like

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
and if you have berries or whatever like

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.839 
and if you have berries or whatever like
sticks<00:05:01.500> you're<00:05:01.680> trying<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:02.039> pick<00:05:02.220> up<00:05:04.669> you<00:05:05.669> can

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
sticks you're trying to pick up you can

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.939 
sticks you're trying to pick up you can
drag<00:05:06.090> them<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.300> your<00:05:06.539> base<00:05:06.780> but<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.650> think<00:05:07.860> we

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
drag them to your base but I think we

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.080 
drag them to your base but I think we
show<00:05:08.099> that<00:05:08.250> later<00:05:08.460> on<00:05:08.639> too<00:05:08.849> so<00:05:09.270> whatever<00:05:09.919> um

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
show that later on too so whatever um

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.430 
show that later on too so whatever um

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
relatively respectable amount of time

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.840

like if you send just a small group of
ants<00:06:42.150> at<00:06:42.270> a<00:06:42.330> big<00:06:42.510> patch<00:06:42.690> of<00:06:42.720> areas<00:06:43.200> are<00:06:43.320> a<00:06:43.350> big

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
ants at a big patch of areas are a big

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.740 
ants at a big patch of areas are a big
patch<00:06:43.770> of<00:06:43.800> sticks<00:06:44.400> or<00:06:44.580> whatever<00:06:44.850> it's<00:06:45.570> gonna

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
patch of sticks or whatever it's gonna

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.030 
patch of sticks or whatever it's gonna
take<00:06:46.080> way<00:06:46.229> too<00:06:46.260> long

the<00:06:51.040> returns<00:06:51.370> are<00:06:51.520> exponential<00:06:52.090> for<00:06:52.270> sending

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
the returns are exponential for sending

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.200 
the returns are exponential for sending
more<00:06:52.690> ants<00:06:52.930> that's<00:06:53.080> what<00:06:53.200> I'm<00:06:53.290> trying<00:06:53.440> to<00:06:53.590> say

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
okay so when it's a whole bunch of

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.290 
okay so when it's a whole bunch of
single<00:06:56.470> berries<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.550> I<00:06:57.910> don't<00:06:58.060> know<00:06:58.120> if<00:06:58.210> I'm

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
single berries and I don't know if I'm

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.670 
single berries and I don't know if I'm
timed<00:06:58.540> right<00:06:58.750> now<00:06:58.870> but<00:06:59.050> I<00:06:59.110> was<00:06:59.230> freaking<00:06:59.590> out

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
timed right now but I was freaking out

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.610 
timed right now but I was freaking out
anyways<00:07:00.780> it's<00:07:01.780> best<00:07:02.050> to<00:07:02.169> get<00:07:02.290> just<00:07:02.470> like<00:07:02.560> a

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
anyways it's best to get just like a

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.050 
anyways it's best to get just like a
small<00:07:02.919> little<00:07:02.950> cluster<00:07:03.520> and<00:07:03.730> you<00:07:03.790> don't<00:07:03.970> have

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
small little cluster and you don't have

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.890 
small little cluster and you don't have
to<00:07:04.210> put<00:07:04.389> your<00:07:04.450> circle<00:07:05.160> center<00:07:06.160> right<00:07:06.970> in<00:07:07.270> the

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
to put your circle center right in the

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.720 
to put your circle center right in the
middle<00:07:08.080> of<00:07:08.200> a<00:07:08.350> group<00:07:08.530> of<00:07:08.620> ants<00:07:08.950> like<00:07:09.160> you<00:07:09.700> I

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
middle of a group of ants like you I

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.190 
middle of a group of ants like you I
feel<00:07:10.360> like<00:07:10.510> down<00:07:10.630> the<00:07:10.720> line<00:07:10.840> you're<00:07:10.990> really

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.200 
feel like down the line you're really

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.290
