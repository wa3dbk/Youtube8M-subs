rookie signature and one signature elite

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.959 
rookie signature and one signature elite
player<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:54.069> what<00:01:55.069> that<00:01:55.100> does<00:01:55.429> it<00:01:55.609> gives<00:01:55.789> you<00:01:55.909> a

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.610 
you can see their signature which is
cool<00:05:42.300> but<00:05:43.300> you<00:05:43.539> will<00:05:43.690> not<00:05:43.810> make<00:05:44.020> any<00:05:44.259> profit

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.850 
off it he they all their signature cards
go<00:05:48.580> for<00:05:48.789> maybe<00:05:48.940> like<00:05:49.000> 20<00:05:49.479> 20<00:05:50.139> k<00:05:50.319> more<00:05:50.620> than

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
go for maybe like 20 20 k more than

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.820 
go for maybe like 20 20 k more than
their<00:05:51.009> regular<00:05:51.219> card<00:05:51.759> so<00:05:52.529> let's<00:05:53.529> say<00:05:53.650> julio

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
their regular card so let's say julio

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.860 
their regular card so let's say julio
jones<00:05:54.009> went<00:05:54.460> for<00:05:54.669> nothing<00:05:55.029> this<00:05:55.479> card<00:05:55.750> would

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
jones went for nothing this card would

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.100 
jones went for nothing this card would
just<00:05:56.020> go<00:05:56.139> for<00:05:56.289> 20k<00:05:56.759> so<00:05:57.759> is<00:05:58.270> it<00:05:58.539> really<00:05:58.659> worth<00:05:58.840> it

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
just go for 20k so is it really worth it

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.110 
just go for 20k so is it really worth it
I<00:05:59.229> really<00:05:59.800> think<00:06:00.009> these<00:06:00.219> signature<00:06:00.729> packs<00:06:00.940> are

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
I really think these signature packs are

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.300 
I really think these signature packs are
really<00:06:01.479> not<00:06:01.630> worth<00:06:01.840> it<00:06:02.020> but<00:06:02.770> that's<00:06:02.949> just<00:06:03.069> my

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
really not worth it but that's just my

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.180 
really not worth it but that's just my
