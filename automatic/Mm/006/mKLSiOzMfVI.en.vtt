00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
carbon fiber and this is metal so this

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.840 
carbon fiber and this is metal so this

the<00:02:05.500> other<00:02:05.680> side<00:02:06.720> basically<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.870> same<00:02:08.110> it

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
the other side basically the same it

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.780 
the other side basically the same it
doesn't<00:02:08.950> have<00:02:09.100> any<00:02:09.539> rearview<00:02:10.539> mirrors<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:12.700> if

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
doesn't have any rearview mirrors see if

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.560 
doesn't have any rearview mirrors see if
we<00:02:12.910> can<00:02:14.130> can't<00:02:15.130> really<00:02:15.430> see<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.940> interior

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
we can can't really see the interior

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.430 
we can can't really see the interior
that<00:02:16.750> well<00:02:17.020> because<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:17.800> it's<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.700> smoked

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
that well because it's it's a smoked

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.400 
that well because it's it's a smoked
like<00:02:20.440> tinted<00:02:20.890> color<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:22.570> that's<00:02:23.170> what<00:02:23.350> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
like tinted color and that's what it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.480 
like tinted color and that's what it
looks<00:02:23.440> like<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.070> bottom<00:02:26.010> now<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.070> show<00:02:27.430> you

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
looks like on the bottom now to show you

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:36.300 
looks like on the bottom now to show you
a<00:02:27.580> comparison<00:02:29.490> maystow<00:02:32.490> right<00:02:33.490> there<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:36.130> may

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
a comparison maystow right there the may

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.140 
a comparison maystow right there the may
still<00:02:36.640> has<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:38.709> design<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.720> more<00:02:40.720> redefined<00:02:41.410> I

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
still has the design is more redefined I

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.460 
still has the design is more redefined I
think<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.100> looks<00:02:45.280> like<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
think it is and so it looks like on the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.590 
think it is and so it looks like on the
side<00:02:48.510> top<00:02:49.510> view<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.900> mean<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:52.360> looks<00:02:52.540> like

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
side top view I mean and it looks like

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.020 
side top view I mean and it looks like
the<00:02:52.810> Mesa<00:02:53.020> one's<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.530> larger<00:02:53.920> car<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:57.030> that's

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
the Mesa one's a larger car and that's

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.610 
the Mesa one's a larger car and that's
what<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.330> looks<00:02:58.480> like<00:02:58.630> from<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.020> back

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
what it looks like from the back

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
what it looks like from the back
the<00:03:00.430> Mesa<00:03:00.640> one<00:03:01.150> has<00:03:01.630> more<00:03:02.080> painted<00:03:03.010> detail<00:03:03.400> on

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
the Mesa one has more painted detail on

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.430 
the Mesa one has more painted detail on
the<00:03:03.820> back<00:03:04.980> looks<00:03:05.980> more<00:03:06.280> realistic<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
the back looks more realistic and the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.490 
the back looks more realistic and the
Hot<00:03:08.620> Wheels<00:03:08.860> ones<00:03:09.160> designed<00:03:09.610> for<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.150> track

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
Hot Wheels ones designed for the track

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.920 
Hot Wheels ones designed for the track
so<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.950> doesn't<00:03:12.580> have<00:03:12.760> all<00:03:12.790> proportion<00:03:13.690> wheels

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
so it doesn't have all proportion wheels

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.039 
so it doesn't have all proportion wheels
and<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.920> doesn't<00:03:15.250> have<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.430> rear<00:03:15.730> view<00:03:15.940> mirror

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
and it doesn't have the rear view mirror

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.770 
and it doesn't have the rear view mirror
mirrors<00:03:18.010> because<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.910> Boosters<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.600> would

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
mirrors because in the Boosters it would

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.440 
mirrors because in the Boosters it would
cause<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.290> get<00:03:20.500> stuck<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.820> that's<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.269> main

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
cause it to get stuck so that's the main

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.840 
cause it to get stuck so that's the main
reason<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:24.940> we<00:03:25.060> showed<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.720> then<00:03:26.700> here's<00:03:27.700> what

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
reason as we showed and then here's what

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.210 
reason as we showed and then here's what
it<00:03:27.910> looks<00:03:28.030> like<00:03:28.150> on<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.510> bottom<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:30.040> Hot

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
it looks like on the bottom the Hot

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.120 
it looks like on the bottom the Hot
Wheels<00:03:30.370> one<00:03:30.640> has<00:03:30.790> more<00:03:31.030> detail<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.989> bottom

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.340 

right<00:03:36.130> there<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.810> Mesa<00:03:37.989> one<00:03:38.260> is

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
right there and the Mesa one is

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.000 
right there and the Mesa one is
definitely<00:03:38.590> wider<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:40.500> that's<00:03:41.500> pretty<00:03:41.890> much

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
definitely wider and that's pretty much

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.720 
definitely wider and that's pretty much
it<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.930> Hot<00:03:44.110> Wheels<00:03:44.440> one's<00:03:44.680> like<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.370> dollar

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
it the Hot Wheels one's like a dollar

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.660 
it the Hot Wheels one's like a dollar
and<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.360> other<00:03:46.510> ones<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:47.110> dollar<00:03:47.470> two<00:03:48.780> but<00:03:50.670> for

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
and the other ones a dollar two but for

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.090 
and the other ones a dollar two but for
the<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.269> like<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.720> collect<00:03:52.870> mostly<00:03:53.680> ones<00:03:53.920> that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
the I like to collect mostly ones that

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.550 
the I like to collect mostly ones that
are<00:03:54.190> based<00:03:54.400> on<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:54.820> realistic<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.350> would

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
are based on the realistic and I would

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.160 
are based on the realistic and I would
go<00:03:56.680> with<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.950> maystow<00:03:57.370> one<00:03:57.610> but<00:03:58.600> if<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.989> want

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
go with the maystow one but if you want

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.050 
go with the maystow one but if you want
to<00:03:59.260> get<00:03:59.380> one<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.920> shows<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.459> little<00:04:00.790> bit<00:04:01.030> of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
to get one that shows a little bit of

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.569 
to get one that shows a little bit of
the<00:04:01.329> interior<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.530> Hot<00:04:02.739> Wheels<00:04:02.890> one<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:03.370> good

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
the interior the Hot Wheels one is good

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.780 
the interior the Hot Wheels one is good
too<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.560> that's<00:04:05.560> pretty<00:04:05.860> much<00:04:05.980> all<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.370> have<00:04:06.610> to

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
too and that's pretty much all I have to

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.569 
too and that's pretty much all I have to
