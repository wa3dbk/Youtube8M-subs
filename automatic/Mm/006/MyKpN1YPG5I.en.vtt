00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.250
 hello friends how are you welcome today 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.470
 back to my channel 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.300
 remember that they are in technical friend me 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.310
 I'm the iii and today we're going to learn to 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.039
 knit this very cute point that is called 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.279
 interlaced columns is a good point 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.119
 easy only need two laps and 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.909
 let's start by assembling multiples of 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.829
 three points plus two for the edges 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.569
 then we start with the first 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.939
 back what we're going to do with the 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:35.630
 first point is that we are going to slide it 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:39.530
 without weaving it later we weave a 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.590
 lazada we passed a point 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.400
 and we have one 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.520
 and two rights we finally passed the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.460
 point that we do not weave on the two 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.890
 rights that we just knit and that's 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.760
 We repeat the whole motive again 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.760
 laced 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.379
 we passed a point without weaving we weave a 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.070
 straight 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.399
 two rights and we passed the point that the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.399
 tissues 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.610
 and so on until the end of the round 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.380
 when we get the last point of the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.750
 We will return one that is left over 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.750
 edge we weave it upside down 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.740
 and the number 2 return is a very 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.280
 simple because the only thing we're going to 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.680
 to do is that we're going to weave all the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.040
 backhand points the first point what 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:48.600
 we slide without knitting and the rest of the 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.600
 back we weave all the backhand 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.880
 and we finish our stitch the truth 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.370
 it's a very nice stitch look it looks like 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.710
 in a lot of detail 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.290
 I hope you liked wish the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.510
 try thank you for visiting me the day of 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.979
 Today we see very soon who is weaving 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.979
 with me goodbye
