00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.660
 the last frontier of technology e 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.360
 chronic is the partial compression and the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.840
 new line and winter factor is the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.910
 test 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.000
 from a study carried out by the laboratory 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.620
 cern of the research is the garona 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.329
 these were the conclusions 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.699
 that partial compression is 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.070
 clearly superior in performance 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.640
 to the classic compression created on 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.640
 the whole surface 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.180
 partial compression has two advantages 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.070
 1 and cardiovascular and the other is 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.760
 temperature control pressure lines 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.380
 they favor the cardiovascular aspects 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.560
 instead create lighter weight 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.180
 precisely favor thermoregulation 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.640
 the human body is a perfect machine 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.409
 so one advice I give you is that 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.500
 always in hostile conditions 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.360
 heating is very important 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.360
 training and cool down 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.060
 the knee a particular process 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.150
 called neuro response of those active 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.440
 receptors and improves activity 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.240
 neuromuscular 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.610
 the line is now composed of one 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.460
 long sleeve shirt and trousers on 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.740
 quadriceps special processing 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.320
 called the intercooler this allows 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.260
 to dispose of excess heat 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.640
 developed right here in our parts 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.980
 the effect line has now been designed 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.470
 for cold temperatures but not 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.300
 very rigid in extreme conditions of 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.490
 cold instead we can use the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.220
 our tector lines in contact with the 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.230
 skin by adding a second or a third 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.680
 layer as in this case the winter 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.680
