 This is a public facility or residential area 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 I'm going to the site to become Otomo 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.340
 For the time being, we also consider the environment 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.150
 I can choose the same way as the engine and use it 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.700

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.420

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.520
 It has become a button of reversal 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.130
 If by any chance 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.320

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.710

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.719
 The control is 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.329

 This machine is ideal for hospitals and places where sound is an issue 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.459
