00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 To further twist the twisted hair, 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 The hair bundle has a three-dimensional effect and makes it look like nuances.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Divide the hair in the middle and further halve the hair bundle, 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Twist to cross each hair bundle. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 After twisting to the hair, fasten with rubber. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Cross the two hair bundles at the back and repeat the twist until the hair ends to one. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Let's finish it a little loose to put it together later. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Make a curled bundle of twisted hair bundle and fix the root with a pin. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 If you have a double comb head access, 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 While the loose up is well fixed, the glitz is also added. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Insert it diagonally behind the ear to complete. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
