 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.900
 new video by iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.369
 today I show you how to run the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.950
 untethered jailbreak of ios 7.1 and ios 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.660
 7.1.1 with tango a jailbreak released 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.239
 surprise by a team of Chinese hackers 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.860
 which is doing a lot of talking about itself in 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.660
 these hours because guys are true 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.180
 it works then let's see how 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.130
 perform this unlock unlock for now 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.540
 available only on windows you don't know 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.329
 what is the jailbreak find the link in 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.859
 description to learn more and if 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.670
 you want to follow the textual guide for 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.289
 this jailbreak 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.750
 you also have this option always in the 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.019
 link in description or on the article of 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.850
 iphoneitalia.com first we must 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.129
 launch pang for windows after having it 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.600
 downloaded clearly and connect the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.489
 our device via the cable 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.929
 usb to the computer 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.239
 at this point we press on the one 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.400
 pang interface button that 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.400
 with the three question marks all black 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.860
 and then we follow the directions we will need 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.320
 go to general date and settings 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.750
 now turn off the automatic options e 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.140
 set as the device date 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.829
 on 2 June 2014 and as now at eight o'clock 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.299
 thirty 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.829
 this is necessary so that 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.930
 the jailbreak operation goes well 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.180
 end if you do n't do this 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.740
 the jailbreak will not continue and will remain 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.360
 firm exactly as we are seeing 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.969
 now if you did everything 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.219
 correctly the operation will continue e 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.630
 it will stop again only when it is 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.740
 further action required 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.520
 user 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.439
 that is, pressing of the pang icon 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.820
 that an application that will be installed 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.399
 exactly as we have seen with i 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.100
 vision 7 to perform the jailbreak 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.110
 we will have to open this application 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.909
 confirm the operation when it comes 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.920
 request after which the procedure of 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.659
 jailbreak will be completely automatic 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.969
 so we will notice that the status bar 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.890
 will go ahead and we can disconnect the 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.680
 device only when the bar inter 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.390
 status will be colored black 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.729
 at this point our device will 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.590
 will restart a reboot that will require a 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.390
 some time guys general i have 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.290
 speed up the process in the video 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.180
 but a break that compared to those known 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.340
 past ones requires a little more 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.320
 time I tell you that the operation in 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.160
 general may require even a quarter 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.960
 so now make sure you have 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.820
 quite a bit of time available before 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.320
 to do this because if 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.280
 something should clearly go 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.470
 awry 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.960
 you will need to reset the device 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.120
 we hope not and run the 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.680
 I also advise you to restore everything 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.230
 before jailbreak your device 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.580
 because if you have updated via ota a 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.450
 ios 7.1 7.1.1 the jailbreak could 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.100
 have problems 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.680
 I showed you that my ipod and 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.770
 updated to ios 7.1.1 in this 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.050
 moment is cydia installed then the 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.940
 jailbreak compango has been successful 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.180
 now we throw cydia that as usual 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.150
 at the first start it performs this scan 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.740
 of the file system this preparation there 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.110
 will be a last restart of the terminal 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.940
 after the conclusion of this operation 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.370
 and then we can finally 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.050
 use is one hundred percent 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.880
 I take this opportunity to tell you guys that 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.270
 many tweaks are not yet updated 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.480
 for ios 7.1 7.1.1 then you will have problems 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.580
 compatibility in the installation 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.220
 any programs I recommend 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.410
 not to update to ios 7.1 in each 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.750
 case if you keep the jailbreak if you have a 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.209
 previous jailbreak if you do not have 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.250
 still a jailbreak and you have one of the 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.110
 two versions that are unlocked 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.580
 just from pango then in that case 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.200
 go ahead anyway because this 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.630
 jailbreak has been tested by several 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.610
 hacker and is one hundred percent secure 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.490
 there are no malware there is no danger 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.800
 for user security 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.900
 in any case, boys this was the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.800
 our video tutorial on the jailbreak of 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.690
 ios 7.1.1 and by haier 7.1 let me know 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.370
 what do you think and let me know in case 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.560
 of problems leaving a comment to 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.560
