00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.900
 if you want questore green description 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.030
 defined 15 with small plus entering the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.100
 code that eat everything tiny 5 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.140
 percent of credits is better i 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.029
 guys here justin let's say i had this 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.000
 brand new video which is the freie review 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.609
 by young min son I believe it is pronounced like this 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.019
 a really strong player 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.019
 obviously in the version minus the match 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.910
 with 78 verona dio players I said 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.439
 really very strong that I liked 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.140
 a lot but let's go and see what 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.590
 first I liked it then 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.110
 I paid 340 thousand because I weigh it 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.460
 morning after he left though 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.030
 anyway right now in this 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.410
 record they feel the 190,000 then 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.390
 see a little then learn no to 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.680
 end of this player and then we leave 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.800
 with the first of this player who 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.660
 they are really a lot of speed first 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.750
 what speed why we find 86 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.520
 acceleration and 87 speeds shot a lot 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.430
 very good it makes it go away easily 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.740
 from the left wing and is also 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.860
 accompanied by a very good agility 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.710
 that 80 but also seems on the 85 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.990
 I really liked this fact though 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.899
 unfortunately like all fast players 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.840
 and agile the music move is a counter 53 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.179
 physical strength that is also felt 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.939
 the balance is not racism 77 and not 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:28.359
 helps applied then 50 of the forces 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.819
 media is absolutely one against another 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.219
 the five stars are truly amazing 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.049
 weak 5-star foot sees weak that 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.460
 allow him to pull 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.700
 regardless of the left text and 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.920
 simple methods cota the goalkeeper throw 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.749
 ride is also very good very good 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.450
 because we felt the shoot so much 

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:48.429
 excellent of course don't try long shots 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.280
 away because the dinho 83 power 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.889
 it's not the best but let's say about the 25 vehicles 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.200
 can put the goalkeeper in trouble 

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:58.469
 also an effect 81 which is not the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.829
 maximum but still very acceptable 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.569
 but above all the finalization 83 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.119
 very very very good he made me 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.860
 also some goals from a real race bomber 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.290
 I never expected well done 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.780
 some goals and sees in the course of the brands 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.970
 but it's really really good 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.060
 value from this point of view ahead 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.680
 the door almost never fails e 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.880
 this surprised me not me 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.310
 I waited because we say that I am 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.590
 expecting a good player to deviate 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.420
 so fast though once arrived from 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.069
 a goalkeeper who ate the goal e 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.020
 instead he surprised me at this point 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.900
 view because it is just the opposite that is 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.209
 very often it also puts in positions 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.410
 apparently very very difficult 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.680
 let me make some goals from position 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.030
 secluded that I pulled we say 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.200
 despair in quotation marks but he has it 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.150
 commissioning without any kind of problem 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.340
 in fact not having seen ten goals in 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.170
 seven games which is an excellent score for 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.670
 a left wing to test wire of the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.540
 left I advise you to use it 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.459
 absolutely like to the left because 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.989
 I tried it like ats and it is not me 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.780
 liked it a lot because he is 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.360
 let's say a need to unleash his 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.680
 speed here as ats no longer succeeds 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.030
 so much and therefore from this point of 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.220
 I did not like it in fact I have 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.670
 married immediately as ii everything changed 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.080
 really devastating this player 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.640
 speaking of the last against 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.040
 obviously I had already mentioned that the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.170
 physical strength that obviously despite 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.970
 he is one meter tall and 83 is 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.340
 penalizing from this point of view 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.890
 however we say that its height helps you 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.420
 even with the right shots in fact at 72 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.790
 of precision of a meter high head e 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.870
 83 we say that something in the head can 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.920
 do 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.620
 let's say they made me 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.910
 only one of the header 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.769
 dangerous if you don't find it on TV 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.400
 but in the end however he failed to 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.829
 to mark other however the 82 of 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.630
 great placement excellent loot 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.430
 really there are people complaining about him 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.320
 part from too far back but in my opinion 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.239
 no because for a left wing it goes 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.450
 very well always found where he should 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.950
 stay when when the team only 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.720
 attacking list goes further when 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.549
 you know I know how to cry in front of one 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.730
 hand in cover so very much 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.320
 good was always in his place 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.600
 in fact, with the field changes he made 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.850
 on the other side I always found it 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.760
 always ready 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.890
 no ball control amazed me 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.850
 however we say that it is not a counter because 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.220
 however it is quite lowered 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.630
 the final grade I give this player 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.180
 as you see a summary screen 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.330
 it's eight and a half if I had 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.150
 absolutely the four if the skills 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.470
 this would have been 99 and a half 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.270
 defect I have not noticed that much 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.830
 because I don't know much about schilardi though 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.500
 I do n't know how to do complex things but maybe 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.720
 people who are more capable of ringing 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.060
 it bothers me here is this could 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.130
 happen then if maybe better at 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.400
 take off and my parents wanted to give more 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.660
 this defect however speed 5 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.550
 stars sees weak finalizations and 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.410
 positioning could the skills and strength 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.050
 physical final grade at eight and a half 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.330
 obviously take it immediately because the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.100
 price will rise again not finding us anymore 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.340
 in packages so I guess when 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.350
 this news player will still be out 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.910
 on 200k so if you are interested 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.970
 taking it the instant, however , that 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.230
 they were in the club in the hope of the 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.940
 price rises and that I don't do 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.850
 lose hundreds of thousands of katyn 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.260
 anyway it's all for this ayew player 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.880
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.410
 if you want others to do it and that 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.230
 start doing more often because this 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.840
 telecommunication my first waste layer 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.880
 I can maybe say it on the channel then 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.680
 if you liked it let me hear this 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.990
 support we try to get to 50 mi 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.520
 like cei not comment what do you 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.470
 think of this player 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.280
 I thank as always forecast there 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.280
 let's see next video
