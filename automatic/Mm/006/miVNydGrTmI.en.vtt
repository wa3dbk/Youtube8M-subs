here<00:01:46.529> what<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.249> factory<00:01:47.670> did<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.209> they<00:01:48.959> just

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
here what the factory did was they just

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.039 
here what the factory did was they just
slopped<00:01:49.850> metal<00:01:50.850> paint<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.719> I<00:01:51.840> just

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
slopped metal paint on it so if I just

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.719 
slopped metal paint on it so if I just
mask<00:01:52.289> that<00:01:52.469> off<00:01:52.709> it<00:01:53.100> would<00:01:53.219> just<00:01:53.429> look<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
mask that off it would just look the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.730 
mask that off it would just look the
same<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.509> what<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.689> did<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.959> I<00:01:55.049> sprayed<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.439> all
