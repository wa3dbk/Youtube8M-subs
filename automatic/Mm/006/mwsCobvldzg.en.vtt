00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 if it's not really about singing techniques 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.950
 choral 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.850
 Pierre mehaignerie but Armenia 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.159
 ignatieff and hers she has come a long way 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.599
 it's really a whole 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:12.719
 who does what 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.650
 then this one is now to be heard on the building site 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.509
 he works a lot deeper in attack 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.960
 there will be the right of everyone to know mm equivalent exist 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.899
 we really work on alliances 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.499
 do now it's done it's done by china helps a lot 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.510
 and we 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.790
 not really happy with the job 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.240
 but he has embarked on a world where standards 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.320
 crusade of norm change on this Tuesday 1 and at the same time we take the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.400
 time to work seriously 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.170
 once a week for three hours the Parisians the blow is all 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.070
 this hate 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.030
 once we are in focus at this party it was a close match and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.870
 finally 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.600
 it was something that will be done 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.560
 the aaa basketball team 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.690
 the right side 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.560
 where she hears everything 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.630
 French 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.750
 it's really right 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.120
 or then proposals 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.780
 a bad for a well the arrangements all this was brought to light by his 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.780
 performance it was worth to the job a little varied in writing of afp 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.220
 but a lot of research 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.990
 incredible cinema-concert and fiat is really 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.790
 because every scene and that's really it 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.400
 finally because we really have everything to please 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.890
 it's a very good atmosphere in the entry level 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.000
 buying a worker 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.920
 individually so that it gives something to the group 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 for its part on the technique and the hand to the dough 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.830
 it will be settled in the ear you are poor but as I spoke 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.079
 of victims who is very very important c 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.079
 it's one of its only two overmotivated neighborhoods 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.560
 this moment in France this group b these difficult times because it is she 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.230
 who asked if the French tend to 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.230
 not to mention what he saw from the rhythm 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.299
 embedded in the body really feel to fill the rooms 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.640
 pursuit can sing she is really rhythmic and for proof 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.140
 patrick guimez grouped 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.059
 you have to keep them 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.519
 but in practice all those who are indeed in course nearly a year on the other 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.370
 comment 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.519
 actually having even more and more tight 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.269
 this year and it's true that it's a good way to experience the scene and 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.689
 the audience and is just about to improve 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.449
 because we want to pretend that it is a direct question of 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.639
 work in concert it's new 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.639
 but I feel that it will help me enormously scandal 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:36.079
 in my opinion the npd challenged to explore things and not necessarily at the level 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.079
 national 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.189
 in June 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.519
 when we go back we feel that people are very very very very expensive 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.929
 departure 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.769
 finally the end of this tare landed fatigue is 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.029
 completely% 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.029
 khadir completely the road to the exit at the sixth 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.059
 it's a great voice announcement comes after the session so that's it sucks 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.569
 ernst 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.459
 it's before everything else we would deprive ourselves 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.619
 in order to build unfortunate 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.769
 these sports palace collectives once we are in the north of the shooting range 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.519
 christian 86 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.139
 people are happy to come say tomorrow tuesday 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.769
 because it shows on radiant faces 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.839
 it's a final sprint and it's really 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:25.919
 certainly sectors 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.869
 it was very generous in this forest before slumping back 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.039
 however, there is no exaggeration 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.279
 every Thursday of the choir bringing all and without exception really
