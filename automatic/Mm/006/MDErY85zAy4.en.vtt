00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.299
 here we are again today in this new video 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.890
 today as you can see from the object 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.369
 cremano let's talk about the world 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.750
 portal gun has long been that talk 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.720
 of this mounted that one of mine 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.869
 prefer this request from many 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.200
 users so let's immediately talk about the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.989
 mod 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.000
 as you well know where practically yes 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.050
 he will add the various rifles to us 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.989
 I'm just in the game 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.700
 and real minecraft game is that if there is 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.050
 they have it with the right and left key e 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.960
 they went back into a portal 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.870
 from above and vice versa 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.120
 then as in the game we will have 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.840
 practically this stick that serves 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.840
 to position the portal the gun 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.780
 of the portals and approaching the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.329
 we will resume to close the portals 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.820
 just press r and you will see them again 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.530
 then we have these cells with the key 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.440
 right we can practically choose 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.720
 of can happen 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.020
 to operate them we say with the circuit of 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.380
 income is here we can see the kind of 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:22.180
 portal that will be activated when 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.860

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.900

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.880
 when we're going to pass the laser and yes 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.610
 it is generating and will dine to attack us 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.090

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.600
 49 then we also have these three CDs that 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.900
 in the game and I can't make a feel 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.750

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.730
