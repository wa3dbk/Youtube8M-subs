00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
but they're not sealed and what I mean

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.939 
but they're not sealed and what I mean
by<00:00:17.550> sealed<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.210> they're<00:00:18.390> not<00:00:18.480> steamed<00:00:18.960> you

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
by sealed is they're not steamed you

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.830 
by sealed is they're not steamed you
have<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.160> steam<00:00:20.430> them<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.000> they<00:00:21.449> hold<00:00:21.660> their

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
have to steam them so they hold their

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.250 
have to steam them so they hold their
shape<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.350> twist<00:00:22.680> them<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.010> steam<00:00:23.250> them

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
shape so you twist them and steam them

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.750 
shape so you twist them and steam them
but<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.619> my<00:00:25.740> next<00:00:26.010> set<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.189> dreads<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.670> I'm

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
but for my next set of dreads that I'm

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.250 
but for my next set of dreads that I'm
gonna<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:27.060> putting<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.390> my<00:00:27.539> hair<00:00:27.570> they're

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
gonna be putting in my hair they're

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.880 
gonna be putting in my hair they're
going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:29.599> blonde<00:00:30.599> fading<00:00:31.170> into<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> black

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
going to be blonde fading into a black

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.170 
going to be blonde fading into a black
tip<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:35.059> when<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> make<00:00:36.450> dreads<00:00:38.000> you<00:00:39.000> can

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
tip and when you make dreads you can

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.990 
tip and when you make dreads you can
make<00:00:39.360> them<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.140> black<00:00:40.379> starts<00:00:41.100> up

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
make them so that the black starts up

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.979 
make them so that the black starts up
here<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.840> kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:44.690> wind<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.899> around

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
here and you kind of just wind it around

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.819 
here and you kind of just wind it around
but<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.800> prefer<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.730> method<00:00:48.500> which<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.680> you

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
but I prefer this method which is you

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
but I prefer this method which is you
just<00:00:50.010> punch<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.460> hole<00:00:50.640> through<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.390> put

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
just punch a hole through and then put

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
just punch a hole through and then put
the<00:00:51.719> black<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.199> afterwards<00:00:52.770> which<00:00:53.579> I'll

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the black in afterwards which I'll

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.619 
the black in afterwards which I'll
probably<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.480> into<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.559> another<00:00:56.039> video<00:00:56.629> but

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
probably go into in another video but

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.049 
probably go into in another video but
not<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.520> about

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
not in this one but this here is about

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.640 
not in this one but this here is about
20<00:01:00.899> dreads<00:01:02.449> unsealed<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.589> see

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
20 dreads unsealed and as you can see

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.020 
20 dreads unsealed and as you can see
then<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.299> first<00:01:06.570> part<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.790> dreads

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
then I have the first part of the dreads

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.700 
then I have the first part of the dreads
here<00:01:09.299> which<00:01:09.630> aren't<00:01:09.869> finished<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.590> add

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
here which aren't finished I have to add

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.940 
here which aren't finished I have to add
black<00:01:11.340> onto<00:01:11.790> them<00:01:12.110> but<00:01:13.110> um<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:16.200> takes<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.680> lot<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
black onto them but um it takes a lot of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.399 
black onto them but um it takes a lot of
time<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:18.299> make<00:01:18.450> these<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.200> very

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
time to make these it's very

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.370 
time to make these it's very
time-consuming<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.990> can<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.170> rather

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
time-consuming and can be rather

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.830 
time-consuming and can be rather
frustrating<00:01:24.799> but<00:01:25.799> worth<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.369> they're<00:01:26.520> in

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
frustrating but worth it when they're in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.999 
frustrating but worth it when they're in
but<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.590> at<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> top

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
but as you can see like at the top

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.890 
but as you can see like at the top
there's<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.850> hole<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:30.630> where<00:01:30.869> I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
there's the hole and that's where I

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.620 
there's the hole and that's where I
would<00:01:31.140> place<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:32.009> hair<00:01:32.820> through<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.479> then

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
would place my hair through and then

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.499 
would place my hair through and then
braid<00:01:33.930> my<00:01:34.200> hair<00:01:34.229> around<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.220> dread<00:01:38.299> but<00:01:39.299> yes

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
braid my hair around this dread but yes

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.120 
braid my hair around this dread but yes
these<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.079> dreads<00:01:40.380> look<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.710> unsealed

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
these are what dreads look like unsealed

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
these are what dreads look like unsealed
and<00:01:41.430> these<00:01:41.579> are<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> dreads<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.420> going

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and these are the dreads that I'm going

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.469 
and these are the dreads that I'm going
to<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.220> in<00:01:44.220> my<00:01:44.399> hair<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:45.060> don't<00:01:45.210> look<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
to have in my hair they don't look the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240 
to have in my hair they don't look the
best<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:45.869> obviously<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:46.979> they're

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
best right now obviously because they're

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.170 
best right now obviously because they're
not<00:01:47.430> sealed

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.580 

but<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:53.020> thought<00:01:53.260> I<00:01:53.320> would<00:01:53.650> show<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:54.640> guys<00:01:55.680> the

but I thought I would show you guys the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.170 
but I thought I would show you guys the
what<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.740> going<00:02:00.070> on<00:02:00.220> basically<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.180> process

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
what is going on basically the process

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.450 
what is going on basically the process
this<00:02:04.180> isn't<00:02:04.540> really<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.810> video<00:02:05.200> about<00:02:06.100> anything

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
this isn't really a video about anything

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.730 
this isn't really a video about anything
really<00:02:06.940> this<00:02:07.150> is<00:02:07.300> just<00:02:07.330> me<00:02:07.600> showing<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:08.080> but<00:02:08.709> I
