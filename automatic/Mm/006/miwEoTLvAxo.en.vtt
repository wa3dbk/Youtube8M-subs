00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 very good everyone today I will explain 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.220
 how to make your playstation 3 not 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.620
 make so much noise with relationships and 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.170
 Also how to prevent it from overheating 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.680
 more than the account as you all know the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.810
 playstation is very well ventilated and not 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.520
 It gives overheating problems but 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.090
 you always have to prevent before healing 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.289
 and in this case as you can check the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.180
 play 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.490
 directly touches what is the basis of the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.560
 furniture where we have always located 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.940
 that you have it horizontally on 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.110
 trick that I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.110
 basically in using 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.900
 if you erase erasers there's basically 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.910
 that putting them under the tips is 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:50.070
 you have to put a here one here another here 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.950
 and another here as long as below 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.080
 the console is clear 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.170
 now I will teach you the noise of 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.520
 console without the bombs so we can 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.740
 check the difference between 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.390
 with them and without them I will introduce 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.309
 any game in this case I'm going to 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.309
 introduce the king man legends 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.500
 and we're going to hear the noise he makes with 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.500
 the console directly touching when flying 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.890
 and now this would be boring for the disk 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.160
 inside and touching the furniture now I'm going to 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.410
 do 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.920
 the next step was to hang the 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.560
 rubbers and let's compare the difference 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.820
 Well I have placed the gums 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.680
 I have put in a way that does not want 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.850
 cool your you've put the whites here 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.050
 I put the red ones behind and I'm going to 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.050
 proceed to dirty the disc 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.830
 but first of all the key sack 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.430
 but first of all I want me 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.740
 check that right now 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.160
 there is one I can put almost the little finger 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.140
 inside there is a difference of 2 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.180
 millimeters thick in which 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.520
 we will have this part of here from below 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.020
 refrigerated is always better than 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.620
 pass a little air that does not touch 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.790
 directly the furniture and that produces 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.790
 a few more degrees of heat 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.120
 The truth is that I do not know if it's me or not 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.640
 but if you can pull back on the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.940
 video you can compare what noise has 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.940
 lowered enough 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.340
 well I hope you liked this 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.670
 mini tutorial and nothing to enjoy 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.850
 your ps4 with more security up to 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.850
 then
