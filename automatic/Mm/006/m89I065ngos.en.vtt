can be sitting on my desk so that's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.420 
can be sitting on my desk so that's
really<00:02:36.810> heavy<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.350> then<00:02:37.920> what<00:02:38.130> else<00:02:38.160> we<00:02:38.400> have

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
stand as it twists into the base you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.130 
stand as it twists into the base you
know<00:02:43.980> I'll<00:02:44.040> be<00:02:44.250> able<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.489> see<00:02:44.579> that<00:02:44.730> says

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
future previously it was really

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.960 
future previously it was really
inconvenient<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.410> record<00:03:16.799> because<00:03:17.130> well<00:03:17.790> I

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
inconvenient to record because well I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.759 
inconvenient to record because well I

were<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.459> little<00:03:23.670> bit

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
were a little bit

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.910 
were a little bit
more<00:03:23.970> difficult<00:03:24.390> but<00:03:24.930> now<00:03:25.050> they'll<00:03:25.260> be<00:03:25.290> way

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
more difficult but now they'll be way

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.980 
more difficult but now they'll be way
more<00:03:25.950> consistent<00:03:26.640> frequent<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.720> little

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
more consistent frequent and a little

more consistent frequent and a little
bit<00:03:28.080> easier<00:03:28.350> for<00:03:28.380> me<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:28.880> expect<00:03:29.880> good<00:03:30.030> higher

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
bit easier for me so expect good higher
