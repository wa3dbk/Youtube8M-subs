00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
get started in the video so starting off
for<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> first<00:01:29.670> weapon<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.840> KF<00:01:31.170> five

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
for the first weapon we have the KF five

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.890 
for the first weapon we have the KF five
single<00:01:31.860> stack<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.430> guys<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
single stack as you guys can see so this

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.140 
single stack as you guys can see so this
enlisted<00:01:34.500> weapon<00:01:34.890> actually<00:01:35.310> has<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.549> damage

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
enlisted weapon actually has the damage

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
enlisted weapon actually has the damage
going<00:01:36.540> down<00:01:36.750> by<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.770> fire<00:01:38.040> rate

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
going down by one and the fire rate

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
going down by one and the fire rate
going<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.790> by<00:01:39.180> one<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> comes<00:01:40.140> down<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
going up by one so when it comes down to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
going up by one so when it comes down to
and<00:01:40.530> listen<00:01:40.799> weapons<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.369> aren't<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.790> to

and listen weapons you aren't going to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
and listen weapons you aren't going to
get<00:01:42.000> any<00:01:42.060> stats<00:01:42.630> better<00:01:42.930> than<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.320> basically

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
get any stats better than this basically

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.010 
get any stats better than this basically
there's<00:01:44.729> usually<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.689> stat

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
there's usually going to be one stat

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.109 
there's usually going to be one stat
that<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> usually<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.790> step

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that is going up and usually one step

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.810

already but having the damage down won't
do<00:01:57.090> much<00:01:57.299> because<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> submachine<00:01:58.590> gun

unfortunately I don't have it but the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.900 
unfortunately I don't have it but the
stats<00:03:04.410> on<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.739> weapon<00:03:04.950> does<00:03:05.430> look<00:03:05.670> quite

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
stats on this weapon does look quite

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.390 
stats on this weapon does look quite
nice<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.450> as<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.720> already<00:03:06.840> know<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.500> ak-12<00:03:07.950> is

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
nice so as you already know the ak-12 is

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.520 
nice so as you already know the ak-12 is
the<00:03:08.550> most<00:03:08.790> accurate<00:03:09.060> assault<00:03:09.780> rifle<00:03:10.200> if<00:03:10.350> I'm

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the most accurate assault rifle if I'm

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.199 
the most accurate assault rifle if I'm
definitely<00:03:10.860> sure<00:03:11.100> in<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.580> game<00:03:11.790> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
definitely sure in this game the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.759 
definitely sure in this game the
accuracy<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:12.630> going<00:03:12.870> down<00:03:13.140> by<00:03:13.319> one<00:03:13.590> which

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
accuracy is going down by one which

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.259 
accuracy is going down by one which
doesn't<00:03:14.130> matter<00:03:14.310> because<00:03:14.550> this<00:03:14.670> weapon<00:03:15.180> is

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
doesn't matter because this weapon is

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.150 
doesn't matter because this weapon is
like<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> laser<00:03:15.930> anyway<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.739> pretty<00:03:16.980> much<00:03:17.130> has

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
like a laser anyway it pretty much has

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.310 
like a laser anyway it pretty much has
no<00:03:17.430> recoil<00:03:17.880> especially<00:03:18.660> when<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.870> add<00:03:19.019> for

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
no recoil especially when you add for

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.680 
no recoil especially when you add for
grip<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.190> fire<00:03:20.459> rates<00:03:20.670> going<00:03:20.880> up<00:03:21.120> by<00:03:21.360> one

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
grip and the fire rates going up by one

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.479 
grip and the fire rates going up by one
which<00:03:21.989> obviously<00:03:22.380> means<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.920> it's<00:03:23.220> going<00:03:23.400> to

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
which obviously means that it's going to

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.610 
which obviously means that it's going to
shoot<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.820> bit<00:03:23.970> faster<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.959> lot<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.200> people

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
shoot a bit faster and a lot of people

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.830 
shoot a bit faster and a lot of people
use<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.100> ak-12<00:03:26.610> hair<00:03:27.120> trigger<00:03:27.510> as<00:03:27.690> an

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
use this ak-12 hair trigger as an

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.890 
use this ak-12 hair trigger as an
alternate<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> ak-12<00:03:29.820> irap<00:03:30.450> because

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
alternate to the ak-12 irap because

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.990 
alternate to the ak-12 irap because
obviously<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.380> rfp<00:03:31.799> just<00:03:32.070> has<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.519> fire<00:03:32.820> in

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
obviously the rfp just has the fire in

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.490 
obviously the rfp just has the fire in
and<00:03:33.120> some<00:03:33.239> other<00:03:33.390> stats<00:03:33.690> going<00:03:33.989> up<00:03:34.140> as<00:03:34.290> well

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
and some other stats going up as well

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.319 
and some other stats going up as well
and<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:35.160> lot<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.370> people<00:03:35.459> use<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:35.970> as<00:03:36.180> an

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
and a lot of people use this as an

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.940 
and a lot of people use this as an
alternate<00:03:36.780> version<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:37.470> because<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
alternate version just because of the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.009 
alternate version just because of the
fire<00:03:38.280> Aidan<00:03:38.610> if<00:03:38.820> anything<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.630> weapon

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
fire Aidan if anything this weapon

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.600 
fire Aidan if anything this weapon
already<00:03:40.230> shoots<00:03:40.440> like<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.680> laser<00:03:40.980> without<00:03:41.340> real

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
already shoots like a laser without real

already shoots like a laser without real

call and basically you're getting a +1
fire<00:03:44.040> rate<00:03:44.310> upgrade<00:03:44.820> which<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.420> absolutely

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
fire rate upgrade which is absolutely

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.050 
fire rate upgrade which is absolutely
amazing<00:03:46.320> for<00:03:46.709> an<00:03:46.799> assault<00:03:47.040> rifle<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.640> even

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
amazing for an assault rifle and even

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.699 
amazing for an assault rifle and even
though<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.299> unlisted<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.870> makes<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.560> even

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
though it's unlisted it makes it even

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.280 
though it's unlisted it makes it even
better<00:03:50.090> moving<00:03:51.090> over<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.630> second<00:03:52.170> last

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
better moving over to the second last

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.900 
better moving over to the second last
weapon<00:03:52.530> on<00:03:52.859> our<00:03:53.010> list<00:03:53.220> it's<00:03:53.430> going<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.670> be<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
weapon on our list it's going to be the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.840 
weapon on our list it's going to be the
IMR<00:03:54.480> impact<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.709> weapon<00:03:56.130> has<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.340> plus<00:03:56.609> 1

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
IMR impact this weapon has a plus 1

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.940 
IMR impact this weapon has a plus 1
damage<00:03:57.120> with<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.630> range<00:03:57.870> going<00:03:58.290> down<00:03:58.470> by<00:03:58.680> one

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
damage with the range going down by one

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.650 
damage with the range going down by one
so<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.519> weapon<00:03:59.850> is<00:03:59.940> obviously<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.329> first

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
so this weapon is obviously a first

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.690 
so this weapon is obviously a first
weapon<00:04:00.930> which<00:04:01.530> means<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.010> range<00:04:02.280> won't<00:04:02.579> be

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
weapon which means the range won't be

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.280 
weapon which means the range won't be
too<00:04:02.910> much<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.120> an<00:04:03.390> issue<00:04:03.570> because<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.140> kills

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
too much of an issue because it kills

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.890 
too much of an issue because it kills
anyone<00:04:04.650> pretty<00:04:05.160> much<00:04:05.370> any<00:04:05.609> range<00:04:05.970> this<00:04:06.540> weapon

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
kills about one or two bursts of that

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.670 
kills about one or two bursts of that

the reason why a load of snipers want
this<00:04:36.100> number<00:04:36.789> one<00:04:36.940> is<00:04:37.090> kind<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.389> red<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.810> get

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
this number one is kind of red to get

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.230 
this number one is kind of red to get
number<00:04:38.560> two<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.009> fire<00:04:39.310> rate<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.610> going<00:04:39.789> up<00:04:40.030> by

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
number two the fire rate is going up by

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.270 
number two the fire rate is going up by
one<00:04:40.600> which<00:04:41.110> means<00:04:41.380> that<00:04:41.470> quickscoping<00:04:42.160> is

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
one which means that quickscoping is

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.740 
one which means that quickscoping is
going<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.520> be<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.610> little<00:04:42.850> bit<00:04:43.090> easier<00:04:43.300> because

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
going to be a little bit easier because

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.990 
going to be a little bit easier because
you'll<00:04:44.080> be<00:04:44.199> able<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.680> reload<00:04:45.190> a<00:04:45.220> bit<00:04:45.460> faster

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
you'll be able to reload a bit faster

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.480 
you'll be able to reload a bit faster
and<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.120> fire<00:04:46.419> rate<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:46.780> also<00:04:47.350> faster<00:04:47.680> on<00:04:48.070> this

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
and the fire rate is also faster on this

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.370 
and the fire rate is also faster on this
weapon<00:04:48.759> and<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:49.479> is<00:04:49.600> definitely<00:04:49.750> a<00:04:50.020> snipe<00:04:50.229> and

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
weapon and it is definitely a snipe and

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.140 
weapon and it is definitely a snipe and
a<00:04:50.440> half<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.800> have<00:04:50.979> it<00:04:51.130> too<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.550> considered<00:04:52.060> it

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
and I considered it to be one of the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.550 
and I considered it to be one of the
best<00:04:53.740> quickscoping<00:04:54.780> snipers<00:04:55.780> in<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:56.110> game<00:04:56.350> if
