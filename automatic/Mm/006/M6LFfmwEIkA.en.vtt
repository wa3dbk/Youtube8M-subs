features<00:02:10.459> high<00:02:10.880> accuracy<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.510> surface

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
features high accuracy and surface

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.130 
features high accuracy and surface
quality<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:12.950> completely<00:02:13.400> burry<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
quality and is completely burry the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.900 
quality and is completely burry the
product<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.620> machined<00:02:15.980> without<00:02:16.220> any<00:02:16.400> contact

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
product is machined without any contact

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.030 
product is machined without any contact
so<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.690> product<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.140> not<00:02:18.350> subjected<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.950> any

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
so the product is not subjected to any

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.460 
so the product is not subjected to any
mechanical<00:02:19.790> stress<00:02:20.060> nor<00:02:20.989> is<00:02:21.140> there<00:02:21.290> any

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
mechanical stress nor is there any

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.650 
mechanical stress nor is there any
thermal<00:02:21.890> stress<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> product<00:02:22.819> so<00:02:23.270> no<00:02:23.420> heat

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
thermal stress on the product so no heat

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.500 
thermal stress on the product so no heat
affected<00:02:24.110> zone<00:02:24.319> develops<00:02:25.030> furthermore<00:02:26.030> there

affected zone develops furthermore there

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.509 
affected zone develops furthermore there
is<00:02:26.540> no<00:02:26.810> mechanical<00:02:27.410> or<00:02:27.590> thermal<00:02:27.620> load<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
is no mechanical or thermal load on the

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.960 
is no mechanical or thermal load on the
tool<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.330> there<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.630> no<00:02:29.780> possibility<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.500> where
