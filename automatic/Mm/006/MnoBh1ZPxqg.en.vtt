00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.879
 ah 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.869
 hi hello oompa loompas de limoncello 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.279
 Today's recipe I bring cream 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.680
 lemon is super delicious to believe me for 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.650
 we're going to need 5 yolks and two 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.630
 medium eggs 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.630
 the zest of a medium lemon 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.170
 we will also need 110 grams of juice 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.960
 of lemon but please freshly squeezed 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.900
 not the one that they sell in the super that does not 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.900
 110 grams of sugar is very good 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.580
 and 60 grams of unsalted butter 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.890
 Today I 'm going to teach you how to make this cream 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.970
 peirÃ³ focused more to beginners 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.950
 look 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.930
 we need a pot with water so that 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.130
 the steam in the bowl above and 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.500
 we can make the cream without us 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.090
 cut well now be careful because 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.730
 when the water is boiling the steam 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.070
 you have to take the bowl fast and throw it 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.930
 for you because if not the vapor of 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.900
 water can burn your hand or 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.360
 forward 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.520
 the moment you take the bowl and I did it 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.110
 is back and forth is more possible than 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.180
 my hands are worth so always 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.270
 remember or forward or backward and a 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.830
 fast movement well as you see we put 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.480
 the yolks and the eggs in the bowl and 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.160
 we add the lemon juice we mix 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.760
 well with the rods and we add the 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.340
 sugar and lemon zest 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.020
 have prepared a colander nearby voucher and 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.690
 a clean bowl because there we will have 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.610
 to spend the cream 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.250
 once our water is boiling 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.380
 we put the bowl over 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.750
 with the help of a rod we will go 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.060
 moving 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.710
 and little by little the first thing that will happen 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.890
 in this cream is that it's going to start 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.530
 every time it's going to have more foam and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.560
 every time it's going to be denser if you give 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.050
 mind I'm already grabbing the bowl with 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.460
 a rag is worth it so we will avoid burning and 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.590
 from time to time we raise so that 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.270
 come out a little steam when you see that 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.910
 the lemon cream starts to thicken 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.840
 it's going to be time to remove it here 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.840
 you can see the texture 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.300
 when you see that the brand of 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.800
 rods stay in the cream that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.950
 means that you will be ready to 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.140
 pass it through the colander 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.879
 let's pass this cream through the colander 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.099
 and with the help of the rods as you see 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.989
 because it's so much easier because that's how we 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.090
 will be much smoother remember that 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.709
 Take the lemon zest and so on 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.230
 we will avoid finding the pieces of 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.890
 lemon inside the eye cream that if you 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.209
 like you can leave it butter this 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.670
 it's very important you have to add the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.980
 cold while you make the cream leave it 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.660
 cut into squares as you can see inside 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.250
 of the fridge and when the cream is already 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.170
 passed through the strainer we add the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.150
 cold butter 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.860
 we move well with the rods until 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.630
 the butter has melted when 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.819
 you see that you already have the cream as 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.940
 you are watching in the bright smooth video 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.319
 and pretty we passed it to a bowl and this is 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.380
 exactly like the custard 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.150
 We put a piece of paper, film that touches 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.850
 well the cream like that will not dry us 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.430
 It is important that the cream rest 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.750
 minimum in the fridge an hour although to me 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.430
 the creams I always like to leave 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.220
 made in the afternoon and use them daily 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.680
 next I recommend you use this cream 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.150
 of lemon with the recipe that I published makes 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.910
 a couple of weeks of lemon sponge cake 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.069
 it's super delicious if you like the 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.540
 lemon as much as me really down at 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.010
