00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.050
 today we are going to cook potato gnocchi with 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.030
 cabrales sauce the ingredients will be 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.660
 potatoes eggs flour cheese oil wine 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.250
 white tin liquid salt and nutmeg 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.250
 we put on our super apron 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.590
 first of all let's start peeling 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.929
 the potatoes in our case this recipe 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.199
 We're going to do it for three people and 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:30.140
 we will peel approximately 750 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.689
 grams of potatoes 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.070
 We put them to boil, we leave them to 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.070
 so boil before 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 well in pieces 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.850
 and we will have them boiling because you know 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.210
 about 15-20 minutes depending on the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.210
 potato 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.260
 once they are boiled potatoes 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.970
 we are going to drain well 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.870
 helping us with a colander 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.870
 there they go 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.829
 and now we're going to go through the 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.830
 food mill 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.420
 this process of mashing the potatoes 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.250
 You can also do it with a 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.439
 blender but good we have 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.439
 used in this case the puree step 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.159
 We are going to add this potato dough 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.219
 3 eggs 1 2 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.159
 and 3 and we're going to mix the set well 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.759
 so that both elements are integrated 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.759
 egg and potato 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.630
 let's add a little piece of salt that 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.360
 we will go throwing more if necessary 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.690
 and our touch of nutmeg 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.800
 we remove everything well 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.800
 to mix 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.010
 On the other hand, we are going to weigh the flour 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.490
 let's see how much flour for this 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:56.399
 amount of potato 230 grams 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.890
 and we're going to incorporate it into the mix 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.630
 of potato and egg 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.830
 we have to move everything well so that it 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.490
 there is a uniform mixture 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.979
 on the other hand let's make the sauce 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.250
 we put in a saucepan to heat cream 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.020
 liquid that can be 16 in matter 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.360
 of rasa or thirty-something that already as 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.350
 you want 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.030
 we're good in salsa and now we're going to 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.980
 add half a glass of white wine 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.340
 a normal white wine that you can 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.910
 find in any supermarket 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.280
 we add the half glass 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.710
 and now the cheese we have chosen 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.450
 the cabrales cheese although it is quite 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.250
 powerful 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.660
 when we will throw it then it depends on whether 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.360
 you like cheese a lot or little if 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.980
 you want me to know stronger or looser 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.660
 we already see what we have 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.220
 aggregate 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.220
 we leave it there reduce 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.090
 and now let's fill a sleeve 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.090
 pastry with the mass of the year x 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.110
 We fill it well and now only remains 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.560
 meet him x 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.150
 we will be doing cuts with the scissors 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.860
 If the scissors sticks we can 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.640
 wet a little in the water so that 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.640
 keep cutting well 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.510
 when the nikis are done the trick 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.760
 is to throw them in the water 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.069
 and when I go up it means 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.349
 that are already cooked more or less in 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.349
 Time is approximately 3 minutes 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.480
 we have already known our year quiz 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.480
 that as you can see enough has come out 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.840
 and now it only remains to add that sauce 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.350
 that we had reducing the cream sauce 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.670
 white wine and cabrales is reduced and 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.670
 we add gnocchi 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.230
 and the result here you have a plate 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:02.110
 very simple and very rich if you liked 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.110
 subscribe and give likes bye bye
