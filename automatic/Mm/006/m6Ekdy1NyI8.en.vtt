the one which I think it's the basis

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.550 
the one which I think it's the basis
upon<00:01:31.340> what<00:01:32.340> people<00:01:32.610> think<00:01:33.140> opportunities<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560

better kind of reasoning about it but
like<00:05:27.580> I'm<00:05:28.000> see<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.990> America<00:05:29.620> definitely<00:05:29.830> is

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
like I'm see that America definitely is

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.600 
like I'm see that America definitely is
filled<00:05:32.020> with<00:05:32.890> opportunity<00:05:33.750> but<00:05:35.130> just<00:05:36.130> being

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
filled with opportunity but just being

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.060 
filled with opportunity but just being
somebody<00:05:36.880> that<00:05:37.000> works<00:05:37.270> hard<00:05:37.770> isn't<00:05:38.770> going<00:05:38.950> to

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
somebody that works hard isn't going to

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.270 
somebody that works hard isn't going to
make<00:05:39.220> you<00:05:40.380> strive<00:05:41.380> isn't<00:05:41.860> gonna<00:05:41.950> make<00:05:42.070> you

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
make you strive isn't gonna make you

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.150 
make you strive isn't gonna make you
successful<00:05:42.729> it's<00:05:43.720> gonna<00:05:43.870> make<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.229> a<00:05:44.290> good

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
successful it's gonna make you a good

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.510 
successful it's gonna make you a good
cog<00:05:45.970> in<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.600> system<00:05:46.990> rather<00:05:47.440> than<00:05:47.860> being<00:05:48.130> a

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
cog in the system rather than being a

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.890 
cog in the system rather than being a
master<00:05:49.090> of<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.600> system<00:05:50.010> so<00:05:51.010> yeah<00:05:51.940> it<00:05:52.690> was<00:05:52.810> just

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
master of the system so yeah it was just

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.380 
master of the system so yeah it was just
a<00:05:53.050> weird<00:05:53.229> kind<00:05:53.530> of<00:05:53.650> thing<00:05:53.710> which<00:05:54.040> I<00:05:54.160> just<00:05:54.669> think

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
a weird kind of thing which I just think

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.690 
a weird kind of thing which I just think
like<00:05:55.840> I<00:05:56.020> really<00:05:56.440> felt<00:05:56.680> that<00:05:56.860> America<00:05:56.979> was<00:05:57.669> a

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
like I really felt that America was a

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.850 
like I really felt that America was a
place<00:05:58.120> that<00:05:58.350> even<00:05:59.350> if<00:05:59.440> you<00:05:59.530> worked<00:05:59.770> hard

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
place that even if you worked hard

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.440 
place that even if you worked hard
you're<00:06:00.220> never<00:06:00.490> really<00:06:00.640> good<00:06:00.880> again<00:06:01.120> ewhere

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
you're never really good again ewhere

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.159 
you're never really good again ewhere
but<00:06:02.080> if<00:06:02.260> you<00:06:02.440> were<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:02.950> little<00:06:03.880> bit<00:06:04.180> more<00:06:04.210> daring

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
but if you were a little bit more daring

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.590 
but if you were a little bit more daring
