to<00:02:42.280> obviously<00:02:43.150> find<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:44.050> starting<00:02:44.410> point<00:02:44.770> to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
to obviously find a starting point to

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.210 
to obviously find a starting point to
try<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.280> match<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:47.050> colors<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.740> film<00:02:47.980> as

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
try to match the colors of the film as

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.099 
try to match the colors of the film as
the<00:02:49.200> creative<00:02:50.200> guys<00:02:50.790> intended<00:02:51.790> feed

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.880 

so<00:02:57.109> what<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.349> did<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:58.840> got<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.900> hold<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.439> our

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
so what we did is I got a hold of our

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.369 
so what we did is I got a hold of our
Telus<00:03:01.700> any<00:03:01.879> analysis<00:03:02.359> films<00:03:02.689> called<00:03:02.810> T<00:03:03.079> a.m.

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
Telus any analysis films called T a.m.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.119 
Telus any analysis films called T a.m.
and<00:03:04.540> what<00:03:05.540> we<00:03:05.659> do<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:05.930> we<00:03:06.079> align<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.799> Telus

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
and what we do is we align the Telus

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.390 
and what we do is we align the Telus
city<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.790> match<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.750> color<00:03:09.019> information<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
city to match the color information the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.099 
city to match the color information the
grayscale<00:03:10.969> and<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:12.230> detail<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.829> that<00:03:12.859> film

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
grayscale and the detail of that film

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.690 
grayscale and the detail of that film
now<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:16.480> prints<00:03:17.480> at<00:03:17.629> that<00:03:17.930> time<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:19.489> had<00:03:19.670> a

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
now the prints at that time you had a

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.819 
now the prints at that time you had a
lot<00:03:19.969> of<00:03:20.000> grain<00:03:20.329> but<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:21.019> standard<00:03:21.469> depth<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
lot of grain but in standard depth the

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.410 
lot of grain but in standard depth the
grain<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.189> conscious<00:03:22.609> mushed<00:03:22.849> over<00:03:23.150> because

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
grain is conscious mushed over because

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.780 
grain is conscious mushed over because
you<00:03:23.510> didn't<00:03:23.689> really<00:03:23.930> see<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.680> grain<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.489> now

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
you didn't really see the grain and now

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.679 
you didn't really see the grain and now
we're<00:03:26.030> taking<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.420> HD<00:03:27.700> it's<00:03:28.700> looking<00:03:29.209> further

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
we're taking to HD it's looking further

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:30.819 
we're taking to HD it's looking further
into<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.079> film<00:03:30.319> we're<00:03:30.439> seeing<00:03:30.680> more

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
into the film we're seeing more

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.559 
into the film we're seeing more
resolution<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.939> of<00:03:32.030> course<00:03:32.239> one<00:03:32.419> of<00:03:32.450> the

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
resolution and of course one of the

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.539 
resolution and of course one of the
byproducts<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.169> resolution<00:03:33.829> for<00:03:33.859> any<00:03:34.099> film

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
byproducts of resolution for any film

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.520 
byproducts of resolution for any film
it's<00:03:34.970> great<00:03:35.269> great<00:03:35.569> is<00:03:35.689> what<00:03:35.840> gives<00:03:36.049> us<00:03:36.139> the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
it's great great is what gives us the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.520 
it's great great is what gives us the
resolution

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.140 

that's<00:03:40.430> probably<00:03:40.640> one<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.060> most

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
that's probably one of the most

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.770 
that's probably one of the most
important<00:03:41.810> things<00:03:42.020> about<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:42.770> project<00:03:43.070> is

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
important things about this project is

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.280 
important things about this project is
trying<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.930> be<00:03:45.290> as<00:03:46.300> true<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.600> honest<00:03:47.990> and<00:03:48.170> do

trying to be as true and honest and do

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.530 
trying to be as true and honest and do
the<00:03:48.590> proper<00:03:48.950> reproduction<00:03:49.820> if<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.120> will<00:03:50.300> of

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
the proper reproduction if you will of

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.610 
the proper reproduction if you will of
this<00:03:50.660> film<00:03:50.960> I<00:03:51.730> feel<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:53.540> we've<00:03:53.750> accomplished

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
this film I feel that we've accomplished

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.800 
this film I feel that we've accomplished
making<00:03:55.550> it<00:03:55.670> look<00:03:55.880> as<00:03:56.150> true<00:03:56.510> as<00:03:56.570> a<00:03:56.690> good

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
making it look as true as a good

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.340 
making it look as true as a good
positive<00:03:56.960> look<00:03:57.460> and<00:03:58.460> when<00:03:58.670> you<00:03:58.730> look<00:03:58.880> at<00:03:58.940> this

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
positive look and when you look at this

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.410 
positive look and when you look at this
I<00:04:00.350> think<00:04:00.860> you'll<00:04:00.980> be<00:04:01.130> pleasantly<00:04:01.790> surprised

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.610 
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised
with<00:04:02.750> this<00:04:02.900> version<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.500> Dragon<00:04:03.800> Ball<00:04:04.070> Z<00:04:05.620> I

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
with this version of Dragon Ball Z I

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.530 
with this version of Dragon Ball Z I
want<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.160> see<00:04:07.310> what<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.580> great<00:04:07.820> Jack<00:04:08.180> rods

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
want to see what the great Jack rods

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:40.519 
want to see what the great Jack rods
made<00:04:08.900> of

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:40.529 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.719 

the<00:04:41.529> first<00:04:41.740> filter<00:04:41.949> we<00:04:42.099> use<00:04:42.279> is<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.550> dust

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
the first filter we use is the dust

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.189 
the first filter we use is the dust
filter<00:04:43.059> because<00:04:43.779> we're<00:04:43.900> working<00:04:44.050> with

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
filter because we're working with

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.140 
filter because we're working with
animated<00:04:44.559> material<00:04:45.069> the<00:04:45.430> filter<00:04:45.729> is<00:04:45.789> kind<00:04:46.089> of

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
animated material the filter is kind of

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.480 
animated material the filter is kind of
prone<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.599> removing<00:04:47.050> stars<00:04:47.499> from<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.860> sky<00:04:48.099> or

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
prone to removing stars from the sky or

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.029 
prone to removing stars from the sky or
people's<00:04:49.389> pupils<00:04:49.809> so<00:04:50.289> we<00:04:50.409> have<00:04:50.529> to<00:04:50.680> remove<00:04:50.889> it

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
people's pupils so we have to remove it

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.589 
people's pupils so we have to remove it
from<00:04:51.129> specific<00:04:51.610> parts<00:04:51.849> of<00:04:51.939> specific<00:04:52.360> scenes

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
from specific parts of specific scenes

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.820 
from specific parts of specific scenes
before<00:04:53.080> we<00:04:53.319> send<00:04:53.499> it<00:04:53.559> on<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.889> fixed<00:04:54.069> fast

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
before we send it on to the fixed fast

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.290 
before we send it on to the fixed fast
so<00:04:56.830> after<00:04:57.189> the<00:04:57.309> dust<00:04:57.490> pass<00:04:57.699> we<00:04:57.879> move<00:04:58.059> on<00:04:58.150> to

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
so after the dust pass we move on to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.089 
so after the dust pass we move on to
doing<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:58.599> fixed<00:04:58.900> pass<00:04:59.050> painting<00:04:59.740> out<00:04:59.860> any

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
doing the fixed pass painting out any

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.839 
doing the fixed pass painting out any
blemishes<00:05:00.599> abnormalities<00:05:01.599> even<00:05:02.259> hairs

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
frame by frame we find my front and

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.529 
frame by frame we find my front and
frame<00:05:08.889> just<00:05:09.189> basically<00:05:09.610> anything<00:05:09.969> that's

marks<00:05:14.259> between<00:05:14.559> the<00:05:15.039> scenes<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.879> it<00:05:16.599> is<00:05:16.779> most

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
marks between the scenes and it is most

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:39.070 
marks between the scenes and it is most
time-consuming<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:19.029> all<00:05:19.809> the<00:05:20.080> process

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.239 

after<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.169> fix<00:05:40.379> passed<00:05:40.619> we<00:05:40.770> run<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.039> steady

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:41.249 
after the fix passed we run the steady

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:42.409 
after the fix passed we run the steady
filter<00:05:41.639> which<00:05:41.879> gets<00:05:42.119> rid<00:05:42.240> of<00:05:42.300> the

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
filter which gets rid of the

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.879
