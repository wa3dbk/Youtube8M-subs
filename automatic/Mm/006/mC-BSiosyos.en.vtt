00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.060
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.760
 our today's episode of game talk 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.770
 live today we deal with 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.869
 bioshock but not with the whole 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.780
 row but with the latest litter 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.660
 bioshock infinite 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.890
 the developed studio irrational games 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.200
 had the expectation for the game 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.970
 relatively high screwed there was already one 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.880
 few horny trailer was really 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.960
 wonderful you have to admit 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.920
 However , the game also wants to keep it up 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.780
 the development several times to the revanche 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.300
 and maybe it is not like that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.850
 amazing that ken levine now 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.490
 the boss of the national games studio 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.120
 word reported and a little unsightly 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.309
 announcement made bioshock infinite 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.170
 will have to come without multiplayer part 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.299
 That means the game will be complete 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 be singleplayer 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.350
 reason for this is simple as he says 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.780
 that the team is neither enough time nor is it 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.409
 it nice and now even the multiplayer 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.060
 Part ready to bring in the whole 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.010
 multiplayer plans and similar vehicle 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 completely worked out that means one 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.020
 I had the concept ready now 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.020
 But there is no time and money for that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 it is still possible to install many of them 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.020
 it will be a pity workshop 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.900
 be further singleplayer 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.790
 the game will not have a multiplayer 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.940
 and well, maybe many will 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.810
 disturb those who were happy too 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.860
 maybe it will be for some time 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.530
 not buy reason one does not know but am 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.540
 ken levine said where the animals are 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.000
 you never know when we will go back and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.190
 it will be rethinking again 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.770
 was a really cool stuff there though 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.810
 it just was not ready 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.880
 means that it could well happen 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.390
 that sometime later than dlc 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.460
 possibly also chargeable then 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.590
 a multiplayer part will follow 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.080
 He kept the door open with the door 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.560
 a vague statement because more accurate 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.360
 but at first you only suspect 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.230
 So bioshock infinite first without 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.600
 multiplayer 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.460
 how do you think that's what you think 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.280
 hinders this now on the purchase or 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.100
 that just a reason because then more trouble 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.210
 when singleplayer is given 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.790
 Just leave a comment I 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.870
 I'm curious how you see it and that 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.380
 It would be then again for today 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.550
 been 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.890
 I hope you will hear the next 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.890
 until then people cia
