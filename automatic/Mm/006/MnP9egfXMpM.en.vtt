00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
rock is just always straight for it so

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.090 
rock is just always straight for it so
it's<00:03:48.940> accented<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.690> each<00:03:49.930> no<00:03:50.530> it's<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.830> term

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
it's accented on each no it's the term

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.820 
it's accented on each no it's the term
from<00:03:51.250> each<00:03:51.459> arm<00:03:51.820> sticking<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.930> play<00:03:53.170> but

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.320 
with funk or with jazz or whatever
it<00:03:56.800> just<00:03:57.040> depends<00:03:57.370> on<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.550> accent<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.270> I'll

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330
