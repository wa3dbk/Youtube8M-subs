it<00:02:22.740> with<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> level<00:02:23.010> one<00:02:23.300> but<00:02:24.300> i'm<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.450> going<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
it with a level one but i'm not going to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.990 
it with a level one but i'm not going to
actually<00:02:24.990> put<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:26.460> video

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
actually put it in this this video

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.190 
actually put it in this this video
because<00:02:27.270> i<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.540> t<00:02:27.630> bugga<00:02:27.780> bugga<00:02:27.960> now<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
because i can t bugga bugga now and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.420 
because i can t bugga bugga now and
everything<00:02:28.500> but<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.100> actually<00:02:29.160> make<00:02:29.400> a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
everything but you can actually make a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.690 
everything but you can actually make a
gate<00:02:30.030> level<00:02:30.180> 1<00:02:30.450> go<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.050> auction<00:02:31.170> house

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
gate level 1 go to the auction house

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.310 
gate level 1 go to the auction house
like<00:02:32.700> first<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.690> have<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.870> get<00:02:33.960> a<00:02:33.990> level<00:02:34.140> one

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
like first you have to get a level one

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
like first you have to get a level one
then<00:02:34.470> if<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.590> get<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> hundred<00:02:34.920> gold<00:02:35.160> that's

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
then if I get a hundred gold that's

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.950 
then if I get a hundred gold that's
pretty<00:02:35.550> easy<00:02:35.580> go<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.390> oxygen<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.750> ask

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
pretty easy go to the oxygen just ask

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.840 
pretty easy go to the oxygen just ask
any<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.500> your<00:02:37.620> friends<00:02:37.800> up<00:02:37.980> mates<00:02:38.160> go<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
any one of your friends up mates go to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.680 
any one of your friends up mates go to
the<00:02:38.970> auction<00:02:39.060> house<00:02:39.500> buy<00:02:40.500> items<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:42.510> would

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the auction house buy items and it would

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.990 
the auction house buy items and it would
tell<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.350> what<00:02:43.590> items<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.040> buy<00:02:44.160> up<00:02:44.370> items<00:02:44.880> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
tell you what items to buy up items to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.930 
tell you what items to buy up items to
resell<00:02:46.160> with<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.220> tad<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.520> add-on<00:02:47.820> is

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
resell with a tad on the add-on is

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.930 
resell with a tad on the add-on is
really<00:02:48.330> really<00:02:48.600> complex<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:50.700> actually

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
really really complex but it actually

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.440 
really really complex but it actually
like<00:02:51.240> simplifies<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.930> add-on<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:53.450> it

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
like simplifies at the add-on so it

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.699 
like simplifies at the add-on so it
would<00:02:54.570> just<00:02:54.660> told<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.990> shut<00:02:55.200> away<00:02:55.320> what<00:02:55.620> to

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
would just told you shut away what to

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.780 
would just told you shut away what to
buy<00:02:55.830> what's<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.280> best<00:02:56.310> thing<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:57.680> yeah

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
buy what's the best thing and yeah

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
buy what's the best thing and yeah
unlike<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.970> other<00:03:00.120> ones<00:03:00.300> like<00:03:00.420> auction<00:03:00.750> II

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
unlike the other ones like auction II

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.060 
unlike the other ones like auction II
and<00:03:00.959> everything<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.410> isn't<00:03:01.620> that's<00:03:01.860> like

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
and everything it isn't that's like

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.860 
and everything it isn't that's like
really<00:03:02.280> complicated<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.970> stuff<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.660> is

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
really complicated and stuff this is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.220 
really complicated and stuff this is
like<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.110> most<00:03:04.200> easy<00:03:04.920> out<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.700> i<00:03:06.230> recommend
