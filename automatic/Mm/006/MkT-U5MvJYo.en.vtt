dirty<00:01:21.000> again<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> again<00:01:24.090> these<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.330> size<00:01:24.689> 8

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
dirty again and again these are size 8

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
dirty again and again these are size 8
these<00:01:26.369> are<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> ones<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.090> zipper<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
these are the ones with zipper all the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:38.420 
these are the ones with zipper all the
mounts<00:01:36.560> I'm<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.740> sure<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:37.979> these<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.310> been

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
mounts I'm not sure if these have been

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.520 
mounts I'm not sure if these have been
worn<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:39.270> whether<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.780> bottoms<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.320> just

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
worn or whether the bottoms are just

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
worn or whether the bottoms are just
like<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.720> not<00:01:42.720> sure<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.350> both<00:01:43.500> are

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
like that not sure but they both are

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.600 
like that not sure but they both are
size<00:01:44.009> 8<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.729> first<00:01:48.030> pair<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
size 8 so that's the first pair so I

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.690 
size 8 so that's the first pair so I
guess<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.750> put<00:01:51.990> these<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.890> I'll<00:01:53.520> be

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
guess I will put these on and I'll be

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:05.850 
guess I will put these on and I'll be
right<00:01:53.850> back

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.990 

they're<00:02:06.100> just<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.520> taupe<00:02:06.910> color<00:02:07.120> very<00:02:07.990> neutral

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.490 

no<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.030> do<00:02:13.300> see<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.230> these<00:02:14.410> are<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:15.130> bit<00:02:15.610> loose

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
no I do see that these are a bit loose

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.170 
no I do see that these are a bit loose
now<00:02:17.500> if<00:02:17.650> your<00:02:17.770> shoes<00:02:17.950> are<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.400> loose<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.790> just

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
now if your shoes are that loose I just

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.480 
now if your shoes are that loose I just
can't<00:02:19.360> gel<00:02:19.660> inserts<00:02:20.140> for<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.530> bath<00:02:20.680> just<00:02:21.340> to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
can't gel inserts for the bath just to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.620 
can't gel inserts for the bath just to
tighten<00:02:21.700> them<00:02:21.940> up<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.120> bit

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
tighten them up a bit

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.750 
tighten them up a bit
so<00:02:23.290> that's<00:02:23.410> what<00:02:23.620> I'll<00:02:23.710> probably<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.730> a
