00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
has a lot of people have had this issue

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.750 
has a lot of people have had this issue
and<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:44.800> actually<00:00:44.980> haven't<00:00:45.340> had<00:00:45.400> this<00:00:45.580> issue

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
and I actually haven't had this issue

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.430 
and I actually haven't had this issue
myself<00:00:46.330> so<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:46.540> figured<00:00:46.780> I'd<00:00:46.900> go<00:00:47.020> in<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.320> make<00:00:47.410> a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
myself so I figured I'd go in and make a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.530 
myself so I figured I'd go in and make a

should<00:01:07.090> be<00:01:07.600> up<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:07.930> working<00:01:08.140> I'm<00:01:08.410> done<00:01:08.590> this

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
should be up and working I'm done this

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.740 
should be up and working I'm done this
about<00:01:08.950> two<00:01:09.250> or<00:01:09.400> three<00:01:09.430> times<00:01:09.850> with<00:01:10.060> my<00:01:10.240> devices

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
about two or three times with my devices

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.880 
about two or three times with my devices
that<00:01:10.840> have<00:01:10.930> been<00:01:11.020> water<00:01:11.229> damage<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:11.710> they've

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
that have been water damage and they've

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.340 
that have been water damage and they've
worked<00:01:12.270> every<00:01:13.270> single<00:01:13.570> time<00:01:13.750> so<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.320> doesn't

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
worked every single time so it doesn't

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.690 
worked every single time so it doesn't
work<00:01:14.680> every<00:01:14.920> time<00:01:15.070> but<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.400> works<00:01:15.610> the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
work every time but it works the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.890 
work every time but it works the
majority<00:01:16.119> of<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.240> time<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:16.630> let's<00:01:16.810> get

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
majority of the time so let's get

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.050 
majority of the time so let's get
straight<00:01:17.080> into<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.440> steps<00:01:17.680> as<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.790> can<00:01:18.910> see<00:01:19.030> I

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
straight into the steps as you can see I

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.580 
straight into the steps as you can see I
have<00:01:19.210> them<00:01:19.270> all<00:01:19.420> typed<00:01:19.660> out<00:01:19.810> here<00:01:20.110> so<00:01:20.320> I<00:01:20.350> don't

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
have them all typed out here so I don't

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.900 
have them all typed out here so I don't
have<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.740> water<00:01:20.950> damage<00:01:21.280> device<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.670> show<00:01:21.850> you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
have a water damage device to show you

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.499 
have a water damage device to show you
this<00:01:22.180> right<00:01:22.869> now<00:01:22.930> but<00:01:23.350> I'll<00:01:23.440> go<00:01:23.619> ahead<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.509> go

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
this right now but I'll go ahead and go

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.330 
this right now but I'll go ahead and go
through<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.810> steps<00:01:25.869> anyways<00:01:26.410> let<00:01:26.920> me<00:01:26.979> zoom<00:01:27.160> up

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
through the steps anyways let me zoom up

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.580 
through the steps anyways let me zoom up
here<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.550> little<00:01:27.640> bit<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.990> basically<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.380> first

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
here a little bit so basically the first

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.469 
here a little bit so basically the first
step<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:30.070> do<00:01:30.190> is<00:01:30.220> if<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.729> water<00:01:30.910> damage<00:01:31.300> your

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
step to do is if you water damage your

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.749 
step to do is if you water damage your
device<00:01:31.570> go<00:01:32.020> ahead<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.680> immediately<00:01:33.340> turn<00:01:33.610> off

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
device go ahead and immediately turn off

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.330 
device go ahead and immediately turn off
the<00:01:33.880> device<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.330> remove<00:01:34.450> any<00:01:34.840> cases<00:01:35.410> that<00:01:36.250> you

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
the device and remove any cases that you

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.520 
the device and remove any cases that you
may<00:01:36.460> have<00:01:36.670> on<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.910> device<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:37.420> dry<00:01:37.780> off<00:01:38.020> the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
may have on the device and dry off the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.710 
may have on the device and dry off the
device<00:01:38.979> completely<00:01:39.310> with<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.640> paper<00:01:39.880> towel<00:01:40.180> or

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
device completely with a paper towel or

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.350 
device completely with a paper towel or
a<00:01:40.750> towel<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:42.250> get<00:01:42.369> all<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.610> excess<00:01:42.850> water<00:01:43.090> off

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
a towel to get all the excess water off

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.240 
a towel to get all the excess water off
you<00:01:43.899> don't<00:01:44.200> want<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.530> leader<00:01:44.740> device<00:01:45.070> on

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
you don't want a leader device on

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.160 
you don't want a leader device on
because<00:01:45.520> then<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.700> makes<00:01:45.880> short-circuit<00:01:46.750> you

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
because then it makes short-circuit you

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.389 
because then it makes short-circuit you
don't<00:01:47.319> want<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.500> let<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.710> water<00:01:47.860> sit<00:01:48.100> on<00:01:48.250> there

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
don't want to let the water sit on there

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.590 
don't want to let the water sit on there
because<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.700> may<00:01:48.789> short-circuit<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
because it may short-circuit and the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.330 
because it may short-circuit and the
device<00:01:49.780> may<00:01:50.020> just<00:01:50.200> be<00:01:50.319> wrecked<00:01:50.560> from<00:01:51.250> the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
device may just be wrecked from the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.090 
device may just be wrecked from the
beginning<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:51.940> make<00:01:52.119> sure<00:01:52.149> that<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.539> do<00:01:52.750> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
beginning so make sure that you do that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.620 
beginning so make sure that you do that
just<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.220> make<00:01:54.310> sure<00:01:54.369> that<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.819> keep<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.240> in<00:01:55.479> a

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
just to make sure that you keep it in a

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.919 
just to make sure that you keep it in a
relatively<00:01:56.200> good<00:01:56.289> condition<00:01:56.350> from<00:01:57.160> the<00:01:57.310> start

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
relatively good condition from the start

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.699 
relatively good condition from the start
I'll<00:01:58.929> have<00:01:59.080> all<00:01:59.170> these<00:01:59.289> steps<00:01:59.530> in<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
I'll have all these steps in the

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.010 
I'll have all these steps in the
description<00:02:00.100> by<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.250> way<00:02:00.459> to<00:02:00.840> step<00:02:01.840> two
