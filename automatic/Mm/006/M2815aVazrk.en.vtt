00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.149
 made in the kitchen because of its 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.739

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.809
 calorie and 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.879
 rebalancing my diet 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.250
 now personally I am you 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.490
 advise you feel ready to include 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.020
 in fact some physical activity 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.150
 for several reasons that I you 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.860
 share and now first the sport 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
 will make you burn more calories 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.020
 so this plus your rebalancing 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.820
 food by lowering your calories at 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.979
 nutrition level will make sure you 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 go lose weight then in addition to 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.560
 calories burned because we are going 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.330
 redraw 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.740
 so that's something you're going 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.229
 really see at your level 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.060
 silhouette and who I assure you 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.850
 will do a lot of good you will 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.280
 feel firmer finer finer and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.890
 this will motivate you to continue more 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.329
 your muscles will become stronger and become 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.610
 louder she responds not to become 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.630
 bigger do not worry about 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.290
 that they become higher do 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 really go there 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.490
 they're going to firm up that means that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.619
 you were actually going to increase your rate 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.420
 of resting metabolism 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.189
 it simply means that as 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.020
 and as you go, you will burn more 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.850
 more calories even when you do not 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.469
 do not play sports and to finish at 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.540
 mind level that makes a big 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.549
 difference after your workout 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.799
 you feel so good it does 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.330
 a good crazy and well also the fact that 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.400
 you have this feeling of having done this 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.349
 what to do so that would put you 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.069
 in a much more positive attitude 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.260
 and this will help you so keep on 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.330
 the long term I 'm doing a sport that you 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.650
 agrees that you like that you like 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.390
 simply because otherwise you 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.160
 do not hold on in the long run 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.989
 and as for rebalancing 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.720
 food is a habit to take 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.790
 not just time to lose 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.470
 weight otherwise it will really serve 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.450
 pick up once you will stop but 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.700
 you will see that the effects of sport 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.110
 on your body are going little by little 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.450
 fade what would really be 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.400
 shame so better go for a 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.170
 gentler activity if you prefer 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.209
 but you will do in the long run 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.940
 started slowly by small 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.190
 sessions and gradually increase 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.110
 your body needs to adapt to 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.790
 this new physical activity so that 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.430
 it's useless to go there directly 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.720
 background and exhaust yourself and so when your 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.790
 body is not ready are you going to 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.590
 do not feel very well and you risk 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.379
 you disgust us better go there 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.170
 slowly slowly gradually but 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.300
 surely and little by little be able to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.800
 do more you do not have to do two 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.319
 hours of sport every day for that 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.050
 it's effective but we'll talk about it 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.580
 in a next video I tell you to 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.580
 soon and take care of yourself
