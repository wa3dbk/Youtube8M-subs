into<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.489> Carolinas<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.769> it<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:49.980> looks

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
into the Carolinas and it just looks

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.240 
into the Carolinas and it just looks
like<00:03:50.489> everything<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.150> there<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:52.950> always

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
like everything is there it's always

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.680 
like everything is there it's always
going<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.489> boil<00:03:53.700> down<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.120> mesoscale

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
going to boil down to the mesoscale

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.509 
going to boil down to the mesoscale
quite<00:03:55.019> frankly<00:03:55.350> one<00:03:55.620> big<00:03:55.829> question<00:03:56.010> will<00:03:56.430> to

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
quite frankly one big question will to

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.250 
quite frankly one big question will to
be<00:03:56.639> another<00:03:56.849> convective<00:03:57.359> complex<00:03:57.870> down<00:03:58.079> there

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
be another convective complex down there

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.289 
be another convective complex down there
in<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.410> Gulf<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:59.190> shut<00:03:59.430> things<00:03:59.609> off<00:03:59.940> like<00:04:00.180> we

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
in the Gulf to shut things off like we

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.059 
in the Gulf to shut things off like we
had<00:04:00.420> this<00:04:00.540> morning<00:04:00.780> if<00:04:01.109> not<00:04:01.590> it's<00:04:01.829> going<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.010> be

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
had this morning if not it's going to be

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.000 
had this morning if not it's going to be
a<00:04:02.099> really<00:04:02.340> rough<00:04:02.370> day<00:04:03.470> we'll<00:04:04.470> take<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> look<00:04:04.889> at

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
a really rough day we'll take a look at

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.650 
a really rough day we'll take a look at
the<00:04:06.170> modelling<00:04:07.170> here<00:04:07.349> this<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.450> GFS<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
the modelling here this is the GFS the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.289 
the modelling here this is the GFS the
twelves<00:04:09.989> Iran<00:04:10.349> at<00:04:10.500> noon<00:04:10.739> I'm<00:04:11.730> sorry<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.120> is

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
twelves Iran at noon I'm sorry this is

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.250 
twelves Iran at noon I'm sorry this is
at<00:04:12.419> 6am<00:04:12.930> tomorrow<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:14.389> obviously<00:04:15.389> you<00:04:15.900> see

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
at 6am tomorrow and obviously you see

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.810 
at 6am tomorrow and obviously you see
something<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.769> in<00:04:17.099> late<00:04:17.250> March<00:04:17.549> it's

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
something like that in late March it's

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.430 
something like that in late March it's
just<00:04:18.030> screaming<00:04:18.450> severe<00:04:18.840> weather<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.320> down

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
just screaming severe weather and down

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.589 
just screaming severe weather and down
at<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.650> surface<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.220> surface<00:04:20.250> low<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:20.970> near

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
at the surface the surface low is near

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.510 
at the surface the surface low is near
little<00:04:21.900> rock<00:04:21.930> with<00:04:22.320> very<00:04:22.740> active<00:04:23.159> weather<00:04:23.310> in

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
little rock with very active weather in

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.580 
little rock with very active weather in
progress<00:04:23.940> over<00:04:24.210> Mississippi<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.900> Alabama<00:04:24.960> I

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
progress over Mississippi and Alabama I

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.770 
progress over Mississippi and Alabama I
think<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.370> window<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:26.729> going<00:04:26.909> to<00:04:26.970> be<00:04:27.090> 38

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
think the window is going to be 38

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.629 
think the window is going to be 38
m<00:04:27.840> 2<00:04:28.050> 3pm<00:04:28.590> that's<00:04:28.950> going<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.160> be<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.400> core

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
m 2 3pm that's going to be the core

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.340 
m 2 3pm that's going to be the core
window<00:04:30.030> what<00:04:30.210> kind<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.420> open<00:04:30.690> up<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:30.900> 12-hour

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
window what kind of open up that 12-hour

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.280 
window what kind of open up that 12-hour
window<00:04:31.620> is<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.130> core<00:04:32.600> maybe<00:04:33.600> some<00:04:33.930> action<00:04:34.230> a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
window is the core maybe some action a

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.080 
window is the core maybe some action a
little<00:04:34.560> before<00:04:34.950> maybe<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.370> little<00:04:35.520> after<00:04:35.730> that

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
little before maybe a little after that

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.960 
little before maybe a little after that
but<00:04:36.270> that'll<00:04:36.480> be<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.720> big<00:04:36.870> 12<00:04:37.139> hour<00:04:37.290> window

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
but that'll be the big 12 hour window

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.159 
but that'll be the big 12 hour window
there's<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.090> look<00:04:39.210> at<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.419> instability<00:04:40.050> this

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
there's a look at the instability this

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.629 
there's a look at the instability this

northeastern part of the state stays

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.440 
northeastern part of the state stays
stable<00:04:58.020> I'm<00:04:58.320> really<00:04:58.620> don't<00:04:58.770> buy<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.790> think

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
stable I'm really don't buy that I think

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.000 
stable I'm really don't buy that I think
everybody<00:05:00.870> will<00:05:01.020> be<00:05:01.169> at<00:05:01.260> risk<00:05:01.290> tomorrow<00:05:01.680> from

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
everybody will be at risk tomorrow from

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.150 
everybody will be at risk tomorrow from
severe<00:05:02.370> weather<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:03.020> those<00:05:04.160> instability

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
severe weather and those instability

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.380 
severe weather and those instability
values<00:05:05.490> i<00:05:05.610> do<00:05:05.669> believe<00:05:05.910> can<00:05:06.210> be<00:05:06.240> achieved

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
values i do believe can be achieved

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.040 
values i do believe can be achieved
statewide<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:08.210> by<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.270> way<00:05:09.419> this<00:05:09.540> is<00:05:09.720> valid

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
statewide and by the way this is valid

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.370 
statewide and by the way this is valid
at<00:05:10.140> midday<00:05:10.530> tomorrow<00:05:11.600> olicity<00:05:12.600> seems<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.230> be

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
at midday tomorrow olicity seems to be

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.630 
at midday tomorrow olicity seems to be
maxed<00:05:14.130> out<00:05:14.280> over<00:05:14.730> East<00:05:15.120> Alabama<00:05:16.190> but<00:05:17.190> really

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
maxed out over East Alabama but really

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.130 
maxed out over East Alabama but really
that<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:17.940> numbers<00:05:18.210> are<00:05:18.240> very<00:05:18.600> high<00:05:18.840> all

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
that the numbers are very high all

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.300 
that the numbers are very high all
throughout<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.950> central<00:05:20.940> part<00:05:21.450> of<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.630> state

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
throughout the central part of the state

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.740 
throughout the central part of the state
you<00:05:23.310> can<00:05:23.430> see<00:05:23.550> those<00:05:23.700> hired<00:05:23.970> values<00:05:24.540> their

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
you can see those hired values their

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.440 
you can see those hired values their
places<00:05:25.080> like<00:05:25.350> Tuscaloosa<00:05:26.450> Birmingham

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
places like Tuscaloosa Birmingham

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.390 
places like Tuscaloosa Birmingham
aniston<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.380> numbers<00:05:28.650> really<00:05:28.919> max<00:05:29.160> out

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
aniston and the numbers really max out

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.860 
aniston and the numbers really max out
down<00:05:29.580> around<00:05:29.790> Lake<00:05:30.030> Martin<00:05:30.330> but<00:05:30.660> there's

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
down around Lake Martin but there's

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.870 
down around Lake Martin but there's
certainly<00:05:31.280> rotating<00:05:32.280> updrafts<00:05:32.760> are<00:05:32.820> a

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
certainly rotating updrafts are a

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.340 
certainly rotating updrafts are a
distinct<00:05:33.270> possibility<00:05:33.419> and<00:05:34.020> again<00:05:34.229> the

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
distinct possibility and again the

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.440 
distinct possibility and again the
concern<00:05:34.710> is<00:05:34.860> that<00:05:34.890> we<00:05:35.010> could<00:05:35.220> see<00:05:35.400> some<00:05:35.450> long

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
concern is that we could see some long
