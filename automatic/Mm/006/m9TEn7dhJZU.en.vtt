this game making tutorial and this part

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.200 
this game making tutorial and this part
will<00:00:09.750> be<00:00:10.050> adding<00:00:10.530> textures<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.400> our<00:00:11.519> game<00:00:11.820> so

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
will be adding textures to our game so

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.390 
will be adding textures to our game so
there<00:00:12.599> won't<00:00:12.719> be<00:00:12.870> only<00:00:13.139> rectangles<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.190> each

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
there won't be only rectangles in each

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.720 
there won't be only rectangles in each
missile<00:00:15.080> Ivan<00:00:16.080> I've<00:00:16.590> made<00:00:16.890> some<00:00:17.130> pictures

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
missile Ivan I've made some pictures

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.700 
missile Ivan I've made some pictures
here<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.449> cloud<00:00:19.199> some<00:00:19.619> enemies<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.699> round

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
here a cloud some enemies and a round

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.599 
here a cloud some enemies and a round
horizon<00:00:22.710> basically<00:00:24.920> first<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.310> when

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
horizon basically first of all when

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.779 
horizon basically first of all when
you're<00:00:26.760> making<00:00:27.029> textures<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.380> your<00:00:28.529> game<00:00:28.830> you

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you're making textures for your game you

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.290 
you're making textures for your game you
have<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.240> be<00:00:30.359> careful<00:00:31.019> when<00:00:31.920> sizing<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.000> image

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
have to be careful when sizing the image

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.470 
have to be careful when sizing the image
the<00:00:34.140> size<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> image<00:00:35.190> has<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the size of the image has to be in the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
the size of the image has to be in the
power<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.870> two<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.410> see<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.100> there<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
power of two as you see on there the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
power of two as you see on there the
little<00:00:39.059> tooltip<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.960> popped<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.350> there<00:00:40.530> that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
little tooltip that popped up there that

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.150 
little tooltip that popped up there that
dimensions<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> cloud<00:00:41.940> picture<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:43.160> 256

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
dimensions of the cloud picture is 256

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.510 
dimensions of the cloud picture is 256
times<00:00:44.489> 64<00:00:45.390> those<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:46.140> both<00:00:46.320> numbers<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.219> power

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
times 64 those are both numbers in power

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.900 
times 64 those are both numbers in power
of<00:00:47.820> two<00:00:48.440> same<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:50.010> other<00:00:50.340> pictures

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
of two same with with other pictures

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.689 
of two same with with other pictures
that<00:00:51.120> enemy2<00:00:52.039> is<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> size<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.059> 512<00:00:54.690> times

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
that enemy2 is in the size of 512 times

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.610 
that enemy2 is in the size of 512 times
512<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> am<00:00:58.890> yeah<00:00:59.399> when<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.850> know<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.620> let's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
512 so am yeah when we know that let's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.399 
512 so am yeah when we know that let's
go<00:01:02.280> ahead<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.730> add<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.329> images<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.080> our<00:01:04.199> game

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
go ahead and add the images to our game

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.320 
go ahead and add the images to our game
the<00:01:04.830> reason<00:01:05.309> why<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the reason why you have to have it in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
the reason why you have to have it in
the<00:01:06.420> power<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.810> 2<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.130> old

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the power of 2 is because some old

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.320 
the power of 2 is because some old
graphics<00:01:08.970> cards<00:01:10.340> don't<00:01:11.340> support<00:01:11.909> other

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
graphics cards don't support other

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.740 
graphics cards don't support other
images<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.170> only<00:01:13.950> support<00:01:14.520> images<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
images they only support images in the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.160 
images they only support images in the
power<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.140> 2<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> remember<00:01:18.390> remember<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
power of 2 so remember remember that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.010 
power of 2 so remember remember that
when<00:01:19.380> you're<00:01:19.530> making<00:01:19.650> no<00:01:19.920> textures<00:01:20.540> let's<00:01:21.540> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
when you're making no textures let's I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.050 
when you're making no textures let's I
like<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> make<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> new<00:01:23.009> folder<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.610> my<00:01:23.759> game

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
like to make a new folder in my game

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.219 
like to make a new folder in my game
directory<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:24.930> I'm<00:01:25.110> adding<00:01:26.030> images

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
directory when I'm adding images

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
directory when I'm adding images
textures<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:29.430> let's<00:01:29.880> call<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> fall

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
textures so like let's call this fall

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.740 
textures so like let's call this fall
the<00:01:30.540> textures<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.850> just<00:01:32.850> copy<00:01:33.119> paste<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the textures and just copy paste that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.800 
the textures and just copy paste that
into<00:01:33.990> there<00:01:34.320> ah<00:01:36.079> yep<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:38.329> we<00:01:39.329> need<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> load

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
into there ah yep and we need to load

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.340 
into there ah yep and we need to load
the<00:01:40.020> images<00:01:41.090> noting<00:01:42.090> images<00:01:42.540> only<00:01:42.750> has<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> be

the images noting images only has to be

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.130 
the images noting images only has to be
done<00:01:44.340> once<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.090> function<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.720> loading<00:01:46.049> an

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
done once a function for loading an

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.149 
done once a function for loading an
image<00:01:46.700> only<00:01:47.700> needs<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.329> run<00:01:48.600> once<00:01:49.130> for<00:01:50.130> each

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
image only needs to be run once for each

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.039 
image only needs to be run once for each
image<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:53.180> yeah<00:01:54.210> we'll<00:01:54.479> go

directory<00:02:34.900> for<00:02:35.350> security<00:02:35.920> reasons<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.430> you

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
directory for security reasons so you

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.240 
directory for security reasons so you
can't<00:02:36.760> access<00:02:37.150> system<00:02:37.569> 32<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:38.230> example<00:02:38.620> just

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
can't access system 32 for example just

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.210 
can't access system 32 for example just
saying<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.780> um<00:02:41.220> yeah<00:02:43.230> path<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.620> our<00:02:44.650> first

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
saying so um yeah path to our first

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.750 
saying so um yeah path to our first
image<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.670> Celt<00:02:45.940> image<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:48.720> textures<00:02:49.720> slash

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
image the Celt image is textures slash

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.860 
image the Celt image is textures slash
cloud<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.890> then<00:02:57.190> we<00:02:57.310> just<00:02:57.519> add<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:58.000> rest<00:02:58.239> of

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
cloud and then we just add the rest of

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.960 
cloud and then we just add the rest of
them<00:02:59.080> oh<00:02:59.940> joy<00:03:00.940> up<00:03:01.120> here<00:03:02.400> there<00:03:03.400> we<00:03:03.489> go

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
them oh joy up here there we go

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.430 
them oh joy up here there we go
I<00:03:04.739> with<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.859> same<00:03:06.180> same<00:03:07.180> method<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.840> variable

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
I with the same same method a variable

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.099 
I with the same same method a variable
name<00:03:09.130> something<00:03:11.010> resembles<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.340> image<00:03:12.640> and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
name something resembles the image and

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.840 
name something resembles the image and
you<00:03:14.109> don't<00:03:14.320> have<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:14.859> it's<00:03:15.100> it's<00:03:15.489> it's

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
you don't have to but it's it's it's

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.270 
you don't have to but it's it's it's
good<00:03:16.239> coding<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.560> have<00:03:17.769> names<00:03:17.980> that

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
good coding to to have names that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.360 
good coding to to have names that
resembles<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.720> value<00:03:20.320> in<00:03:20.530> there<00:03:20.769> in<00:03:21.190> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
resembles the value in there in the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.780 
resembles the value in there in the
variable<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.030> yeah<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.290> path<00:03:23.440> as<00:03:24.340> easy<00:03:24.609> as

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
variable so yeah and the path as easy as

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.690 
variable so yeah and the path as easy as
that<00:03:24.970> when<00:03:25.900> we<00:03:26.019> want<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.380> draw<00:03:26.620> an<00:03:26.799> image<00:03:27.100> in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
that when we want to draw an image in

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.640 
that when we want to draw an image in
the<00:03:28.000> game<00:03:28.180> we<00:03:28.510> use<00:03:28.690> another<00:03:28.930> function<00:03:29.200> called

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
the game we use another function called

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.479 
the game we use another function called
log<00:03:30.420> graphics<00:03:31.420> draw<00:03:32.079> this<00:03:32.620> has<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.069> be<00:03:33.220> called

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
log graphics draw this has to be called

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.199 
log graphics draw this has to be called
every<00:03:34.209> frame<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.709> we're<00:03:35.980> putting<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.370> in<00:03:36.609> the

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
every frame so we're putting it in the

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.250 
every frame so we're putting it in the
draw<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.350> love<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.310> draw<00:03:39.640> function<00:03:40.019> this<00:03:41.019> one

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
draw I love the draw function this one

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.910 
draw I love the draw function this one
since<00:03:41.709> it's<00:03:41.950> run<00:03:42.370> every<00:03:42.730> frame<00:03:43.000> for<00:03:43.930> sure<00:03:44.350> so

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
since it's run every frame for sure so

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.670 
since it's run every frame for sure so
the<00:03:45.790> first<00:03:46.060> argument<00:03:46.269> in<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.079> function<00:03:47.500> is

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
the first argument in this function is

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.550 
the first argument in this function is
the<00:03:47.889> image<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.730> let's<00:03:48.940> copy<00:03:49.269> let's<00:03:50.200> go<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.470> the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
the image so let's copy let's go to the

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.970 
the image so let's copy let's go to the
cloud<00:03:51.630> we<00:03:52.630> want<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:53.019> image<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.380> be<00:03:53.739> drawn

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
cloud we want this image to be drawn

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.069 
cloud we want this image to be drawn
instead<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.670> white<00:03:54.850> rectangle<00:03:55.120> which<00:03:55.810> was

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
instead of the white rectangle which was

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.280 
instead of the white rectangle which was
our<00:03:56.290> cloud

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
our cloud

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.740 
our cloud
this<00:03:58.950> cloud<00:03:59.430> if<00:03:59.819> you<00:03:59.879> can<00:04:00.120> call<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.599> oh

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
this cloud if you can call it that oh

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.580 
this cloud if you can call it that oh
look<00:04:00.959> it's<00:04:01.349> already<00:04:01.530> drawing<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.469> but<00:04:04.469> we

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
look it's already drawing it so but we

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.559 
look it's already drawing it so but we
want<00:04:04.769> this<00:04:04.920> Cal<00:04:05.189> to<00:04:05.370> draw<00:04:05.549> over<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:05.909> rectangle

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
want this Cal to draw over the rectangle

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.380 
want this Cal to draw over the rectangle
so<00:04:06.810> let's<00:04:07.230> copy<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:08.370> position<00:04:08.909> of<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.180> cloud

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
so let's copy the position of the cloud

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.119 
so let's copy the position of the cloud
which<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:10.140> very<00:04:11.099> ating<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:13.769> fourth

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
which is very ating and the fourth

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.249 
which is very ating and the fourth
argument<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.269> function<00:04:15.629> is<00:04:15.840> the

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.840 

angle<00:04:19.259> which<00:04:20.100> we<00:04:20.250> don't<00:04:20.370> need

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
angle which we don't need

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.960 
angle which we don't need
and<00:04:21.539> then<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.139> scale<00:04:22.470> which<00:04:23.039> is<00:04:23.310> from<00:04:23.520> zero<00:04:23.789> to

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
and then the scale which is from zero to

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.210 
and then the scale which is from zero to
infinity<00:04:24.000> where<00:04:24.810> one<00:04:25.020> is<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.500> original<00:04:25.889> scale

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
infinity where one is the original scale

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.820 
infinity where one is the original scale
and<00:04:26.729> offset<00:04:29.840> we<00:04:30.840> don't<00:04:31.050> want<00:04:31.259> all<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.650> cloud

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
and offset we don't want all the cloud

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.890 
and offset we don't want all the cloud
now<00:04:32.039> so<00:04:32.639> let's<00:04:32.940> see<00:04:33.060> how<00:04:33.120> this<00:04:33.270> turned<00:04:33.539> out

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
now so let's see how this turned out

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.800 
now so let's see how this turned out
yeah<00:04:34.020> by<00:04:34.259> the<00:04:34.320> way<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:35.400> color<00:04:35.699> of<00:04:36.090> an<00:04:36.300> image<00:04:36.539> is

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
yeah by the way the color of an image is

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.529 
yeah by the way the color of an image is
set<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.229> default<00:04:37.440> when<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.520> color<00:04:38.789> set<00:04:39.120> before

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
set to default when the color set before

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.230 
set to default when the color set before
the<00:04:39.660> image<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:40.169> white<00:04:40.759> remember<00:04:41.759> that<00:04:41.940> I'm

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
the image is white remember that I'm

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.719 
the image is white remember that I'm
going<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.449> show<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.690> now<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:43.949> here<00:04:44.099> we<00:04:44.190> go<00:04:44.310> now

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
going to show you now so here we go now

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.670 
going to show you now so here we go now
we<00:04:44.789> have<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> cloud<00:04:45.270> instead<00:04:45.780> of<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:46.050> rectangle

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
we have a cloud instead of a rectangle

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.260 
we have a cloud instead of a rectangle
that's<00:04:47.099> jolly<00:04:47.639> good<00:04:48.919> if<00:04:49.919> we<00:04:50.370> turn<00:04:50.849> the<00:04:51.090> color

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that's jolly good if we turn the color

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.420 
that's jolly good if we turn the color
to<00:04:51.539> red<00:04:51.720> ever<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:55.229> cloud<00:04:55.440> turns<00:04:55.830> red<00:04:56.130> or

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
to red ever the cloud turns red or

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.870 
to red ever the cloud turns red or
reddish<00:04:58.849> some<00:04:59.849> fun

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.830 

now<00:05:04.780> let's<00:05:04.990> add<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.760> ground<00:05:06.760> or<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.180> horizon

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
now let's add the ground or the horizon

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.610 
now let's add the ground or the horizon
which<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.170> made

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
which I made

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.050 
which I made
I<00:05:09.090> want<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:10.300> horizon<00:05:10.480> to<00:05:11.470> lay<00:05:11.890> on<00:05:12.160> top<00:05:12.190> of<00:05:12.520> the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
I want this horizon to lay on top of the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.650 
I want this horizon to lay on top of the
browser<00:05:14.280> picture<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:18.030> if<00:05:19.030> we're<00:05:19.270> going<00:05:19.450> to<00:05:19.570> be

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
browser picture so if we're going to be

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.530 
browser picture so if we're going to be
able<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.870> do<00:05:20.080> that<00:05:20.230> we<00:05:20.470> need<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.650> code<00:05:21.160> some

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
able to do that we need to code some

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.360 
able to do that we need to code some
nifty<00:05:22.540> stuff<00:05:25.500> we<00:05:26.500> want<00:05:26.710> image<00:05:27.100> to<00:05:27.250> display

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
nifty stuff we want image to display

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.030 
nifty stuff we want image to display
after<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.690> grass<00:05:28.900> or<00:05:29.170> on<00:05:29.200> top<00:05:29.560> of<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.860> grass

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
after the grass or on top of the grass

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.960 
after the grass or on top of the grass
so<00:05:30.430> let's<00:05:30.730> put<00:05:30.970> it<00:05:31.060> under<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:32.440> grass<00:05:32.970> drawing

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
so let's put it under the grass drawing

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.140 
so let's put it under the grass drawing
function<00:05:35.010> we're<00:05:36.010> going<00:05:36.190> to<00:05:36.310> draw<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.760> image

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
function we're going to draw the image

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.650 
function we're going to draw the image
ground<00:05:37.540> image<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:40.750> exposition<00:05:42.270> since<00:05:43.270> the

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
window is 800 pixels wide we need to

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.860 
window is 800 pixels wide we need to
subtract<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:57.070> size<00:05:57.610> of<00:05:57.820> the<00:05:57.940> window<00:05:58.240> -<00:05:58.660> the

size of the image / - since I'm since
I've<00:06:02.830> put<00:06:03.160> the<00:06:03.310> image<00:06:03.520> in<00:06:03.700> the<00:06:03.880> middle<00:06:04.740> since<00:06:05.740> I

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
I've put the image in the middle since I

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.170 
I've put the image in the middle since I
put<00:06:06.040> the<00:06:06.100> ground<00:06:06.250> in<00:06:06.520> the<00:06:06.610> middle<00:06:06.880> of<00:06:07.030> the

put the ground in the middle of the

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.000 
put the ground in the middle of the

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
image so let's do let's do that let's do

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.890 
image so let's do let's do that let's do
just<00:06:12.550> that

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.420 

800,000<00:06:17.670> 24/2<00:06:19.200> the<00:06:20.200> white<00:06:20.380> position<00:06:20.920> should

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
800,000 24/2 the white position should

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.000 
800,000 24/2 the white position should
be<00:06:21.610> halfway<00:06:22.150> down<00:06:22.540> the<00:06:22.720> screen<00:06:22.960> -<00:06:23.620> the<00:06:23.800> height

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
be halfway down the screen - the height

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.740 
be halfway down the screen - the height
of<00:06:24.220> the<00:06:24.370> image<00:06:24.580> which<00:06:25.090> was<00:06:25.300> 64<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:28.120> the<00:06:28.480> color

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
of the image which was 64 and the color

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.370 
of the image which was 64 and the color
has<00:06:29.080> to<00:06:29.980> be<00:06:30.220> white<00:06:30.940> since<00:06:31.480> you<00:06:31.570> want<00:06:31.780> the<00:06:32.020> color

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
has to be white since you want the color

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.040 
has to be white since you want the color
of<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.830> image<00:06:33.010> to<00:06:33.550> show<00:06:33.580> not<00:06:34.270> our<00:06:34.480> custom

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
of the image to show not our custom

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.390 
of the image to show not our custom
colors

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
colors

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.570

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
and we'll make enemies in the next

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.700 
and we'll make enemies in the next
