tired air spring needs to be replaced
this<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.849> new<00:00:30.119> air<00:00:30.300> spring<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.750> probably

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
this is a new air spring it's probably

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.190 
this is a new air spring it's probably
relatively<00:00:31.859> new<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.310> been<00:00:32.490> a<00:00:32.520> spell<00:00:32.940> about

10,000 miles on it and what I want you

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.930 
10,000 miles on it and what I want you
to<00:00:36.239> look<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.289> surface<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.860> rubber<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to look at is the surface the rubber and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.990 
to look at is the surface the rubber and
here<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:40.219> it's<00:00:41.219> very<00:00:41.460> new

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
here it it's very new

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.529 
here it it's very new
it's<00:00:42.570> contiguous<00:00:43.170> surface<00:00:43.649> smooth<00:00:44.539> without

any kind of fissures or cracks or any

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.270 
any kind of fissures or cracks or any
kind<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.199> know<00:00:49.260> irregularities<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
kind of you know irregularities in the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.090 
kind of you know irregularities in the
surface<00:00:51.230> this<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> surface<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.920> want<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
surface this is the surface you want to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
surface this is the surface you want to
look<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:54.210> curls<00:00:54.600> under<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
look at right here that curls under and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
look at right here that curls under and
folds<00:00:55.410> against<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.800> bail<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
folds against this bail this is the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.880 
folds against this bail this is the
surface<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.840> usually<00:00:58.050> wears<00:00:58.260> out<00:00:58.500> first

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
surface that usually wears out first

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.029 
surface that usually wears out first
because<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.000> there's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> lot<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.859> this<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
because there there's a lot of this this

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.330 
because there there's a lot of this this
point<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.789> continually<00:01:03.510> bending<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.340 
point is is continually bending and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.070 
point is is continually bending and
flexing<00:01:05.340> so<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:06.000> surface<00:01:06.210> develops<00:01:06.780> cracks

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
flexing so this surface develops cracks

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
flexing so this surface develops cracks
and<00:01:07.380> that's<00:01:08.189> where<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> inspect<00:01:09.060> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and that's where you want to inspect so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690 
and that's where you want to inspect so
next<00:01:09.930> I'm<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> take<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.700> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
next I'm going to take you to the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
next I'm going to take you to the
example<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.360> old<00:01:12.540> air<00:01:12.780> spraying<00:01:13.080> these<00:01:13.259> be

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
example of an old air spraying these be

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
example of an old air spraying these be
replaced<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> original<00:01:17.369> OEM<00:01:17.880> air

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
replaced so this is the original OEM air

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.740 
replaced so this is the original OEM air
spring<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.840> took<00:01:19.470> off<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.650> vehicle<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.750> ignore

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
spring I took off the vehicle and ignore

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
spring I took off the vehicle and ignore
the<00:01:21.960> fact<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.380> dirty<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the fact that's dirty what I want you to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300 
the fact that's dirty what I want you to
look<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.180> these<00:01:24.329> cracks<00:01:24.689> they<00:01:25.100> go<00:01:26.100> all

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
look at the see these cracks they go all

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850 
look at the see these cracks they go all
the<00:01:26.340> way<00:01:26.579> around<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.360> rubber<00:01:27.659> lip<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the way around this rubber lip that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
the way around this rubber lip that
would<00:01:28.979> eventually<00:01:29.130> roll<00:01:29.579> under<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.240> tuck

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
would eventually roll under and tuck

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.960 
would eventually roll under and tuck
along<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.110> belt<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.399> where<00:01:32.610> when

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
along this belt and this is where when

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.850 
along this belt and this is where when
you<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.420> cracks<00:01:33.960> forming<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.619> time

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you see these cracks forming it's time

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.639 
you see these cracks forming it's time
to<00:01:35.009> replace<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.490> bag<00:01:36.170> past-time<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.560> in

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
to replace the bag past-time really in

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:38.569 
to replace the bag past-time really in
most<00:01:37.829> people's<00:01:38.130> opinion

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
most people's opinion

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.340 
most people's opinion
this<00:01:39.090> bag<00:01:39.329> was<00:01:39.720> removed<00:01:40.020> from<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> vehicle

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
this bag was removed from the vehicle

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
this bag was removed from the vehicle
approximately<00:01:41.159> eighty<00:01:41.509> eighty-five

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
approximately eighty eighty-five

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.719 
approximately eighty eighty-five
thousand<00:01:43.110> miles<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.369> how<00:01:44.490> long

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
thousand miles so that's about how long

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149 
thousand miles so that's about how long
he<00:01:44.880> lasts<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.540> vehicle<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.590> vehicle

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
he lasts and that vehicle or the vehicle

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.120 
he lasts and that vehicle or the vehicle
had<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.460> oh<00:01:47.729> maybe<00:01:48.689> about<00:01:48.840> nine<00:01:49.110> years<00:01:49.439> on

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
had about oh maybe about nine years on

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.060 
had about oh maybe about nine years on
it<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.350> pattern<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it so this is the kind of pattern you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.179 
it so this is the kind of pattern you
look<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.229> this<00:01:55.229> means<00:01:55.560> your<00:01:55.799> spring<00:01:56.070> is

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
look for and this means your spring is

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.600 
look for and this means your spring is
worn<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.790> time<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.119> replace<00:01:57.390> it
