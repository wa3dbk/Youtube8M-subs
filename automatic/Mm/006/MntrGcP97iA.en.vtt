00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.200
 Hello, good kids , we're here 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.580
 new video of advanced warfighter and 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.320
 establishing a game of bull because 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.360
 Well but first of all, I wanted nothing 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.980
 thank you for the support you had 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.900
 yesterday's video of the controls that was 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.029
 one pass and one of controls that I 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.489
 you sent jce but they took me every two or 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.989
 three seconds is a new design and it's going to 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.789
 be difficult to choose the theme for 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.159
 those three that I like the most because I had 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.649
 designs but beautiful even that I 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:30.589
 they like more than the controls that I have 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.970
 not so let's see during this 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.710
 week then I will say the three that I most 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.960
 like and we already do the voting so that 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.600
 you choose the design of those three 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.910
 What's more cool for you to avoid it 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.280
 then I have seen a lot of 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.320
 comments there are some that you 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.850
 you make a little mess with the theme of 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.060
 draw you do there uncle 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.770
 so I wanted to clarify it a little bit 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.010
 of those three designs that 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.720
 that you choose and you are going to choose the one of the 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.230
 double-a and I've been in the same place the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.640
 campero says 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.650
 those three designs then 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.210
 and I chose the one that you like the most 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.159
 to draw but to enter the draw 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.530
 what you have to do is give rt to the 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.140
 tweet that there is a description that already 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.970
 I said yesterday but good for those who have 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.640
 bundled up a little bit and that's how it 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.860
 caught this is that it was 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.580
 the same was varied at the same site gave 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580
 explaining 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.760
 to see if someone comes out here but 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.350
 then you answer you can not trust 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.960
 but hey then 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.790
 of all those who have participated then 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.030
 the winner will take the design of the breast 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.380
 what if, for example, the design is 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.380
 play 4 and win 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.700
 win someone who has the xbox 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.010
 one would change the design and it 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.010
 would buy then to the command of 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.010
 of your console to not have we are going to see that 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.700
 it's costing me a bit to get the 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.310
 streak but is that talking and everything 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.340
 like what 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.340
 cost yours to know where they get 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.200
 let's go here they are here 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.740
 Well, it does not seem like it 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.280
 where do they get 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.770
 if not here below 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.680
 we go 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:38.910
 if I can catch someone around here I could 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.830
 boy get out of here but we're going to 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.780
 the bombing on this map 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.900
 Acosta the domain of throwing it but good 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.340
 let's see if I'm up 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.420
 to see if I can enter through here behind 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.520
 we go 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.520
 and nobody can be 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.600
 come on uncle come fuck I almost do the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.940
 fourth and they are all lying there 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.710
 this is going to work, I think 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.880
 that it was not going to cost but how are they 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.880
 everyone there I hope 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.570
 but the uncles are all in there 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.570
 how are we going 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.120
 come on uncle come on and I make myself screech lad 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.620
 can not be 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.620
 he does not like to get in here 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.750
 my mother the shisha others are not 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.870
 coming out the other side 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.740
 figure of the side 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.930
 where is this 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.310
 is that I do not like to go out there to see 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.610
 let's go around this part 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.610
 best 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.110
 stop 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:01.290
 we're 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.290
 come on come on it's not so hair 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.780
 fired 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.120
 I do not know where they shot me but 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.680
 half a turn and let's see if we can 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.250
 catch a few here that seems 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.040
 that are already in the site 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.640
 I think I 'm late 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.640
 OK 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.080

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.370
 come on I do not know if they're going to come out here or 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.240
 what but I'm going to turn around in case 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.449
 perhaps 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.180
 and another seen 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.180

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.340
 I have several around here so 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.590
 we go 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.760
 it's not worth it, at least I've taken the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.760
 guard in those who are here 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.620
 to the top 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.280
 as the guards and inside come out 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.330
 here 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.330
 which is here 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.450

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.389

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.190

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.400

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.400

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.630

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.820
 agreement 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.180

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.009

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.760
 can almost kill me kid looks but if 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.760
 they keep coming out here 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.490
 it was to play ready the clock and ximo 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.490
 or be bad 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.440
 my mother 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.740
 my mother lynched and at the last minute that 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:21.960
 amazing incredible streak the map and this one 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.319
 he responds there below when he hooks them 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.840
 50 7 but what do you say games go like 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:30.509

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.520
 ranch to prettier but good that wanted 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:36.060
 Tell me a little bit about the subject this 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.400
 of the draw since they had seen then 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.319
 how many comments of which you are going 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.090
 well a little bit so I do not expect anything 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.090
 you liked it and until next time
