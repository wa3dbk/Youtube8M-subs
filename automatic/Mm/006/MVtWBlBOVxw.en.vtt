places your back malarkey so we needed

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.820 
places your back malarkey so we needed
that<00:01:57.590> list<00:01:57.800> for<00:01:57.920> relief<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:58.370> down<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.830> second

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.699 

bit<00:02:04.509> of<00:02:04.540> a<00:02:04.600> situation<00:02:04.750> here<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:07.780> just<00:02:08.560> gonna

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
bit of a situation here I'm just gonna

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.210 
bit of a situation here I'm just gonna
wait<00:02:08.890> for<00:02:09.069> that<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.910> yeah<00:02:10.270> I<00:02:10.300> think<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.920> here

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.400 

obviously<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.120> was<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.269> fail<00:02:25.569> but<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:29.230> can

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
obviously that was a fail but you can

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.000 
obviously that was a fail but you can
see<00:02:29.560> we're<00:02:29.769> getting<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.220> with<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.640> now<00:02:30.849> is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
see we're getting that with that now is

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.410 
see we're getting that with that now is
just<00:02:33.010> basically<00:02:33.370> build<00:02:33.700> all<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.269> go

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
just basically build all that you go

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.220 
just basically build all that you go
down<00:02:34.690> into<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.200> elevator<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.959> fling

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
down into this elevator and you fling

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.100 
down into this elevator and you fling
yourself<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.860> other<00:02:39.069> parts<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.730> map<00:02:40.299> which
