wheel in the previous video on Sebago
Lake<00:00:06.810> Ranch<00:00:07.309> he<00:00:08.309> would<00:00:08.460> have<00:00:08.550> seen<00:00:08.730> them<00:00:09.000> in

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
Lake Ranch he would have seen them in

Lake Ranch he would have seen them in
action<00:00:09.660> moving<00:00:10.139> through<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.440> snow<00:00:11.599> that<00:00:12.599> one

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
action moving through the snow that one

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.330 
action moving through the snow that one
nice<00:00:13.139> thing<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.799> time<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.009> year<00:00:14.190> if<00:00:14.280> you

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
nice thing is this time of year if you

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.129 
nice thing is this time of year if you
got<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.549> move<00:00:14.670> portable<00:00:15.030> fence<00:00:15.240> nothing<00:00:15.990> has

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
got to move portable fence nothing has

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.810 
got to move portable fence nothing has
to<00:00:16.260> go<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> ground<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.520> way<00:00:20.640> these

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
to go in the ground so the way these

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.290 
to go in the ground so the way these
work<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.990> wire<00:00:22.580> thread<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.939> tube

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
work is the wire thread to this tube

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.200 
work is the wire thread to this tube
that<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.750> split<00:00:26.000> along<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.300> side<00:00:29.210> probably

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
that is split along one side probably

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.229 
that is split along one side probably
see<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:31.009> then<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.189> little<00:00:32.399> plastic<00:00:33.030> thing

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
see that then that little plastic thing

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.620 
see that then that little plastic thing
holds<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:34.020> place<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.559> then<00:00:35.540> there's<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
holds it in place and then there's a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.760 
holds it in place and then there's a
slot<00:00:38.120> right<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.170> turn<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
slot right there and then you turn this

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.529 
slot right there and then you turn this
aluminum<00:00:41.700> tube<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:43.410> scare<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.030> inside

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
aluminum tube to scare it and inside

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.100 
aluminum tube to scare it and inside
there

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
there

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.529 
there
you<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.649> plate<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.610> falls<00:00:48.149> into<00:00:48.450> place

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
you got this plate that falls into place

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.240 
you got this plate that falls into place
by<00:00:48.960> gravity<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.340> see<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:52.710> electrifies

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
by gravity as you can see it electrifies

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.770 
by gravity as you can see it electrifies
in<00:00:53.699> contacts<00:00:54.829> all<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.129> these<00:00:56.309> legs<00:00:57.090> except<00:00:57.600> for

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
in contacts all of these legs except for

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.139 
in contacts all of these legs except for
the<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.050> touch<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> ground<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.730> animals

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the to touch to the ground as so animals

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.369 
the to touch to the ground as so animals
won't<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.660> tempted<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.109> rub<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:03.110> these<00:01:04.110> are

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
won't be tempted to rub on it these are

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.620 
won't be tempted to rub on it these are
probably<00:01:05.070> seven<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.090> eight<00:01:06.150> years<00:01:06.390> old<00:01:07.580> and

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
probably seven or eight years old and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.420 
probably seven or eight years old and
the<00:01:09.630> main<00:01:10.020> failure<00:01:10.530> point<00:01:10.799> I've<00:01:10.979> had<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> them

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the main failure point I've had on them

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.740 
the main failure point I've had on them
actually<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.820> only<00:01:12.030> thing<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.540> broke<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
actually the only thing that's broke is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.070 
actually the only thing that's broke is
this<00:01:13.140> orange<00:01:13.799> clips

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
this orange clips

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.749 
this orange clips
it's<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> polycarbonate<00:01:16.950> or<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.580> they<00:01:17.729> are

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it's a polycarbonate or what they are

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.969 
it's a polycarbonate or what they are
but<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.240> tend<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.110> brittle<00:01:19.470> probably

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
but they tend to get brittle probably

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.390 
but they tend to get brittle probably
broken<00:01:20.189> down<00:01:20.400> by<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> UV<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.780> break<00:01:22.400> but

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
broken down by the UV and can break but

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.600 
broken down by the UV and can break but
I<00:01:24.200> haven't<00:01:25.200> ordered<00:01:25.500> more<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.460> that

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I haven't ordered more from I think that

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.550 
I haven't ordered more from I think that
came<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.060> some<00:01:27.210> extras<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.020> used<00:01:28.229> them<00:01:28.409> up

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
came with some extras and I used them up

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.640 
came with some extras and I used them up
and<00:01:29.689> maybe<00:01:30.689> I'll<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:31.020> some<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.530> these

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and maybe I'll get some more but these

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.969 
and maybe I'll get some more but these
tie-wrap<00:01:32.340> seem<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.759> working<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.150> fine

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
tie-wrap seem to be working just fine

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.929 
tie-wrap seem to be working just fine
one<00:01:34.979> thing<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.189> keep<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.400> mind<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.729> tire

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
one thing to keep in mind with tire

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359 
one thing to keep in mind with tire
wraps<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.780> white<00:01:37.020> ones<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:38.009> UV

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
wraps is the white ones do not have UV

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.880 
wraps is the white ones do not have UV
inhibitors<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:39.900> break<00:01:40.439> down<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
inhibitors and they will break down in a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.880 
inhibitors and they will break down in a
couple<00:01:41.630> like<00:01:42.630> two<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.170> three<00:01:43.200> seasons<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
couple like two or three seasons and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.710 
couple like two or three seasons and
then<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.220> fall<00:01:44.399> apart<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> use<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
then just fall apart you want to use the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.319 
then just fall apart you want to use the
black<00:01:45.899> ones<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.439> say<00:01:47.070> UV<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.090> label<00:01:50.329> so

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
black ones that say UV on the label so

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.310 
black ones that say UV on the label so
they<00:01:51.810> take<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:52.979> see<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:54.600> Y<00:01:55.290> is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
they take as you can see that the Y is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.940 
they take as you can see that the Y is
about<00:01:55.590> 31<00:01:55.950> inches<00:01:56.369> off<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.549> ground<00:01:57.950> not

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
about 31 inches off the ground not

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.160 
about 31 inches off the ground not
taking<00:01:59.340> into<00:01:59.610> account<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.000> snow<00:02:00.860> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.700 

so<00:02:04.800> they<00:02:04.920> are<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> little<00:02:05.430> bulky<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.710> transport

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
so they are a little bulky the transport

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.880 
so they are a little bulky the transport
I<00:02:07.970> have<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.420> believe<00:02:09.660> six<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.860> two

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I have I believe six of them one two

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.390 
I have I believe six of them one two
three<00:02:11.520> four<00:02:11.850> five<00:02:12.090> six<00:02:12.830> yeah<00:02:13.860> maybe<00:02:14.160> there's<00:02:14.340> a

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
three four five six yeah maybe there's a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.860 
three four five six yeah maybe there's a
seventh<00:02:14.700> one<00:02:14.880> down<00:02:15.060> over<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.360> hill<00:02:17.870> but

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
seventh one down over the hill but

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.370 
seventh one down over the hill but
that's<00:02:19.440> about<00:02:19.650> all<00:02:19.709> there<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.220> it
