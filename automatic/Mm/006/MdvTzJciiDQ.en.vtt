00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.049
 hello how are you welcome 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.599
 cooking the other day coming back from the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.700
 party praying from the club at home 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.310
 friends asked me to prepare a 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.380
 tuna burrito like delphi shares 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.439
 for obvious reasons at 4 in the morning not 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 I had fresh tuna but I made them with 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.510
 canned tuna and it tasted great they are not 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.340
 goes the recipe to make the burrito 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 of tuna at home very fast 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.620
 skillet 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.620
 olive oil 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.670
 chopped onion 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.300
 canned tuna tuna can be in water or in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.930
 oil 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930
 this is in water 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.950
 As they did not have fresh tuna 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.240
 it occurred to me why not do it with a 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.040
 canned tuna and it tasted great 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.939
 that all that does not have to be his 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.939
 Manchego cheese house 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.960
 if the bronx 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.640
 a little cilantro 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.640
 Serrated chinito serrano 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.570

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.570
 with tuna 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.980
 that the taquitos were very good 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.780
 acts 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.390
 and we made them in 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.510
 5 minutes is working and all 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.500
 fascinated 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.010
 let's season the compound is magic 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.010
 in English 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.690
 soy sauce 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.560
 because of pepper 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.050
 and squeeze half a lemon 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.220
 and ready 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.390
 we stir here on the cheese with the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.230
 tuna ok I have some flour tortillas 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.230
 already hot 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.990
 and we mounted some taquitos are about 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.990
 burritos as they want to call 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800
 Benefits 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.230
 great 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.160
 they do not roll 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.209
 and here I have a little dish 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.530
 to ride our burritos with 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.020
 marinade 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.310
 and we mount our cries here in the 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.930
 dish that we had left I think that 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.549
