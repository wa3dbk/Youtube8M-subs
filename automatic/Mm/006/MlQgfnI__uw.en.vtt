usually don't get over 9 foot around my
area<00:00:56.519> I'll<00:00:57.519> take<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:57.760> look<00:00:58.030> here<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.469> is<00:00:59.710> a

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
area I'll take a look here this is a

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.200 
area I'll take a look here this is a
desert<00:01:00.190> plant<00:01:00.609> so<00:01:00.850> what<00:01:00.999> you're<00:01:01.120> gonna

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
desert plant so what you're gonna

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.860 
desert plant so what you're gonna
actually<00:01:01.390> find<00:01:01.839> are<00:01:02.579> thorns<00:01:03.579> so<00:01:04.300> right<00:01:04.540> here

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
actually find are thorns so right here

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.570 
actually find are thorns so right here
this<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.710> big<00:01:05.890> enough<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.100> actually<00:01:06.490> go

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
this is big enough to actually go

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.970 
this is big enough to actually go
through<00:01:06.730> my<00:01:06.850> finger<00:01:07.210> picking<00:01:07.990> them<00:01:08.260> I<00:01:08.470> didn't

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
through my finger picking them I didn't

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.890 
through my finger picking them I didn't
find<00:01:09.160> too<00:01:09.340> much<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.610> a<00:01:09.670> problem<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.330> this<00:01:10.750> is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
find too much of a problem so this is
