00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
me of the corpse bride a little bit like

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.309 
me of the corpse bride a little bit like
I<00:02:38.430> think<00:02:38.820> Tim<00:02:39.060> Burton<00:02:39.450> was<00:02:39.570> just<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.020> no<00:02:40.200> no

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
I think Tim Burton was just like no no

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.140 
I think Tim Burton was just like no no
guys<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.770> make<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> raver<00:02:41.190> figure<00:02:41.520> let<00:02:41.790> me<00:02:41.880> step

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
guys we make a raver figure let me step

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.690 
guys we make a raver figure let me step
in<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.569> one<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.430> don't<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.520> if<00:02:44.610> they

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
in on this one I don't know if they

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.310 
in on this one I don't know if they
brought<00:02:44.880> Sam<00:02:45.090> Burton<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.720> one<00:02:45.989> or<00:02:46.170> not

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
brought Sam Burton in on this one or not

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.490 
brought Sam Burton in on this one or not
but<00:02:46.590> uh<00:02:46.790> yeah<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.209> get<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:49.350> just

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
but uh yeah so you get that you just

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.380 
but uh yeah so you get that you just
kind<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.709> attach<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.130> there<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:51.239> actually

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
kind of attach it there and it actually

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.509 
kind of attach it there and it actually
kind<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.720> does<00:02:51.959> toned<00:02:52.350> down<00:02:52.530> her<00:02:52.590> whole<00:02:53.070> face

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
kind of does toned down her whole face

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.250 
kind of does toned down her whole face
so<00:02:53.880> like<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.269> guess<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.630> its<00:02:54.870> kind<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.110> makes

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
so like I guess I its kind of makes

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.800 
so like I guess I its kind of makes
sense<00:02:55.440> they're<00:02:55.860> big<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.150> kind<00:02:57.690> of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
sense they're big and kind of

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.090 
sense they're big and kind of
mesmerizing<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.800> with<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.100> mask<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.519> then

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
mesmerizing so with the mask on then

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.190 
mesmerizing so with the mask on then
guess<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.280> makes<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.670> little<00:03:02.730> more<00:03:02.880> sense

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
guess that makes a little more sense

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.509 
guess that makes a little more sense
another<00:03:04.200> thing<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> point<00:03:04.860> system<00:03:05.160> the

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
another thing like a point system the

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.060 
another thing like a point system the
great<00:03:05.820> craftsmanship<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.860> might<00:03:07.860> not<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.010> able

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
great craftsmanship I might not be able

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.530 
great craftsmanship I might not be able
to<00:03:08.190> see<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.430> but<00:03:08.519> behind<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.030> cloak<00:03:09.239> here<00:03:09.420> is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
to see it but behind the cloak here is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.900 
to see it but behind the cloak here is
actually<00:03:09.959> her<00:03:10.140> foreign<00:03:10.650> jewel<00:03:10.830> oh<00:03:11.070> yeah<00:03:11.640> it's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
actually her foreign jewel oh yeah it's

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.190 
actually her foreign jewel oh yeah it's
actually<00:03:12.180> got<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.480> on<00:03:12.630> there<00:03:12.810> which<00:03:13.019> is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
actually got that on there which is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.930 
actually got that on there which is
pretty<00:03:13.890> surprising<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.580> they<00:03:14.700> went<00:03:14.850> ahead

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
pretty surprising that they went ahead

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.750 
pretty surprising that they went ahead
and<00:03:15.200> put<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:16.470> there<00:03:16.620> because<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.220> know<00:03:17.610> if

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
and put that on there because I know if

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.810 
and put that on there because I know if
you<00:03:17.850> can<00:03:18.000> get<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.299> on<00:03:18.390> camera<00:03:19.190> what<00:03:20.190> uh<00:03:20.220> yes

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
you can get it on camera what uh yes

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.539 
you can get it on camera what uh yes
they're<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.329> under<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:22.470> part<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.310> droops

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
they're like under this part that droops

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.819 
they're like under this part that droops
over<00:03:23.959> actually<00:03:24.959> went<00:03:25.230> ahead<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.440> put<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.620> on

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
over actually went ahead and put that on

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.199 
over actually went ahead and put that on
there<00:03:25.980> which<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.160> surprising<00:03:26.880> because<00:03:26.910> you

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
there which is surprising because you

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.370 
there which is surprising because you
think<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.570> know<00:03:27.690> nobody's<00:03:28.049> going<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.260> look

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
think you know nobody's going to look

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.720 
think you know nobody's going to look
there<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.709> see<00:03:28.890> if<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.130> actually<00:03:29.280> there

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
there and see if it's actually there

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.259 
there and see if it's actually there
because<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.030> can't<00:03:30.209> even<00:03:30.299> really<00:03:30.540> see<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.930> but

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
because you can't even really see it but

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.880 
because you can't even really see it but
yeah<00:03:33.269> just<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.600> attention<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.170> detail<00:03:34.230> along

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
yeah just the attention to detail along
