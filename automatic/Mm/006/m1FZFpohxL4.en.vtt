00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 the the rider 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.229
 it would be weird if i got on the train 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.849
 and no pain declaration think they do as must be no doubt about it 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.119
 possibly it is true that when i come from 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.730
 rapid recovery after surgery it is important 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.109
 therefore the pain must be controlled as effectively as possible 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.449
 it's cozy 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.519
 the piece can continue 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.750
 also and that movement is these patients 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.460
 my good pain relief has got you also mobile faster 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.890
 red had a better one 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 ANP who state that the store chain 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.040
 it is also vital for post-operative recovery 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.250
 maybe exaggerated but it is very important 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790
 it promotes postoperative recovery 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.940
 this said matt cutts a plus 7 at the risers 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.720
 welcome to a the atrium tennessee team 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.440
 good pain treatment improves the bond healing 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.060
 speeds up rehabilitation 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.060
 reduces the chance of infection of the lungs 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.970
 why 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.410
 the patient is the only one who can indicate how much pain he or she has and where 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.110
 they both put 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.950
 anp 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.290
 The pain is usually indicated on the so-called pain suffer 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 on a scale of 10 top 10 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.780
 but giving more information to the patient is important 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.760
 Fighting pain too late is more difficult 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.710
 and they must eat and I think 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.600
 although your head yes that is their heels 9 what a riot in nisse sponsors 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.110
 approaching the cluster giving information as patients is of course also 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.070
 important 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.930
 exaggeration does not help anything but the train bus is not careful either 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.620
 well sure to do though than it is 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.450
 but neither 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.300
 also no longer the same time 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.770
 apart from the patient's information, the men and the woman leave it 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.070
 square of course also someone must be there 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.299
 According to efficient it is nevertheless playing along with it 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.399
 bit of a guy who doesn't feel that i am naturally on 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.779
 gathering the capital

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.899
 if that is given at good times 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.899
 already before the patient gets terrible pain 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.649
 then that also helps quite well 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.469
 the back 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.609

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.879
 selecting for this works

 the patients are connected to a pain pump via an infusion 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:30.219
 he or she can administer a dose of morphine every six minutes with pain 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.879
 so turn for the suspect 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.119
 pepper trends then become 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.659
