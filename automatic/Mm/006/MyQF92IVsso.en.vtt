thing I did notice is that some of the
cards<00:01:36.909> if<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.119> are<00:01:37.270> really<00:01:37.689> really

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
cards if you are really really

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.050

specifically<00:01:38.740> at<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:38.979> collector<00:01:39.429> there's<00:01:39.969> a

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
specifically at the collector there's a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.999 
specifically at the collector there's a
slight<00:01:40.539> Bend<00:01:40.840> on<00:01:40.990> some<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:41.320> them<00:01:41.409> I'm<00:01:41.530> assuming

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
slight Bend on some of them I'm assuming

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.230 
slight Bend on some of them I'm assuming
it<00:01:42.100> depends<00:01:42.429> on<00:01:42.520> who<00:01:42.609> put<00:01:42.820> them<00:01:42.939> into<00:01:43.060> their

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240
