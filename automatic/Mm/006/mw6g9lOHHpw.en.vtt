00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
just you don't get the atomic feature

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.549 
just you don't get the atomic feature
plus<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.390> other<00:01:03.539> version<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
plus on the other version you have a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.070 
plus on the other version you have a
carbon<00:01:05.010> fiber<00:01:05.309> strap<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.540> version<00:01:06.960> you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
carbon fiber strap on this version you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
carbon fiber strap on this version you
have<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> regular<00:01:07.710> casio<00:01:08.159> g-shock<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.850> resin

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
have a regular casio g-shock a resin

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
have a regular casio g-shock a resin
strap<00:01:09.540> which<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.320> fine<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:10.979> opinion<00:01:11.630> this

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
strap which is fine in my opinion this

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.080 
strap which is fine in my opinion this
watch<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> twin<00:01:13.680> sensor<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.820> this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
watch does have a twin sensor so this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.870 
watch does have a twin sensor so this
watch<00:01:15.330> does<00:01:16.020> tell<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.720> temperature<00:01:19.320> and

watch does tell you the temperature and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.810 
watch does tell you the temperature and
the<00:01:21.350> direction<00:01:22.350> you're<00:01:22.500> heading<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.580> has<00:01:23.790> a

the direction you're heading in it has a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.749 
the direction you're heading in it has a
full<00:01:24.240> compass<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.640> the

really nice cassia has been doing a
really<00:01:35.189> good<00:01:35.400> job<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.780> negative<00:01:37.140> display

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
really good job on the negative display

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.499 
really good job on the negative display
even<00:01:38.520> though<00:01:39.650> this<00:01:40.650> watch<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.340> don't<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.060> too

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
even though this watch I don't have too

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.330 
even though this watch I don't have too
much<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.840> hard<00:01:43.079> time<00:01:43.320> telling<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.829> time<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
much of a hard time telling the time and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.880 
much of a hard time telling the time and
no<00:01:44.610> type<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.049> different<00:01:46.710> lighting

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
no type of you know different lighting

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.580 
no type of you know different lighting
conditions<00:01:47.210> although<00:01:48.210> sometimes<00:01:48.750> when<00:01:49.470> I'm

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
conditions although sometimes when I'm

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.219 
conditions although sometimes when I'm
in<00:01:49.619> my<00:01:49.920> house<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.729> dark<00:01:51.030> spot<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.689> may<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
in my house at the dark spot it may be a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.899 
in my house at the dark spot it may be a
little<00:01:52.409> challenging<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.130> see<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
little challenging to see that at the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.440 
little challenging to see that at the
time<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
time so if you don't like you know to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.480 
time so if you don't like you know to
have<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:58.170> struggle<00:01:58.380> looking<00:01:59.310> at<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
have a little struggle looking at the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.100 
have a little struggle looking at the
time<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.939> negative<00:02:00.090> display<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.719> do

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
time with a negative display I do

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.469 
time with a negative display I do
suggest<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.890> get<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> positive<00:02:02.610> display<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
suggest you to get a positive display of
