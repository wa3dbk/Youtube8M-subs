star<00:00:43.500> bits<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.010> ever<00:00:44.100> need<00:00:44.370> them<00:00:45.680> there's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
star bits if you ever need them there's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.069 
star bits if you ever need them there's
just<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.070> ridiculous<00:00:47.399> number<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.629> star<00:00:48.840> bins

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
just a ridiculous number of star bins

00:00:49.079 --> 00:01:14.610 
just a ridiculous number of star bins
here

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.000 

in<00:01:15.130> this<00:01:15.370> galaxy<00:01:15.670> just<00:01:16.240> launched<00:01:16.630> from<00:01:17.010> sling

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
in this galaxy just launched from sling

in this galaxy just launched from sling
pod<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.400> sling<00:01:18.640> pod

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.820 

be<00:01:30.240> sure<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.570> aim<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.960> true<00:01:31.230> because<00:01:31.440> there's

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
be sure your aim is true because there's

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.020 
be sure your aim is true because there's
nothing<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.580> prevent<00:01:32.730> you<00:01:33.240> from<00:01:37.640> from<00:01:38.640> falling

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
nothing to prevent you from from falling

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:48.200 
nothing to prevent you from from falling
into<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.300> black<00:01:39.390> hole<00:01:46.370> 50<00:01:47.370> *<00:01:47.640> bits<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:48.030> ready

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
into the black hole 50 * bits are ready

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.610 
into the black hole 50 * bits are ready
and<00:01:48.360> we're<00:01:48.570> nowhere<00:01:48.720> near<00:01:48.900> done<00:01:49.320> with<00:01:49.500> this

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
and we're nowhere near done with this

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:58.980 
and we're nowhere near done with this
stage

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.260 

and<00:01:59.229> there's<00:01:59.740> just<00:01:59.890> a<00:02:00.070> ridiculous<00:02:00.250> number<00:02:01.030> of

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
and there's just a ridiculous number of

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:13.170 
and there's just a ridiculous number of
star<00:02:01.540> bits<00:02:01.780> in<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.049> full<00:02:02.829> star<00:02:03.100> path

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.179 

this<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.900> also<00:02:14.230> another<00:02:14.349> reason<00:02:14.500> why<00:02:14.890> lives

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
this is also another reason why lives

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:45.560 
this is also another reason why lives
are<00:02:15.430> kind<00:02:15.609> of<00:02:15.670> meaningless

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.150 

and<00:02:46.570> just<00:02:47.260> when<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.500> thought<00:02:47.650> we<00:02:47.830> had<00:02:48.040> them

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
and just when you thought we had them

00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:15.959 
and just when you thought we had them
all<00:02:52.170> there's<00:02:53.170> more

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:15.969 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.250 

if<00:03:16.969> you<00:03:17.090> go<00:03:17.239> for<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.450> one<00:03:17.689> up<00:03:17.870> you'll<00:03:18.049> have<00:03:18.230> a

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
if you go for that one up you'll have a

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.899 
if you go for that one up you'll have a
very<00:03:18.650> hard<00:03:18.920> shot<00:03:19.219> coming<00:03:19.549> back<00:03:19.879> so<00:03:20.299> I<00:03:20.329> would

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
very hard shot coming back so I would

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:30.330 
very hard shot coming back so I would
just<00:03:22.909> line<00:03:23.120> up<00:03:23.150> your<00:03:23.329> shot<00:03:27.879> look<00:03:28.879> at<00:03:29.000> this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
just line up your shot look at this

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.830 
just line up your shot look at this
that's<00:03:31.340> 161<00:03:32.180> star<00:03:32.480> bits<00:03:32.719> that<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.439> can<00:03:33.590> get

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
that's 161 star bits that you can get

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.629 
that's 161 star bits that you can get
every<00:03:35.840> time<00:03:36.049> you<00:03:36.169> come<00:03:36.349> here<00:03:36.590> it's<00:03:36.769> just

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
every time you come here it's just

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:44.740 
every time you come here it's just
ridiculous<00:03:38.599> and<00:03:42.760> when<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.879> die<00:03:44.090> you'll<00:03:44.419> start

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
ridiculous and when you die you'll start

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.659 
ridiculous and when you die you'll start
at<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.019> end<00:03:45.319> of<00:03:45.439> the<00:03:45.560> pole<00:03:45.769> star<00:03:45.919> path<00:03:46.250> if<00:03:46.549> you

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
at the end of the pole star path if you

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.909 
at the end of the pole star path if you
come<00:03:46.879> this<00:03:47.060> far<00:03:47.329> and<00:03:47.629> you<00:03:48.409> can<00:03:48.590> just<00:03:48.739> keep

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
come this far and you can just keep

00:03:48.919 --> 00:04:01.539 
come this far and you can just keep
collecting<00:03:49.189> started<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.980> if<00:04:01.069> you<00:04:01.189> ever<00:04:01.280> need

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
collecting started so if you ever need

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.089 
collecting started so if you ever need
star<00:04:01.819> bits<00:04:02.030> just<00:04:02.299> come<00:04:02.510> here<00:04:02.780> there's<00:04:03.650> no

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
star bits just come here there's no

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.289 
star bits just come here there's no
better<00:04:04.310> place<00:04:04.519> in<00:04:04.639> the<00:04:04.879> game

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.869 

so<00:04:09.299> next<00:04:10.049> time<00:04:10.349> on<00:04:10.680> let's<00:04:11.190> play<00:04:11.459> super<00:04:11.760> mario
