show you how drives look in this so in
the<00:03:59.970> first<00:04:00.209> row<00:04:00.569> be<00:04:00.810> here<00:04:01.049> we<00:04:01.530> just<00:04:01.680> there

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
the first row be here we just there

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.009 
the first row be here we just there
which<00:04:02.100> yank<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:02.609> out<00:04:02.870> we<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:03.989> a

but<00:04:41.330> they<00:04:41.570> should<00:04:41.810> be<00:04:41.930> very<00:04:42.290> fast<00:04:42.590> which<00:04:42.890> is

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
but they should be very fast which is

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.120 
but they should be very fast which is
very<00:04:43.280> nice<00:04:43.520> on<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.270> back<00:04:44.419> we<00:04:44.450> have<00:04:44.800> double<00:04:45.800> and

I<00:04:46.430> believe<00:04:46.850> it's<00:04:47.030> six<00:04:47.210> give<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:47.570> a<00:04:47.600> second<00:04:48.020> a

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
I believe it's six give it a second a

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.520 
I believe it's six give it a second a
SATA<00:04:48.410> ports<00:04:48.890> to<00:04:49.370> give<00:04:49.820> it<00:04:50.060> ethernet<00:04:51.020> ports<00:04:51.320> two

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
active cooling with the what I believe

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.500 
active cooling with the what I believe
is<00:04:57.650> an<00:04:57.919> 80<00:04:58.100> millimeter<00:04:58.700> or<00:04:58.910> maybe<00:04:59.150> need<00:04:59.390> to

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
is an 80 millimeter or maybe need to

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.000 
is an 80 millimeter or maybe need to
develop<00:04:59.750> my<00:04:59.960> fan<00:05:00.169> and<00:05:00.650> we<00:05:00.710> also<00:05:00.800> have<00:05:00.919> a

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
develop my fan and we also have a

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.590 
develop my fan and we also have a
Kensington<00:05:01.550> lock<00:05:01.580> also<00:05:02.150> have<00:05:02.240> some<00:05:02.419> more

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
Kensington lock also have some more

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.230 
Kensington lock also have some more
serial<00:05:03.440> numbers<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:03.919> stuff<00:05:04.040> in<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.250> back<00:05:04.460> so

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
serial numbers and stuff in the back so

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.540 
serial numbers and stuff in the back so
that's<00:05:05.570> pretty<00:05:05.870> much<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.740> we'll<00:05:07.250> be<00:05:07.340> doing

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
that's pretty much it and we'll be doing

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.420 
that's pretty much it and we'll be doing
a<00:05:07.610> full<00:05:07.820> review<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.419> and<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.500> way<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:09.680> taking<00:05:10.370> a
