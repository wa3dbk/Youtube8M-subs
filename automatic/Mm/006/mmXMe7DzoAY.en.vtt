00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
good about this mic compared to the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.229 
good about this mic compared to the
others<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.140> not<00:00:43.680> trying<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.910> anything

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
others is it's not trying to be anything

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.260 
others is it's not trying to be anything
that<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.860> knockoff<00:00:47.430> it's

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
that it's not it's not a knockoff it's

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.979 
that it's not it's not a knockoff it's
not<00:00:48.480> even<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.870> look-alike<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:50.660> what<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
not even a look-alike it is what it is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.010 
not even a look-alike it is what it is
and<00:00:52.260> while<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.570> while<00:00:54.780> there's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and while you know while there's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.029 
and while you know while there's
certainly<00:00:55.170> some<00:00:55.559> overlap<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.670> for

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
certainly some overlap in what it's for

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.560 
certainly some overlap in what it's for
compared<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> others<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.270> doesn't

try<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.199> knockoff<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.039> short<00:01:02.370> model

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
try to be a knockoff of a short model

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.969 
try to be a knockoff of a short model
now<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> mic<00:01:06.090> element<00:01:06.540> there

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
now you can see the mic element there

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.020 
now you can see the mic element there
doesn't<00:01:07.979> look<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.310> anything<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
doesn't look like anything that I

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.450 
doesn't look like anything that I
recognise<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.110> meant<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.070> patterned

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
recognise it's not meant to be patterned

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.730 
recognise it's not meant to be patterned
after<00:01:11.729> sure<00:01:12.170> it's<00:01:13.170> not<00:01:13.500> meant<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:16.590> know

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
after sure it's not meant to you know

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.890 
after sure it's not meant to you know
actually<00:01:17.729> doesn't<00:01:18.150> look<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.450> any<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.780> them

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
actually doesn't look like any of them

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
I've ever seen before in it I think it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.100 
I've ever seen before in it I think it

doing<00:02:08.220> quality<00:02:08.700> control<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.420> whatnot<00:02:10.050> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
doing quality control and whatnot that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.559 
doing quality control and whatnot that
the<00:02:10.410> Chinese<00:02:10.800> OEMs<00:02:11.370> perhaps<00:02:11.819> are<00:02:12.030> not<00:02:12.060> doing

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
the Chinese OEMs perhaps are not doing

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.760 
the Chinese OEMs perhaps are not doing
so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.290 
so
maybe<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.280> means<00:02:14.430> you're<00:02:14.730> less<00:02:14.880> likely<00:02:15.240> to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
maybe that means you're less likely to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.500 
maybe that means you're less likely to
get<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.510> DOA<00:02:16.010> things<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.520> many<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.330> it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
get a DOA things like that many right it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.120 
get a DOA things like that many right it
seems<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.170> finished<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> very<00:02:19.950> high

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
seems like it's finished to a very high

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.460 
seems like it's finished to a very high
standard<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:21.660> looks<00:02:21.960> good

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
standard it looks good

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.210 
standard it looks good
you<00:02:22.710> can<00:02:22.890> certainly<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:24.120> know<00:02:24.240> peel<00:02:24.540> that

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
you can certainly you know peel that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.220 
you can certainly you know peel that
serial<00:02:26.220> number<00:02:26.490> sticker<00:02:26.700> off<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.690> it's

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
serial number sticker off because it's

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.220 
serial number sticker off because it's
just<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.650> regular<00:02:28.980> paper<00:02:29.220> sticker<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.200> after<00:02:31.200> a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
just a regular paper sticker and after a

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.320 
just a regular paper sticker and after a
couple<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.770> years<00:02:31.980> or<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.640> will<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.970> gummy

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
couple of years or so it will get gummy

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.950 
couple of years or so it will get gummy
and<00:02:33.420> fall<00:02:33.660> off<00:02:33.840> anyway<00:02:34.230> now<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.660> it's

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
and fall off anyway now you know it's

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.700 
and fall off anyway now you know it's
it's<00:02:37.830> heavy<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:39.780> any<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> other<00:02:40.410> mics

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
it's heavy like any of the other mics

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.830 
it's heavy like any of the other mics
but<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.070> did<00:02:41.370> unscrew<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.000> bottom<00:02:42.150> part<00:02:42.570> too

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
but I did unscrew the bottom part too

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.940 
but I did unscrew the bottom part too
and<00:02:43.820> look<00:02:44.820> down<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> tube<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.650> spite

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
and look down in the tube and in spite

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.780 
and look down in the tube and in spite
of<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> heft<00:02:47.370> there's<00:02:47.700> there<00:02:48.630> isn't<00:02:49.050> a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
of the heft there's there isn't a

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.040 
of the heft there's there isn't a
there's<00:02:50.790> no<00:02:50.970> transformer<00:02:51.660> down<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.960> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
there's no transformer down in the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.350 
there's no transformer down in the
bottom<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:53.130> way<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.610> sure<00:02:53.790> mics<00:02:54.060> have

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
bottom the way that the sure mics have

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.320 
bottom the way that the sure mics have
so<00:02:54.690> it's<00:02:54.840> not<00:02:55.020> like<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.920> know<00:02:56.040> down<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.670> it's

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
so it's not like you know down here it's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.380 
so it's not like you know down here it's
not<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.630> it's<00:02:57.810> trying<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:59.060> be<00:03:00.060> something

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
not like it's trying to be something

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.530 
not like it's trying to be something
that<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.780> not<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.580> so<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.910> doesn't<00:03:03.240> have<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
that it's not and so it doesn't have the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.870 
that it's not and so it doesn't have the
sound<00:03:03.840> modifiers<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.250> that

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
sound modifiers of that of that

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.940 
sound modifiers of that of that
transformer<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.840> shores<00:03:07.110> but<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:07.650> it

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
transformer and the shores but it's it

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.720 
transformer and the shores but it's it
seems<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.430> pretty<00:03:08.670> good<00:03:08.820> microphone

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
seems like a pretty good microphone

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.300 
seems like a pretty good microphone
