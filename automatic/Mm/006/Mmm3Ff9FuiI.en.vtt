hi this is Scott for expert village I
wanted<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.879> make<00:00:03.090> sure<00:00:03.120> that<00:00:03.570> we<00:00:03.750> covered<00:00:04.589> the

wanted to make sure that we covered the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
grip there used to be a way that you

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.310 
grip there used to be a way that you
could<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.360> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> old<00:00:45.629> rackets<00:00:46.170> where

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
could do it with the old rackets where

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
could do it with the old rackets where
you<00:00:46.410> could<00:00:46.530> put<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:46.890> finger<00:00:47.510> basically<00:00:48.510> hit

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you could put your finger basically hit

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
you could put your finger basically hit
at<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> halfway<00:00:49.200> point<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.980> let<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
at the halfway point and let go of the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.090 
at the halfway point and let go of the
racket<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> could<00:00:51.660> tell<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.829> head

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
racket and you could tell if it was head

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.639 
racket and you could tell if it was head
heavy<00:00:53.370> or<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.120> balanced<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:54.960> towards

heavy or if it was balanced more towards
the<00:00:55.829> center<00:00:56.390> nowadays<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:58.219> right<00:00:59.219> on

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the center nowadays they have right on

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.790 
the center nowadays they have right on
written<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.449> rackets<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.230> lot<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> them

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
written on the rackets on a lot of them

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.240 
written on the rackets on a lot of them
they'll<00:01:02.520> show<00:01:03.080> right<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.650> grip<00:01:05.010> or

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
they'll show right on the on the grip or

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
they'll show right on the on the grip or
on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> shaft<00:01:05.909> whether<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.530> racket

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
on the shaft whether or not the racket

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.789 
on the shaft whether or not the racket
is<00:01:08.430> more<00:01:08.909> weighted<00:01:09.780> towards<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> head<00:01:10.500> or

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
is more weighted towards the head or

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.120 
is more weighted towards the head or
more<00:01:11.130> weighted<00:01:11.520> towards<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> handle<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
more weighted towards the handle I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.730 
more weighted towards the handle I
suggest<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.340> especially<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> beginner

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
suggest that especially with a beginner

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.140 
suggest that especially with a beginner
possibly<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.979> maybe<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.460> little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.880> more

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
possibly going maybe a little bit more

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.530 
possibly going maybe a little bit more
towards<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:20.280> weight<00:01:20.490> towards<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.060> handle

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
towards the weight towards the handle

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.120 
towards the weight towards the handle
not<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.960> much<00:01:22.200> head<00:01:23.040> heavy<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:24.570> could<00:01:24.720> go

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
not so much head heavy you could go

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.640 
not so much head heavy you could go
somewhere<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> middle<00:01:26.670> maybe<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.900> balanced

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
somewhere in the middle maybe a balanced

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.670 
somewhere in the middle maybe a balanced
racket<00:01:29.040> towards<00:01:30.049> something<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.350> weighted

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
racket towards something that's weighted

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.969 
racket towards something that's weighted
more<00:01:31.890> towards<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.670> handle<00:01:33.180> because<00:01:33.979> getting

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
more towards the handle because getting

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.969 
more towards the handle because getting
the<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.880> head<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> racket<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.650> front

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the the head of the racket out in front

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.330 
the the head of the racket out in front
of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> ball<00:01:38.310> isn't<00:01:38.780> important<00:01:39.829> with<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of the ball isn't important with a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.789 
of the ball isn't important with a
beginner<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.960> become<00:01:43.229> more<00:01:43.590> proficient

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
beginner as you become more proficient

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.480 
beginner as you become more proficient
at<00:01:44.340> playing<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.200> kind<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.500> get<00:01:47.220> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
at playing then you can kind of get to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.700 
at playing then you can kind of get to
the<00:01:47.700> point<00:01:47.880> where<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.840> might<00:01:49.079> want<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.500> choose

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the point where you might want to choose

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710 
the point where you might want to choose
something<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.369> has<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> little<00:01:50.939> more<00:01:51.119> pop<00:01:51.450> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
something that has a little more pop to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.499 
something that has a little more pop to
it<00:01:51.750> which<00:01:52.560> would<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.340> more<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.909> weight

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
it which would have more of a weight

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.870 
it which would have more of a weight
center<00:01:55.500> towards<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.009> head<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> racket

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
center towards the head of the racket

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.190 
center towards the head of the racket
which<00:01:57.030> will<00:01:57.180> give<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.630> follow-through

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
which will give you more follow-through

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.910 
which will give you more follow-through
more<00:01:58.500> more<00:01:59.030> more<00:02:00.030> power<00:02:00.390> behind<00:02:00.869> your<00:02:01.320> shot<00:02:01.790> so

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
more more more power behind your shot so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.069 
more more more power behind your shot so
like<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.009> said<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.939> go<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
like I said you can you can go to the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.749 
like I said you can you can go to the
store<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.350> you'll<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.680> able<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.009> pick<00:02:08.550> out

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
store and you'll be able to pick out

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.630 
store and you'll be able to pick out
which<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:10.170> according<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.679> what<00:02:11.489> they

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
which one just according to what they

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.080 
which one just according to what they
they<00:02:11.970> show<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.720> grip

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
they show on the grip

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.269 
they show on the grip
so
