00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
they'll print a range of different sizes

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.490 
they'll print a range of different sizes
I<00:00:35.560> get<00:00:36.490> that<00:00:36.640> in<00:00:36.730> a<00:00:36.790> second<00:00:37.720> this<00:00:37.810> is<00:00:38.020> obviously

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
I get that in a second this is obviously

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.650 
I get that in a second this is obviously
a<00:00:38.620> four<00:00:39.070> full-color<00:00:39.970> and<00:00:40.180> pleasantly

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
a four full-color and pleasantly

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.790 
a four full-color and pleasantly
surprised<00:00:41.080> by<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.350> quality<00:00:41.470> of<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:43.330> printing

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
surprised by the quality of the printing

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.530 
surprised by the quality of the printing
much<00:00:44.800> better<00:00:45.010> than<00:00:45.130> I<00:00:45.190> expected<00:00:45.270> even<00:00:46.270> the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
much better than I expected even the

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.260 
much better than I expected even the
paper<00:00:46.720> quality<00:00:47.260> is<00:00:47.380> pretty<00:00:47.770> good<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
paper quality is pretty good this

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.319 
paper quality is pretty good this
particular<00:00:49.690> one<00:00:50.050> was<00:00:50.200> quite<00:00:50.350> expensive<00:00:50.740> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
particular one was quite expensive the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.580 
particular one was quite expensive the
the<00:00:52.329> cost<00:00:52.540> of<00:00:52.690> this<00:00:52.810> is<00:00:52.930> like<00:00:53.020> twelve<00:00:53.320> pounds

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
the cost of this is like twelve pounds

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.220 
the cost of this is like twelve pounds
30<00:00:53.829> then<00:00:54.070> you<00:00:54.160> add<00:00:54.310> shipping<00:00:54.550> under<00:00:54.760> that<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
30 then you add shipping under that the

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.140 
30 then you add shipping under that the
print<00:00:56.470> on<00:00:56.680> demand<00:00:56.710> so<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:57.730> don't<00:00:57.880> have<00:00:57.970> to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
print on demand so you don't have to

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.790 
print on demand so you don't have to
choose<00:00:58.420> how<00:00:58.690> many<00:00:58.750> you<00:00:58.989> want<00:00:59.110> an<00:00:59.290> advance<00:00:59.620> or

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
choose how many you want an advance or

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.690 
choose how many you want an advance or
pay<00:01:00.010> for<00:01:00.190> anything<00:01:00.370> on<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.700> in<00:01:00.910> advance<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.770> it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
pay for anything on the in advance so it

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.270 
pay for anything on the in advance so it
took<00:01:04.030> about<00:01:04.149> a<00:01:04.269> week<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.809> get<00:01:04.930> this<00:01:05.130> kind<00:01:06.130> of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
took about a week to get this kind of

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.530 
took about a week to get this kind of
printed<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:06.759> sent<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.270> me<00:01:08.310> they<00:01:09.310> have<00:01:09.550> as<00:01:10.479> I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
printed and sent to me they have as I

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.540 
printed and sent to me they have as I
said<00:01:10.870> they've<00:01:11.260> got<00:01:11.440> about<00:01:11.560> fifteen<00:01:11.950> sizes<00:01:12.430> to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
said they've got about fifteen sizes to

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.860 
said they've got about fifteen sizes to
choose<00:01:12.580> from<00:01:12.790> three<00:01:13.270> different<00:01:13.300> types<00:01:13.720> of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
choose from three different types of

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.750 
choose from three different types of
paper<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:14.380> choose<00:01:14.620> from<00:01:14.890> I<00:01:15.100> think<00:01:15.370> this<00:01:15.640> is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
paper to choose from I think this is

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.270 
paper to choose from I think this is
kind<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.150> mid-range<00:01:16.570> paper<00:01:17.010> they've<00:01:18.010> got

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
kind of a mid-range paper they've got

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.219 
kind of a mid-range paper they've got
different<00:01:19.000> types<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.420> binding<00:01:19.930> this<00:01:20.080> is

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
different types of binding this is

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.310 
different types of binding this is
perfectly<00:01:20.740> ballast<00:01:21.190> is<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.400> most<00:01:21.549> expensive

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
perfectly ballast is the most expensive

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.140 
perfectly ballast is the most expensive
you<00:01:23.320> can<00:01:23.350> get<00:01:23.710> coil<00:01:24.340> burn<00:01:24.549> you<00:01:24.760> can<00:01:24.880> get<00:01:25.030> the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
you can get coil burn you can get the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.480 
you can get coil burn you can get the
cheapest<00:01:25.540> one<00:01:25.720> which<00:01:25.870> is<00:01:26.080> it's<00:01:26.770> really<00:01:27.400> just

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
cheapest one which is it's really just

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.340 
cheapest one which is it's really just
staple<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.210> saddle<00:01:28.570> stitch<00:01:28.780> option<00:01:29.170> so<00:01:29.260> you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
staple the saddle stitch option so you

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.110 
staple the saddle stitch option so you
might<00:01:29.470> want<00:01:29.620> to<00:01:29.650> take<00:01:29.830> a<00:01:29.860> look<00:01:30.070> at<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:30.430> if<00:01:30.700> you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
might want to take a look at that if you

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.700 
might want to take a look at that if you
want<00:01:31.299> a<00:01:31.510> lower-cost<00:01:32.640> option<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:35.049> as<00:01:35.500> I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
want a lower-cost option this is as I

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.070 
want a lower-cost option this is as I
said<00:01:35.950> full-color<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:37.299> I've<00:01:37.540> got<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.930> pretty

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
said full-color so I've got a pretty

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.070 
said full-color so I've got a pretty
expensive<00:01:39.299> combination<00:01:40.299> of<00:01:40.450> options<00:01:40.869> here

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
expensive combination of options here

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.050 
expensive combination of options here
but<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:41.470> could<00:01:41.740> reduce<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.580> kind<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:42.850> just

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
but I could reduce this to kind of just

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.300 
but I could reduce this to kind of just
a<00:01:43.119> few<00:01:43.330> pounds<00:01:43.690> if<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.869> wanted<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:45.010> say<00:01:45.220> if

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
a few pounds if I wanted to and say if

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.789 
a few pounds if I wanted to and say if
it<00:01:45.400> was<00:01:45.549> maybe<00:01:46.240> smaller<00:01:46.630> black<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.650> white

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
it was maybe smaller black and white

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.980 
it was maybe smaller black and white
with<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> different<00:01:48.880> binding<00:01:49.840> on<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.020> side<00:01:51.990> but
