00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:13.986
 Welcome to the next program about mobile devices. 

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:18.700
 Here's a gadget with a bit unusual sizes like for tablets - 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.886
 smaller than the most common 10-inch ones, 

00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:25.526
 and slightly larger than the 7-inch ones. 

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.006
 How does this equipment work? 

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.820
 Stay with us these few moments and you will find out! 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.886
 Here is the Pentagram Tab 8.5 Dual Core IPS P5344, 

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:39.240
 which of course belongs to the Pentagram family of tablets. 

00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:42.720
 The device at first glance looks typical, 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.340
 and does not differ from similar gadgets. 

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:47.720
 The dimensions of the equipment is quite unusual. 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.913
 Fits in a briefcase, backpack or women's purse, 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.300
 but about pushing it into your pocket - we have nothing to dream about. 

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:59.306
 For this reason, it should be placed just slightly between typical tablets. 

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:04.553
 The 4: 3 screen has a diagonal of 8 inches and a good resolution. 

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.486
 The matrix is ​​backlit with LED diodes 

00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:11.760
 and uses the most modern IPS technique, i.e. In-Plane Switching. 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.440
 I have mentioned this technology before. 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.713
 The name comes from specific behavior 

00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:20.360
 liquid crystals in the cells of the screen, 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.173
 always located in the same plane 

00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:25.266
 - parallel to the screen plane. 

00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:30.213
 As a result, the matrix offers a very wide viewing angle - up to 180 degrees, 

00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:34.366
 lower reaction time and incomparably better color saturation. 

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:37.800
 On the upper edge of the tablet, the Pentagram Tab 8.5 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.073
 a power button and headphone input are provided. 

00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:44.720
 On the lower one you can find: the RESET button, 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.426
 power socket being at the same time a microUSB input, 

00:01:48.853 --> 00:01:52.106
 HDMI socket, microSD card slot, 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.966
 microphone, and finally the HOME button. 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.966
 This last key allows you to return to the home screen from any application. 

00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:03.266
 However, the RESET button placed in the small hole 

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.600
 In front of the screen is the eye of video cameras 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.760
 used for internet conversations. 

00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:16.686
 In turn, the rear has a much better quality lens 

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:20.880
 allowing you to take pictures or make videos of higher quality. 

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:26.033
 There are still speakers on the back of the Pentagram Tab 8.5 tablet. 

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:28.846
 The equipment is equipped with a dual-core processor 

00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:31.900
 without major problems, performing several tasks at the same time. 

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:35.180
 In turn, the double graphics accelerator ensures 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.526
 smooth display of 3D graphics in games 

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:40.753
 and applications that require high computing power. 

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:46.613
 Android 4.1 is installed on the tablet 

00:02:46.613 --> 00:02:50.906
 and it is worth remembering to update this operating system at every opportunity. 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.866
 A 16 GB of built-in memory 

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:56.933
 allows you to install numerous applications on this platform.
