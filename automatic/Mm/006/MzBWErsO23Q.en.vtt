00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:10.600
 Hello, everyone is a dragon this time is finally a dream of my home was completed 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:14.610
 Let's introduce when we did it 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.610
 It feels good from the outside 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.960
 I'm Rem 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.960
 Hello 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.710
 Let's see 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:55.590
 What does it mean 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 The messy space has turned into a clean and impressive space 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.370
 Such a feeling from the second floor 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.170
 And the second floor changed to a relaxing space 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.880
 ni 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.780
 You can see the collaboration between the mountain and the river from here 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.780
 It is beautiful 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:45.050
 And here are two rooms 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:47.650
 One consideration is that we want you to take care of your space no matter how much your room is Rem. 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.650
 There is 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.270
 And here is my room 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.109
 You can see the wonderful view from here 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.109
 Sounds good 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.780
 My room is like this 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.780
 me 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.879
 Then let's introduce this much 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:33.380
 Yes it's getting tough 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:36.890
 Claw that was what requested the renovation went to visit again 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.250
 Did you have any complaints 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.310
 Because we are satisfied with this house please quit Seriously 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.760
 Yes I was reformed in front of the house 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.760
 Run away 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.069
 Why in such a place 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.330
 Thank you seriously are you fine 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.500
 In this way dismantling Shinoshi' 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.580
 ni 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.160
 me 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:06.000
 Oh bulldoze 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.600
 What a bummer or fool I immediately Watch defeated when cormorants ze was guessed to my room when miscellaneous notes One Modo again Son 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.010
 Call 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:14.489
 Was dangerous Iyo after the steaming 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.579
 I'm wondering repair tired and he who blame 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:22.829
 I'm sure it's not my fault I'm a bus 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:31.220
 Ok i 'm his ah yes i'm working on this too 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:31.220
 I thought it would flow but my PC was heavier than I thought Yuki Biome, so double speed 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.100
 2 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:47.270
 I can not hear it even if I come up with a good mood . 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.140
 Why more black spots Come on over Nanchatte woman bee not Jowaa 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.069
 It is strange 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.760
 Oh oh my name is good this 4 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:01.920
 You are receiving a Sea King, such is also Iro in silence aboard &amp; 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:07.709
 Yes let 's wait, let 's do Japanese style architecture 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.130
 The fact that you try to do it well you'll not come by Sumida's immediately 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.600
 Build Japanese style 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:19.209
 Let's find yourself basically a picture of the model 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:27.980
 It's about looking at the terrain and making it in practice 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:31.360
 Also, 30% have original elements, because the photo has limits on angles etc. 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.360
 I wonder if this is good 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:52.430
 I'm going to here 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:52.430
 Basically, I think that Mr. Rem, who is an architect . 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.910
 Let's measure the size first 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.110
 It is important here 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.140
 ana 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.140
 2 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.990
 me 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.689
 me 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:15.370
 me 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:18.139
 It is quite a no plan despite the beginning this time 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.699
 How shall we go 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.699
 Well okay 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.880
 me 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.050
 It was more difficult than I thought of editing 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.030
 I'm pretty tired 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.030
 Good luck and 5 more 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:50.939
 It is Hikryu to the end but explains how to make it 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.939
 Let's decide the position of the pillar first 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.249
 me 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.590
 The position of the pillar is easy to understand the cobbles 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.590
 No sleep Personally 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:22.450
 Let's make a foundation when it is over 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:29.220
 The building I have ever built is a triple tower 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:29.220
 It was so I think it was okay that can and so on Deva 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.030
 Let's make the base part with the key 4 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.650
 ua 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.390
 If you make a mistake , it looks like it's wasteful 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.170
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.170
 me 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.620
 Hmm 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.390
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.340
 me 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.340
 Then you place the soil 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:06.190
 re 4 's 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:09.220
 Early to decrease 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:16.330
 It will be a wall on the ground 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:23.070
 If it says Japanese style, it's wooden. At first this video was intended to live a villager 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:23.070
 Since the building was thought that fun But suddenly changed just below 

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:37.330
 Well I do not think that I am good at architecture There is humble there 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:37.330
 I am half-hearted, but everyone is bye-bye
