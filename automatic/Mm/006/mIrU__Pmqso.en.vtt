00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 it's gone between dolgopolov and troicki 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:15.929
 here he is dolgopolov who is serving 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:19.529
 the 1st of balls to lead 1 0 and this 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.680
 cruel match won against mika 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.680
 Llodra 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.480
 very very good shower 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.559
 I think if he wants to beat hull who 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.090
 today I do not want them to stay 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:41.629
 in his pathway because it's a 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:46.870
 benefit but if big servers and 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:49.399
 bias kamke still a German 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.160
 this will break the party from the beginning 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.540
 of interesting match to see to see the 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.020
 stat at the end of the match to see how much 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.020
 of amortized 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.270
 son and alexander behind here and there he 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.580
 take the risk of losing the point ah 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.580
 no it's really 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.430
 tennis-inspired tennis 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.430
 artistic look at the cushioning there 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.260
 and still a no but by moment he 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.560
 does anything anyway 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.500
 some teddy salia nï tennis lo 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.930
 it's his tennis so we'll say his 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.060
 tennis because the look at the cushioning 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.060
 six and stuffed board a ball was going 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.930
 polish him boot dancing polka 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.250
 not have won the previous round on the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.920
 land we had never seen that in Roland 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.270
 garros facing the Colombian falla a man 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.270
 dangerous coming out of qualifying 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.890
 Oh 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.050
 when they did not have it because 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.550
 that she has a 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.530
 he has had seven or eight since 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.900
 start of the game when he plays 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.900
 the ball and they are not surprised 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.590
 go one more 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.150
 I have a lot 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.500
 another one 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.970
 3 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.939
 it is to give it back but then it would have 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.799
 really crazy if he had 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:43.829
 turned on more because he can do it 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.829
 before we go we'll finish this point 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.940
 stop the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.590
 the lamartine car 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.280
 stopped counting them for a while 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.110
 that we will discover him rap to see in 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.060
 what state of mind and in what 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.090
 provisions and rafael nadal still a 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.970
 but it's four shots away 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.970
 obviously it is not necessary that benoît beads 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:05:00.730
 mata will say but eventually it does not 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.160
 laugh at all troicki today no 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.170
 but it's troicki yesterday but cards 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.800
 in hand 20th and sends there again it is 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.800
 went to lose a set 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.320
 but learning the cushioning might well 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.070
 and here she is 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.930
 it's the dead 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.460
 give troicki points in forehand 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.479
 all saved way more big love go 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.479
 each other 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.249
 for example 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.150
 he can sign he lived a funny 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:21.479
 experience today on the court 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.629
 number 1 frankly to get by in 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:28.289
 four sets without panic on board 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:30.629
 but here is a focus 1 it was sealed 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:34.190
 famous ah the famous fast in the famous 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.190
 sign popularized by wilander masts 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.569
 when he became world number one 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:44.150
 in imitation 88 and who can greet the 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:44.150
 crowd confirms it's take to be kia
