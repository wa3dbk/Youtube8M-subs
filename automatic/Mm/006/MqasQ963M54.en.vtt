00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 personal hello i am joseph Tenorio pride 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 of the jr mechanical area south of sao paulo 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.139
 I want to pass on to you a tip 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.990
 goal return technique that uses 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.000
 wheel that the rotation sensor 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.250
 this one is the parallel mark holder 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.020
 which we are obliged to count because 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.750
 did not have the original available 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.220
 market that was stuck because it did not 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.789
 worked in the car 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.600
 the reason after so much work 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.989
 we find that the sensor it does 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.030
 far from the phonic wheel it 's to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.550
 within about 2 millimeters 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.950
 so if you compare when you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 put the advisor on the wheel on the fringe 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.570
 original 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 You notice that it looks good and yields 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.949
 do not stay then do not use the retainer 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.620
 parallel or headache 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.399
 this one it comes with this device 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.439
 that it positions the phonic wheel, which 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.130
 suggests to the mechanic that he does not need 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.290
 specific tool and makes mistakes 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.750
 it only positions it at the time of you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.820
 to fit the phonic wheel there 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.500
 the depth it will enter 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.900
 Will it be in your hand that you will succeed? 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 put her perfect without staying more for 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.890
 one side that everyone 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.810
 I think it's not too hard so 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.869
 you must use the correct tool 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.299
 not to have a headache because besides 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.450
 correctly position the phonic wheel 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.900
 you will have the exact depth and 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.799
 alignment got there arrived in the end one 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.869
 end 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.170
 the perfect job no headache 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.170
 cool, and until the next time 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.170
 ae
