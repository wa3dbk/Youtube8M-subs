00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
is the Shep's

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.260 
is the Shep's
I<00:00:20.210> think<00:00:21.020> it's<00:00:21.140> called<00:00:21.410> mono<00:00:22.369> six<00:00:22.790> but<00:00:23.060> I'm<00:00:23.119> not

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
I think it's called mono six but I'm not

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.670 
I think it's called mono six but I'm not
sure<00:00:23.540> this<00:00:24.350> is<00:00:24.500> an<00:00:24.680> AKG<00:00:25.540> C<00:00:26.540> 409<00:00:27.110> microphone

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
sure this is an AKG C 409 microphone

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.800 
sure this is an AKG C 409 microphone
that<00:00:27.830> I<00:00:27.890> used<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.820> benefit<00:00:29.240> of<00:00:29.270> a<00:00:29.420> mic<00:00:29.600> like

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
that I used the benefit of a mic like

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.720 
that I used the benefit of a mic like
this<00:00:30.020> clip-on<00:00:30.650> is<00:00:31.009> that<00:00:31.310> wherever<00:00:31.490> you<00:00:31.640> go

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
this clip-on is that wherever you go

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.730 
this clip-on is that wherever you go
with<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.119> cello<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:32.720> mic<00:00:33.200> will<00:00:33.380> stay<00:00:33.560> with

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
with the cello the mic will stay with

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.380 
with the cello the mic will stay with
you<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.100> if<00:00:34.190> you<00:00:34.280> move<00:00:34.430> around<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.820> lot<00:00:34.970> this<00:00:35.329> is

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
you so if you move around a lot this is

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.390 
you so if you move around a lot this is
good<00:00:35.720> choice<00:00:35.930> for<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.290> also<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:37.160> much

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
good choice for you also it's much

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.050 
good choice for you also it's much
cheaper<00:00:37.460> than<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.360> ship's<00:00:39.820> this<00:00:40.820> is<00:00:40.970> the

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
cheaper than a ship's this is the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.300 
cheaper than a ship's this is the
cheapest<00:00:41.390> mic<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:41.810> ever<00:00:41.960> use<00:00:42.230> this<00:00:42.530> is<00:00:42.710> an<00:00:42.860> Audio

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
cheapest mic I ever use this is an Audio

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.240 
cheapest mic I ever use this is an Audio
Technica<00:00:43.930> it's<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.050> small<00:00:45.290> mic<00:00:45.500> this<00:00:45.920> little

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
Technica it's a small mic this little

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.580 
Technica it's a small mic this little
thing<00:00:46.430> here<00:00:46.460> I<00:00:46.910> basically<00:00:47.810> wrap<00:00:47.990> this<00:00:48.170> in<00:00:48.230> foam

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
thing here I basically wrap this in foam

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.650 
thing here I basically wrap this in foam
and<00:00:48.920> stick<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:49.280> under<00:00:49.490> the<00:00:49.870> tailpiece<00:00:52.660> so

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
and stick it under the tailpiece so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.780 
and stick it under the tailpiece so
setup<00:00:54.020> with<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.230> mic<00:00:54.410> at<00:00:54.650> an<00:00:54.890> angle<00:00:55.280> facing

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
setup with the mic at an angle facing

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.490 
setup with the mic at an angle facing
away<00:00:56.240> from<00:00:56.480> where<00:00:56.630> most<00:00:56.840> of<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.050> sound<00:00:57.320> is

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
away from where most of the sound is

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.280 
away from where most of the sound is
coming<00:00:57.650> from<00:00:57.920> in<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.130> band<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.990> try<00:00:59.990> to<00:01:00.050> shoot

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
coming from in the band and try to shoot

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.810 
coming from in the band and try to shoot
the<00:01:00.470> bridge<00:01:00.740> now<00:01:00.950> I<00:01:00.980> found<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.520> lot<00:01:01.670> of

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
the bridge now I found that a lot of

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.490 
the bridge now I found that a lot of
sound<00:01:02.090> men<00:01:02.300> like<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.720> try<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:02.990> shoot<00:01:03.350> the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
sound men like to try to shoot the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.030 
sound men like to try to shoot the
f-holes

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
f-holes

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.560 
f-holes
point<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.640> mic<00:01:04.759> at<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.030> F<00:01:05.119> holes<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.479> that

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
point the mic at the F holes and that

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.420 
point the mic at the F holes and that
doesn't<00:01:05.960> really<00:01:06.350> sound<00:01:06.619> as<00:01:06.830> good<00:01:06.890> as<00:01:07.159> far<00:01:07.310> as

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
doesn't really sound as good as far as

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.800 
doesn't really sound as good as far as
I'm<00:01:07.520> concerned<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.119> let's<00:01:08.509> hear<00:01:08.600> what<00:01:08.720> this

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
I'm concerned so let's hear what this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:18.149

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.070 

that's<00:01:18.970> shooting<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.420> bridge<00:01:19.600> let's<00:01:19.900> hear

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
that's shooting the bridge let's hear

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:35.280 
that's shooting the bridge let's hear
what<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.290> f<00:01:20.440> holes

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.680 

okay<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:36.350> that's<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.740> basic<00:01:36.890> mic<00:01:37.280> setup<00:01:37.610> kind<00:01:38.600> of

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
okay so that's a basic mic setup kind of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.920 
okay so that's a basic mic setup kind of
bridge<00:01:39.500> level<00:01:40.040> bridge<00:01:40.370> height<00:01:40.750> shoot<00:01:41.750> the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
bridge level bridge height shoot the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.560 
bridge level bridge height shoot the
bridge<00:01:42.490> you<00:01:43.490> can<00:01:43.610> experiment<00:01:43.940> with<00:01:44.210> different

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
bridge you can experiment with different

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.120 
bridge you can experiment with different
placements<00:01:45.110> but<00:01:45.229> usually<00:01:45.620> when<00:01:45.800> you're<00:01:45.920> doing

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
placements but usually when you're doing

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.500 
placements but usually when you're doing
a<00:01:46.190> sound<00:01:46.400> check<00:01:46.580> you<00:01:46.700> don't<00:01:46.880> have<00:01:47.030> an<00:01:47.150> enormous

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
a sound check you don't have an enormous

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.040 
a sound check you don't have an enormous
amount<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.050> time<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.420> just<00:01:50.420> do<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.810> best<00:01:50.930> you

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
amount of time so just do the best you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.400 
amount of time so just do the best you
can<00:01:51.820> now<00:01:52.820> with<00:01:53.060> using<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.420> mic<00:01:53.600> like<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.110> the

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
can now with using a mic like this the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.530 
can now with using a mic like this the
other<00:01:54.590> big<00:01:54.979> issue<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.700> big<00:01:55.850> problem<00:01:56.090> is

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
other big issue and the big problem is

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.270 
other big issue and the big problem is
if<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:57.290> need<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.590> hear<00:01:57.740> yourself<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.190> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
if you need to hear yourself in the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.480 
if you need to hear yourself in the
monitors<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:59.140> generally<00:02:00.140> don't<00:02:00.440> use<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.979> monitor

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
monitors I generally don't use a monitor

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.870 
monitors I generally don't use a monitor
if<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.729> can<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:03.170> with<00:02:04.010> a<00:02:04.040> mic<00:02:04.310> like<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.550> it's

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
if I can and with a mic like this it's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.780 
if I can and with a mic like this it's
very<00:02:05.660> hot<00:02:05.960> very<00:02:05.990> sensitive<00:02:06.680> microphone<00:02:07.160> if

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
very hot very sensitive microphone if

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.669 
very hot very sensitive microphone if
you<00:02:07.850> have<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.209> monitor<00:02:08.509> very<00:02:08.840> close<00:02:09.110> by<00:02:09.350> there's

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
you have a monitor very close by there's

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.229 
you have a monitor very close by there's
going<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.860> be<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.040> feedback<00:02:10.459> loop<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.910> you're

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
going to be a feedback loop and you're

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.750 
going to be a feedback loop and you're
going<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.420> get<00:02:11.570> some<00:02:11.750> problems

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
going to get some problems

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.059 
going to get some problems
so<00:02:14.760> let's<00:02:14.970> try<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.180> AKG<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.739> this<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.040> a

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
so let's try the AKG now this is a

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.270 
so let's try the AKG now this is a
clip-on<00:02:17.459> mic<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.409> generally<00:02:19.409> there<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.129> two

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
clip-on mic and generally there are two

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.320 
clip-on mic and generally there are two
ways<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.580> deal<00:02:20.760> with<00:02:20.909> it

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
ways to deal with it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.430 
ways to deal with it
one<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.049> underneath<00:02:22.620> near<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.250> bridge<00:02:24.440> and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
one is underneath near the bridge and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.619 
one is underneath near the bridge and
I'll<00:02:25.590> use<00:02:25.739> this<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:26.459> any<00:02:26.700> situation<00:02:27.450> that's

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
I'll use this for any situation that's

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.750 
I'll use this for any situation that's
really<00:02:27.959> pretty<00:02:28.709> strong<00:02:29.099> or<00:02:29.370> when<00:02:29.489> I'm<00:02:29.580> playing

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
really pretty strong or when I'm playing

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.759 
really pretty strong or when I'm playing
with<00:02:29.970> drums<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.989> clip<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.260> on<00:02:31.440> your<00:02:31.590> tail

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
with drums you clip it on your tail

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.729 
with drums you clip it on your tail
piece<00:02:32.069> try<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:32.970> get<00:02:33.180> no<00:02:33.390> rattle<00:02:33.870> by<00:02:34.080> one<00:02:34.500> and

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
piece try to get no rattle by one and

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.530 
piece try to get no rattle by one and
the<00:02:34.799> wires<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.840> then<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.140> face<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.620> mic

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the wires here and then you face the mic

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.420 
the wires here and then you face the mic
pointing<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.720> space<00:02:40.019> around<00:02:40.709> between<00:02:41.129> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
pointing to the space around between the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.369 
pointing to the space around between the
feet<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.819> bridge<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.959> let's<00:02:43.110> hear<00:02:43.230> what

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
feet of the bridge so let's hear what

00:02:43.379 --> 00:03:00.130 
feet of the bridge so let's hear what
that<00:02:43.409> sounds<00:02:43.530> like

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.130 

okay<00:03:01.140> now<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.830> other<00:03:02.040> way<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.250> do<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:02.990> is<00:03:03.990> to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
okay now the other way to do this is to

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.790 
okay now the other way to do this is to
get<00:03:04.290> kind<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.680> more<00:03:04.890> natural<00:03:05.430> sound<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:07.620> to

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
get kind of a more natural sound is to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.560 
get kind of a more natural sound is to
go<00:03:07.920> for<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.160> mic<00:03:08.490> placement<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:09.090> had<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
go for the mic placement we had on the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.120 
go for the mic placement we had on the
chef's<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:11.060> kind<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.120> above<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.420> bridge

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
chef's so kind of above the bridge

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.830 
chef's so kind of above the bridge
shooting<00:03:14.130> down<00:03:14.460> with<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.730> bridge<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.660> let's

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
shooting down with the bridge so let's

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:30.809 
shooting down with the bridge so let's
hear<00:03:15.960> what<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.140> sounds<00:03:16.590> like

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.940 

okay<00:03:31.659> this<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.140> cheapest<00:03:32.500> option<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.890> I

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
okay this is the cheapest option that I

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.160 
okay this is the cheapest option that I
had<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:33.909> the<00:03:34.000> audio<00:03:34.239> technica<00:03:34.299> mic<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.109> I

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
had this is the audio technica mic it I

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.399 
had this is the audio technica mic it I
think<00:03:35.319> it<00:03:35.439> cost<00:03:35.620> $80<00:03:36.489> when<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.700> first<00:03:37.000> bought<00:03:37.180> it

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
think it cost $80 when I first bought it

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.390 
think it cost $80 when I first bought it
you<00:03:38.409> can<00:03:38.530> see<00:03:38.650> it's<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.799> very<00:03:38.829> tiny<00:03:39.219> little

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
you can see it's a very tiny little

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.190 
you can see it's a very tiny little
microphone<00:03:39.969> and<00:03:40.000> I've<00:03:40.239> just<00:03:40.420> reinforced<00:03:41.109> the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
microphone and I've just reinforced the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.059 
microphone and I've just reinforced the
end<00:03:41.379> with<00:03:41.650> some<00:03:42.340> electronic<00:03:42.840> electrical<00:03:43.840> tape

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
end with some electronic electrical tape

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.190 
end with some electronic electrical tape
make<00:03:45.069> sure<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.370> doesn't<00:03:45.519> tear<00:03:45.969> or<00:03:46.239> fray<00:03:46.840> at<00:03:47.019> the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
make sure it doesn't tear or fray at the

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.280 
make sure it doesn't tear or fray at the
where<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.159> wire<00:03:48.400> meets<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.819> mic<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.329> basic

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
where the wire meets the mic a basic

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.390 
where the wire meets the mic a basic
approach<00:03:50.409> with<00:03:50.769> this<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.189> to<00:03:52.799> lay<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.950> down<00:03:53.980> in

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
approach with this is to lay it down in

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.030 
approach with this is to lay it down in
some<00:03:54.689> foam<00:03:56.400> wrap<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.579> up<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.840> squeeze<00:03:59.799> it<00:03:59.920> onto

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
some foam wrap it up and squeeze it onto

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.729 
some foam wrap it up and squeeze it onto
your<00:04:00.159> tail<00:04:00.400> piece<00:04:01.170> now<00:04:02.170> don't<00:04:02.319> go<00:04:02.469> overboard

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
your tail piece now don't go overboard

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.699 
your tail piece now don't go overboard
trying<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.430> squeeze<00:04:03.639> it<00:04:03.790> down<00:04:03.909> there<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.709> also

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
trying to squeeze it down there and also

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.860 
trying to squeeze it down there and also
make<00:04:06.370> sure<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.609> wire<00:04:06.760> doesn't<00:04:07.000> dangle<00:04:07.629> on<00:04:07.750> the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
make sure the wire doesn't dangle on the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.360 
make sure the wire doesn't dangle on the
body<00:04:08.049> of<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.260> cello<00:04:08.500> because<00:04:08.680> it'll<00:04:08.919> buzz<00:04:09.129> the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
body of the cello because it'll buzz the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.909 
body of the cello because it'll buzz the
mic<00:04:09.549> definitely<00:04:10.000> picks<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.329> up

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
mic definitely picks that up

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.869 
mic definitely picks that up
okay<00:04:11.919> let's<00:04:12.099> hear<00:04:12.220> what<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.430> one<00:04:12.579> sounds

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
okay let's hear what this one sounds

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:25.610 
okay let's hear what this one sounds
like

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.909 

now<00:04:26.620> there's<00:04:26.919> one<00:04:26.979> slight<00:04:28.860> detriment<00:04:29.860> to

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
now there's one slight detriment to

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.589 
now there's one slight detriment to
using<00:04:30.189> this<00:04:30.279> kind<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.580> situation<00:04:31.060> is<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.330> foam

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
using this kind of situation is the foam

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.499 
using this kind of situation is the foam
pushing<00:04:32.169> against<00:04:32.409> the<00:04:32.560> body<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:32.979> cello

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
pushing against the body of the cello

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.879 
pushing against the body of the cello
definitely<00:04:34.509> changes<00:04:35.379> the<00:04:35.409> sound<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.860> little

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
definitely changes the sound a little

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.550 
definitely changes the sound a little
bit<00:04:36.099> so<00:04:36.639> it's<00:04:36.789> not<00:04:36.849> the<00:04:37.029> greatest<00:04:37.300> but<00:04:37.719> it's

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
bit so it's not the greatest but it's

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.890 
bit so it's not the greatest but it's
not<00:04:38.800> bad<00:04:39.039> it's<00:04:39.310> cheap<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.759> it's<00:04:40.180> pretty<00:04:40.749> good

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
not bad it's cheap and it's pretty good

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.809 
not bad it's cheap and it's pretty good
quality

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
quality

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.450 
quality
so<00:04:42.819> that's<00:04:43.330> microphones<00:04:44.069> let's<00:04:45.069> move<00:04:45.249> on<00:04:45.370> to

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
so that's microphones let's move on to

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.379 
so that's microphones let's move on to
pickups
