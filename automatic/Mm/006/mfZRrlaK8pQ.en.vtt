heat over there we're over here so they

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.819 
heat over there we're over here so they
should<00:02:00.719> put<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> lot<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.290> heat<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.530> watt

should put out a lot of heat and watt

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.420 
should put out a lot of heat and watt
light<00:02:02.070> too<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:03.270> good<00:02:03.829> just<00:02:04.829> bending

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.730 
light too so that's good just bending
the<00:02:05.460> wires<00:02:05.729> into<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.299> hooks<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.840> then

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the wires into little hooks and then

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.190 
them so I can't show them anyway so the
lamp<00:06:22.110> project<00:06:22.560> worked<00:06:22.830> it's<00:06:23.100> about<00:06:23.940> 40<00:06:24.360> 40

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
lamp project worked it's about 40 40

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.610 
lamp project worked it's about 40 40
outside<00:06:25.560> maybe<00:06:25.770> 39<00:06:26.310> right<00:06:26.640> now<00:06:26.760> so<00:06:27.410> we<00:06:28.410> got<00:06:28.590> a

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
outside maybe 39 right now so we got a

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.650 
outside maybe 39 right now so we got a
good<00:06:28.920> 30<00:06:29.310> degree<00:06:30.210> difference<00:06:30.690> upstairs<00:06:31.380> and

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
good 30 degree difference upstairs and

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.730 
good 30 degree difference upstairs and
that's<00:06:33.660> gonna<00:06:33.810> be<00:06:33.900> good<00:06:33.990> for<00:06:34.200> winter<00:06:34.320> because

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
that's gonna be good for winter because

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.730 
that's gonna be good for winter because
it<00:06:35.310> maybe<00:06:35.730> gets<00:06:36.000> down<00:06:36.150> to<00:06:36.180> the<00:06:36.360> 20s<00:06:36.720> so<00:06:37.140> 50

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
it maybe gets down to the 20s so 50

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.010 
it maybe gets down to the 20s so 50
would<00:06:37.830> be<00:06:37.890> tolerable<00:06:38.180> tolerable<00:06:39.180> terrible

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
would be tolerable tolerable terrible

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.260 
would be tolerable tolerable terrible
