showed eyes of where to find that but

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.149 
showed eyes of where to find that but
anyway<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.309> only<00:00:59.519> kind<00:01:00.179> of<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.390> rubix<00:01:01.260> type

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159

Diane<00:01:02.670> Lube<00:01:02.940> works<00:01:03.600> well<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:03.839> everything<00:01:04.970> and

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Diane Lube works well for everything and

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.290 
Diane Lube works well for everything and
yeah<00:01:06.300> so<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:06.930> they're<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.500> comparable

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
yeah so they they're pretty comparable

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.790 
yeah so they they're pretty comparable
this<00:01:09.300> one<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.810> haven't<00:01:10.170> been<00:01:10.290> using<00:01:10.410> as<00:01:10.680> much

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
this one I haven't been using as much

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.140 
this one I haven't been using as much
the<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.280> without<00:01:11.370> the<00:01:11.670> anchor<00:01:11.910> is<00:01:12.000> only

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the one without the anchor is only

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.260 
the one without the anchor is only
because<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.460> think<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.960> needs<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.620> anchors

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
because I think it needs the anchors

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.440 
because I think it needs the anchors
okay<00:01:18.300> anyway<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.500> zhanchi<00:01:19.740> how<00:01:20.730> I'll<00:01:21.300> show

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.450 
a lighter feel to it a little crispier
for<00:02:12.250> me<00:02:12.340> although<00:02:13.270> my<00:02:13.690> goo<00:02:13.870> hyung<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.460> pretty

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
for me although my goo hyung is pretty

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.440 
for me although my goo hyung is pretty
gummy<00:02:15.850> at<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.270> point<00:02:16.600> which<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.710> like<00:02:18.460> but

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
gummy at this point which I like but

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.320 
gummy at this point which I like but
it's<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.600> different<00:02:19.900> slightly<00:02:20.650> different<00:02:20.800> fuel

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
it's a different slightly different fuel

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.160 
it's a different slightly different fuel
basically<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.450> same<00:02:22.600> size<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:24.960> still<00:02:25.960> like<00:02:26.140> my

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
basically the same size I still like my

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.200 
basically the same size I still like my
goo<00:02:26.440> hyung<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:26.830> I'm<00:02:27.490> thinking<00:02:27.820> about<00:02:27.880> using

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
goo hyung but I'm thinking about using

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.470 
goo hyung but I'm thinking about using
the<00:02:28.690> done<00:02:29.260> chief<00:02:29.500> for<00:02:29.740> my<00:02:30.490> main<00:02:30.820> cube<00:02:31.240> at<00:02:31.330> this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
the done chief for my main cube at this

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.120 
the done chief for my main cube at this
point<00:02:31.720> at<00:02:31.870> least<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.440> one<00:02:32.590> from<00:02:32.830> puzzle

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
point at least the one from puzzle

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.730 
point at least the one from puzzle
addictions<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.820> had<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> mess<00:02:35.200> with<00:02:35.320> attentions

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
addictions I had to mess with attentions

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.050 
addictions I had to mess with attentions
a<00:02:35.830> little<00:02:36.040> bit<00:02:36.160> but<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.400> was<00:02:36.640> really<00:02:36.880> all<00:02:37.030> I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
a little bit but that was really all I

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.720 
a little bit but that was really all I
needed<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.360> do<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:38.350> may<00:02:38.950> put<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.250> anchors<00:02:39.550> in

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
needed to do I may put the anchors in

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.140 
needed to do I may put the anchors in
this<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.120> see<00:02:40.300> how<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:41.130> improves<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.400> or<00:02:42.670> not

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
this and see how that improves it or not

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.090 
this and see how that improves it or not
but<00:02:44.110> at<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.320> moment<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.770> little<00:02:44.980> bit

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
but at the moment it's a little bit

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.960 
but at the moment it's a little bit
weird<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.000> my<00:02:46.300> taste<00:02:47.370> okay<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.700> guess

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
weird for my taste okay so I guess

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.750 
weird for my taste okay so I guess
getting<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> cube<00:02:49.840> itself<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.560> has<00:02:51.460> all

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
getting to the cube itself it has all

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.650 
getting to the cube itself it has all
the<00:02:51.910> kind<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.180> similar<00:02:52.920> feeling<00:02:53.920> or<00:02:54.660> similar

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
the kind of similar feeling or similar

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.810 
the kind of similar feeling or similar
feel<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.900> most<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.010> other<00:02:57.130> Dayan<00:02:57.460> cubes

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
feel to most of the other Dayan cubes

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.150 
feel to most of the other Dayan cubes
most<00:02:58.750> typically<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.440> goo<00:02:59.560> long<00:02:59.740> so<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.100> you

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
most typically to goo long so if you

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.240 
most typically to goo long so if you
like<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.400> go<00:03:00.520> home<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.830> don't<00:03:03.010> want<00:03:03.160> a

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
like to go home and you don't want a

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.350 
like to go home and you don't want a
fast<00:03:03.730> cube<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.690> can<00:03:04.990> really<00:03:06.150> has<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.180> nice

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
fast cube that can really has a nice

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.460 
fast cube that can really has a nice
crisp<00:03:07.750> feel<00:03:08.020> to<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.690> very<00:03:11.320> nice

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
crisp feel to it this is a very nice

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.990 
crisp feel to it this is a very nice
cube<00:03:11.830> too<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.760> use<00:03:13.950> its<00:03:14.950> bigger<00:03:15.190> which<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.790> like

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
cube too to use its bigger which I like

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.620 
cube too to use its bigger which I like
because<00:03:16.209> my<00:03:16.510> hands<00:03:16.840> are<00:03:16.930> giant<00:03:17.350> anyway

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
because my hands are giant anyway

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.440 
because my hands are giant anyway
movement<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:20.100> smooth<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.370> everything<00:03:21.459> cuts

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
movement is smooth and everything cuts

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.150 
movement is smooth and everything cuts
corners<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:23.110> like<00:03:23.290> mine<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.500> little<00:03:23.680> bit<00:03:23.890> tighter

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
corners I like mine a little bit tighter

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.610 
corners I like mine a little bit tighter
than<00:03:24.370> most<00:03:24.580> people<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.810> still<00:03:26.140> has<00:03:26.470> no

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
than most people but it still has no

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.660 
than most people but it still has no
real<00:03:26.830> problems<00:03:27.360> with<00:03:28.360> any<00:03:28.540> corners<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.050> think

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
real problems with any corners I think

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.790 
real problems with any corners I think
nothing<00:03:30.670> really<00:03:30.760> lock<00:03:31.000> up<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.360> much<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.709> the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
nothing really lock up that much and the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.920 
nothing really lock up that much and the
anchors<00:03:33.100> really<00:03:33.430> don't<00:03:33.610> I<00:03:33.760> don't<00:03:33.790> feel<00:03:34.480> the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
anchors really don't I don't feel the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.120 
anchors really don't I don't feel the
anchors<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.560> which<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.890> good<00:03:36.100> thing

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
anchors in that which is a good thing

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.840 
anchors in that which is a good thing
because<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.610> people<00:03:37.420> have<00:03:37.540> problems<00:03:37.870> with<00:03:37.959> that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
because I people have problems with that

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.150 
because I people have problems with that
rubbing<00:03:39.850> on<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.030> inside<00:03:40.360> or<00:03:40.570> anything<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.160> the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
rubbing on the inside or anything so the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.910 
rubbing on the inside or anything so the
way<00:03:42.310> whatever<00:03:42.610> I<00:03:43.390> wire<00:03:43.690> does<00:03:43.989> he<00:03:44.320> he<00:03:44.590> really

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
way whatever I wire does he he really

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.430 
way whatever I wire does he he really
makes<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.459> cube<00:03:45.730> smooth<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:47.140> little

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
makes the cube smooth and a little

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.199 
makes the cube smooth and a little
crispy<00:03:47.530> which<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.550> refreshing<00:03:49.180> change<00:03:51.209> so

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
crispy which is a refreshing change so

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.470 
crispy which is a refreshing change so
yeah<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.840> turns<00:03:54.090> fantastically<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.330> any

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
yeah it turns fantastically like any

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.680 
yeah it turns fantastically like any
other<00:03:55.690> Dayan<00:03:56.019> cube<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.880> little<00:03:58.150> feels<00:03:58.600> a

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
other Dayan cube the little feels a

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.270 
other Dayan cube the little feels a
little<00:03:58.780> lighter<00:03:59.019> than<00:03:59.230> my<00:03:59.320> goo<00:03:59.470> hyung<00:03:59.680> but

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
little lighter than my goo hyung but

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.430 
little lighter than my goo hyung but
that<00:04:01.150> may<00:04:01.269> just<00:04:01.300> be<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.900> amount<00:04:02.019> of<00:04:02.140> Lube<00:04:02.410> that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
that may just be the amount of Lube that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.949 
that may just be the amount of Lube that
I<00:04:02.680> have<00:04:02.950> in<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.670> goo<00:04:03.820> Hong<00:04:04.030> because<00:04:04.330> I<00:04:04.630> put

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
I have in the goo Hong because I put

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.020 
I have in the goo Hong because I put
lots<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.290> stuff<00:04:05.500> in<00:04:05.620> there<00:04:05.800> to<00:04:06.070> make<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.450> smooth

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
lots of stuff in there to make it smooth

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.490 
lots of stuff in there to make it smooth
so<00:04:10.030> sound<00:04:10.300> difference<00:04:10.720> if<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:11.019> do<00:04:11.080> is<00:04:11.260> keep<00:04:11.410> them

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
so sound difference if I do is keep them

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.319 
so sound difference if I do is keep them
vert<00:04:14.500> on<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.739> GU<00:04:14.890> Hong<00:04:15.100> versus<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.790> junkie

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.040 

so<00:04:19.329> you<00:04:19.389> can<00:04:19.600> see<00:04:19.810> there's<00:04:20.079> a<00:04:20.470> crispy<00:04:21.040> or<00:04:21.160> feel

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
so you can see there's a crispy or feel

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.980

improvement over the goo hyung which is
I<00:05:20.800> guess<00:05:20.830> what<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.220> was<00:05:21.340> meant<00:05:21.580> to<00:05:21.639> be<00:05:21.789> so<00:05:22.180> I

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
I guess what it was meant to be so I

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.870 
I guess what it was meant to be so I
guess<00:05:23.229> that's<00:05:23.440> my<00:05:23.650> review<00:05:24.010> for<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.430> junkie

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
guess that's my review for the junkie

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.700 
guess that's my review for the junkie
