00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.850
 I am very disappointed by your attitude 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.560
 children why because you are 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.230
 nothing but concentrated 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.860
 negativity the kings of slackers and the 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.810
 reins of crying things like a 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.940
 sir who is called father neither his chariot 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.790
 woman tells him stuff like that and 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.140
 their nest boxes you want to see your stack of 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.140
 freight on the belly of an elephant 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.009
 nobody in the world is able to 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.820
 understand what you say girl 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.320
 Your book is probably what is 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.500
 what are you complaining about I'm going to 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.460

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.880
 when you got here 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.049
 you were positive and enthusiastic 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.479
 motivated to learn to become 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.009
 artists 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:57.090
 now it looks old to 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.090
 the hospice I could very well leave 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.350
 I should just go out that door 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.350
 and never come back 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.630
 like that your own favorite 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.110
 will disappear forever 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.520
 these beautiful remains and brought it not 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.870

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.870
