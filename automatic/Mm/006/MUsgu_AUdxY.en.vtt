00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
a tryout engineer and now the score

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
a tryout engineer and now the score
streaks<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.390> i'm<00:01:36.509> using<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.930> guys<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.259> see

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
streaks that i'm using you guys can see

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.069 
streaks that i'm using you guys can see
loads<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:38.040> dogs<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.880> swarm<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.509> reason

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
loads are dogs and a swarm the reason

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.359 
loads are dogs and a swarm the reason
why<00:01:40.170> i'm<00:01:40.229> using<00:01:40.500> lodestar<00:01:40.920> instead<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.250> these

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
why i'm using lodestar instead of these

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.999 
why i'm using lodestar instead of these
sad<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.820> because<00:01:42.329> every<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.170> i<00:01:43.350> use<00:01:43.560> V<00:01:43.770> side

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
sad is because every time i use V side

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.830 
sad is because every time i use V side
the<00:01:44.250> game's<00:01:44.490> end<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:44.970> two<00:01:45.180> minutes<00:01:45.390> early

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the game's end like two minutes early

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.139 
the game's end like two minutes early
because<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:46.560> team<00:01:46.799> always<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.189> triple<00:01:47.640> caps<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149

been using low start to a preventable
capping<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.759> definitely<00:01:57.090> reduced<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
capping and it's definitely reduced it a

stars<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.109> the<00:02:49.200> beginning<00:02:49.349> like<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.799> said<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
stars in the beginning like I said the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.520 
stars in the beginning like I said the
200-plus<00:02:51.390> shouldn't<00:02:52.049> have<00:02:52.170> been<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.379> problem

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
200-plus shouldn't have been a problem

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.789 
200-plus shouldn't have been a problem
but<00:02:53.340> also<00:02:53.519> this<00:02:53.760> game<00:02:54.030> lasted<00:02:54.959> only<00:02:55.170> um<00:02:55.650> I

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
but also this game lasted only um I

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.440 
but also this game lasted only um I
think<00:02:55.950> nine<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.609> half<00:02:56.640> minutes<00:02:56.970> maybe<00:02:57.269> like

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
think nine and a half minutes maybe like

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.210 
think nine and a half minutes maybe like
nine<00:02:57.629> minutes<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.140> 15<00:02:58.470> seconds<00:02:58.859> so<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.010> ended

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
nine minutes and 15 seconds so it ended

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.610 
nine minutes and 15 seconds so it ended
a<00:02:59.310> bit<00:02:59.459> early<00:02:59.819> it<00:03:00.239> ended<00:03:00.540> about<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.840> 30-40

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
a bit early it ended about a 30-40

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.110 
a bit early it ended about a 30-40
seconds<00:03:01.920> early<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> games<00:03:02.640> need<00:03:02.879> to<00:03:02.970> last

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
seconds early so the games need to last

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.569 
seconds early so the games need to last
their<00:03:03.450> full<00:03:03.659> length<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:04.049> well<00:03:04.260> because<00:03:05.220> when

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
their full length as well because when

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.979 
their full length as well because when
there<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:05.849> like<00:03:06.000> 30<00:03:06.150> seconds<00:03:06.599> left<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.870> this

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
there was like 30 seconds left in this

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.380 
there was like 30 seconds left in this
game<00:03:07.109> I<00:03:07.440> had<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.799> swarm<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.549> dogs<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.000> call<00:03:09.180> in

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
game I had a swarm and dogs to call in

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.319 
game I had a swarm and dogs to call in
and<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.989> think<00:03:10.290> 30<00:03:10.620> seconds<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> lot<00:03:11.909> of<00:03:12.090> time

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
and I think 30 seconds is a lot of time

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.660 
and I think 30 seconds is a lot of time
for<00:03:12.629> my<00:03:12.720> swarm<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.200> dogs<00:03:13.409> to<00:03:13.650> go<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.159> it

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
for my swarm and dogs to go in and it

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.309 
for my swarm and dogs to go in and it
get<00:03:14.819> me<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.000> lot<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.359> kills<00:03:15.599> as<00:03:15.780> well<00:03:15.989> with<00:03:16.170> me

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
get me a lot of kills as well with me

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.420 
get me a lot of kills as well with me
running<00:03:16.650> around<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.980> getting<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.250> lot<00:03:17.400> of

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
running around and getting a lot of

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.330 
running around and getting a lot of
kills<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:17.880> my<00:03:18.030> gun<00:03:18.269> as<00:03:18.480> well<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:20.099> know<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
kills with my gun as well so we know the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.009 
kills with my gun as well so we know the
200-plus<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.880> really<00:03:21.150> lobby<00:03:21.359> dependent<00:03:21.930> i'm
