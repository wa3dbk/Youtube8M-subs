I've been doing the past month so it's

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.120 
I've been doing the past month so it's
thinking<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:06.810> Stargate<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.649> just<00:00:07.980> thought

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
thinking about Stargate and just thought

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.020 
thinking about Stargate and just thought
it'd<00:00:08.250> be<00:00:08.280> cool<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.550> make<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> Stargate<00:00:09.240> mod<00:00:11.030> so

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
it'd be cool to make a Stargate mod so

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.530 
it'd be cool to make a Stargate mod so
what<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.570> here<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.799> gate<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.540> can

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
what we have here is a gate I can

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.000 
what we have here is a gate I can
currently<00:00:15.870> make<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> gate<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> any<00:00:16.560> size<00:00:16.800> I'm

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
currently make a gate to any size I'm

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.470 
currently make a gate to any size I'm
one<00:00:17.190> city<00:00:17.490> shape<00:00:17.789> whatever<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:20.180> what<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> did

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
one city shape whatever and what I did

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.170 
one city shape whatever and what I did
for<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> addresses<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:23.869> this<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.019> referred<00:00:25.410> to

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
for the addresses it this is referred to

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.429 
for the addresses it this is referred to
this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.359> what<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> show<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.109> referred<00:00:28.410> to

this is what on the show is referred to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.359 
this is what on the show is referred to
as<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> THD<00:00:29.960> taking<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.080> different<00:00:31.369> symbols

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
as the THD taking on different symbols

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.260 
as the THD taking on different symbols
has<00:00:32.969> them<00:00:33.660> pop<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.980> top<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.270> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
has them pop up on the top there and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.040 
has them pop up on the top there and
even<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> gate

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.150 

do<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.350> clicking<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.219> symbols<00:00:46.160> these

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
do you see clicking of the symbols these

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.959 
do you see clicking of the symbols these
different<00:00:47.430> ones<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.700> here<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.850> can

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
different ones up here so what we can

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.910 
different ones up here so what we can
also<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:52.160> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.280> type<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.730> eight<00:00:54.539> address

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.939 

take<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.070> one<00:01:00.170> we<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> stargate

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
take this one we get a stargate

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
take this one we get a stargate
animation<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:03.239> go<00:01:03.420> through<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:07.170> appear<00:01:07.470> on

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
animation we go through you appear on

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.760 
animation we go through you appear on
the<00:01:07.619> other<00:01:07.799> side<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.710> yep<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.590> going<00:01:13.590> through

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the other side so yep and going through

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.120 
the other side so yep and going through
a<00:01:13.799> gate<00:01:14.100> gives<00:01:14.580> us<00:01:15.049> these<00:01:16.049> emerald<00:01:16.830> blocks

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
a gate gives us these emerald blocks

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
a gate gives us these emerald blocks
where<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.700> Chevron's<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.390> which<00:01:18.750> should

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
where the Chevron's are which should

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.170 
where the Chevron's are which should
have<00:01:19.170> shows<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:20.280> they<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.580> us<00:01:20.700> locked<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
have shows that they get us locked and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.249 
have shows that they get us locked and
kept<00:01:21.360> bees<00:01:21.540> right<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:23.150> going<00:01:24.150> through<00:01:24.299> why

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
kept bees right now going through why

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.600 
kept bees right now going through why
haven't<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.650> properly<00:01:25.860> set<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.340> here

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
haven't really properly set it up here

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.660 
haven't really properly set it up here
we're<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.060> through<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> active<00:01:28.080> portal

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
we're going through the active portal

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
we're going through the active portal
block<00:01:29.670> doesn't<00:01:30.240> let<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> teleport<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.140> back

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
block doesn't let to teleport you back

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.149 
block doesn't let to teleport you back
to<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> previous<00:01:31.740> server<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.799> wait<00:01:34.950> for

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
to the previous server so if we wait for

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.160 
to the previous server so if we wait for
it<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> deactivate<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:39.170> it's

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it to deactivate you can see that it's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.609 
it to deactivate you can see that it's
gone<00:01:40.380> back<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> normal<00:01:41.070> shipments<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:43.380> can

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
gone back to the normal shipments we can

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.520 
gone back to the normal shipments we can
type<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.299> address<00:01:45.390> back<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> first

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
type in the address back to the first

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:57.030 
type in the address back to the first
planet<00:01:50.210> go<00:01:51.210> through<00:01:51.799> me<00:01:52.799> right<00:01:52.829> back<00:01:53.220> here

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040
