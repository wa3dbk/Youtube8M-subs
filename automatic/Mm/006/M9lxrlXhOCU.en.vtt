00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.560
 the first bmw m3 hits the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.580
 current m3 and m4 meet the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.830
 generations 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.330
 the mind is the same the technique 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.540
 but this changed 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.310
 Let's start with the first of its kind 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:22.740
 bloated bake spoiler an edged 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.750
 Type built from mid-1986 to 1991 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.779
 the hood is a 2.3 liter four cylinder 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.800
 sucker with 200 ps without kat the sprint 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.950
 on 100 takes 6 7 seconds 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.220
 235 km h the price at that time from 58 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.650
 1000 mark 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.540
 five generations on after four 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.740
 cylinders six cylinders eight cylinders 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.540
 where to go back now 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.810
 six-cylinder under the hood of 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.100
 m3 recommends double turbo technology 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:55.340
 the three liter machine comes to 431 ps 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:59.810
 maximum torque 550 newtonmeter 40 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.060
 more than the detached v8 tip to 280 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.280
 km h and the time from the stand to 100 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.490
 passes in 4 3 seconds 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.320
 the four-door is still called m3 and how 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.729
 the coupÃ© has the limousine now too 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.590
 a roof of light carbon 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.070
 both models have one at the rear 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.979
 subtle trailing edge otherwise there is the m 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.710
 typical features painted calipers 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.960
 thick end pipes on each side 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.290
 aerodynamic modifications for the m4 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.080
 Coupe are at least 72,000 200 euros 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.360
 due two doors more so the m3 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.070
 costs 700 euros less 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.330
 Both models will be available if they are in 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.950
 go next year to start the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.869
 he be at all three fastest 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.060
 despite all the technical finesse and 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.470
 the progress will be some m3 fans 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.270
 most probably the trumpet of the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.830
 eight-cylinder also miss with 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.290
 flap controlled in the exhaust comes the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.000
 Sound of the new will not be exciting 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.130
 certainly the fight between porsche 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.130
 911 carrera s with performance upgrade 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.050
 and the m 4 ps is moderately subject to the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.540
 porsche on the data sheet exactly one 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.020
 horsepower a rogue who evil here 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.020
 thinks
