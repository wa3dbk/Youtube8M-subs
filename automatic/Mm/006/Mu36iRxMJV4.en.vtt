00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.279
 you all know our pizza recipe hope 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.299
 I certainly do not look at you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.900
 the video on 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.570
 we usually round up pizza 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.960
 For once, come up today 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.640
 great because we have many guests and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.980
 make many different pizzas 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.800
 I want you to have a recipe today 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.990
 Let's show the pizza dough is like that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.039
 basic recipe what we always for pizza dough 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.309
 make a little excitement for the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.700
 cover that would be in this case as always 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.850
 tomato paste you can, though 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.430
 you sometimes vary volt times 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.770
 give chopped tomatoes to give 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.050
 it also in the can or even fresh 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.219
 tomatoes so there you all have 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.620
 possibilities 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.079
 we accepted tomatoes passat 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.739
 then have a lot of onions small 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.820
 cut small chopped you have to 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.920
 you have to watch a lot of howling 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.100
 It is always a sad meal then 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.780
 As I say each time in any case 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.810
 tastes good afterwards and onions are 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.820
 healthy then so many onions then 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.880
 These onions are very nice with 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.630
 Pepper spiced fresh from the mill 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.580
 ground 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:25.500
 then come small chopped olives there 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.850
 Of course you can do it on the whole 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.380
 put on it or only once 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.210
 cut that can do you how 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.890
 you want we have rosemary then 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 this is picked just briefly under 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 water crane and then it will be fine 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.090
 hacked so there are the leaflets 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.790
 stripped off the stalks and then 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 this is finely chopped who does not 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.770
 Of course, the may also like 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.540
 put whole branches on it and the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.549
 after that, it is there 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.770
 Not a problem but we like that 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.630
 like to have it finely chopped on it 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.159
 then he comes over it and important for 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.869
 a pizza oregano 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.799
 which gives then the typical Italian 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.830
 taste then we have in this case 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.960
 Now mozzarella on it we did 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 do not like to do so 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.700
 zarrella at all we do not do 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.760
 Happy cheese on the pizza but there we 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.700
 many guests have today and some of them 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.730
 We also like to eat cheese 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.000
 mozzarella given to it 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.510
 yes, that's actually the oven 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.230
 is still warm 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.590
 who only ten minutes about when 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.680
 Preheat oven to her would still 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.550
 fifteen minutes otherwise tried 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.220
 try other things 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.220
 This is definitely not one of the ybbs
