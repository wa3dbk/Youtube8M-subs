00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.450 
that low fastball you have no chance of
that<00:02:31.260> because<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.800> think<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.370> a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
put it in a you know try to hit hit

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.140 
put it in a you know try to hit hit
somewhere<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.080> middle<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.380> plate

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
somewhere in the middle of the plate

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.120 
somewhere in the middle of the plate
and<00:04:24.660> you'll<00:04:24.900> get<00:04:25.139> close<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.650> where<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.919> want

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.080 
and you'll get close to where you want
it<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.340> go<00:04:26.490> but<00:04:26.760> that's<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.970> way

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
it to go but that's the way

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.870 
it to go but that's the way
knuckleballers<00:04:27.720> are<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.229> think<00:04:29.220> he<00:04:29.550> may<00:04:29.699> be<00:04:29.729> the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
knuckleballers are I think he may be the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.640 
knuckleballers are I think he may be the
best<00:04:30.060> knuckleball<00:04:30.810> pitcher<00:04:31.169> in<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.470> game
