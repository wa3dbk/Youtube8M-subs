00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:28.199
 for our gastronomic story a pig house today we talk 22 choose me 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.489
 escape 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.769
 ok 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.830
 we have always been used to having a burning fire 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.960
 with one that the realm of chair is born 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 naples soccer 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.960
 to put a spit that spins and that cooks info on all the nerves of some 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 once the starlings are blue you want penguins other times 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.120
 you have to somehow also be skype protections in these poor people 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.140
 animals flying from a head suckling then 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 we propose something creates roast birds who can look like 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 take with the pork belly 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.120
 like I'm doing right now 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.820
 what aromateasy I love 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.820
 with two products that we find 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.290
 quite frequently in the vegetable garden and in the woods 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.860
 the sage 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.320
 and the window 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.870
 this is the salle this image prella Ready to roll 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.670
 I prepare a kind of roulade 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.460
 I still go ahead because 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.280
 of bacon we prepared them so much 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.520
 palatine 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.650
 of flavored and prepare this kind of 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.289
 the reason that 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.350
 just to try to give 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.840
 the resemblance raised by the Turks to the rotisserie 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.880
 aromateasy i love that saga and with china it is cold 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.140
 yet another roll and we put it this way 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.799
 and so we can continue for a long time but because why 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.649
 embedding &amp; sharing we looked for 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:20.469
 of particular 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.029
 for the reasons we previously told 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.599
 Pork itself is a song that lends itself very well 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.339
 to be cooked rotisserie 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.509
 if we claro but I call you with these two ingredients 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.889
 the sage beautiful image 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.499
 it turns out how much click costs 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.459
 at the roast thrush a post 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.609
 is assumed 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.249
 the escaped birds are ready we take you explain it 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.519
 we put 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.229
 in the middle of the tits 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.269
 the bread as I am doing 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.329
 a little bird 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.329
 a slice of bread 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.349
 yet another shelby knox 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.519
 still a slice of bread with you don't call me little birds though 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:18.409
 the birds have only at least melhor unibo 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:23.590
 the taste and the scent because the birds in high journeys 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.789
 particular 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:29.999
 why we are we're environmentally friendly and animals that don't 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:30.979
 I'm 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.979
 absolutely harmful 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.209
 I continue to put bread 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:43.779
 and little birds that will become funny we could also call 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.099
 rolls 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.929
 flavored with the famous 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.929
 and also flavored 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.219
 with the salle 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:57.879
 of our body 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.870
 the spit 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.369
 it's ready 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.369
 and I go to the rotisserie 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:40.050
 the rotisserie starts to move 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.580
 we are waiting for canonical time 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.080
 because fattening the pig 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.309
 cooler to slowly 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:48.900
 birds 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.090
 you can stop them 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.639
 and us letters on the run 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.460
 because we will surely have the feeling of having eaten 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.360
 the spit 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.069
 surroundings osmer 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:01.900
 anyway 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.509
 a row of approx
