00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello my name is Bommel and I show 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.130
 Now the mystery in the Fluc coast 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.860
 I started spilling archives 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.710
 at the wkg water courses anchorage and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.400
 give me time lapse direction 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.859
 south over the water there is one 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.949
 would take a bit longer than normal 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.930
 speed down there because you go to 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.699
 So swim in the viewpoint 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.650
 should not really be an adversary 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.510
 Treat the surface with both 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.180
 and since they all a bit 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.100
 differently from such a side arrived 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.110
 Let's follow the path and I'll try 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.570
 to evade the opponents or from now 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.829
 both are ignored 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:53.030
 just to take a little bit of time 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.030
 only save upwards 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 80 opponents we are all too 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.860
 general area here about this 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.550
 Coral we come then piece by piece 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.550
 further up 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.970
 you see you can be the most opponent 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.460
 Just go over here by talking about this 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.479
 coral goes up and a bit 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.479
 distance from it 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.460
 Now we are at the point of view 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.420
 arrived 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.219
 and here begins our puzzle 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.130
 Let's go over it in the corner 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.869
 corals do not fall on the coral 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.750
 other side and soft if possible 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.640
 these red fields from the namely 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.109
 Apply poisoning and another 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.109
 be a bit malicious 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.950
 she does not think so static 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.030
 somehow random it that the sponsors 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.329
 and when coming imagine the same 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.329
 out 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.840
 and as with all coral rises 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:18.030
 here on this map is partly yet 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:21.800
 a little tricky and you have to 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.800
 To see how best to go to the oven 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.290
 in principle, just follow the coral 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.290
 the way up 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.170
 Winter opponents are bothered by that 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.430
 also eliminate but i am now 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.430
 just like that 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.560
 if we overcome this floor after this 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.510
 we are actually already 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.069
 at the end because up here it is the same 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.610
 a platform on the right side 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.620
 it goes up we'll have to also 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.590
 straight ahead in the back are already 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.489
 the chest and I try it there 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.230
 get through 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:16.470
 without me somehow great 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.840
 to be stopped so success is there good 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.519
 to get 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.390
 I thank you for watching and me 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.390
 hope you liked it
