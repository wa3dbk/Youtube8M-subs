00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
made for vegetables is fine you don't

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.120 
made for vegetables is fine you don't
need<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> add<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> lot<00:01:43.079> at<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.409> stage<00:01:43.649> because

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
need to add a lot at this stage because

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.620 
need to add a lot at this stage because
chances<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.700> your<00:01:45.060> plants<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.450> already

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
chances are your plants have already

come pre well fertilized from the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.370 
come pre well fertilized from the
nursery<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:48.720> sprinkle<00:01:49.229> will

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
nursery so just a little sprinkle will

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.190 
nursery so just a little sprinkle will
do<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:50.520> ahead<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.939> work<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.360> into<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.899> soil

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
do go ahead and work that into the soil

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
do go ahead and work that into the soil
and<00:01:52.500> at<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.159> stage<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.149> potting

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and at this stage because the potting

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.200 
and at this stage because the potting
soil<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.140> dry<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.280> give<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> pots<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
soil is so dry I like to give the pots a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.050 
soil is so dry I like to give the pots a
good<00:01:57.509> soak<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.229> water<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:59.130> really<00:01:59.640> fill<00:01:59.909> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
good soak of water just really fill it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.940 
good soak of water just really fill it
up<00:02:00.149> make<00:02:00.450> sure<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.930> soil<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.350> nice<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
up make sure that that soil is nice and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.590 
up make sure that that soil is nice and
damp<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.399> think<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.939> better<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> add<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
damp I think it's better to add the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
damp I think it's better to add the
water<00:02:03.810> at<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.229> stage<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.100> you're

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
water at this stage so that you're

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.069 
water at this stage so that you're
actually<00:02:05.399> planting<00:02:06.149> your<00:02:06.240> plants<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.780> damp

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
actually planting your plants in damp

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.229 
actually planting your plants in damp
soil<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:08.039> shocking<00:02:08.759> them<00:02:08.910> with<00:02:09.030> too<00:02:09.149> much

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
soil and not shocking them with too much

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.330 
soil and not shocking them with too much
water<00:02:09.509> once<00:02:09.869> they're<00:02:09.989> actually<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.530> soil<00:02:10.890> now

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
water once they're actually in soil now

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.559 
water once they're actually in soil now
you

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
you

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.209 
you
could<00:02:11.689> start<00:02:11.959> with<00:02:12.140> seeds<00:02:12.379> but<00:02:12.769> I'm<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.980> bit<00:02:13.129> of

if you want one of the things that you
can<00:03:25.579> do<00:03:25.729> is<00:03:25.909> mark<00:03:26.239> your<00:03:26.449> herbs<00:03:26.629> so<00:03:26.930> you

can do is mark your herbs so you

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.869 
can do is mark your herbs so you
remember<00:03:27.379> what<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.650> planted<00:03:28.129> and<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.609> think<00:03:28.819> a

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
remember what you planted and I think a

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.339 
remember what you planted and I think a
great<00:03:29.120> way<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.329> go<00:03:29.540> is<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:29.930> by<00:03:30.019> using<00:03:30.169> some

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
great way to go is just by using some

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.929 
great way to go is just by using some
little<00:03:30.620> popsicle<00:03:31.099> sticks<00:03:31.519> they're

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
little popsicle sticks they're

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.030 
little popsicle sticks they're
inexpensive<00:03:32.419> they're<00:03:32.930> wood<00:03:33.379> so<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.799> it<00:03:33.919> sort

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
inexpensive they're wood so that it sort

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.649 
inexpensive they're wood so that it sort
of<00:03:34.129> fits<00:03:34.340> with<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:34.519> nice<00:03:34.699> organic<00:03:35.030> theme<00:03:35.419> and

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
of fits with a nice organic theme and

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.719 
of fits with a nice organic theme and
just<00:03:35.689> use<00:03:36.199> a<00:03:36.229> permanent<00:03:36.829> pen<00:03:37.040> because<00:03:37.519> when

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:37.729 
just use a permanent pen because when

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.429 
just use a permanent pen because when
you<00:03:37.819> start<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.180> water<00:03:38.449> those<00:03:38.659> herbs<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:39.259> don't

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 
you start to water those herbs you don't

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.839 
you start to water those herbs you don't
want<00:03:39.590> your<00:03:39.680> marking<00:03:40.069> to<00:03:40.159> actually<00:03:40.459> wash<00:03:40.639> off

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
want your marking to actually wash off

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.270 
want your marking to actually wash off
then<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.870> keep<00:03:42.049> all<00:03:42.229> of<00:03:42.259> our<00:03:42.439> moisture<00:03:42.889> inside

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
then to keep all of our moisture inside

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.949 
then to keep all of our moisture inside
the<00:03:43.759> next<00:03:44.030> thing<00:03:44.120> we're<00:03:44.239> going<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.389> do<00:03:44.569> is<00:03:44.780> just

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
the next thing we're going to do is just

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.869 
the next thing we're going to do is just
cover<00:03:45.199> them<00:03:45.439> with<00:03:45.560> some<00:03:45.769> cedar<00:03:46.040> bark<00:03:46.370> you

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
cover them with some cedar bark you

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.039 
cover them with some cedar bark you
