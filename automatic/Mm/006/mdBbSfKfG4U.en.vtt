00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
a beaded baseball cap such as this first

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.490 
a beaded baseball cap such as this first
thing<00:00:08.970> as<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.179> did<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.889> loaded<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.960> looming<00:00:12.960> bead

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
thing as I did I loaded a looming bead

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.709 
thing as I did I loaded a looming bead
looming<00:00:13.889> paper<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.880> printed<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
looming paper and I printed that out and

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.189 
looming paper and I printed that out and
I<00:00:15.780> plotted<00:00:16.049> out<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:17.060> design<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.390> my<00:00:18.510> hat<00:00:18.750> this

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
I plotted out a design for my hat this

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.910 
I plotted out a design for my hat this
is<00:00:19.550> size<00:00:20.550> 13<00:00:21.119> beads<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.869> there's<00:00:22.109> 19<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.740> them

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
is size 13 beads and there's 19 of them

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.769 
is size 13 beads and there's 19 of them
from<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.400> end<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> design<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> other

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
from one end of the design to the other

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.320 
from one end of the design to the other
end<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> design<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:26.699> I'm<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
end of the design and then I'm going to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.599 
end of the design and then I'm going to
be<00:00:27.449> using<00:00:27.840> Nemo<00:00:28.380> thread<00:00:28.680> or<00:00:29.010> Nemo<00:00:29.310> thread

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
an upholstery needle but you can also

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.499 
an upholstery needle but you can also
use<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.560> heavier<00:01:25.860> sewing<00:01:26.280> needle<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
t-top on this because I can use that

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
t-top on this because I can use that
when<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> push<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.470> through<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> Hat<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.460> then

thread<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.960> melt<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:20.550> what<00:02:20.730> I'm

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
thread I can melt it and I'm what I'm

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.230 
thread I can melt it and I'm what I'm
doing<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.180> I'm<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:21.330> making<00:02:21.840> an<00:02:21.930> end<00:02:22.820> as<00:02:23.820> you

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
doing is I'm just making an end as you

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.760 
doing is I'm just making an end as you
can<00:02:24.360> see<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.720> does<00:02:24.870> catch<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.260> fire<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.650> be

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
can see that does catch on fire so be

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.550 
can see that does catch on fire so be
prepared<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.910> blow<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.270> out<00:02:27.330> let<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.410> cool

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
prepared to to blow that out let it cool

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.530 
prepared to to blow that out let it cool
for<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.860> second<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.400> then<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.270> double

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
for a second and then you can double

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.930 
for a second and then you can double
check<00:02:30.570> its<00:02:30.900> strength<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.040> way<00:02:32.250> when<00:02:32.550> I

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
check its strength but this way when I

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.550 
check its strength but this way when I
put<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:34.110> through<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.410> Hat<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.420> bring<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.600> you

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
know up to the edge it won't pull

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.350 
know up to the edge it won't pull
through<00:02:39.630> all<00:02:40.560> right<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.940> looks<00:02:41.970> very

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
through all right and it looks very

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.090
