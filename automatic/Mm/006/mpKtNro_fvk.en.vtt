00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
sandstone because you can't have just

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.400 
sandstone because you can't have just
like<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.959> portrayed<00:02:32.440> straight<00:02:32.829> over<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:35.140> on

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
door because you can't crack the window

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.710 
door because you can't crack the window
just<00:02:38.049> close<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.920> can't<00:02:39.160> place<00:02:39.310> them<00:02:39.459> down

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
just close it you can't place them down

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.259

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
reskin that to beat the cold of thing

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.259 
reskin that to beat the cold of thing
and<00:02:45.540> also<00:02:46.540> them<00:02:46.889> one<00:02:47.889> thing<00:02:48.069> which<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.579> mark

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
and also them one thing which is I mark

we<00:02:49.389> want<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.630> have<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.810> either<00:02:49.900> start<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.410> just

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
we want to have to either start and just

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.319 
we want to have to either start and just
rescaling<00:02:51.190> kind<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.609> showed<00:02:51.910> me<00:02:52.030> how<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.209> could

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
rescaling kind of showed me how I could

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.140 
rescaling kind of showed me how I could
do<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.540> while<00:02:53.319> them<00:02:53.530> basically<00:02:54.519> in<00:02:54.730> Hogwarts

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
do it while them basically in Hogwarts

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.640 
do it while them basically in Hogwarts
that<00:02:55.269> one<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.599> ways<00:02:55.660> its<00:02:55.930> describes<00:02:56.530> I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
that one of the ways its describes I

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.229 
that one of the ways its describes I
think<00:02:56.829> it's<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.040> first<00:02:57.250> book<00:02:57.489> but<00:02:58.180> it

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
think it's in the first book but it

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.849 
think it's in the first book but it
describes<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.720> there<00:02:58.900> there's<00:02:59.290> doors<00:02:59.590> which

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
describes that there there's doors which

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.059 
describes that there there's doors which
pretend<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.220> be<00:03:00.310> walls<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:01.920> there's<00:03:02.920> also
