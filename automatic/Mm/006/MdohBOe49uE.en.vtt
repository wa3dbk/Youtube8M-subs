00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.149
 Hello dear users 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.370
 youtube 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.610
 I want to tell this video how to make 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.580
 the simplest wrap from the album 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.080
 sheet for this you need such a huge 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.690
 sheet and all the usual huge sheet and all 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:28.880
 for this we first fold our 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:33.630
 album sheet in half so you 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.620
 simply enough it can everyone for 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.420
 decorations 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:46.379
 so it turned out like this and now 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.230
 add up the chance of it in half so well, you need to 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.430
 than measured fold corner corner pool 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.530
 all the better 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.100
 the principle will be qualitatively lacing times 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.940
 collapse and remain in position 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.080
 We turn the corner on the sheet to itself here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.299
 the devil is hiding 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:15.659
 when to yourself and at least someone erased on 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:23.659
 which we are exactly bending down 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.659
 line that's bending it over line 2 even 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.820
 so on we have half an hour so here 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:44.400
 it opens up and this 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.400
 side to bend spend 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:57.070
 also the angle of that side the angle you need here 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:01.420
 so look here it was possible to dive 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:10.649
 then the tab on the other hand is the opposite 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:10.649
 this corner crosswise changed 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:25.750
 it happened at such a pilot our all thanks 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:30.780
