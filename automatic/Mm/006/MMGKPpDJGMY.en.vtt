00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
feels so nice like I could just sit here

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.030 
feels so nice like I could just sit here
doing<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.150> day<00:02:12.209> like

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
doing this all day like

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.130 
doing this all day like
we're<00:02:13.849> not<00:02:13.970> gonna<00:02:14.090> do<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.540> so

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
we're not gonna do that so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.339 
we're not gonna do that so
unprofessional<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:17.720> feels<00:02:17.989> like<00:02:18.140> it'd<00:02:18.260> be

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
unprofessional it feels like it'd be

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.860 
unprofessional it feels like it'd be
really<00:02:18.470> light<00:02:18.739> coverage<00:02:19.099> though<00:02:19.629> all<00:02:20.629> right

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
really light coverage though all right

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.330 
really light coverage though all right
so<00:02:21.310> typically<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.790> would<00:02:23.030> use<00:02:23.299> a<00:02:23.540> sponge<00:02:24.290> for<00:02:24.920> my

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
so typically I would use a sponge for my

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.179 
so typically I would use a sponge for my
foundation<00:02:25.819> but<00:02:26.599> I<00:02:26.989> think<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> brush<00:02:27.920> is

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
foundation but I think that a brush is

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.410 
foundation but I think that a brush is
gonna<00:02:28.370> work<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.640> lot<00:02:28.760> better<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.209> I'm<00:02:29.269> going<00:02:29.390> to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
gonna work a lot better so I'm going to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.009 
gonna work a lot better so I'm going to
use<00:02:29.540> my<00:02:29.720> Sigma<00:02:30.760> Foundation<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.970> 60<00:02:32.480> brush<00:02:32.690> I'm
