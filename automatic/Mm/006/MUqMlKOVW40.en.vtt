 When you go to Egypt you can see the Sphinx and the pyramids 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.570
 It is their faith to prepare for the afterlife by making a luxurious tomb for a lifetime 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 Get 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.210
 But I could not overcome death .

 It is a Korean-Chinese church. 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.910
 Christianity is not important and ends with death 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.910
 Ah 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.850
 Jesus only died on the cross 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.850
 He has risen from the power of death . 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.170

 Jesus' grave was empty. 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:13.220
 The king's king is resurrected 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.220
 As the eagle flies toward the real ball, it has ascended to the world of God 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.170
 The resurrection gave birth to joy 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.970
 So the essence of the believer is to rejoice 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.899
 Christianity is religion in joy 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:36.770
 Even if I die I will be alive again. 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.770
 No two days to mourn the sad towards heaven and wants 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.100
 A believer can not do any hard work 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.100
 You can turn it into joy 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.340
 This is a Christian church and it is Jesus 5
