 invest in one is inverted that 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.939
 if this one inverted that if your country is 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.050
 an inverted t everything has become 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.180
 the inverted t and did not know that the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.290
 repercussion that was going to have this when 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.940
 I did it on the tango channel as 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.500
 I always say if you go to your glasses 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.610
 channel when we were doing minecraft 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.260
 parkour who has done also or we have 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.539
 what to do but we have time to stay 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.829
 and be able to do it because I put it before 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.910
 inverted to the characters and people 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.829
 He told me Perez has a problem with 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.420
 three and that's how it has come down to so 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.250
 limit that has now appeared in my 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.600
 maps and more and more and more the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.370
 people already have ideas in their heads 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.499
 that in fact they have done to me as you know 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.210
 outline that it is a country full of teas 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.339
 inverted everywhere but good 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.600
 no more let's read this here goes to 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.890
 be a short map because in fact already 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.649
 has already appeared I think in the end 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.150
 because I was carrying all these items here is 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.980

 football greeting for you thank you very much 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.409
 because in this map the rules 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.909
 have fun inventing a town that is 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.189
 allowed to be creative and if any error 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.729

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.039

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.799

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.630
 well been a touch a touch as it should 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.189
 to be apart you have taken the subject well 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.649
 to put the pink latte tip so that 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.780
 so that the theme of how to 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.090
 it falls to the ground its quota 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.000
 look at this piece of olea and we are 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.709
 look but how can I get through here is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.579
 This is not because maybe it does not enter 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:53.130
 back or the lady you get away from entering 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.619
 from the parkour inside a t 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.799
 inverted we look good mate 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.810
 because they load this not because no longer 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.270
 I could enter because he was good here 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.829
 near solar and the ally you can see the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.509
 entrance directly and was covered in 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.709
 the TV so how has this made me 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.679
 to fix the failures I had 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.989
 the poor one there is a collision a shock to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.459
 the head and I recommend yes yes 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.840
 that when in the maps that 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.269
 try to do 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.010
 a little check of what's inside 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.870
 not because sometimes there are country fools 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.220
 but we take it for granted but no points for 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.050
 beige the saints that is to say many 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.090
 sometimes shocks me better explain the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.519
 head up or the other day for example 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.959
 in the calculation between script antlers a 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.890
 nipple of these that I call him that 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.410
 it was like to another level not jobs like 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.360
 that was at another level than normal 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.500
 for you therefore therefore here for 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.180
 example I am shocked by this is easy but 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.970
 I was shocked and it was impossible 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.280
 well the head could not go up and because 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.680
 crashed like the body and it was impossible and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.290
 here I do not know right now I have to go 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.950
 where do I have to go because if I go back 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.950
 go back there 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.110
 Right now I'm lost 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.650
 I'm lost inside a TV does not know 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.120
 if here has come as 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.280
 or upload 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:18.040
 done right is right here I'm scratched at 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.849
 come back here and from here touch jump 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.370
 is that also here is this head and 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.480
 here this good man I think he has 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.800
 missing here a block to the web 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.060
 in fact 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.800
 here but 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.550
 I'm trying to fix this from a 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.599
 way I do not know how to put it if I put it 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.599
 I will not get there 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.450
 as you look we put this like this 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.970
 concept like that and here this I take it out and I 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.980
 the game there is also a lack of is 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.090
 here to go from here here and so be able 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.200
 complete the parkour what God commands 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:02.770
 this if not present here here 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.200
 it arrived is possible by god they reach us are 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.910
 many jumps many to the sad I think 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.050
 is at another level and that's why it will reach us 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.989
 a little bit because it's like ok if it's been 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.959
 reached this final we have reached the 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.130
 inverted look and we are someone by 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.989
 here 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.540
 congratulations my paper was short but 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.950
 I wait but wait a smile 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.480
 Of course, if this is not educational 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.490
 although there are you going to do with colate 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.490
 inverted let's watch TV 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.719
 is that if the malpensados ​​simply 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.719
 has a web smoothly I 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.680
 placed here there we are or the cobweb is 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:39.939
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.310
 the map although I have had a small 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.719
 mistake that now I hope you lose him 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.340
 the boy because many times work 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.259
 is this king blame bump that is, a 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.639
 barn that can jump from here when 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.590
 It's not the same, I 've also skipped something 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.090
 because I'm not perfect for fainting 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.889
 I'm quite like in these many things 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.210
 Sometimes I do not see the most obvious thing in the world 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.159
 We are past I like how he plays the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.479
 beach but if it's around here they gave me 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.400
 turns everywhere and better in one 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.319
 door that he had simply not touched 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.060
 because I had taken it for granted that 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.069
 it was out there and many times in itself 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.090
 it failed and it was horrible but good without 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.219
 more guys I hope you liked it 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.900
 this little calculation in a giant before 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:14.460
 that in six that we see a very advance 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.460
 big and until the next 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.890
 A) Yes
