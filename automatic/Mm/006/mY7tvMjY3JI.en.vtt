 Employees and 7 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.529
 are represented 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.699
 especially the boycott of the world 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.989
 and this is 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.289
 nothing is a ripper 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.390
 now is 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.710
 damn hard 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.039
 No, it's all pretty lame 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.510
 i'll eat it i'll make it 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.510
 now the form is and everything is Jades Vidic 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.299
 Years ago I can show you 18 in the IGS in Rothenstein 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.880
 I've got it ever since he got through g 8 to 11 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.890
 and I have spared in Ottenstein 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.310
 it is so difficult 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.110
 by chance to the telephone 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.570
 also see how its shape turns 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.780
 the leather looks different 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 Flückiger that one not 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.610
 APA 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.610
 zol should pay attention 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.840
 best and then only now it looks similar 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.690
 this lightning reaction 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.690
 hit the scene of the bomb 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.400
 12 cents lighter 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 I hope we can do that and a targeted and 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.670
 in the second part 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.670
 You can call him one of the most active 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.930
 century 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.930
 should it bring in the week measures 17 report 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.520
 I still remember 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.590
 initially it was 4 percent 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.620
 Arthur notices you 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.390

 pte 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.530
 and ladies 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.320
 They did not want to go back near the bomb

 Amerang set Dirk Petersen 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.560
 we have ourselves as industry and producers 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.510
 for another, they are active in things 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.380

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.259
 in the sights 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.479
 did not take advantage of such opportunities 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.729
 and also the second reactor 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.099
 as expected

 it borders 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:59.229
 he was going to break himself 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.029

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.359
 moves 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.569
 By the year, not least had to be so important 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.039
 obvious 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.949

 this work there 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.979

 Harry Prünster already the last part 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.749

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.740
 she is uncomfortable with these lines 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.580
 b also does not reject 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.090
 that does not succeed 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.240
 because he is very feminine 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.749
