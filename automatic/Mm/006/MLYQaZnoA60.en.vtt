can do in this map and I have gone

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.499 
can do in this map and I have gone
through<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.549> already<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
through this already this is not the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.670 
through this already this is not the
front<00:01:30.659> door<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.049> don't<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.290> where<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> front

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680

one<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> hangars<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.290> go<00:01:34.409> inside

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
one of the hangars to kind of go inside

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.179 
one of the hangars to kind of go inside
already

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
already

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.270 
already

this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.470> an<00:01:40.650> end<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:43.729> portal<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.880> end

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this is an end of the portal to the end

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.380 
this is an end of the portal to the end
whatever<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.689> called<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.110> whatever<00:01:47.070> anyway

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
whatever is called but whatever anyway

that minecart

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.790 
that minecart
fine<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.870> seal<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.170> there's<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.740> much

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800

you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.010> look<00:02:17.160> around<00:02:17.420> I'm<00:02:18.420> not<00:02:18.630> sure<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.960> is

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
you can look around I'm not sure this is

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.750 
you can look around I'm not sure this is
a<00:02:19.320> replica<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:21.020> exact<00:02:22.020> ship<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.340> room<00:02:23.610> by

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
a replica of the exact ship like room by

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.330 
a replica of the exact ship like room by
room<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.270> know<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:25.350> it's<00:02:25.620> exactly<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
room I know that it's exactly the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.330 
room I know that it's exactly the
replica<00:02:26.820> for<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.270> size<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> size<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.220> our

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
replica for the size so the size of our

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.000 
replica for the size so the size of our
Minecraft<00:02:29.760> character<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.840> size<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.680> halo

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
Minecraft character is a size the halo

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.890 
Minecraft character is a size the halo
character<00:02:32.460> would<00:02:32.610> be<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.570> makes<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
character would be so this makes the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.100 
character would be so this makes the
ship<00:02:33.960> a<00:02:34.880> replica<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.240> size<00:02:36.510> I'm<00:02:36.780> not<00:02:36.960> sure

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
ship a replica of the size I'm not sure

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.130 
ship a replica of the size I'm not sure
the<00:02:37.440> exact<00:02:37.830> items<00:02:38.490> like<00:02:38.820> these<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:40.020> he's

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
the exact items like these but he's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.840 
the exact items like these but he's
obviously<00:02:40.290> not<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.680> halo<00:02:41.340> but<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.640> know<00:02:41.760> what

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
obviously not in halo but you know what

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.090 
obviously not in halo but you know what
I<00:02:41.910> mean<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.570> there<00:02:42.870> tables<00:02:43.470> here<00:02:43.710> in<00:02:43.950> the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
I mean like is there tables here in the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.310 
I mean like is there tables here in the
halo<00:02:44.400> ship<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.880> don't<00:02:45.270> know<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.630> haven't

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
halo ship I don't know I haven't

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.750 
halo ship I don't know I haven't
actually<00:02:46.410> bothered<00:02:46.770> looking<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.190> myself<00:02:47.520> but

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
actually bothered looking for myself but

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.220 
actually bothered looking for myself but
you<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.450> obviously<00:02:48.660> tell<00:02:48.840> there's<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.140> much

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
you can obviously tell there's so much

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.050 
you can obviously tell there's so much
effort<00:02:49.590> was<00:02:49.650> put<00:02:49.740> into<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.160> okay<00:02:50.910> I'm<00:02:50.970> gonna

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
effort was put into this okay I'm gonna

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.350 
effort was put into this okay I'm gonna
go<00:02:51.210> inside<00:02:51.420> here<00:02:52.640> okay<00:02:53.640> let's<00:02:53.880> see<00:02:54.060> where<00:02:54.300> this

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
go inside here okay let's see where this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.900 
go inside here okay let's see where this
takes<00:02:54.540> us

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.280 

this<00:02:59.910> obviously<00:03:00.300> just<00:03:00.480> goes<00:03:00.600> on<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:01.080> and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
this obviously just goes on and on and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.560 
this obviously just goes on and on and
on<00:03:01.410> but<00:03:01.680> we'll<00:03:02.310> find<00:03:02.550> out<00:03:02.760> eventually<00:03:03.390> where

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
on but we'll find out eventually where

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.430 
on but we'll find out eventually where
it<00:03:03.660> takes<00:03:03.780> us<00:03:05.960> now<00:03:06.960> there<00:03:07.110> seems<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.350> be

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
it takes us now there seems to be

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.340 
it takes us now there seems to be
actually<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:07.980> beds<00:03:08.340> on<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.670> side<00:03:09.290> so<00:03:10.290> I'm

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
actually be beds on the side so I'm

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.040 
actually be beds on the side so I'm
guessing<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.350> where<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:15.300> soldiers<00:03:15.780> used

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
guessing this is where the soldiers used

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.310 
guessing this is where the soldiers used
to<00:03:16.140> sleep<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.380> have<00:03:16.590> no<00:03:16.860> idea<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:18.110> don't<00:03:19.110> know<00:03:19.170> how

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
to sleep I have no idea I don't know how

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.540 
to sleep I have no idea I don't know how
long<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.650> gonna<00:03:19.830> carry<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:20.250> for<00:03:20.460> the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
long this is gonna carry on for the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.630 
long this is gonna carry on for the
solicitors<00:03:21.950> let's<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.100> keep<00:03:23.220> guessing

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
solicitors let's just keep guessing

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.950 
solicitors let's just keep guessing
we're<00:03:23.790> gonna<00:03:23.940> take<00:03:24.180> us<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.600> then<00:03:24.690> eventually

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
we're gonna take us and then eventually

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.540 
we're gonna take us and then eventually
we'll<00:03:25.290> find<00:03:25.320> out<00:03:25.740> I<00:03:25.770> guess<00:03:25.950> come<00:03:26.370> on<00:03:28.280> wow<00:03:29.280> that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
we'll find out I guess come on wow that

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.840 
we'll find out I guess come on wow that
is<00:03:29.580> actually<00:03:30.060> huge<00:03:30.660> like<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.930> far<00:03:31.230> we've<00:03:31.410> gone

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
is actually huge like a far we've gone
