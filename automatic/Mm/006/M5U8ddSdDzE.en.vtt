slick vic revolution x show you a little

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.870 
slick vic revolution x show you a little
difference<00:00:14.009> between<00:00:14.099> what<00:00:14.429> we're<00:00:14.580> doing<00:00:14.820> and

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
difference between what we're doing and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.000 
difference between what we're doing and
what<00:00:15.000> everybody<00:00:15.240> else<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.509> doing<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.990> give<00:00:16.920> you

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
what everybody else is doing I give you

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.710 
what everybody else is doing I give you
an<00:00:17.070> example<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.730> thickness<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> tubing

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
an example the thickness of the tubing

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.099 
an example the thickness of the tubing
that<00:00:18.750> we're<00:00:18.990> using<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.789> our<00:00:20.939> tubing<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
that we're using this is our tubing is

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.990 
that we're using this is our tubing is
what<00:00:22.320> everybody<00:00:22.590> else<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.830> using<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.820> is

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
what everybody else is using this is

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.670 
what everybody else is using this is
quarter<00:00:24.420> inch<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.199> 3/8<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:27.410> get<00:00:28.410> down<00:00:28.560> here

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
quarter inch this is 3/8 I get down here

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.790 
quarter inch this is 3/8 I get down here
and<00:00:28.830> show<00:00:29.010> you

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.100 

it's<00:00:32.099> quite<00:00:32.310> a<00:00:32.340> bit<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.579> difference<00:00:32.880> there<00:00:33.110> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
it's quite a bit of difference there the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.750 
it's quite a bit of difference there the
units<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.650> super<00:00:34.980> strong<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.489> her<00:00:35.550> built

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
units are super strong when her built

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.530 
units are super strong when her built
this<00:00:35.910> way<00:00:36.090> there's<00:00:36.900> no<00:00:36.930> breaking<00:00:37.350> no<00:00:37.590> cracky

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
this way there's no breaking no cracky

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.520 
this way there's no breaking no cracky
nothing<00:00:39.540> really<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:39.960> wrong

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
nothing really to go wrong

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.840 
nothing really to go wrong
this<00:00:40.860> unit<00:00:41.160> particular<00:00:41.489> we're<00:00:41.640> building

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
this unit particular we're building

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.390 
this unit particular we're building
today<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.780> revolution<00:00:43.559> model<00:00:43.950> was

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
today is a revolution model was

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.720 
today is a revolution model was
introduced<00:00:44.790> in<00:00:44.940> 2001<00:00:45.980> we<00:00:46.980> built<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.400> prior

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
introduced in 2001 we built them prior

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
introduced in 2001 we built them prior
to<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.239> our<00:00:48.330> own<00:00:48.360> tow<00:00:48.660> trucks<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.290> we

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
to that for our own tow trucks but we

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.340 
to that for our own tow trucks but we
introduced<00:00:49.769> slick<00:00:50.100> back<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.460> 2001<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.840> give

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
introduced slick back in 2001 to give

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.009 
introduced slick back in 2001 to give
the<00:00:52.440> public<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:53.070> little<00:00:53.340> taste<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:54.019> what

depending<00:01:31.490> on<00:01:31.729> what<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:31.910> want<00:01:32.120> what<00:01:32.330> your

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
depending on what you want what your

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.330 
depending on what you want what your
application<00:01:32.870> is<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.680> just<00:01:33.830> tell<00:01:34.040> us<00:01:34.070> when<00:01:34.250> you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
application is you just tell us when you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.950 
application is you just tell us when you
order<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.940> makes<00:01:35.119> no<00:01:35.240> difference<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.630> us<00:01:35.750> we

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
order it it makes no difference to us we

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.320 
order it it makes no difference to us we
can<00:01:36.110> put<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.320> together<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.619> other<00:01:36.710> way<00:01:37.330> this

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
can put it together the other way this

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.140 
can put it together the other way this
is<00:01:38.479> just<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.690> little<00:01:38.840> idea<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.229> what<00:01:39.940> some<00:01:40.940> of

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
is just a little idea of what some of

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.730 
is just a little idea of what some of
the<00:01:41.270> stuff<00:01:41.420> is<00:01:41.570> constructed<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.320> wanted<00:01:42.680> to

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
the stuff is constructed I wanted to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.530 
the stuff is constructed I wanted to
show<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.070> actual<00:01:43.310> difference<00:01:43.729> in<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
show you the actual difference in the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.590 
show you the actual difference in the
tube<00:01:44.750> sizes<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.470> in<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.340> strength<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:47.509> know
