00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hi guys, in this class, I 'm just going 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.429
 present the evolution of the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.700
 vegetables in a very simple realm 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.900
 vegetable metaphorical kingdom the kingdom plant 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.210
 and include all plant groups 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.580
 found on the planet 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.650
 initially in the primitive ocean 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.840
 the green unicellular algae 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.689
 that occupied the environment became 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.720
 pluricellular and from there evolved 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.890
 the vegetable groups first structure 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.920
 that emerges in nature are the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.350
 Angel gametes that are rectangles are 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.020
 structures that form gametes 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.050
 gametes fertilize and originate sewage 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.170
 that embryos evolve when they appear 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.680
 embryos in the vegetable groups then 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.860
 Evolve the edges so people say 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.489
 to see bryophytes I have here one 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.829
 picture a biota close the musician is the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.769
 main representative of this phylum 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.350
 bryophytes so repair the vegetation 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.010
 greenish on the rocks a little plant 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:15.030
 which loves ambient humidity shaded 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.020
 humidity and is of very small size 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.430
 repair dimension here in ruler measure 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.500
 so small 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.970
 the first plant group occupies the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.090
 environment from the evolution of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.450
 bryophytes notice that plants begin 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.270
 to present sap conductive vessels 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.490
 which are sap conducting vessels are 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.710
 channels that conduct water 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.240
 minerals and chemicals 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.590
 necessary for the proper 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.829
 of the plant 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.100
 the sap conducting vessels represent 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.829
 or are similar to vessels better 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.810
 the blood of the animals leading 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.590
 substances to facilitate the evolution of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.969
 group 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.579
 then from the moment they arise 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.180
 conductive vessels small vegetables 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.420
 can grow more if they develop 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.700
 then the main pteridophytes 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.819
 representative of the pteridophytes is the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.660
 ferns and other ferns 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.300
 groups 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.130
 but here I have typical bay asthma that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.140
 everybody knows how the plant 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.550
 a few meters of 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.310
 The sheet length is not returning to 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.350
 from the pteridophytes that even in the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.170
 Jurassic period dominated the planet 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.740
 gigantic pteridophytes 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.400
 but today they are small measure 123 meters 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.400
 few meters with the evolution of these 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.370
 plant groups that did not have 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.300
 flowers then we call the cryptogram 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.640
 plants that do not produce flowers 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.630
 development leads to the development of 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.910
 seeds 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.640
 the seed a very important structure 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.150
 in plant evolution protects an embryo 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.120
 external environmental factors and 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.140
 has a nutritional reserve that, 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.310
 shape facilitates the evolution of this embryo 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.650
 with the development of seeds 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.860
 the third vegetable group 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.660
 called gymnosperms, people can 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.020
 view here in the image 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.260
 few minutes legs pine trees 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.490
 large sequoias pine trees and 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.060
 other good evolving seeds 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.880
 answers to the environment these plants 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.490
 evolved then came flowers 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.020
 which are reproductive organs 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.030
 and the development of the 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.209
 because it is very important in the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.330
 last group the most advanced degree of 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.950
 vegetable kingdom bears fruit 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.980
 protecting the seeds inside 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.280
 what would be the advantage of the reserve fruit 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.070
 of nutrient to feed the embryo and 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:00.060
 therefore this type of seed found 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.930
 inside the fruit it would take longer we go 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.150
 say so 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.130
 surviving environment if the conditions 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.640
 were not favorable 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.940
 then the angiosperms appear the word 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.310
 angiosperms means waiting for matos 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.150
 protected seed within a 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:22.919
 compartment an urn a box then 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:25.470
 Assange the legs of the whole system 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.050
 plant to flower and fruit 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.130
 you have here a fruit is recognized by 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.890
 all a mandarin and representing the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.810
 plant kingdom specifically the division 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:42.690
 angiosperms these flowering plants 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.020
 mainly gymnosperms and flowers 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.020
 typical colored angiosperms 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.780
 make up the group called phanerogams 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.280
 people were numbers means attachments and 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.020
 flowers are reproductive attachments 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.610
 many plants generate seeds 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.980
 the vast majority of plants generate 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.290
 seeds actually the Angel sperm 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.320
 group g the problem is the group that occupies 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.710
 95% of the total plants on the planet 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.640
 and they all have seeds, flowers and 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.670
 fruits 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.120
 therefore seedlings were 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:21.150
 spermatophores from the tapirs germinated here 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.590
 and plant hypermarcas seed then 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.340
 seeded plants 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.610
 we notice the following of pteridophytes 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.240
 to top pteridophytes gymnosperms joseph 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.400
 leg 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.900
 the plants have conductive vessels 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.490
 in powder 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.850
 then those with conductive vessels 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.630
 of illuminated sap of xylem and moema 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.810
 are known as track off tas or 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.090
 vascular plants and we noticed the 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.710
 next, the algae are here in a 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.810
 different coloring 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.140
 He opened the door, he likes me in the 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.919
 legs the system today make up the kingdom 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.770
 vegetable 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.050
 the algae are outside the plant kingdom 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.740
 for a more important reason than 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.110
 no embryos in the algae 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.930
 plants with developed embryos are 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.790
 engine of texas calls 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:16.320
 this way you have an overview 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:18.510
 of the vegetable kingdom until 2005 more or less 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.880
 algae were classified in the kingdom 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.280
 due to its anatomical structure 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.510
 very simple and absence of embryos 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.700
 compact 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.310
 algae are no longer classified as 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.460
 vegetables currently classified in the kingdom of 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.830
 protozoan conclusion then we have 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.820
 four bryophyte plant groups 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.820
 pteridophytes gymnosperms 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.860
 The legs, a hug, I'm forever and 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.860
 Until the next class
