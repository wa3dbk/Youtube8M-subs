00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
pressure plate they're blocking between

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.999 
pressure plate they're blocking between
them<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.479> clamp<00:01:45.689> lock<00:01:45.869> when<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
command block you want to type TP space

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.190 
command block you want to type TP space
at<00:01:50.719> like<00:01:51.719> the<00:01:51.929> hotmail<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:54.119> P<00:01:54.509> so
