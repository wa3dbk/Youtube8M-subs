think<00:03:43.340> there<00:03:43.519> are<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.669> few<00:03:43.729> tracks<00:03:44.209> here<00:03:44.510> that

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
think there are a few tracks here that

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.259 
think there are a few tracks here that
could<00:03:44.750> have<00:03:44.870> slipped<00:03:45.199> in<00:03:45.470> very<00:03:46.280> snugly<00:03:47.030> into

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
could have slipped in very snugly into

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.899 
could have slipped in very snugly into
the<00:03:48.199> codes<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.769> keys<00:03:48.979> tracklist

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
the codes and keys tracklist

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.360 
the codes and keys tracklist
without<00:03:50.299> really<00:03:50.479> ruining<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.049> flow<00:03:51.319> of<00:03:51.500> the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
without really ruining the flow of the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.020 
without really ruining the flow of the
album<00:03:52.819> songs<00:03:53.629> like<00:03:53.959> little<00:03:54.349> wanderer<00:03:54.799> or<00:03:55.069> dosa

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
album songs like little wanderer or dosa

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.000 
album songs like little wanderer or dosa
Beverly<00:03:56.419> Drive<00:03:56.569> there<00:03:57.169> are<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.349> few<00:03:57.560> tracks<00:03:57.829> on

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
Beverly Drive there are a few tracks on

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.469 
Beverly Drive there are a few tracks on
the<00:03:58.099> back<00:03:58.310> end<00:03:58.519> of<00:03:58.579> this<00:03:58.699> album<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.180> stand

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.869 
the back end of this album that stand
out<00:03:59.659> but<00:04:00.409> not<00:04:00.530> necessarily<00:04:00.919> for<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.639> best

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
reasons the song good help is hard to

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.580 
reasons the song good help is hard to
find<00:04:04.150> features<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.180> bit<00:04:05.540> of<00:04:05.629> a<00:04:05.689> danceable<00:04:06.290> beat

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
find features a bit of a danceable beat

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.390 
find features a bit of a danceable beat
but<00:04:07.159> the<00:04:07.549> very<00:04:08.120> prominent<00:04:08.780> peppy<00:04:09.709> drums<00:04:10.069> don't

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
but the very prominent peppy drums don't

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.909 
but the very prominent peppy drums don't
really<00:04:10.699> fit<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.389> slow-motion<00:04:12.079> guitars<00:04:12.620> and

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
really fit the slow-motion guitars and

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.770 
really fit the slow-motion guitars and
neither<00:04:13.009> do<00:04:13.310> they<00:04:13.459> compliment<00:04:14.030> Ben<00:04:14.540> Gibbard

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
neither do they compliment Ben Gibbard

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.499 
neither do they compliment Ben Gibbard
is<00:04:14.989> kind<00:04:15.199> of<00:04:15.340> even-tempered<00:04:16.340> vocal<00:04:17.000> delivery

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
is kind of even-tempered vocal delivery

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.719 
is kind of even-tempered vocal delivery
I<00:04:18.049> think<00:04:18.470> they<00:04:18.560> take<00:04:18.799> away<00:04:18.949> from<00:04:19.280> Ben<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.459> little

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
I think they take away from Ben a little

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.420 
I think they take away from Ben a little
bit<00:04:19.909> as<00:04:20.060> well<00:04:20.599> as<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.989> emotion<00:04:21.919> of<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.159> track

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
bit as well as the emotion of the track

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.540 
bit as well as the emotion of the track
which<00:04:22.700> feels<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:23.389> faint<00:04:23.840> already<00:04:24.770> a<00:04:25.010> lot<00:04:25.400> of

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
which feels so faint already a lot of

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.260 
which feels so faint already a lot of
the<00:04:25.610> time

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
the time

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.450 
the time
this<00:04:26.360> album<00:04:26.629> I<00:04:27.020> kind<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.560> feel<00:04:27.740> like<00:04:27.770> I<00:04:28.069> have

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
this album I kind of feel like I have

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.960 
this album I kind of feel like I have
this<00:04:28.639> old<00:04:29.259> crappy<00:04:30.259> radio<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.039> I<00:04:31.160> am<00:04:31.280> just<00:04:31.460> very

this old crappy radio and I am just very

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.749 
this old crappy radio and I am just very

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
emotions of this album and I can't tell

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.640 
emotions of this album and I can't tell
if<00:04:37.639> it's<00:04:38.090> because<00:04:38.240> my<00:04:38.479> receiver<00:04:38.870> is<00:04:39.050> bad<00:04:39.259> or<00:04:39.560> if

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
if it's because my receiver is bad or if

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.920 
if it's because my receiver is bad or if
the<00:04:39.860> signal<00:04:40.280> itself<00:04:40.639> is<00:04:40.940> kind<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.750> getting

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
the signal itself is kind of getting

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.570 
the signal itself is kind of getting
weak<00:04:42.139> that<00:04:42.530> is<00:04:42.770> pretty<00:04:42.979> much<00:04:43.099> how<00:04:43.159> I<00:04:43.310> filled

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
weak that is pretty much how I filled

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.100 
weak that is pretty much how I filled
out<00:04:43.699> this<00:04:43.849> record<00:04:44.210> I'm<00:04:44.300> pretty<00:04:44.509> indifferent

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
out this record I'm pretty indifferent

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.379 
out this record I'm pretty indifferent
toward<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.590> honestly<00:04:46.430> there<00:04:47.120> are<00:04:47.210> some

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
toward it honestly there are some

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.180 
toward it honestly there are some
highlights<00:04:47.720> here<00:04:48.169> but<00:04:48.650> it's<00:04:48.860> not<00:04:49.039> like

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
highlights here but it's not like

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.920 
highlights here but it's not like
they're<00:04:49.340> so<00:04:49.520> great<00:04:49.819> that<00:04:50.030> they're<00:04:50.180> gonna<00:04:50.270> have

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
they're so great that they're gonna have

they're so great that they're gonna have

me driving back to this album anytime

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.809 
me driving back to this album anytime
soon<00:04:53.990> these<00:04:54.349> songs<00:04:54.710> on<00:04:55.009> this<00:04:55.159> album<00:04:55.310> that<00:04:55.669> I<00:04:55.699> do

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
soon these songs on this album that I do

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.939 
soon these songs on this album that I do
like<00:04:56.240> I<00:04:56.690> wouldn't<00:04:57.349> say<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.470> like<00:04:57.680> them<00:04:57.860> because

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
like I wouldn't say I like them because

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.370 
like I wouldn't say I like them because
they're<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:59.000> know<00:04:59.030> particularly<00:04:59.599> special<00:05:00.289> or

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
they're you know particularly special or

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.480 
they're you know particularly special or
anything<00:05:00.470> like<00:05:00.860> that

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
anything like that

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.309 
anything like that
I<00:05:01.520> think<00:05:02.150> what<00:05:02.300> Death<00:05:02.479> Cab<00:05:02.720> does<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.229> the

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
I think what Death Cab does on the

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.800 
I think what Death Cab does on the
highlights<00:05:03.770> from<00:05:03.889> this<00:05:04.039> album<00:05:04.310> is<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.630> they

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
highlights from this album is that they

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.290 
highlights from this album is that they
merely<00:05:06.440> prove<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.550> they<00:05:07.669> can<00:05:07.819> still<00:05:08.060> go

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
merely prove that they can still go

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.120 
merely prove that they can still go
through<00:05:08.659> the<00:05:08.810> motions<00:05:09.229> of<00:05:09.349> making<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.860> decent

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
through the motions of making a decent

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.700 
through the motions of making a decent
Death<00:05:10.550> Cab<00:05:10.819> song<00:05:11.180> as<00:05:11.750> far<00:05:12.020> as<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.229> other<00:05:12.409> cuts

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
Death Cab song as far as the other cuts

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.420 
Death Cab song as far as the other cuts
on<00:05:12.919> here

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
on here

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.089 
on here
they're<00:05:13.940> either<00:05:14.419> incredibly<00:05:15.199> forgettable<00:05:15.830> or

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
they're either incredibly forgettable or

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.219 
they're either incredibly forgettable or
they<00:05:16.759> just<00:05:16.789> have<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.120> few<00:05:17.509> subtle<00:05:17.870> qualities

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
they just have a few subtle qualities

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.230 
they just have a few subtle qualities
that<00:05:18.740> just<00:05:19.009> kind<00:05:19.190> of<00:05:19.250> knock<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:19.969> sound

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
that just kind of knock the sound

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.959 
that just kind of knock the sound
quality<00:05:20.690> off<00:05:20.900> slightly<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.520> point<00:05:22.759> where

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
quality off slightly to the point where

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.249 
quality off slightly to the point where
I<00:05:23.210> don't<00:05:23.389> know<00:05:23.569> if<00:05:23.659> just<00:05:23.810> something<00:05:24.050> doesn't

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
I don't know if just something doesn't

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.800 
I don't know if just something doesn't
quite<00:05:24.800> feel<00:05:25.099> right<00:05:25.400> whether<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:25.759> be<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.180> huge

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
quite feel right whether it be the huge

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.290 
quite feel right whether it be the huge
booming<00:05:27.229> drums<00:05:27.530> on<00:05:27.740> Eldorado<00:05:28.219> or<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.789> out<00:05:29.120> of

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300
