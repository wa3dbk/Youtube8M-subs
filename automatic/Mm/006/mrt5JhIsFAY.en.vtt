00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.040
 fight dear friends with you like 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.230
 always artem tischenko in this lesson we are with you 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.970
 let's talk both of one such thing we will 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.930
 talk we are about operating 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.619
 system 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.619
 advanced day as usual 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.080
 im so you can this system 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.919
 put in as a second and operating 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.990
 systems and see yes and it goes 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.429
 directly to you or not coming 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.309
 how do you know the standard 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:30.599
 standard at the time 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.679
 which can be used 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.550
 operating systems without a year including this 30 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.540
 days 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.310
 which is given to us by the introductory 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.110
 translation that we have read all 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.990
 operating system features 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.510
 now on an example 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.570
 let's see how you can actually 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.790
 completely illegal 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.260
 and warm up 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.920
 use of the operating system 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.160
 not for 30 days but for 120 days 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.310
 including the same trick will work and 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.710
 Windows vista 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.970
 but Shakespeare did not check the novelties 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.380
 damn 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.860
 things but i think that maybe even there she is 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.500
 will work 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.470
 take that now i don't have any 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.500
 wallpaper 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 on the data test version which 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.300
 set 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.950
 m here at my bottom show up to 7 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.250
 assembly 7 6 acres and the following inscriptions 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 Your copy of $ 1 is genuine 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.860
 it means that at a given time 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.400
 did not exhaust 30 days 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.220
 for using the operating system 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.480
 if we now shock him on the properties of the new 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.210
 computer right click then 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.530
 properties 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 that we will see it now 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.770
 and here is the ruzhichka activation of windows and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.440
 it is written that you need to perform 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.190
 activation today 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.950
 and perform windows activation then if a man 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 clicked 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 then we can activate our 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.600
 operating system engine green 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.750
 key 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.120
 for example, we are not yet ready to make fresh 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.250
 key don't want to continue 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.660
 use the system further 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.510
 legally and completely free 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.759
 and this 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.680
 enraged of spring will lead 120 days 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.739
 what is he for 300 km 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.939
 this is a special team 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.439
 which we need to execute in command 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.889
 row 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.679
 there on the team will need to perform 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:20.539
 only when you have 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.259
 30 days over 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.719
 that is, and all of this in more detail show 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.719
 we have to go in the command to execute 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.000
 if you execute the command 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.520
 not displayed in the start menu call 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.629
 right click 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.759
 properties 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.399
 Aziz wrinkles start menu will take 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.239
 set up a button 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.099
 and then if you have important 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.689
 he will stand specifically tick 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.179
 opposite the command execute it here 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.449
 then you have a bosch command start menu 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.049
 done so here we press the data 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.469
 command to execute 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.469
 and we are typing here Russia time d 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.119
 although he 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:03.339
 probably for dessert we will not run 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:04.459
 in admin mode 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.019
 let's do it differently 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.049
 with you this you can do in 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.540
 operating systems green box 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.319
 experts in the system 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.059
 in this matter with you here we will dial in 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.789
 searching for sirens r 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.059
 three characters 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.639
 Here is the command line 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.269
 click the right mouse button 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.349
 and select the item left button already 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.870
 run as administrator 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.139
 got it right and right 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.169
 make agree click yes 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.709
 a team opens before us 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.729
 line 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.919
 that to us, respectively, but 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.569
 we need to drive here to produce 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:38.739
 here is perfect 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.739
 very much about any team 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.719
 this is how this command is written and here I am 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.319
 a little bit wrong 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.699
 that is, we will be with you team as a whole 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.279
 he 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:52.919
 then struck 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.859
 then yesterday is usually standard 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.729
 which is located 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:59.879
 on the numeric keypad and command 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:00.680
 I have adm 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.589
 fire prime tass 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.439
 after that, before us is displayed such 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.069
 run window command successful 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.289
 complete reboot 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:08.779
 computer to make changes come into 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:11.739
 force we begin science 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.589
 and when we will need when we 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:15.559
 want we reboot our 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:16.789
 cars with you 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.969
 the fifth is required to do several times 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.659
 to change save 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.509
 the point is that after this command 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.999
 I have now of course not rebooted 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.969
 when you go into properties 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.639
 my computer 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.169
 you will have a lot here process field 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.330
 activation 1 usd 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.169
 she will be shown here now 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.789
 state unavailable 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.800
 and after rebooting, it will show me 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.180
 what a bonus 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.100
 accordingly using the system 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.749
 also 30 days 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:47.309
 then the counter is reset 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.150
 you can reset it for a limited time 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.150
 more precisely a limited number of times 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.300
 next time i need calculating 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.710
 run it does not mean that to me now 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.430
 need example four times that score 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.439
 run 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.979
 i.e. execute this command three times 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.979
 In general, on the very same creators 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.580
 then I have the opposite, respectively, all 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.259
 these mine attempts will come down 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.430
 kg 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.430
 I can not use the village 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.059
 more days list 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:18.819
 we will never have exactly 30 days a mouse but 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.559
 we use this command in the very 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:21.749
 center arm 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.300
 and the system is still working 30 days 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.809
 after 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.299
 passes another three activation price we are all 

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:29.429
 see respectively through 

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:30.849
 we are computer properties 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.800
 you run the command line again 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.469
 through with exactly admin rights 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.539
 run the command again with anji 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:38.470
 Armenians 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.469
 and use 3 pigs again 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:41.909
 so can use the system 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.979
 completely free and at the legal level 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.710
 in 120 days 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.410
 i.e. it turns out four 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.279
 about the month 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.979
 Here on this I finished this rock 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.520
 so we can now 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.949
 quite familiar with the system for four 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.930
 months to decide whether you need it or not and 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.790
 get completely legal 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.860
 trench in the near as you shop 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.080
 I'm on this rock
