00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.739
 for the I can of vpc ravaglioli it is necessary to follow specifics 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.589
 indications that take into consideration the particularities of 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.199
 this material 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.919
 the materials supplied by raisins are 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.400
 the staves on the floor in vpc ravaioli 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.349
 in three different colors 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.439
 habana coral building 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.040
 the magatello limbo pc ravaioli 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.870
 the team on brown or gray PCs to be chosen based on the color of the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.900
 floor 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.470
 the finishing frame offered in the same colors as the floor 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.070
 the slats the colors and the finishing frame are all optional elements 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.960
 the beginning cult depends on the type of ponsacco from the practical needs and 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.430
 customer aesthetics 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 the double ravaioli can be installed both with visible screws and with whom 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.060
 the latter are of the same material as the floor 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.750
 on cement ground obligatory to re-use in magatelli in vpc 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.690
 Ravaioli 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.740
 these must be fixed to the ground with the appropriate vitesse te, 5% millimeters 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.260
 supplied by ravaioli 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.160
 the screw must be fixed after garbage 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.060
 in the case of laying on other types of soil it is possible to use magatelli the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.710
 wood 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.260
 aluminum galvanized sheet following the same procedure as the king il 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.700
 solid wood 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.260
 the interaxis spacing should not exceed 40 centimeters and be 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.200
 perpendicular to the women of the floor 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.860
 where there will be the meeting of the ends of the slats is necessary 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.990
 provide for doubling of the joist respecting a minimum lateral distance 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.760
 6 mm 6 2 slats 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.900
 a distance of 15 millimeters instead you have to be left at the meeting 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.330
 of the 3 '2 slats ends 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
 let's see now the laying of the floor slats 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.790
 the first dowry abba fixed with the ms glue orientedly tasks 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.970
 for the subsequent possible placement of the finishing frame and necessary 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.160
 provide a projection of the rods of at least 25 millimeters 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.599
 the pose can come with two dense for each slat 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.319
 to avoid crushing the clip which would prevent you from inserting yours 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.419
 a subsequent one is necessary to use a thickness that must then be removed once 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.419
 applied the gem 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.450
 or with two TTs taking care of making garbage transports 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.229
 as for the backing, the solid wood laying with screws guarantees stability 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.229
 no doubt better 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.799
 the lateral distance of the planks must be 6 millimeters 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:51.359
 if the laying carried out with clip the leak is determined by the clicks itself 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.019
 if carried out with screws it is necessary to use a non-distancing spacer also 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.019
 Head distance between the planks should be 6 millimeters 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:04.489
 for aesthetic appeal it is advisable to smooth the end of 45 degrees 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.099
 every woman 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.109
 the peripheral expansion of the floor varies according to the total length 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.969
 of the flooring according to the table that can be found in the installation manual 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.819
 ravaioli backing 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.029
 for example if a pavement a total length of 6 meters must 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.799
 be left 18 millimeters apart between the ends of the planks 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.339
 peripheral the perimeter that delimits the pavement itself 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.249
 to cover the alveoli of the slats that appear in the perimeter of the 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:37.919
 flooring it is possible to use the perimeter frame in vpc ravaioli 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:42.659
 pass a string of glue dipped inside the frame of the frame 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.209
 and finally enter 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.409
 the frame on the end of the plank leaving it to dry 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.279
 the paving now completed 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:56.009
 the vpc ravaioli unlike the solid wood daikin does not need 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.010
 maintenance apart from regular cleaning with a brush and bleach 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.940
 diluted 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.940
 in dirt that can accumulate outside 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:09.760
 in the case of more resistant stains fat ketchup wine or similar 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.790
 it is advisable to use two parts of bleach diluted in three parts of water 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.900
 leave it to work for 15-20 minutes, then wash with plenty of water 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.609
 thanks for your attention, it's a good thing 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:24.860
 hair 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.860
 you
