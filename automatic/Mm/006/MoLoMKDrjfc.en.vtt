00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.540
 I am an atheist 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.349
 Some people believe so 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.750
 I'm really free to choose if I have as many options as possible 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.019
 then I am free 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.999
 because the Maillot jaune it works only if I have many options off and on 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.499
 I can choose between different drugs by option then I am 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:23.640
 free 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.160
 many people will only contradict that I would guess 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.189
 especially persons of female gender 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.829
 like all this situation as they stand by the closet and themselves 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.990
 to ask the tragic question 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.100
 What should I wear? 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.320
 what should I wear 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.970
 if I have several options but this will not be easier but 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.280
 sometimes more difficult 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.730
 with us, if so maybe 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.770
 they stand in front of the goal shelves or flipping through the iTunes library 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.820
 the more possibilities we have not afforded ourselves can choose what 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.720
 This is not necessarily keeping you free to do many things 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.040
 I know people who break themselves with the question of what I do not do 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.090
 what should I 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.160
 May be what profession what should I study yet 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.690
 or with which people should I not give up the sun partner of his partner 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.580
 Some people go crazy with the question if they have no idea 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.580
 what she should choose 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.200
 Freedom does not just mean that you have many options but freedom 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.600
 Quite often it also means that I am a feint of these four possibilities 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.660
 the case 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.420
 This is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420
 "I married about two years ago 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.900
 and I'm very happy to have decided to go with this woman 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.580
 statistically speaking, I do not have the moment where I am at the same time 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.990
 I got married 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 about three billion other women decided 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.710
 I liked that because I said he wanted this one 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.640
 the one antenna 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 I believe that it is the same with Jesus when you choose this one 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.950
 you also decide pretty much differently 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.980
 but one chooses the best option of a 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.220
 and the moment you realize but that's it with Jesus I want from now on 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.910
 Life 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.880
 until everything else not so spahn 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.870
 This once said when I set you free 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.309
 then you are really free 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:09.269
 thanks for coming
