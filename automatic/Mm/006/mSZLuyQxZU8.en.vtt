00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
when they've just been released and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.570 
when they've just been released and

they're like window upgrades is like

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
really really high in a minute so it's

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.979 
really really high in a minute so it's
pointless<00:00:42.339> doing<00:00:42.790> them<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.089> like<00:00:43.449> a<00:00:43.600> month<00:00:43.839> in

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
pointless doing them it like a month in

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.299 
pointless doing them it like a month in
advance<00:00:44.140> or<00:00:44.559> whatever<00:00:44.799> because<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.159> height

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
advance or whatever because the height

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.619 
advance or whatever because the height
would<00:00:45.460> have<00:00:45.610> died<00:00:45.760> down<00:00:45.970> you<00:00:46.210> guys<00:00:46.420> aren't

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
would have died down you guys aren't

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.390 
would have died down you guys aren't
going<00:00:46.750> to<00:00:46.839> be<00:00:46.930> as<00:00:46.960> interested<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.799> what<00:00:48.280> the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
going to be as interested and what the

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.270 
going to be as interested and what the
hell<00:00:48.519> is<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.729> point<00:00:48.879> so<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.710> do<00:00:50.860> that<00:00:50.890> I've

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
hell is the point so to do that I've

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.210 
hell is the point so to do that I've
decided<00:00:51.640> to<00:00:51.940> do<00:00:52.059> a<00:00:52.330> double<00:00:52.690> one<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.260> I<00:00:53.890> thought

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
decided to do a double one and I thought

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.670 
decided to do a double one and I thought
why<00:00:54.670> not<00:00:54.699> do<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.089> with<00:00:55.360> benteke<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.199> sturridge

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680

anything<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.690> an<00:03:21.959> increased<00:03:22.500> even

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
anything that is an increased even

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.920 
anything that is an increased even
though<00:03:22.950> he's<00:03:23.070> went<00:03:23.250> up<00:03:23.340> by<00:03:23.489> two<00:03:23.600> overall<00:03:24.600> stats

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
though he's went up by two overall stats

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.900 
though he's went up by two overall stats
which<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.380> kind<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.769> ridiculous<00:03:25.950> if<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.730> think

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
which is kind of ridiculous if you think

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.580 
which is kind of ridiculous if you think
about<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.750> yeah<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.110> move<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.500> to

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
about it so yeah I move on to

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.890 
about it so yeah I move on to
Sturridge's<00:03:29.100> now<00:03:29.280> right<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.330> now<00:03:30.750> I'm

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
Sturridge's now right so now I'm

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.880 
Sturridge's now right so now I'm
comparing<00:03:31.290> Sturridge's<00:03:31.890> 80<00:03:32.190> with<00:03:32.610> his<00:03:32.730> 82<00:03:33.239> so

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
comparing Sturridge's 80 with his 82 so

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.140 
comparing Sturridge's 80 with his 82 so
again<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.160> doesn't<00:03:35.370> look<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.730> be<00:03:35.880> too<00:03:35.910> much

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
again it doesn't look to be too much

into the net they're both acrobatically
which<00:06:01.840> I<00:06:01.990> was<00:06:02.110> really<00:06:02.410> really<00:06:02.500> surprised<00:06:03.040> at

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
which I was really really surprised at

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.659 
which I was really really surprised at
like<00:06:04.419> they<00:06:04.630> just<00:06:05.140> work<00:06:05.560> so<00:06:06.010> well<00:06:06.250> it's<00:06:06.520> hard

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
like they just work so well it's hard

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.550 
like they just work so well it's hard
anything<00:06:07.000> they<00:06:07.240> can't<00:06:07.480> do<00:06:07.660> that<00:06:07.690> finisher<00:06:08.380> to

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
anything they can't do that finisher to

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.030 
anything they can't do that finisher to
agree<00:06:08.890> then<00:06:10.080> when<00:06:11.080> you<00:06:11.140> call<00:06:11.320> it<00:06:11.440> normal<00:06:11.770> shots

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
agree then when you call it normal shots

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.940 
agree then when you call it normal shots
of<00:06:12.250> brilliant<00:06:12.789> I<00:06:13.020> mean<00:06:14.020> if<00:06:14.200> you<00:06:14.380> have<00:06:14.590> got<00:06:14.830> the

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
of brilliant I mean if you have got the

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.980 
of brilliant I mean if you have got the
coins<00:06:15.220> I'd<00:06:15.580> go<00:06:15.910> out<00:06:16.000> and<00:06:16.180> buy<00:06:16.300> their<00:06:16.510> upgraded

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
coins I'd go out and buy their upgraded

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.600 
coins I'd go out and buy their upgraded
ones<00:06:17.169> i<00:06:17.289> don't<00:06:17.620> know<00:06:17.710> if<00:06:17.770> it's<00:06:17.919> just<00:06:18.160> me

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
ones i don't know if it's just me

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.059 
ones i don't know if it's just me
I do<00:06:18.789> feel<00:06:19.210> a<00:06:19.240> difference<00:06:19.810> and<00:06:20.020> that<00:06:20.050> might<00:06:20.949> be

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
I do feel a difference and that might be

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.670 
I do feel a difference and that might be
idiotic<00:06:21.550> with<00:06:22.060> like<00:06:22.569> the<00:06:22.810> low<00:06:23.229> amount<00:06:23.560> of

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
idiotic with like the low amount of

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.529 
idiotic with like the low amount of
staff<00:06:23.979> increases<00:06:24.639> that<00:06:24.759> have<00:06:24.909> happened<00:06:25.240> but

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
staff increases that have happened but

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.230 
staff increases that have happened but
for<00:06:26.409> me<00:06:26.560> they<00:06:27.189> just<00:06:27.219> felt<00:06:27.669> so<00:06:27.939> much<00:06:28.180> better

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
for me they just felt so much better

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.350 
for me they just felt so much better
like<00:06:29.169> their<00:06:29.949> normal<00:06:30.250> ones<00:06:30.520> are<00:06:30.729> overpowered

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
like their normal ones are overpowered

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.670 
like their normal ones are overpowered
like<00:06:31.509> for<00:06:31.689> most<00:06:31.780> people<00:06:32.169> so<00:06:32.379> if<00:06:32.469> you<00:06:32.560> don't

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
like for most people so if you don't

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.200 
like for most people so if you don't
have<00:06:32.860> the<00:06:32.979> coins<00:06:33.189> then<00:06:33.400> just<00:06:33.639> buy<00:06:33.759> the<00:06:33.819> normal

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
have the coins then just buy the normal

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.559 
have the coins then just buy the normal
ones<00:06:34.389> but<00:06:34.960> I<00:06:35.289> just<00:06:36.009> love<00:06:36.610> these<00:06:36.819> laughs<00:06:37.210> I've

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569 
ones but I just love these laughs I've

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.240 
ones but I just love these laughs I've
played<00:06:38.080> with<00:06:38.259> a<00:06:38.319> couple<00:06:38.650> of<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.860> January

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
played with a couple of the January

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.179 
played with a couple of the January
upgrades<00:06:39.639> now<00:06:39.879> and<00:06:40.270> most<00:06:40.719> of<00:06:40.990> them<00:06:41.080> do<00:06:41.379> seem<00:06:42.159> to

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.189 
upgrades now and most of them do seem to

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:44.520 
upgrades now and most of them do seem to
like<00:06:43.060> feel<00:06:43.539> a<00:06:43.599> little<00:06:43.840> bit<00:06:44.020> different<00:06:44.439> a

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
like feel a little bit different a

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
little bit better just that little bit

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.399 
little bit better just that little bit
more<00:06:46.509> pinnacle<00:06:47.439> if<00:06:47.680> they're<00:06:47.889> a<00:06:47.919> striker<00:06:48.310> and

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
more pinnacle if they're a striker and

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.809 
more pinnacle if they're a striker and
mostly<00:06:50.409> the<00:06:50.979> upgrades<00:06:51.340> have<00:06:51.430> been<00:06:51.490> done<00:06:51.789> on

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
mostly the upgrades have been done on

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.519 
mostly the upgrades have been done on
like<00:06:52.090> over<00:06:52.270> power<00:06:52.599> players<00:06:52.900> like<00:06:53.080> sturgeon

benteke<00:06:53.949> have<00:06:54.189> always<00:06:54.460> been<00:06:54.580> known<00:06:54.879> for<00:06:55.120> being

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
benteke have always been known for being

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:58.499 
benteke have always been known for being
sweaty<00:06:56.159> overpowered<00:06:57.159> by<00:06:57.189> as<00:06:57.370> I<00:06:57.550> say<00:06:57.759> I<00:06:57.969> feel<00:06:58.479> a

00:06:58.499 --> 00:06:58.509 
sweaty overpowered by as I say I feel a

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.330 
sweaty overpowered by as I say I feel a
big<00:06:58.750> difference<00:06:59.169> particularly<00:06:59.800> in<00:07:00.189> the

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
big difference particularly in the

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.209 
big difference particularly in the
shooting<00:07:00.849> and<00:07:01.500> like<00:07:02.500> the<00:07:02.620> shooting<00:07:02.949> for<00:07:03.129> the

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:03.219 
shooting and like the shooting for the

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:05.640 
shooting and like the shooting for the
normal<00:07:03.490> ones<00:07:03.699> was<00:07:04.029> okay<00:07:04.629> but<00:07:04.960> it<00:07:05.199> was<00:07:05.439> merely

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
normal ones was okay but it was merely

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.170 
normal ones was okay but it was merely
headers<00:07:06.129> that<00:07:06.159> they<00:07:06.520> were<00:07:06.639> really<00:07:06.789> good<00:07:06.939> at

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
headers that they were really good at

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.779 
headers that they were really good at
but<00:07:07.389> now<00:07:07.419> their<00:07:08.259> shots<00:07:08.620> are<00:07:08.860> really<00:07:08.889> video<00:07:09.490> p

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789 
but now their shots are really video p

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:12.089 
but now their shots are really video p
their<00:07:10.150> finesses<00:07:10.779> in<00:07:10.990> particular<00:07:11.409> have

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:12.099 
their finesses in particular have

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.860 
their finesses in particular have
improved<00:07:12.520> in<00:07:12.669> my<00:07:12.849> opinion<00:07:13.150> like<00:07:13.449> you'll<00:07:13.659> see<00:07:13.840> a

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
improved in my opinion like you'll see a

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.080 
improved in my opinion like you'll see a
few<00:07:14.229> finesse<00:07:14.680> calls<00:07:14.949> from<00:07:15.129> both<00:07:15.310> of<00:07:15.340> them<00:07:15.729> here

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
few finesse calls from both of them here

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.740 
few finesse calls from both of them here
so<00:07:16.240> i<00:07:16.870> would<00:07:17.349> give<00:07:17.529> storage<00:07:18.009> probably<00:07:18.879> a<00:07:18.939> 9.5

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750 
so i would give storage probably a 9.5

so i would give storage probably a 9.5
and<00:07:20.080> benteke<00:07:20.439> probably<00:07:20.979> a<00:07:21.180> 9.6<00:07:22.180> a<00:07:22.509> slightly

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:23.409 
and benteke probably a 9.6 a slightly

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.950 
and benteke probably a 9.6 a slightly
better<00:07:23.710> just<00:07:24.520> because<00:07:25.150> i<00:07:25.569> don't<00:07:25.870> know

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
better just because i don't know

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.110 
better just because i don't know

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
probably as height and his strength lake

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.519
