to opening it by punching down so we set

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.670 
to opening it by punching down so we set
the<00:02:14.330> middle<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:14.780> keep<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> speed<00:02:15.410> with

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
with spiraling out to the edge so just

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.110 
with spiraling out to the edge so just
gradually<00:02:35.320> get<00:02:36.320> bigger<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.799> bigger<00:02:37.120> as
