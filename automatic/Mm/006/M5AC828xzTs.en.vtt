my nuclear it will just fall right on by
itself<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.780> yeah<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.990> counterweights<00:01:31.500> do

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
itself and yeah the counterweights do

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.140 
itself and yeah the counterweights do
work<00:01:31.890> correctly<00:01:32.430> for<00:01:33.049> me<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.229> my<00:01:34.350> question<00:01:34.799> is
