00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
think it's the best sounding the ID

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.570 
think it's the best sounding the ID
sound<00:02:27.460> of<00:02:27.670> her<00:02:27.820> ever<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:29.280> yeah<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.340> could

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
sound of her ever and yeah you could

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.890 
sound of her ever and yeah you could
probably<00:02:30.760> get<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> better<00:02:31.180> guitar<00:02:31.300> sound<00:02:31.780> in

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900

probably get a better guitar sound in
the<00:02:31.990> studio<00:02:32.380> with<00:02:32.650> lots<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.730> lots<00:02:34.240> of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
the studio with lots of lots of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.320 
the studio with lots of lots of
expensive<00:02:34.840> mics<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.440> amps<00:02:35.770> up<00:02:35.950> but<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.490> don't

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
expensive mics and amps up but I don't

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.760 
expensive mics and amps up but I don't
think<00:02:37.570> for<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.960> money<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.290> can't<00:02:38.530> beat<00:02:38.740> that

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
think for the money you can't beat that

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.470 
think for the money you can't beat that
I<00:02:38.980> think<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.630> card<00:02:40.870> use<00:02:41.080> in<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.290> studio
