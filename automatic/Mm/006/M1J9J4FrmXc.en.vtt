distance<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.809> teleport<00:00:40.079> all<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:41.010> oil

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
distance I have to teleport all my oil

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.610 
distance I have to teleport all my oil
from<00:00:41.610> however<00:00:42.390> there<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.840> important

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
from however there is one important

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.029 
from however there is one important
thing<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.950> note<00:00:44.989> let<00:00:45.989> me<00:00:46.110> get<00:00:46.260> someone<00:00:46.559> fired

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
thing to note let me get someone fired

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.250 
thing to note let me get someone fired
here<00:00:47.640> there<00:00:48.090> are<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.660> different<00:00:48.930> types<00:00:49.079> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
here there are two different types of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
here there are two different types of
pipe<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.760> throw<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.969> guy<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
pipe for this so if I throw this guy in

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.799 
pipe for this so if I throw this guy in
here<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.170> an<00:00:55.289> oil<00:00:55.530> teleportation<00:00:56.460> pipe

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
here this is an oil teleportation pipe

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.410 
here this is an oil teleportation pipe
basically<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.890> does<00:00:59.640> exactly<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> way<00:01:00.329> it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
basically it does exactly the way it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.189 
basically it does exactly the way it
sounds<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.620> functions<00:01:02.190> only<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.449> oil<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.049> if

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
sounds it functions only on oil so if

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899 
sounds it functions only on oil so if
you<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> transfer<00:01:04.890> normal<00:01:05.339> items<00:01:05.670> you'd

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you want to transfer normal items you'd

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.789 
you want to transfer normal items you'd
build<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.210> regular<00:01:06.600> teleport<00:01:07.049> pipe<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
build a regular teleport pipe and if you

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.440 
build a regular teleport pipe and if you
want<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> transfer<00:01:08.369> oil<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.909> build<00:01:09.119> an<00:01:09.240> oil

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
want to transfer oil you build an oil

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.140 
want to transfer oil you build an oil
teleport<00:01:10.110> pipe<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> say<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.030> grab

I'm going to go with frequency one just

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.250 
I'm going to go with frequency one just
like<00:02:28.220> redstone<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.060> want<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.540> know<00:02:29.690> anything

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
like redstone you want you know anything

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.390 
like redstone you want you know anything
that<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.440> want<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.769> be<00:02:30.920> connected

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.620 
that you want to be connected
quote-on-quote<00:02:31.760> should<00:02:32.269> have<00:02:32.359> the<00:02:32.480> same

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
quote-on-quote should have the same

frequency and the number of connected
pipes<00:02:34.819> I'm<00:02:35.030> guessing<00:02:35.329> that<00:02:35.419> will<00:02:35.569> increase

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
pipes I'm guessing that will increase

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.420 
pipes I'm guessing that will increase
once<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.349> go<00:02:36.500> set<00:02:36.739> up<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.919> connected<00:02:37.280> pipe

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
once I go set up a connected pipe

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.460 
once I go set up a connected pipe
elsewhere<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.510> let's<00:02:38.720> run<00:02:38.900> over<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.260> our<00:02:39.349> oil

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
elsewhere so let's run over to our oil

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.620 
elsewhere so let's run over to our oil
spawn<00:02:39.889> and<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.280> will<00:02:40.459> start<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.849> video<00:02:40.910> up<00:02:41.090> once

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
distance rah found my oil spawn so how

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.210 
distance rah found my oil spawn so how
do<00:02:50.269> we<00:02:50.329> want<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.660> get<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.139> guy<00:02:51.319> going<00:02:51.349> well<00:02:52.010> I

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
my teleport pipe what do you say I'll

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.509 
my teleport pipe what do you say I'll
clean<00:02:57.019> this<00:02:57.139> all<00:02:57.349> up<00:02:57.380> later<00:02:58.930> or<00:02:59.930> now-ish<00:03:00.519> I'll

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.440 
clean this all up later or now-ish I'll
get<00:03:01.639> the<00:03:01.730> rest<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.120> bit

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
get the rest of a bit

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.180 
get the rest of a bit
that's<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.989> piping<00:03:03.380> remember<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:03.739> showed<00:03:04.010> you

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
that's the piping remember I showed you

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.240 
that's the piping remember I showed you
and<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.430> think<00:03:04.639> it<00:03:04.730> was<00:03:04.849> episode<00:03:05.269> 30<00:03:05.780> ish<00:03:05.870> I

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
and I think it was episode 30 ish I

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.589 
and I think it was episode 30 ish I
started<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.370> do<00:03:07.519> this<00:03:07.669> piping<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.269> said<00:03:08.419> well

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
started to do this piping and said well

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:09.940 
started to do this piping and said well
this<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.900> going<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.109> take<00:03:09.230> forever<00:03:09.380> I'll<00:03:09.709> do<00:03:09.829> it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
this is going to take forever I'll do it

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.589 
this is going to take forever I'll do it
later<00:03:10.069> okay<00:03:10.639> I<00:03:10.819> don't<00:03:11.000> have<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.209> do<00:03:11.329> it<00:03:11.359> anymore

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
later okay I don't have to do it anymore

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.949 
later okay I don't have to do it anymore
I've<00:03:11.870> got<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.019> teleport<00:03:12.500> pipe

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
receive is false and I'll set it to plus

one<00:03:36.889> you<00:03:37.100> can<00:03:37.250> see<00:03:37.400> there's<00:03:37.579> one<00:03:37.639> connected

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
one you can see there's one connected

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.080 
one you can see there's one connected
pipe<00:03:38.419> that<00:03:38.959> sounds<00:03:39.320> cool<00:03:39.729> I'm<00:03:40.729> getting

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
pipe that sounds cool I'm getting

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.370 
pipe that sounds cool I'm getting
excited<00:03:42.489> so<00:03:43.489> let's<00:03:44.150> set<00:03:44.419> up<00:03:44.449> a<00:03:44.690> teleporter

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
excited so let's set up a teleporter

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.939 
excited so let's set up a teleporter
real<00:03:45.560> quick<00:03:46.180> right<00:03:47.180> here<00:03:47.239> should<00:03:47.630> be<00:03:47.750> good<00:03:47.949> now

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
real quick right here should be good now

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.580 
real quick right here should be good now
as<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.400> recall<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:49.729> have<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.150> switch<00:03:50.690> right<00:03:51.169> here

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
as you recall I have a switch right here

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.830 
as you recall I have a switch right here
that<00:03:52.039> will<00:03:52.190> send<00:03:52.430> stuff<00:03:52.699> through<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.479> if<00:03:53.690> this

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
that will send stuff through and if this

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.930 
that will send stuff through and if this
works<00:03:54.169> I<00:03:54.500> should<00:03:54.769> find<00:03:55.039> that<00:03:55.160> by<00:03:55.400> flipping<00:03:55.639> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
works I should find that by flipping the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.379 
works I should find that by flipping the
switch<00:03:57.759> oil<00:03:58.759> is<00:03:58.820> going<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.000> be<00:03:59.120> sent<00:03:59.329> through

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
switch oil is going to be sent through

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.370 
switch oil is going to be sent through

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
featuring these pipes because I want to

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.839 
featuring these pipes because I want to
be<00:05:00.990> able<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.289> let<00:05:01.830> people<00:05:01.860> see<00:05:02.280> them<00:05:02.460> because<00:05:02.759> I

think this is such a cool addition to

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.870 
think this is such a cool addition to
build<00:05:04.500> graph<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:05.009> I<00:05:05.070> want<00:05:05.370> it<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.550> be<00:05:05.729> well

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
build graph that I want it to be well

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.260 
build graph that I want it to be well
known<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.360> get<00:05:07.139> it<00:05:07.229> out<00:05:07.349> there<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:08.270> that's

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
known and get it out there so that's

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.999 
known and get it out there so that's
pretty<00:05:09.660> neat<00:05:09.870> so<00:05:10.289> I'm<00:05:10.380> going<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.560> let<00:05:10.680> this<00:05:10.800> guy

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
pretty neat so I'm going to let this guy

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.830 
pretty neat so I'm going to let this guy
pump<00:05:11.280> along<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.910> I<00:05:12.180> don't<00:05:12.330> even<00:05:12.389> need<00:05:12.690> these

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
pump along and I don't even need these

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.210 
pump along and I don't even need these
temporary<00:05:13.349> storage<00:05:13.620> pipes<00:05:13.919> here<00:05:14.099> I'll

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
temporary storage pipes here I'll

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.100 
temporary storage pipes here I'll
probably<00:05:14.310> wind<00:05:14.580> up<00:05:14.729> emptying<00:05:15.240> them<00:05:15.449> and<00:05:15.690> set

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
probably wind up emptying them and set

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.230 
probably wind up emptying them and set
up<00:05:16.199> this<00:05:16.410> teleporter<00:05:16.949> pipe<00:05:17.160> on<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.669> end<00:05:17.880> of<00:05:18.180> my

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
up this teleporter pipe on the end of my

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.589 
up this teleporter pipe on the end of my
pump<00:05:18.720> over<00:05:18.930> here<00:05:19.490> like<00:05:20.490> there's<00:05:20.880> no<00:05:21.000> reason<00:05:21.210> to

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
pump over here like there's no reason to

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.140 
pump over here like there's no reason to
even<00:05:21.810> have<00:05:22.289> this<00:05:22.500> temporary<00:05:23.460> holding<00:05:23.789> system

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
even have this temporary holding system

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.390 
even have this temporary holding system
right<00:05:24.270> here<00:05:24.330> I<00:05:24.690> can<00:05:25.380> just<00:05:25.530> pump<00:05:25.740> directly<00:05:26.280> out

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
right here I can just pump directly out

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.770 
right here I can just pump directly out
of<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.520> ground<00:05:26.729> into<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.120> teleporter<00:05:27.389> and

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
of the ground into the teleporter and

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.500 
of the ground into the teleporter and

wireless<00:05:37.979> redstone<00:05:38.610> so<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:39.330> can<00:05:39.570> just<00:05:39.750> flip<00:05:39.870> the

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
wireless redstone so I can just flip the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.490 
wireless redstone so I can just flip the
liver<00:05:40.289> here<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:40.860> it<00:05:41.010> will<00:05:41.070> activate<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.760> pump

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
liver here and it will activate the pump

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.129 
liver here and it will activate the pump
over<00:05:43.500> here<00:05:43.889> this<00:05:44.880> pump<00:05:45.180> for<00:05:45.360> example<00:05:45.780> would<00:05:46.110> be

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
over here this pump for example would be

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.600 
over here this pump for example would be
activated<00:05:46.830> when<00:05:46.949> I<00:05:46.979> hit<00:05:47.159> the<00:05:47.310> wireless

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
activated when I hit the wireless

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.370 
activated when I hit the wireless
redstone<00:05:48.000> switch<00:05:48.240> and<00:05:48.539> it<00:05:48.990> would<00:05:49.080> just<00:05:49.110> start

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
redstone switch and it would just start

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.969 
redstone switch and it would just start
magically<00:05:50.310> pulling<00:05:50.639> oil<00:05:50.789> towards<00:05:51.210> my<00:05:51.330> base<00:05:51.979> so

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
magically pulling oil towards my base so

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.629 
magically pulling oil towards my base so
yeah<00:05:53.220> that<00:05:53.610> is<00:05:53.880> cool<00:05:54.560> so<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:55.830> think<00:05:56.070> that's

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
yeah that is cool so I think that's

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.939 
yeah that is cool so I think that's
about<00:05:56.820> all<00:05:56.880> I<00:05:57.000> can<00:05:57.240> cover<00:05:57.449> on<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:58.409> teleporter

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
about all I can cover on the teleporter

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.439 
about all I can cover on the teleporter
pipe<00:05:59.159> it's<00:05:59.490> a<00:05:59.639> very<00:05:59.940> simple<00:06:00.240> and

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
pipe it's a very simple and

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.180 
pipe it's a very simple and
straightforward<00:06:00.690> tool<00:06:01.139> but<00:06:01.530> add<00:06:01.680> so<00:06:02.039> much

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190
