one just a simple magnifying glass you

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.900 
one just a simple magnifying glass you
can<00:00:27.750> use<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> loop<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:29.010> second<00:00:29.429> tool<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.640> going

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
can use a loop the second tool is going

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.060 
can use a loop the second tool is going
to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.689> strong<00:00:31.289> magnet<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.450> then<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:34.070> testing

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
to be a strong magnet and then a testing

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.630 
to be a strong magnet and then a testing
stone<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.670> silver<00:00:36.660> acid<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.320> 18-karat<00:00:38.250> acid

silver<00:01:13.520> think<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.909> coin<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.390> only

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
silver think about this coin it's only

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.170 
silver think about this coin it's only
pure<00:01:16.530> silver<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> middle<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.939> rest

of this and the outer ring is not silver

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.789 
of this and the outer ring is not silver
so<00:01:21.110> when<00:01:22.110> determining<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.780> weight<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
so when determining the weight of and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
so when determining the weight of and
I'm<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.460> one<00:01:26.790> might<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.330> look<00:01:27.450> up

I'm like this one might want to look up

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.999 
I'm like this one might want to look up
on<00:01:28.140> Google<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.150> actual<00:01:31.009> silver

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
on Google to see the actual silver

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.450 
on Google to see the actual silver
weight<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> coin<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:35.759> here<00:01:37.159> stamp<00:01:38.159> 925

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.639 
to five okay I'm going to do a couple
more<00:01:49.439> tests<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
more tests it

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.730 
more tests it
just<00:01:51.280> verify<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.390> is<00:01:52.450> sterling<00:01:52.840> here

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
just verify that that is sterling here

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.219 
just verify that that is sterling here
this<00:01:53.979> one<00:01:54.219> here<00:01:54.549> again<00:01:55.079> says<00:01:56.079> sterling<00:01:56.619> on<00:01:56.770> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
this one here again says sterling on it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.740 
this one here again says sterling on it
and<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.799> checked<00:02:00.100> these<00:02:00.219> last<00:02:00.549> two<00:02:00.759> items<00:02:01.090> they

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
and I checked these last two items they

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.620 
and I checked these last two items they
do<00:02:01.810> not<00:02:02.049> have<00:02:02.289> any<00:02:02.439> markings<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.609> we'll<00:02:04.479> do

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
do not have any markings so we'll do

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.789 
do not have any markings so we'll do
some<00:02:04.840> further<00:02:05.049> tests<00:02:05.409> on<00:02:05.649> those<00:02:07.679> now<00:02:08.679> we're

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
some further tests on those now we're

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.619 
some further tests on those now we're
going<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.009> take<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.369> magnet<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.149> have<00:02:10.330> here

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
going to take the magnet we have here

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.100 
going to take the magnet we have here
just<00:02:10.899> run<00:02:11.349> it<00:02:11.470> over<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.769> items<00:02:12.129> see<00:02:12.549> if<00:02:12.610> we<00:02:12.730> can

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
just run it over the items see if we can

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.009 
just run it over the items see if we can
you<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.200> determine<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:16.480> know<00:02:16.599> if<00:02:16.750> any<00:02:16.900> of

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
you know determine you know if any of

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.259 
you know determine you know if any of
them<00:02:17.170> are<00:02:17.319> magnetic<00:02:18.250> because<00:02:18.879> if<00:02:19.120> they<00:02:19.239> are

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
them are magnetic because if they are

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.220 
them are magnetic because if they are
again<00:02:19.750> there<00:02:20.349> will<00:02:20.440> not<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.830> silver<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.580> gold

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
again there will not be a silver of gold

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.770 
again there will not be a silver of gold
ok<00:02:23.230> these<00:02:23.380> are<00:02:23.590> very<00:02:23.799> magnetic<00:02:24.569> we'll<00:02:25.569> just

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
ok these are very magnetic we'll just

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.789 
ok these are very magnetic we'll just
take<00:02:25.959> these<00:02:26.140> away

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
take these away

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:33.780 
take these away
these<00:02:27.579> are<00:02:27.760> definitely<00:02:28.150> not<00:02:28.560> silver

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.179
