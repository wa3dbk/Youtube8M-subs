00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.529
 and there personal to desire in the area was 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.310
 release the emulator of a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.430
 friend 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.080
 It's Elton who owes some of our 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.630
 friends leave the channel 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.090
 I know they like it very much, but I do not 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.349
 getting a friend to shoot 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.000
 well on ipad spin 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.210
 He gives a lot of trouble because he is well. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 complex prince who has already moved 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.000
 with that for who has something is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.160
 another quarry is also difficult for you 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 adjusting something else is good but it 's that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.129
 such a team emulator is enough game that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.989
 It's 70 games so many of you. 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.510
 can see the folders there but have 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:01.770
 Quite a lot I'm dragging tails up 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:03.830
 overdrive has r type test drive 12 has 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.299
 a lot of things 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.080
 one thing i've seen until syndicate has 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.900
 here to whom you met syndicate gave today 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.880
 has enough cool thing that folder 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.600
 amiga games is where you are from and where 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.020
 the games are is not this pink folder that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.119
 not this one's for the butyne in friendly 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.770
 for him to be able to run the 2 is the old dóis 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.229
 Friend of gods 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.079
 but the games are here friend games 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.270
 Let's get down to business. 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:41.909
 will perform here ô ô ô hymn ainé no hai 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.490
 is that the good emulator here I have one 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.820
 series of pass for you approach 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.280
 drives as the load of the friend was slow 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.759
 because it was done on floppy disk 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.689
 still floppy disk so it was slow that 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.329
 load up said that voters are the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.979
 spirit here if you can see 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.270
 where they are stirring here because it seems 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.969
 the mouse pointer does not 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.119
 appears in this program that I record but 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.030
 is right in the middle of the screen it is 100% 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.630
 would be the same 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.150
 with a drive reading from that time but I 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.640
 800% game far and faster 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.250
 the rest of the staff I do not advise 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.690
 Do not touch anything until you avoid it. 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.170
 problem 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.130
 a detail you will compress this 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.590
 folder in units and root as effective and 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.140
 two points against friend bad friend 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.239
 If you change this folder, you must 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.459
 I came here flirtatious and also change already 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.010
 starts to give a problem or another has the 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.070
 pets here are the paths if you have to 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.680
 change that also where is this roms 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.660
 writing here that you are with 11 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.260
 You have to change the way such rest 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.769
 I do not need it but I advise not to 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.780
 move a lot because nauseous to play 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.209
 which is what the hottest people come 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.480
 kickstart and here the mullah flop drive renan 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.280
 select dial right in the middle of the screen 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.720
 I'm going to catch was playing the final of 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.640
 today we will see another one here we will see the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.420
 test drive 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.420
 I played very well 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.900
 start agent 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.200
 there is the nostalgic screen of the friend being 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.140
 executed and loading is not loading on 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.070
 boot 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.070
 I remember that a lot there 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.690
 and it was already had voice already that time 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.780
 what's up 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.630
 Good, let's go to the metro. 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.630
 game quick to see us working 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.180
 I have size and I think a Ferrari does not 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.460
 I remember now the car I had was 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.460
 a ferrari of this farm of ours 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.720
 chose the area here 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.000
 just remembering that the whole keyboard in the 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:56.090
 numeric keypad is all on the side of the 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.960
 even the numeric keypad you can 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:04.340
 setting this on the regulator may 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.020
 put joystick other keys and load 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.250
 I told you it was only time-consuming. 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.250
 damn already loaded 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.100
 the story the car engine I forgot 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.100
 to get going 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.990

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:35.450

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.560
 one more life 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.130
 I'm leaving third because I 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:58.020
 I 'm not going to bust another engine ourselves 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:58.020
 While there is now I learned that 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.030

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:16.080

 close here we continue to talk about 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:57.370
 Personal accumulator here was executed 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:04.090
