00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 and this princess right now we 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.490
 continue to view the new teaser so 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.740
 how I managed to find many more 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.840
 be sure to put likes 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.719
 if you want to see more videos on this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.119
 the game and let's begin this time with 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.699
 the teaser village has not left any cattle 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.949
 hidden inscriptions however if lighten up 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.119
 image you can notice something 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.560
 the interesting thing is that the light from the window 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.380
 takes the form of a phone is impossible 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.960
 so scott left 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.390
 but obviously his boyfriend's phone is an option 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 what exactly did he send this parcel with 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.870
 sprint doll or vice versa 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.280
 came to the house background Guy still in the code page 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.370
 artificial left encrypted 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.879
 message but this time the cipher is much 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.250
 cooler and solve it and so easy three 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.980
 points scott wrote three letters 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.379
 maybe some of them can be made 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.070
 word but first you need them 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.140
 to decipher 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.609
 put charge on whom and write 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.339
 comments and we will continue 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.860
 consider teaser poland this time 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.250
 scott's logo has become dark green 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.010
 colors all color and springtrap it immediately 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.619
 lets us know that we are on the chair 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.049
 we see the doll is a sprinkle and not 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.500
 some other animatronic maybe 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.040
 that our plot 4 will be based on 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.710
 this q 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.290
 and after all as we know that after the third 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.980
 parts of the knot springtrap survived but not 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.950
 completely 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.050
 where is the newspaper well it is clearly written that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.690
 the managed part of animatronics were 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.950
 sold at auction then there are any 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.430
 springtrap dough 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.720
 survived and maybe from these parts like 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.960
 once created this doll 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 the same and the plot of fnaf 3 we learn that in 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.290
 mountain attraction 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.900
 there were all remaining animatronics a 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.580
 means after the fire nothing at all 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.310
 left except a few parts 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.130
 springtrap after this teaser became 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.430
 it is clear that the children of the game were going to happen 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.710
 future after the events fnaf 3 so 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.110
 as soon as it could appear 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.750
 a sprint doll after her just 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.300
 was not since springtrap appeared 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.530
 only meeting part of the game therefore 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.020
 we will play 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.120
 the person to whom someone sent 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.000
 package with a sprint doll 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.950
 it's like on a teaser outside the window the night then this 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.070
 once again confirms the fact that 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.470
 the gameplay will take place in a dream and that is 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.080
 because of this doll a person will see 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.320
 nightmares that meet everyone 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.400
 nightmarish animatronics it is this 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.410
 teaser phrase 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.620
 scary things come small 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.500
 assumptions suggests that terrible things 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.019
 and so nightmares and me a big parcel 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.570
 there is a doll with a wedge trail which means 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.209
 it is precisely the person who filled it sees the nightmarish 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.220
 I hope you liked the release 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.320
