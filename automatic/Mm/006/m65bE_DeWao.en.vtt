00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
oldest tracks on the circuit who should

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.479 
oldest tracks on the circuit who should
still<00:00:59.640> focus<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.180> little<00:01:00.329> bit<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:04.280> we've<00:01:05.280> been

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
still focus a little bit and we've been

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.170 
still focus a little bit and we've been
here<00:01:05.700> since<00:01:05.869> 2002<00:01:08.270> yeah<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.220> and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
here since 2002 yeah this is good and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.930 
here since 2002 yeah this is good and
one<00:01:13.630> of<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.900> toughest<00:01:14.380> tracks<00:01:14.620> out<00:01:14.920> here<00:01:14.950> even

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
one of the toughest tracks out here even

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.270 
one of the toughest tracks out here even
though<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.270> looks<00:01:16.480> quite<00:01:16.810> smooth<00:01:17.140> -<00:01:17.860> oh<00:01:17.890> it's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
though it looks quite smooth - oh it's

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.910 
though it looks quite smooth - oh it's
slippery<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.990> actually<00:01:20.230> good<00:01:20.410> it<00:01:20.560> rained<00:01:20.800> a

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
slippery it's actually good it rained a

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.580 
slippery it's actually good it rained a
bit<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.310> before<00:01:21.900> otherwise<00:01:22.900> this<00:01:23.140> gravel

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
bit just before otherwise this gravel

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.270 
bit just before otherwise this gravel
would<00:01:23.740> be<00:01:23.890> even<00:01:24.070> more<00:01:24.100> slippery<00:01:24.730> and<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:27.040> I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
would be even more slippery and as I

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.620 
would be even more slippery and as I
said<00:01:27.340> it's<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.780> one<00:01:28.960> of<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.230> toughest<00:01:29.650> ones

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
said it's it's one of the toughest ones

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.590 
said it's it's one of the toughest ones
because<00:01:32.550> one<00:01:33.550> of<00:01:33.580> them<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.000> actually<00:01:34.330> the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
because one of them is actually the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.030 
because one of them is actually the
longest<00:01:34.930> track<00:01:35.200> on<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.160> circuit<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.890> of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
longest track on the circuit and one of

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.980 
longest track on the circuit and one of
the<00:01:39.190> roughest<00:01:39.580> -<00:01:39.760> let's<00:01:40.300> take<00:01:40.510> a<00:01:40.540> little<00:01:40.780> break

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
the roughest - let's take a little break

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.300 
the roughest - let's take a little break
on<00:01:41.320> these<00:01:42.180> britches<00:01:43.180> here<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:47.380> focus<00:01:47.860> into

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
on these britches here now focus into

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.340 
on these britches here now focus into
the<00:01:48.430> rough<00:01:48.610> stuff<00:01:48.880> now<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.270> works<00:01:49.479> where<00:01:50.259> it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
the rough stuff now it works where it

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.070 
the rough stuff now it works where it
really<00:01:50.590> starts<00:01:51.160> and<00:01:51.369> men<00:01:52.090> on<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.300> spinning<00:01:52.780> is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
really starts and men on it spinning is

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
ah let's see if I connected stay behind

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.710 
ah let's see if I connected stay behind
there<00:01:58.450> all<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.780> way<00:01:58.900> down<00:02:00.180> huh

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
going into the dip it takes two demands
