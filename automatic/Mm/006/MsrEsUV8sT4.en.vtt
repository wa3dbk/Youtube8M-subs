00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 it's according to the people who gave me this 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 data what they happen to what they 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.660
 it happened rather the first two times 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.360
 what did they do after I'm talking 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.150
 of lives of extremely healthy people 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 and balanced physically as well as mentally and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.199
 therefore they no longer go through this 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.160
 process but without a doubt you and I 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.150
 the following will happen to us 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.630
 / acn at 10 days from 1 to 5 of 6 to 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.369
 10 from 6 to 10 we will forget 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.170
 because they say it practically feels 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.150
 little and nothing or the body is already 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.850
 used and is already in a 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.910
 natural cleaning arrangement and you already 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.220
 you do not suffer for anything however the five 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.500
 first days these are the battles that 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.670
 one gives 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 the first day 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.260
 you feel great vitality puts it with a sign 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.920
 positive and on the other hand you do not feel anything 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.050
 more than that or is little you sleep 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.540
 you feel awake with encouragement and it is 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.850
 precisely because you have not had anything 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.229
 heavy in your body you do not have a fatigue 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.780
 which is when you eat the blood be the 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.030
 stomach with andy so there are about seven 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.460
 quotes by the soul of rich good approach 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.800
 does not happen then begins to feel a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.900
 vitality but here comes the complicated 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.130
 because when you believe that today you 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.020
 more feel just fine from here to 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.830
 forward is not not the second day 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.570
 It comes a big headache 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.160
 you probably at some point 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.620
 it's going to create terrible things 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.170
 because this because a lot of the 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.700
 toxins especially for smokers it 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.650
 it goes to you and says it works in certain 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.350
 ways of fact me who am I who am 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.070
 a social smoker and it happened to me when 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.800
 I started doing 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.690
 vikram in every game with this hurt me 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.030
 almost like a crescent here inside 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.440
 if so, but it's a pain your bar does not 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.380
 I only wanted to take half of the 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.680
 it's midday like the other half but 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.860
 it hurts so andy german assists hurts 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.190
 it hurts him as well as me and obviously not 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.190
 you can take any type of aspirin or 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.149
 nothing similar headache you have to 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.019
 pass this stage 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.930
 the third the attention headache 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.120
 will decrease but another will appear 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.360
 thing 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.370
 will appear hungry 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.280
 this hunger 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.200
 It is relatively real for lack 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.049
 food is not for lack of food be 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.409
 hungry do not feel like you want to 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.870
 eat you want to feel full one 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.540
 always eat more than necessary being 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.129
 human lives in a world as if there 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.260
 for open that made the Chilean who 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.450
 He did something that is not to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.569
 open and I took two bottles of whiskey 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.370
 came and so the creative thing is like that 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.170
 which is one in excess, that is if it is free 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.879
 this takes everything you can be is 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.290
 that salfate is in our DNA this is 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.420
 our duty to finish everything that goes 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.160
 clear because because our ancestors 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.989
 necessary when it came to the next of 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.430
 create power that's why dogs 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.500
 Dogs have no training 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.959
 that it does not matter that one gave to Paraguay 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.299
 from elche to here because they always 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.950
 have with the component of I do not know if I'm going 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.590
 to eat a while more or tomorrow until 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.750
 Then comes a hunger that is not 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.940
 necessary for the body but it is the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.129
 anxiety as the note said the desire to 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.750
 want to chew something to have something that 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.010
 your teeth creak and then it happens 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.160
 stomach 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.270
 the third day they say that now 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.710
 we go to the fourth the hunger is going to continue 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.900
 but less ok 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.440
 and that is going to appear another 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.050
 component that is the sweat you will sweat 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.480
 a lot now if you are more chubby if you 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.570
 you're like I 'm going to start sweating so 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.300
 less than the second day or here 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.730
 He talks to you, he thinks he talks about friends 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.780
 that come from paco for example that 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.780
 when can baby 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.590
 ask me 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.620
 patricia on twitter I do not know how 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.540
 we walk of the genius with no smoking without 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.900
 eat until women are 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.360
 little bit more 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.060
 the good genius I will say at the end to 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.970
 root of the hotel and well then remember 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.740
 although this is that I am the sweat 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.630
 appears to each one begins to sweat more 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.670
 some may find them before 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.690
 the treatment treatment but the general 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.730
 is that it appears here and finally 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.630
 here and paddle before you start 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.680
 have a good time , the sexual impulse appears 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.759
 good we are going to put 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.759
 we are going to put it there 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.160
 the sex starts crying like I know 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:43.760
 that goes through my head maybe a little 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:49.000
 but now 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.000
 and here comes the will to do 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.910
 the bad mood they say is it has a 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:04.410
 graphic so 7 is how to say exact 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:08.340
 so you feel good first day second 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.400
 day more or less third day hating what 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.020
 all fourth day or giving everything and returns 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.060
 to feel more or less but that a 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.800
 sex drive the fifth here for 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.960
 forward the rage is removed that passes 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.580
 with the dream is the bad mood the first 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.160
 day does not give you and then it starts 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.990
 regular of the third day and you go the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.820
 lightly to the bed about then take 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.920
 the infusions that drain you and that 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.260
 obviously so look hard and then 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.110
 have now mind winner sleep 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.250
 after this because obviously this 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.250
 not for god 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:50.160
 this is broken so terrible and so 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.690
 dominant in us that is strength 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.009
 of will since here they saw what 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.439
 following 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.150
 and this what I want him to learn and this 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.270
 I can say it about yoga that I am 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.270
 doing 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.060
 you are not happy 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.060
 richter 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.260
 edit this and this is the same 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.260
 person 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.569
 we all go from one place to another and everything 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:22.599
 depends on all the chemical processes 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:25.869
 from external emotions that we 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:28.089
 bother the tacos certain problems in 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:31.599
 the work that did not turn out things like 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:33.610
 they wanted this is the paradigm where all 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:37.240
 we should aim precisely with one 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:40.210
 only one accomplish this when the cleat 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.189
 to one in the bank row even when you 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.649
 they challenged even when things do not come out 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:46.930
 how do you want your achievements like aikido 

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:49.029
 shares partial achieve occupy the 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.699
 negative forces and occupy the let's say 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:53.379
 to progress to understand other things 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.869
 to empathize with the other who has more 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:57.990
 rage that you and that's why it attacks you and 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:01.360
 this has to do with the 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:05.229
 detoxification and all this is going to 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.389
 achieve or is this what you're going to feel and it's 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:09.580
 because you have lived prey and slave of 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.409
 this one you do not control gives you more anger 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.809
 of which you would like but it is going to 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.490
 finish like that and I say it for the teacher 

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:18.569
 because once you're clean this one 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.569
 is toxic or are you
