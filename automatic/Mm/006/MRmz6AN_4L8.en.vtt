00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.420
 in monkey he put me in a cage and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.940
 now I am blocked all the time 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.620
 and told me the only way was the 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.480
 solidarity so basically I believe that 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:31.200
 i need i am at the beach the coast 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.879

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.079
 I can not commit suicide I can not do anything 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.550
 do and every time I stay full of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.649
 teeth dressed up in monkey so is this 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.660
 old dogs having already tried to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.949
 to crash into car in plane and all 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:50.820
 but it's nothing I do not know if it's 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:52.530
 my friends are nice modders 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.760
 mellal but who stuck me it's 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.519
 I can never play gta again 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:04.320
 online west do look you can not 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.360
 move it's boring but yeah I'm 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.420
 blocked I'm stuck all my life in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.370
 the cage bah yeah but it's not funny 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.960
 I know for you it's funny at first 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:22.430
 but I really start to get some 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.430
 tired you can say kill me 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.420
 but really I've already tried them 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 rockets the times that planes and where 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.840
 really have to find another solution 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 but I do not know what the best thing 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.869
 it might be a train but hey 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:49.259
 can not lead a train here not I think 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:50.640
 not so here and you do not think that the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.140
 kourouma armored it could do it 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:02.909
 because she's still strong 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:04.679
 powerful that I believe in more active and 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:12.360
 people from the pas de calais everything is going 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:14.430
 divulge names but instead of 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.829

 imagine if I'm like that all my 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.530
 life and I believe that I will have to 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.940
 restart a character or a new 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.450
 blow because if I stay good like 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.120

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.090

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.550

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.920
 to continue 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.500
 how he beat up a medium pushed 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.090

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.190

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.760
 it's even more fun too and I can 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.680
 no longer ride in cars so I 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.920
