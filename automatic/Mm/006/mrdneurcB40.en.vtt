00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.910
 that trace costs you is because being 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.530
 very good the day of vejer or bug 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.209
 welcome gentlemen to this new video 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.740
 in which as the title can we go to 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.029
 analyze the trailer they just pulled 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.860
 for cyrus 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.380
 the new zombie map of black ops 3 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.820
 that mentioned gentlemen that this analysis 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.649
 it can be if I do not want to split it in two 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.239
 first this video that is going to be 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:28.460
 practically analyzing the frames 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.439
 what we can see and I'm going to do another 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.550
 video with the explanation of the trailer 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.140
 which is different because the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.190
 explanation as its name says it I'm going to 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.200
 explain what is happening 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.850
 because the characters are like that they are 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.830
 the scenes that sometimes show that they are 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.660
 the voices that are heard however in 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.520
 this video we're just going to see images and 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.740
 theories of what they show us in the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.810
 trailer then gentlemen we started 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.550
 first with obviously the city in 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.900
 where it will take place this map be 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.640
 mention that this city is a city 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.220
 fictional is like a parallel dimension 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.870
 an alternate dimension to the real world this 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.640
 It's part of the explanation I'm going to give 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.960
 in the video that I'm going to upload later 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.700
 then they show us the characters 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.470
 waking up like that realizing that 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.970
 are within this city are three 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.740
 men and a woman each with one 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.659
 different profession like that I'm going to 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.040
 say in the explanation video it fits 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.929
 mention that this trailer combines 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.130
 cinematic with gameplay so that 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.270
 what we are seeing in the background 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 example is a cinema 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.780
 quite possibly the initial kinematics 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.250
 where they explain the background of the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.229
 characters and then how is that 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.939
 they came to the city how they met 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.679
 how they met and then and you start 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.570
 to play something similar that with mode 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.020
 dead or as with any exo trailer 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.640
 zombies 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.350
 at the beginning there really is not much that 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 see there are not many new things just we 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.319
 obviously confirm that the zombies 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.670
 they have yellow eyes thing that can 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.219
 be related to that family 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.780
 Maxis is in control of the zombies 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.819
 they also show us that obviously 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.409
 the weapons come back from the wall and in this 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.270
 frame we specifically see things 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.159
 interesting on the right we reach to 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.049
 see some red letters in column that 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.280
 has a higher resolution image is 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.869
 the same place seen from another 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.299
 perspective and how can you see are like 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.189
 symbols letters some some alphabet 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.959
 rare that is possibly related 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.599
 with Satanism since this map is 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:02.030
 very acclimated within the satanic 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.920
 very similar to biting and to the bottom of 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.110
 we can also see this image 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.789
 purple light that we will also see more 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.049
 forward in the trailer you do not know with 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.910
 accuracy for what is done but 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.769
 we will try to draw theories as I said 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.900
 a little later in this part we 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.879
 show an improved weapon confirming the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.280
 return of the pack to pons and also more or 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.960
 least they teach us what camouflage is like 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.640
 that you can not distinguish very well 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.020
 nothing interesting happens in the trailer 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.360
 until we get to this part where 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.700
 they show us two swords one red and one 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.380
 blue we can both apparently use them 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.180
 like a gigantic knife that when 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.070
 we hit a zombie obviously 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.960
 we cut shit we do are not my 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.370
 they always die in one fell swoop but 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.050
 is not whether this is going to be like a power 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.150
 off or if it's going to be something permanent the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.620
 damage go then clearly going down 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.450
 gradually according to the life of the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.370
 zombies climb but regardless of 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.710
 that apparently each of these swords 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.180
 has a specific skill the red 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.220
 shows us in entering the one that serves as 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.900
 a tomahawk similar to the one we saw in move 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.210
 dead we can throw the zombies 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.220
 hurt him and he will come back to us 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.140
 and the south serves as the skill 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.970
 special the multiplayer gravity spikes 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.830
 what it does is that the player 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.870
 throws to the air and then with the sword 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.360
 he nails it to the floor and once it says 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.830
 it nails an electrical explosion damages the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.240
 enemies that is around these two 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.340
 things as I said we show the 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.440
 trailer and apparently they are specific to 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.030
 each of these swords here we see the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.100
 new ray field that apparently what 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.840
 have are rockets like that boosters 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.580
 that once you activate them you will go 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.380
 shot forward killing all 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.150
 the emmys that you find in front 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.980
 I imagine that the shield will keep 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.959
 his original way of killing 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.030
 hit hit and you can also 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.860
 activate this eventually eventually for 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.840
 kill more zombies inside a hall 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.519
 or maybe to a full ball or even 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.590
 only to escape after show 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.390
 this little rubber gum machine 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.340
 chewing that a lot of people say they are 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.810
 the dogs that I really doubt them a lot 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.400
 I believe that dogs are not in this 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.959
 trailer for a specific reason that 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.450
 As I already said, I 'll explain it 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.010
 in my next video however this 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.650
 machine apparently they are like that mini 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.049
 random power ops that you buy and you 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.180
 gives some advantage like that by throwing a 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.579
 mini advantage because it's not to me 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.310
 so useful communist akel so useful as a 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.859
 double point however the three that we 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.739
 show here they are first of a candy 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.660
 purple that is the logo is of a person 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.459
 and a zombie passing by and in 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.859
 effect when the player eats this 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.870
 candy is completely ignored by 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.850
 the zombies then there is the red candy 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.190
 with sparks that apparently your logo is 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.479
 like an explosion like that half 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.039
 can not see very well not 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.630
 distinguishes very well in the trailer but 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.729
 when the character eats it at 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.770
 seem along the map appears a 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.780
 random stick in this case was a max 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.190
 I love and then finally in the trailer 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.460
 they show us a purple candy with 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.110
 black 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.970
 that I turned into a symbol of 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.889
 interrogation and like that sparkles 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.210
 around and once the character gets 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.580
 he eats it and the zombies attack him 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.349
 disappears and the explosion you leave 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.569
 when it disappears it hurts the zombies 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.830
 and apparently it kills those are the three 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.780
 that they showed us but very possibly 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.190
 there will be more flavors also something 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.960
 important is that this machine appear 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.330
 many vocalizations around the map 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.620
 it's not like that in a single specific and 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.000
 what it shows in the trailer 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.009
 we will be able to activate the skills 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.960
 when we want or we create it 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.669
 more convenient now show us a 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.380
 transformation we see that the character and 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.970
 becomes what appears to be a 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.620
 monster my theory is that for 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.300
 convert you need to get the 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.130
 candy right then once 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.870
 you eat it you can press like that 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.180
 the buttons or activate the skill to 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.120
 then transform into a monster with 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.460
 tentacles and then you can attack with 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.750
 these tentacles that you have the most 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.580
 important and relevant of these gentlemen 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.810
 is can be seen before it 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.669
 convert you can see along this 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.190
 hallway there is nothing and once you 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.740
 convert in this corridor to the right 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.750
 appears a door these gentlemen me 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.940
 They remember a lot of 'how are you with these 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.560
 in after right you can see doors here 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.409
 when you are converted you can see 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.089
 doors 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.830
 here we can see that this character is 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.869
 turn to see the left hand and in the 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.909
 hole that has its glove we see a mark 

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:49.319
 I'm not sure since it reaches us 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.599
 distinguishes very well but very possibly 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.399
 this is the mark of the damned because 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.830
 if you remember they are the damned 

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:58.110
 survive and possibly this group 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.289
 of four people be part of this 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.479
 organization or subgroup of the damned 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.239
 they also show us then zombie 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.949
 alien boss who is a mosso 

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:10.019
 gigantic three-headed that has 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.879
 tentacles and apparently what you have 

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:13.499
 What to do is shoot him in the mouth 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.179
 each of these heads and when 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:16.889
 electrons the three heads you're going to 

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:19.439
 defeat apparently while you're 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.550
 fighting with this alien monster going 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.679
 to start throwing like that to their 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.659
 little children who are more indigenous 

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:25.829
 flying that look like wasps that 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:28.019
 They will hurt you and you have to 

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:29.519
 kill them in the air is not known if this one 

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:31.019
 that's going to be for a specific round 

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:33.059
 if it's going to look like every five ten fifteen 

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:34.649
 rounds or if it's going to be an event of a 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.089
 only once on the map and finally we 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:38.429
 they show the thing that with more doubts we 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:39.989
 he left apparently there is a satanic room 

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:41.759
 completely where they are making a 

00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:44.669
 rite we can see a table with a 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.439
 pentagram below and we see that a box 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.129
 begins to ascend becomes a 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.979
 human 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:51.689
 after the human explodes I do not know if 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.459
 within the explosion appear something 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:55.289
 because you see all the blood and I think that 

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:57.239
 in the center there is something but without a doubt 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.800
 some this is something very strange and it's going to 

00:06:57.239 --> 00:07:00.539
 have a lot to do, I believe with the 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.800
 stress and in my opinion that would be all for 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.509
 the trailer gentlemen as I say 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.129
 there really are not so many things that you have 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:06.089
 to be analyzing very well without 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:07.979
 But as I said try 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:09.899
 explain the story of what is 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.519
 happening on this map in a video that I'm going 

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:13.439
 to go up a little bit later and then more 

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.909
 sir was tied by this video very many 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:18.110
 thank you for watching, take care, see you 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.110
 then goodbye
