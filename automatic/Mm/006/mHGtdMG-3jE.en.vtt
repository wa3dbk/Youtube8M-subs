a pound so I would put them onto a tray
just<00:02:23.720> like<00:02:23.960> this<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.820> an<00:02:25.820> office<00:02:26.630> play<00:02:26.810> then<00:02:27.080> I

just like this and an office play then I

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.930 
just like this and an office play then I
what<00:02:27.890> I'm<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.190> do<00:02:28.370> with<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.760> has

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
what I'm going to do with it that has

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.880 
what I'm going to do with it that has
something<00:02:29.270> called<00:02:29.300> flash-freezing<00:02:30.200> I'm

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
something called flash-freezing I'm

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.530 
something called flash-freezing I'm
going<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.130> put<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.400> into<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.730> freezer<00:02:32.150> you

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
going to put this into the freezer you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.450 
going to put this into the freezer you
can<00:02:32.990> cover<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.410> or<00:02:33.590> not<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:34.070> going<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.280> take

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
can cover it or not it's going to take

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.460 
can cover it or not it's going to take
about<00:02:34.700> an<00:02:34.880> hour<00:02:35.030> or<00:02:35.150> two<00:02:35.300> just<00:02:35.930> for<00:02:36.050> them<00:02:36.290> to

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
about an hour or two just for them to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.160 
about an hour or two just for them to
harden<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.330> we'll<00:02:38.330> be<00:02:38.450> back<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.810> second

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
harden and we'll be back in a second

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.080 
harden and we'll be back in a second
flash<00:02:39.500> freezing<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:40.340> simply<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.970> greatest

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
flash freezing is simply the greatest

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.540 
flash freezing is simply the greatest
thing<00:02:41.570> ever<00:02:41.870> invented<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.740> cooking<00:02:43.100> or<00:02:43.280> ever

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
invented to those of us who don't love

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.280 
invented to those of us who don't love
to<00:02:45.560> cook<00:02:45.740> so<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:47.240> can<00:02:47.420> flash<00:02:47.630> freeze<00:02:48.050> in<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
to cook so I you can flash freeze in the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.040 
to cook so I you can flash freeze in the
meatballs<00:02:48.740> just<00:02:49.520> lay<00:02:49.760> then<00:02:50.030> like<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.480> said<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:51.020> a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
meatballs just lay then like I said on a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.360 
meatballs just lay then like I said on a
cookie<00:02:51.440> sheet<00:02:51.470> put<00:02:51.890> them<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.160> freezer

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
cookie sheet put them in the freezer

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.340 
cookie sheet put them in the freezer
once<00:02:52.760> they<00:02:52.910> come<00:02:53.150> out<00:02:53.180> that's<00:02:53.840> odd

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
once they come out that's odd

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.410 
once they come out that's odd
they're<00:02:54.500> like<00:02:54.680> little<00:02:54.860> rocks<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.240> just

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
they're like little rocks and you just

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.400 
they're like little rocks and you just
put<00:02:56.630> them<00:02:56.750> inside<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.560> bag<00:02:58.990> now<00:02:59.990> these<00:03:00.170> ones

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
put them inside a bag now these ones

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.260 
put them inside a bag now these ones
here<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.890> I'm<00:03:01.010> doing<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.459> did<00:03:01.640> cheat<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:01.970> little

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
here that I'm doing I did cheat a little

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.210 
here that I'm doing I did cheat a little
bit<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.450> had<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.780> batch<00:03:03.020> I<00:03:03.290> made<00:03:03.500> earlier<00:03:03.980> and

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
bit I had a batch I made earlier and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.630 
bit I had a batch I made earlier and
actually<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.790> batch<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.600> had<00:03:06.560> cooked<00:03:06.920> them<00:03:07.250> on

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
actually this batch I had cooked them on

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.080 
actually this batch I had cooked them on
to<00:03:08.120> cook<00:03:08.300> them<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> little<00:03:08.870> bit<00:03:09.020> at<00:03:09.230> 350<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.790> that

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
to cook them a little bit at 350 so that

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.120 
to cook them a little bit at 350 so that
what<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.450> means<00:03:11.780> is<00:03:11.990> that<00:03:12.020> on<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.440> very<00:03:12.860> busy

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
what that means is that on a very busy

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.920 
what that means is that on a very busy
night<00:03:13.310> instead<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.000> them<00:03:14.239> even<00:03:14.540> having<00:03:14.810> to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
night instead of them even having to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.660 
night instead of them even having to
bake<00:03:15.110> for<00:03:15.380> half<00:03:15.650> an<00:03:15.830> hour<00:03:15.950> in<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.190> oven<00:03:16.280> they

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
bake for half an hour in the oven they

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.100 
bake for half an hour in the oven they
can<00:03:16.850> just<00:03:17.060> go<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.510> oven<00:03:17.570> for<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
can just go in the oven for the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.440 
can just go in the oven for the
remainder<00:03:18.590> 10<00:03:18.950> minutes<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.940> we<00:03:20.150> were<00:03:20.269> already

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
remainder 10 minutes so we were already

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.470 
remainder 10 minutes so we were already
cooked<00:03:21.110> put<00:03:21.680> them<00:03:21.830> on<00:03:21.980> as<00:03:22.160> she<00:03:22.400> put<00:03:23.060> them<00:03:23.180> into

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
cooked put them on as she put them into

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.280 
cooked put them on as she put them into
the<00:03:23.780> bag<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.870> just<00:03:26.870> made<00:03:27.050> my<00:03:27.260> own

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
the bag like this I just made my own

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.130 
the bag like this I just made my own
meatball<00:03:27.980> very<00:03:28.700> inexpensive<00:03:29.540> way<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.690> do<00:03:29.989> it

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
meatball very inexpensive way to do it

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.570 
meatball very inexpensive way to do it
and<00:03:30.350> I'll<00:03:30.440> put<00:03:30.620> them<00:03:30.709> in<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.920> freezer<00:03:31.250> like

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
and I'll put them in the freezer like

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.670 
and I'll put them in the freezer like
this<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.060> busy<00:03:32.600> night<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:33.080> bring<00:03:33.320> them<00:03:33.470> out

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
this on a busy night I bring them out

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.020 
this on a busy night I bring them out
just<00:03:34.010> cook<00:03:34.220> them<00:03:34.370> for<00:03:34.459> an<00:03:34.550> extra<00:03:34.820> 10<00:03:35.000> minutes

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
just cook them for an extra 10 minutes

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.940 
just cook them for an extra 10 minutes
the<00:03:35.720> ones<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:36.080> I<00:03:36.170> made<00:03:36.350> earlier<00:03:36.709> though

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
the ones that I made earlier though

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.710 
the ones that I made earlier though
those<00:03:37.400> ones<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:38.000> was<00:03:38.150> going<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.360> put<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:38.630> the

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
those ones I was going to put in the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.740 
those ones I was going to put in the
freezer<00:03:39.019> as<00:03:39.500> Romi<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.000> would<00:03:41.390> do<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.630> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
freezer as Romi and so I would do it the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.140 
freezer as Romi and so I would do it the
same<00:03:41.989> way<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.500> reason<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:43.070> do<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.730> if

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
same way the reason you do this is if

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.810 
same way the reason you do this is if
you<00:03:44.540> simply<00:03:44.959> made<00:03:45.230> those<00:03:45.440> meatballs<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.640> put

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
you simply made those meatballs and put

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.520 
you simply made those meatballs and put
them<00:03:47.000> in<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.150> bag<00:03:47.299> like<00:03:47.330> this<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.080> hope<00:03:48.290> that

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
them in a bag like this and hope that

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.440 
them in a bag like this and hope that
they<00:03:48.680> wouldn't<00:03:48.920> clump<00:03:49.190> together<00:03:49.400> that's<00:03:50.180> not

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
they wouldn't clump together that's not

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.190 
they wouldn't clump together that's not
going<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.660> happen

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
going to happen

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.080 
going to happen
so<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.560> need<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:51.890> flash<00:03:52.130> freeze<00:03:52.580> them<00:03:52.790> first

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
so you need to flash freeze them first

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.030 
so you need to flash freeze them first
then<00:03:53.690> put<00:03:54.019> them<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.350> freezer<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.830> then

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
then put them in the freezer and then

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.259 
then put them in the freezer and then
when<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.280> pull<00:03:55.489> them<00:03:55.580> out<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.790> can<00:03:56.150> either

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
when you pull them out you can either

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.470 
when you pull them out you can either
cook<00:03:56.630> them<00:03:56.840> arm<00:03:57.049> if<00:03:57.920> they're<00:03:58.130> raw<00:03:58.400> at<00:03:58.730> 350<00:03:59.450> for
