00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.049
 hello everyone with you panda and theme 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.839
 today's tutorial will be a gun cannon 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.050
 from minecraft 1 5 well let me 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.520
 let's see so here I activate as we 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.369
 see we shoots center to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.680
 Sorry now is not so far away 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.420
 click on the button again to see where 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.390
 frequency 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.009
 now should not give a little away 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 actually here's such a good gun in 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.700
 what's her plus and and do not need 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.960
 recharge that is necessary but not so 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.200
 often creates 3 3 1 on the button I press and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.450
 and even if henna with speeding it is calculated 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.960
 on the same amount of his salary 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.239
 occitan around nine become an example 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.219
 such is not the equivalent we created let's 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.719
 build and 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.809
 how could some have guessed here 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.090
 already connected all the same opportunities 15 so 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.640
 well, so take about these 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.270
 nice cool stuff and for example 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 sail such money is better all three hundred 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.659
 so you still need a bucket of water so what 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 let's get down to building 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.810
 set for the beginning of the so-called not very 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.479
 I know what is called the barrel barrel that Volga 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.509
 probably this word is called 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.689
 the trunk in such a way and here is too much 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.079
 this here is the demolition of black managed so 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.880
 Instead, we put distributors and such 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:42.090
 here's the way here so here we set 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.700
 a button above the water source block on 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.439
 him a button here and pave 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.299
 redstone this one is right on the distributor 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.799
 just press shift and go to sell 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.750
 Komi on them right click and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.869
 so what we do further is further here 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.240
 We put a piece of parting, too, because 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.009
 between and I have here in a different way 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.420
 here is not in front of the button stalin piece 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.540
 ration he should get used to us 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.250
 buttons and then we put a repeater here 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.429
 You can put any tightening and then 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.289
 except for 3 nights will work well well 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.590
 in fact, and so here's the track 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.760
 From Rostov but this little bit 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.030
 Start field where he and so no matter how 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.470
 handrails and distributors directed to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.209
 here it would be up to rock and aside 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.580
 to this glad 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.180
 further this distributor we need to power 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.080
 and so we put just here a repeater with 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.319
 maximum delay 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.390
 everything is completely brushing like that 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.190
 way and here it is here better 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.049
 maximum well let's try 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.720
 this little thing 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:52.260
 so here everywhere we lay on day 16 is 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:58.060
 it was enough so and so so so 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.549
 so and so and here you can still close 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.530
 but it can not of course we can say 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.700
 two blocks we leave so here 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.879
 close like this 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.670
 decorate here in this way like this 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:13.810
 I think that's cool how but here you need so 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.209
 here's a bit of money closed and that's it 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.180
 let's check out what we press on 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:25.090
 button wait for it to lean on dark 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.590
 shoots pretty small of course 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.079
 I can over it and because there is sandy 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.549
 area so set but on the ordinary world he 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.190
 will be pretty good level 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.230
 worn on the body yes of course it is 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.060
 it will be difficult to build something very 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.160
 a lot here beat you need for powering 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.660
 here is this thing count for one 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.079
 shot here u uses how much 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.519
 change time two three 4 5 six 7 plus 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.769
 8 8 blocks of dynamite itself is not 4040 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.900
 know how 40 bad I need how much 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.209
 will this guitar too 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.430
 just a lot but if of course you have 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.530
 sword on looting rey something of being that 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.769
 it is certainly easier but nonetheless 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.829
 difficult as well it can be even further 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.519
 improve there up become distributors of the world 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.829
 Thus, I have shown a 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.329
 pretty simple model but on this one 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.939
