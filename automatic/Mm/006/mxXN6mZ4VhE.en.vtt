I'm<00:01:04.879> bracing<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.269> start<00:01:05.479> off<00:01:05.600> we<00:01:06.140> did<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:06.890> is

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
I'm bracing to start off we did this is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.380 
I'm bracing to start off we did this is
starting<00:01:07.340> off<00:01:07.399> with<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.580> candy<00:01:07.850> candy<00:01:08.119> base

starting off with a candy candy base

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.289 
starting off with a candy candy base
this<00:01:08.960> is<00:01:09.020> pretty<00:01:09.320> much<00:01:09.409> an<00:01:09.680> example<00:01:10.369> of<00:01:10.640> the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
this is pretty much an example of the

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.540 
this is pretty much an example of the
monochromatic<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:12.680> lot<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.190> customers<00:01:13.520> that

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
monochromatic a lot of customers that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.609 
monochromatic a lot of customers that
they'll<00:01:13.850> bring<00:01:14.119> their<00:01:14.300> candies<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.899> and<00:01:15.200> you

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
they'll bring their candies in and you

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.410 
they'll bring their candies in and you
want<00:01:15.800> that<00:01:15.920> monochromatic<00:01:16.159> look<00:01:16.759> but<00:01:17.300> what

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
want that monochromatic look but what

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.999 
want that monochromatic look but what
you<00:01:17.539> do<00:01:17.659> is<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:17.840> take<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.170> same<00:01:18.409> base<00:01:18.740> and

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
you do is you take that same base and

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.889 
you do is you take that same base and
just<00:01:19.490> darken<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.030> up<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.330> go<00:01:20.450> right<00:01:20.659> over

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
just darken it up and you go right over

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.450 
just darken it up and you go right over
and<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.110> can<00:01:21.200> get<00:01:21.319> that<00:01:21.440> kind<00:01:21.830> of<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.069> under

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
and you can get that kind of the under

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.540 
and you can get that kind of the under
the<00:01:22.580> candy<00:01:22.909> look<00:01:23.119> for<00:01:23.360> it<00:01:24.280> pretty<00:01:25.280> much<00:01:25.369> what

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
the candy look for it pretty much what

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.639 
the candy look for it pretty much what
you<00:01:25.640> do<00:01:25.789> is<00:01:25.909> I<00:01:26.179> concentrate<00:01:27.020> more<00:01:27.229> everybody

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
you do is I concentrate more everybody

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.430 
you do is I concentrate more everybody
knows<00:01:27.979> me<00:01:28.159> for<00:01:28.340> textures<00:01:28.789> a<00:01:29.270> lot<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:29.720> lot<00:01:30.080> of<00:01:30.140> the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
knows me for textures a lot a lot of the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.649 
knows me for textures a lot a lot of the
students<00:01:30.830> when<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.369> was<00:01:31.399> teaching<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.060> still

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
asked me how do you get the textures

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.690 
asked me how do you get the textures
really<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.229> difference<00:01:36.619> between<00:01:36.770> your

really the difference between your

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.520 
really the difference between your
airbrush<00:01:38.060> look<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.509> your<00:01:38.600> natural<00:01:38.990> look<00:01:39.140> it's

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
airbrush look and your natural look it's

subtle<00:01:41.569> subtle<00:01:42.429> textures<00:01:43.429> in

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
subtle subtle textures in

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.960 
subtle subtle textures in
you<00:01:45.830> know<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:45.980> look<00:01:46.190> at<00:01:46.280> girls<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.610> magazines

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970

you<00:01:50.420> can<00:01:50.570> translate<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.890> airbrush

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
you can translate that to the airbrush

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.800 
you can translate that to the airbrush
world<00:01:52.490> because<00:01:52.730> everybody<00:01:53.120> has<00:01:53.480> scars

way to look more realistic specially on
portraits<00:02:00.890> up<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.450> paying<00:02:02.450> attention<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.840> your

image I came back you can see on some of

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.509 
image I came back you can see on some of
the<00:03:19.170> highlights<00:03:19.560> came<00:03:20.099> back<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
the highlights came back with the

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.819 
the highlights came back with the
electric<00:03:20.939> eraser<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:22.530> Ryan's

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
electric eraser that that Ryan's

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.899 
electric eraser that that Ryan's
explained<00:03:23.189> on<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.909> earlier<00:03:24.840> video<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:26.430> do<00:03:26.609> to

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
explained on a earlier video to do to

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.399 
explained on a earlier video to do to
build<00:03:27.030> into<00:03:27.269> highlights<00:03:27.659> to<00:03:27.900> bring<00:03:28.109> back<00:03:28.230> that

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
build into highlights to bring back that

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.080 
build into highlights to bring back that
the<00:03:28.560> brightest<00:03:28.889> of<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.040> bright<00:03:29.129> here<00:03:29.579> then<00:03:30.000> I

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the brightest of the bright here then I

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.339 
the brightest of the bright here then I
came<00:03:30.239> back<00:03:30.329> with<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.569> razor<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.930> did<00:03:31.169> some

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
came back with the razor and did some

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.289 
came back with the razor and did some
more<00:03:31.469> it's<00:03:32.040> more<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.370> scratch<00:03:32.790> than<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.120> hair

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
more it's more the scratch than the hair

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.379 
more it's more the scratch than the hair
so<00:03:33.900> but<00:03:34.139> this<00:03:34.199> is<00:03:34.379> pretty<00:03:34.530> much<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.829> same

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
so but this is pretty much the same

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.149 
so but this is pretty much the same
technique<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.419> I<00:03:36.599> use<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.620> always<00:03:37.769> comes<00:03:38.010> out

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
technique that I use it always comes out

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.229 
technique that I use it always comes out
cleaner<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.669> when<00:03:38.819> you're<00:03:38.939> using<00:03:39.120> that

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
cleaner and when you're using that

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.300 
cleaner and when you're using that
eraser<00:03:39.750> technique<00:03:40.139> you<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.859> get<00:03:40.949> the<00:03:41.069> bright

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
eraser technique you can get the bright

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.039 
eraser technique you can get the bright
bright<00:03:42.030> bright<00:03:42.060> highlights<00:03:42.719> which<00:03:42.900> is

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049

another thing that you really need to

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.819 
another thing that you really need to
contract<00:03:44.870> concentrate<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.169> the<00:03:46.290> contrast

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
contract concentrate on is the contrast

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.909 
contract concentrate on is the contrast
you<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.430> really<00:03:47.760> really<00:03:48.469> light<00:03:49.469> bright

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
you have really really light bright

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.379 
you have really really light bright
highlights<00:03:50.400> against<00:03:50.790> some<00:03:50.969> of<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.120> deeper

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389
