00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.309 
moved in and basically there's a lot of
conflict<00:00:03.090> happening<00:00:03.449> here<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.080> what

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
conflict happening here and this is what

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.690 
conflict happening here and this is what
players<00:00:04.529> are<00:00:04.680> going<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.859> have<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.160> play

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
players are going to have to play

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.829 
players are going to have to play
through<00:00:05.910> they're<00:00:06.120> going<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.299> find<00:00:06.450> out<00:00:06.629> some

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
through they're going to find out some

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.839 
through they're going to find out some
new<00:00:06.930> storylines<00:00:07.440> about<00:00:08.250> some<00:00:08.519> Naga

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
new storylines about some Naga

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.339 
new storylines about some Naga
involvement<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.570> deathwing<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
involvement with deathwing and the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.990 
involvement with deathwing and the
Cataclysm<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.370> just<00:00:11.550> really<00:00:11.730> think<00:00:11.820> it's

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
Cataclysm and I just really think it's

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.190 
Cataclysm and I just really think it's
going<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.150> be<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.330> cool<00:00:12.509> place<00:00:12.570> it's<00:00:12.929> definitely

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
going to be a cool place it's definitely

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.959 
going to be a cool place it's definitely
a<00:00:13.230> mix<00:00:13.469> up<00:00:13.679> something<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.340> we'd<00:00:14.549> never<00:00:14.790> done

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
a mix up something that we'd never done

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.880 
a mix up something that we'd never done
before<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.780> kind<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:15.990> concept<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.650> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
before this this kind of concept of a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.550 
before this this kind of concept of a
dungeon<00:00:17.550> that's<00:00:17.760> underwater<00:00:18.350> we've<00:00:19.350> got

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
dungeon that's underwater we've got

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.070 
dungeon that's underwater we've got
windows<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.029> edges<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> dungeon<00:00:21.900> that

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
windows on the edges of the dungeon that

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840 
windows on the edges of the dungeon that
actually<00:00:22.350> when<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> look<00:00:22.800> out<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.010> them<00:00:23.310> you

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
actually when you look out of them you

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.370 
actually when you look out of them you
actually<00:00:23.970> look<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.449> into<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> water<00:00:25.050> from

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
actually look out into the water from

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.810 
actually look out into the water from
outside<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.949> might<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> dungeon

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
outside so you might be in the dungeon

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.060 
outside so you might be in the dungeon
and<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.599> look<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.410> wall<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.710> you're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
and you look out to the wall and you're

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.130 
and you look out to the wall and you're
right<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.210> creatures<00:00:30.630> swimming<00:00:30.779> by

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
right and you see creatures swimming by

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
right and you see creatures swimming by
and<00:00:31.679> you're<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> see<00:00:32.489> we're<00:00:32.730> doing

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and you're going to see we're doing

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.850 
and you're going to see we're doing
these<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.170> awesome<00:00:34.290> new<00:00:34.620> water

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
these really really awesome new water

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.560 
these really really awesome new water
effects<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> game<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.420> guys

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
effects for the game I think you guys

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.690 
effects for the game I think you guys
were<00:00:36.960> able<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.380> them<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> art<00:00:38.489> panel

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
were able to see them in the art panel

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330 
were able to see them in the art panel
yesterday<00:00:39.149> those<00:00:39.989> same<00:00:40.260> water<00:00:40.860> effects<00:00:41.190> we're

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
yesterday those same water effects we're

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.830 
yesterday those same water effects we're
gonna<00:00:41.460> end<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.730> using<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.600> dungeon

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
gonna end up using here in this dungeon

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
gonna end up using here in this dungeon
so<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.860> really<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so I just really think it's going to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
so I just really think it's going to
give<00:00:44.579> players<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.969> kind<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> cool<00:00:45.809> unique<00:00:46.110> new

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
give players a kind of a cool unique new

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.540 
give players a kind of a cool unique new
experience<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.129> something<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.520> they

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
experience for something that they

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
experience for something that they
haven't<00:00:47.789> necessarily<00:00:48.000> done<00:00:48.480> before<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.950> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
haven't necessarily done before and it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
haven't necessarily done before and it
just<00:00:50.190> plays<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:50.969> nice<00:00:51.210> fits<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.750> really

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
just plays up really nice fits in really

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.310 
just plays up really nice fits in really
well<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.230> Cataclysm<00:00:52.949> overall<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> here

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
well with Cataclysm overall so here

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
well with Cataclysm overall so here
you've<00:00:55.410> got<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.649> look<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> layout<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.520> over

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you've got to look at the layout of over

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.689 
you've got to look at the layout of over
the<00:00:57.180> concept<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> Bissel<00:00:58.320> ma<00:00:58.699> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the concept here for a Bissel ma it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
the concept here for a Bissel ma it's
nonlinear<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.690> come<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.469> choose

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
nonlinear so you come in you can choose

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
nonlinear so you come in you can choose
to<00:01:01.739> go<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.370> left<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.180> got<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> couple

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
to go right or left you got a couple

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.080 
to go right or left you got a couple
boss<00:01:03.809> dreams<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.350> either<00:01:04.470> side<00:01:04.970> that's<00:01:05.970> an

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
boss dreams on either side that's an

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
boss dreams on either side that's an
elevator<00:01:06.450> shaft<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:06.990> center<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.500> from

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
elevator shaft in the center there from

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.620 
elevator shaft in the center there from
that<00:01:07.860> piece<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.310> concept<00:01:08.520> part<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.299> guys<00:01:09.450> saw

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
that piece of concept part you guys saw

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
that piece of concept part you guys saw
a<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:09.840> earlier<00:01:10.400> going<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.700> elevator

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
a little earlier going up this elevator

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
a little earlier going up this elevator
takes<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> top<00:01:12.960> floor<00:01:13.020> where<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
takes you up to the top floor where you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.350 
takes you up to the top floor where you
end<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.040> fighting<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.520> final<00:01:14.790> boss<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.210> there

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
end up fighting that final boss up there

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760 
end up fighting that final boss up there
at<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.479> top<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.259> there's<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:16.560> bit<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
at the top so there's a little bit of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
at the top so there's a little bit of
choice<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.280> players<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.850> choose<00:01:17.880> which

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
choice here players can choose which

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.820 
choice here players can choose which
side<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.500> boss<00:01:19.680> they

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
side they want to go which boss they

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.320 
side they want to go which boss they
want<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> fight<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.310> which<00:01:20.400> order<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.240> in

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
want to fight in which order but in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
want to fight in which order but in
general<00:01:21.390> they're<00:01:21.689> always<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> end<00:01:22.140> up

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
general they're always going to end up

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.399 
general they're always going to end up
in<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> same<00:01:22.770> place<00:01:23.780> now<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.020> an<00:01:25.259> early

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940

wanted<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.910> put<00:03:33.060> our<00:03:33.269> twist<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.500> know<00:03:34.590> what

wanted to put our twist on you know what
we<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:35.129> that<00:03:35.190> would<00:03:35.430> feel<00:03:35.640> like<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
we think that would feel like in the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.490 
we think that would feel like in the
world<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.510> warcraft<00:03:36.870> something<00:03:37.290> very

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
world of warcraft something very

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.759 
world of warcraft something very
different<00:03:39.019> another<00:03:40.019> dungeon<00:03:40.230> here<00:03:40.560> this

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
different another dungeon here this

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.530 
different another dungeon here this
one's<00:03:40.950> nonlinear<00:03:41.400> also<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.819> come<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.299> you've

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
one's nonlinear also you come in you've

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.300 
one's nonlinear also you come in you've
got<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> choice<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.650> couple<00:03:43.889> different<00:03:44.160> paths

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
got a choice of a couple different paths

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.550 
got a choice of a couple different paths
you<00:03:44.519> can<00:03:44.639> take<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.959> don't<00:03:46.109> always<00:03:46.260> have<00:03:46.410> to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
you can take you don't always have to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.170 
you can take you don't always have to
play<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.889> dungeon<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.459> same<00:03:47.669> way<00:03:47.910> it

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
play the dungeon in the same way it

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.520 
play the dungeon in the same way it
might<00:03:48.299> feel<00:03:48.510> different<00:03:48.900> every<00:03:49.079> time<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.380> get

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
might feel different every time you get

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.110 
might feel different every time you get
here<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:50.010> think<00:03:50.400> that's<00:03:50.519> important<00:03:50.910> something

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
here I think that's important something

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.990 
here I think that's important something
a<00:03:51.239> little<00:03:51.329> different<00:03:52.549> so<00:03:53.549> you<00:03:53.609> know<00:03:53.819> it's

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
a little different so you know it's

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.550 
a little different so you know it's
tight<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.329> dungeon<00:03:54.660> obviously<00:03:55.109> brands<00:03:55.530> got

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
tight and dungeon obviously brands got

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.319 
tight and dungeon obviously brands got
to<00:03:55.799> be<00:03:55.889> here<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.310> mean<00:03:56.730> where<00:03:56.880> else<00:03:56.910> would<00:03:57.180> he<00:03:57.239> be

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
to be here I mean where else would he be

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.449 
to be here I mean where else would he be
