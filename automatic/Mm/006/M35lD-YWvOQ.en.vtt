staff<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.239> light<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.660> don't<00:00:42.930> know<00:00:43.079> really<00:00:43.469> where

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
staff of light I don't know really where

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.270 
staff of light I don't know really where
or<00:00:44.340> why<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> bought<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.829> was<00:00:46.829> selling<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
or why I bought that I was selling the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.040 
or why I bought that I was selling the
shards<00:00:47.640> along<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> way<00:00:48.800> because<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.760> runes

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
shards along the way because the runes

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.189 
shards along the way because the runes
to<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.559> fire<00:00:52.920> surge<00:00:53.280> are<00:00:53.840> extremely<00:00:54.840> expensive

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to do fire surge are extremely expensive

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.080 
to do fire surge are extremely expensive
now<00:00:55.789> it's<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:57.059> 1k<00:00:57.600> per<00:00:57.800> cast<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.910> using

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
now it's like 1k per cast so I was using

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.420 
now it's like 1k per cast so I was using
a<00:01:00.510> staff<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.410> light<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.800> beginning<00:01:02.070> but

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
a staff of light at the beginning but

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.219 
a staff of light at the beginning but
then<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.640> switch<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> fire<00:01:03.329> stuff<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:04.019> I

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
then I switch to a fire stuff because I

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.000 
then I switch to a fire stuff because I
couldn't<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.680> afford<00:01:05.240> the<00:01:06.240> fire<00:01:06.510> rinse

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
but luckily I did get an item I actually

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.920 
but luckily I did get an item I actually
haven't<00:06:36.890> been<00:06:37.159> there<00:06:37.280> that<00:06:37.430> long<00:06:37.630> I've<00:06:38.630> been

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
haven't been there that long I've been

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.719 
haven't been there that long I've been
there<00:06:39.080> maybe<00:06:39.800> I<00:06:40.490> would

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:40.729 
there maybe I would

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.350 
there maybe I would
say<00:06:40.879> 250<00:06:41.360> kills<00:06:41.749> at<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.259> most<00:06:42.439> and<00:06:43.300> I<00:06:44.300> think

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
say 250 kills at the most and I think
