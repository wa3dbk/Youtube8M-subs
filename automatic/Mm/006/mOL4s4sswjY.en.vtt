move from be Eric's didn't meet just yet

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.150 
move from be Eric's didn't meet just yet
there's<00:00:37.660> another<00:00:37.930> kill<00:00:38.200> coming<00:00:38.500> in<00:00:38.620> Burnout

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
there's another kill coming in Burnout

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.740 
there's another kill coming in Burnout
could<00:00:39.340> be<00:00:39.430> coming<00:00:39.700> up<00:00:39.730> for<00:00:39.879> dyrus<00:00:40.360> but<00:00:40.600> they

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
could be coming up for dyrus but they

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.140 
could be coming up for dyrus but they
wait<00:00:41.170> on<00:00:41.350> that<00:00:41.440> one<00:00:41.860> two<00:00:42.040> kills<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:42.730> mid

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
wait on that one two kills and mid

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.520 
wait on that one two kills and mid
turret<00:00:43.360> damage<00:00:43.750> yeah<00:00:44.050> I<00:00:44.079> think<00:00:44.260> that's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
turret damage yeah I think that's

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.080 
turret damage yeah I think that's
actually<00:00:44.800> pretty<00:00:44.920> disastrous<00:00:45.220> early<00:00:45.760> on<00:00:45.880> for

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
actually pretty disastrous early on for

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.880 
actually pretty disastrous early on for
CLG<00:00:46.360> because<00:00:46.840> they<00:00:46.960> are<00:00:47.200> the<00:00:47.590> ones<00:00:47.710> that

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
CLG because they are the ones that

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.620 
CLG because they are the ones that
invested<00:00:48.340> five<00:00:48.489> people<00:00:48.790> up<00:00:48.910> there<00:00:49.060> oh<00:00:49.239> but<00:00:49.510> can

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
invested five people up there oh but can

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.900 
invested five people up there oh but can
they<00:00:49.720> get<00:00:49.870> dyrus<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:50.950> nice<00:00:51.160> very<00:00:51.670> good

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
they get dyrus that is nice very good

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.970
