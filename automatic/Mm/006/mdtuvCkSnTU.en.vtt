00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.180 
but normally I'm tie it with a gold head
but<00:01:28.570> this<00:01:28.780> time<00:01:29.020> because<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.770> water<00:01:29.950> was<00:01:30.130> so

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
but this time because the water was so

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.020

clear and the Sun was bright I decided

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.890 
clear and the Sun was bright I decided
on<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.479> duller<00:01:34.960> white<00:01:35.700> bead<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.570> wouldn't

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
on a duller white bead so it wouldn't

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.020 
on a duller white bead so it wouldn't
spook<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.410> fish<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.400> last<00:01:39.580> one<00:01:39.820> well<00:01:40.000> I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
spook the fish and the last one well I

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.690 
spook the fish and the last one well I
had<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.420> choose<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.630> lure<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.710> decided<00:01:42.340> in<00:01:42.610> a

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
had to choose a lure so I decided in a

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.910 
had to choose a lure so I decided in a
Montana<00:01:43.090> name<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:44.050> was<00:01:44.290> with<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.650> tungsten

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
Montana name it was with the tungsten

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.460 
Montana name it was with the tungsten
bead<00:01:45.400> so<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.180> allowed<00:01:46.479> me<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.660> explore<00:01:47.020> all<00:01:47.320> the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
bead so it allowed me to explore all the

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.760 
bead so it allowed me to explore all the
depths<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:49.210> those<00:01:49.450> fish<00:01:49.720> chasing<00:01:50.290> three

flies tied now to set the rods up now I

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.560 
flies tied now to set the rods up now I
argued<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:54.700> should<00:01:55.030> have<00:01:55.150> been<00:01:55.270> allowed

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570

I'm targeting one particular fish the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.350 
I'm targeting one particular fish the
problem<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.620> every<00:02:28.010> time<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.459> flight<00:02:28.850> drops

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
problem is every time that flight drops

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.979

on<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.600> water<00:02:29.830> they<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:31.040> swim<00:02:31.190> away<00:02:31.989> cast

again another fish what I am trying to
do<00:02:35.870> now<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:36.670> setting<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.730> trap<00:02:37.760> put<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:39.200> cast<00:02:39.440> to

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
do now is setting a trap put the cast to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.949

fish after fish came up to the fly

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.840 
fish after fish came up to the fly
turned<00:02:56.360> away<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:57.200> was<00:02:57.500> very<00:02:58.130> very<00:02:58.549> frustrating

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
turned away it was very very frustrating

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.690 
turned away it was very very frustrating
I<00:02:59.480> tried<00:03:00.110> some<00:03:00.380> different<00:03:00.410> retrieves<00:03:01.370> by

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
I tried some different retrieves by

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.479 
I tried some different retrieves by

eights<00:03:04.730> tweaking<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:06.290> odd<00:03:06.410> fish<00:03:06.680> would

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
eights tweaking it the odd fish would

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.580 
eights tweaking it the odd fish would
would<00:03:07.280> follow<00:03:07.519> for<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.880> yard<00:03:08.840> or<00:03:09.080> two<00:03:09.110> then

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
would follow for a yard or two then

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.800 
would follow for a yard or two then
decided<00:03:10.069> turn<00:03:10.160> away<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.910> at<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.209> point<00:03:11.540> I

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
decided turn away and at this point I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.110 
decided turn away and at this point I
thought<00:03:12.500> shall<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.070> go<00:03:13.280> back<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.579> the<00:03:13.670> lodge<00:03:13.850> and

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
thought shall I go back to the lodge and

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.630 
thought shall I go back to the lodge and
retie<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.600> smaller<00:03:15.109> flight<00:03:15.440> but<00:03:15.980> suddenly<00:03:16.190> a

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640

Whitehead area at this point I wasn't

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.130 
Whitehead area at this point I wasn't
sure<00:03:53.410> which<00:03:54.130> fish<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.790> cast<00:03:55.000> out<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:55.989> was

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
sure which fish to cast out and I was

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.680 
sure which fish to cast out and I was
just<00:03:56.170> dangling<00:03:57.010> my<00:03:57.280> fly<00:03:57.520> near<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.209> bank<00:03:58.420> and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
just dangling my fly near the bank and

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.250 
just dangling my fly near the bank and
boy<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.860> sticklebacks<00:04:00.580> loved<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.780> 40

their<00:04:03.010> Moe's<00:04:03.280> weren't<00:04:03.610> big<00:04:03.819> enough<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:04.150> get<00:04:04.300> a

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
their Moe's weren't big enough to get a

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.540 
their Moe's weren't big enough to get a
look<00:04:04.660> in

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
look in

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.729 
look in
so<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:06.610> my<00:04:06.910> left<00:04:07.150> there<00:04:07.810> was<00:04:07.989> a<00:04:08.050> lot<00:04:08.319> faster

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
so to my left there was a lot faster

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.530 
so to my left there was a lot faster
water<00:04:08.890> where<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.340> spring<00:04:09.819> was<00:04:10.060> feeding<00:04:10.330> the

lake

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.860 
lake
it<00:04:11.140> was<00:04:11.319> rougher<00:04:11.769> it<00:04:11.980> gave<00:04:12.400> me<00:04:12.730> more<00:04:12.970> cover<00:04:13.330> and

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
it was rougher it gave me more cover and

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.469 
it was rougher it gave me more cover and
it<00:04:13.989> also<00:04:14.230> gave<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.950> fish<00:04:15.190> less<00:04:15.730> time<00:04:16.180> to

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
it also gave the fish less time to

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.009 
it also gave the fish less time to
inspect<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.169> flight<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:18.299> can<00:04:19.299> still<00:04:19.570> see

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
inspect the flight I can still see

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.290 
inspect the flight I can still see
shadows<00:04:20.590> moving<00:04:20.979> so<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.160> can<00:04:21.549> tag<00:04:21.760> in<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.120> few

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
shadows moving so I can tag in a few

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.659 
shadows moving so I can tag in a few
