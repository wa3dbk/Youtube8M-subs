00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.160
 The human being operates differently than computers? 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.180
 If I am aware of how a computer is programmed, 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.220
 then I can predict how he will respond to the orders; 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.740
 and so, I can control it. 

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.833
 What would happen if science could shed our brains 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.440
 and reduce them to a series of complex algorithms? 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.300
 Human behavior could also be predicted? 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.280
 And if so, would we be responsible for our actions? 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.600
 Immanuel Kant addresses the problem of determinism in his book "Critica de la RazÃ³n Practica". 

00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:48.853
 What a numbing tab it sounds. 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.960
 Kant says that humans, like everything else in the physical world, are subject to cause and effect. 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.120
 For example, if I am sick, I will want to be healthy. 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.260
 Or, if I have little life, I can not stop wanting a health pack. 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.920
 However, human beings have the capacity to WANT. 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.180
 And this "will power" is free. 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.040
 Although I have little life, I can deny myself the desire to fill it. 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.180
 If we were not free, we would not have the ability to deny our inclinations 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.120
 through what Kant calls the Moral Law. 

00:01:23.853 --> 00:01:25.853
 Suppose there are two players. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.360
 Player one has more than half his life and Player two has almost nothing. 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.940
 Even if Player 1 wants the health pack, 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.280
 He considers it his duty to give it to Player 2. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.720
 Unlike computers, human beings know what they MUST do. 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.940
 Hence his famous aphorism: duty implies power. 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.400
 So, if you recognize an obligation, 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.840
 You have the implicit freedom to do it or not do it. 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.580
 If humans were pure calculation like computers, 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.880
 There would be no sense of DUTY, we would only dedicate ourselves to "doing". 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.280
 There are many philosophers who mocked the idea 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.420
 that humans can transcend cause and effect. 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.200
 Some say we have no freedom at all. 

00:02:11.054 --> 00:02:13.054
 But, as science progresses, 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.440
 Only time can tell where the line between man and machine is located.
