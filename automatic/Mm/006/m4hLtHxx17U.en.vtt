00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
take it to the next level to see just

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.659 
take it to the next level to see just
how<00:00:26.380> much<00:00:26.439> damage<00:00:26.680> you<00:00:26.890> can<00:00:27.009> take<00:00:27.160> before<00:00:27.430> it

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669

literally<00:00:29.259> so<00:00:29.559> I'm<00:00:29.890> gonna<00:00:30.070> run<00:00:30.220> it<00:00:30.250> over<00:00:30.430> with

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
literally so I'm gonna run it over with

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.190 
literally so I'm gonna run it over with
my<00:00:30.759> car<00:00:30.790> and<00:00:31.210> then<00:00:31.540> we<00:00:31.630> do<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:31.750> whole<00:00:31.989> bunch<00:00:32.020> of

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
my car and then we do a whole bunch of

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.299 
my car and then we do a whole bunch of
other<00:00:32.320> crazy<00:00:32.619> stuff<00:00:32.739> if<00:00:33.040> it<00:00:33.190> actually

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
other crazy stuff if it actually

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.160 
other crazy stuff if it actually
survives<00:00:33.760> that<00:00:33.880> test<00:00:34.149> so<00:00:34.360> let's<00:00:34.809> go<00:00:34.960> ahead<00:00:34.989> and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
survives that test so let's go ahead and

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.660 
survives that test so let's go ahead and
get<00:00:35.320> right<00:00:35.500> into<00:00:35.649> it<00:00:35.770> alright<00:00:36.340> so<00:00:36.430> we'll<00:00:36.520> go

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
get right into it alright so we'll go

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.830 
get right into it alright so we'll go
ahead<00:00:36.700> and<00:00:36.910> place<00:00:37.210> this<00:00:37.300> thing<00:00:37.450> in<00:00:37.600> front<00:00:37.690> of

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
ahead and place this thing in front of

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:50.500 
ahead and place this thing in front of
my<00:00:37.930> car's<00:00:38.110> tire<00:00:38.320> face<00:00:38.649> up

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.829 

alright<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.469> we<00:00:52.399> got<00:00:52.429> some<00:00:52.879> entire<00:00:53.359> Mars<00:00:53.660> on

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
alright so we got some entire Mars on

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.060 
alright so we got some entire Mars on
here<00:00:54.079> but<00:00:54.559> see<00:00:54.980> if<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:55.129> screen<00:00:55.309> works<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:57.710> it

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
here but see if the screen works and it

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.319 
here but see if the screen works and it
does<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.519> means<00:00:58.670> we<00:00:58.789> get<00:00:58.879> to<00:00:58.940> go<00:00:59.089> to<00:00:59.149> the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
does so that means we get to go to the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.420 
does so that means we get to go to the
next<00:00:59.480> level<00:00:59.809> alright<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:00.680> survive<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:01.219> car

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
test let's take it to the next level

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.389 
test let's take it to the next level
almost<00:01:03.440> smack<00:01:03.620> it<00:01:03.769> with<00:01:03.800> this<00:01:04.070> piece<00:01:04.250> of<00:01:04.339> wood

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
almost smack it with this piece of wood

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:05.950 
almost smack it with this piece of wood
as<00:01:04.670> if<00:01:04.820> we<00:01:04.909> were<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.030> baseball<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.630> let<00:01:05.810> steve

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
as if we were a baseball and let steve

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.870 
as if we were a baseball and let steve
is<00:01:06.080> fries<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.039> go<00:01:07.399> ahead<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.610> back<00:01:07.909> up

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
is fries that so go ahead and back up

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:24.950 
is fries that so go ahead and back up
good<00:01:12.399> now<00:01:13.399> do<00:01:13.460> with<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.210> screen<00:01:14.509> facing<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.140> so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.240 

you

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.950 

alright<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.210> probably<00:01:30.420> shouldn't<00:01:30.810> try

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
alright so you probably shouldn't try

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.109 
alright so you probably shouldn't try
that<00:01:31.140> because<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:32.130> screen<00:01:32.399> isn't<00:01:32.670> turning<00:01:32.970> on

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that because the screen isn't turning on

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.560 
that because the screen isn't turning on
now<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:34.140> doesn't<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.470> look<00:01:34.920> cracked<00:01:35.820> but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570

takes<00:02:02.039> out<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.459> crack<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.850> thing<00:02:02.909> open<00:02:03.179> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
takes out to crack this thing open and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.870 
takes out to crack this thing open and
we'll<00:02:04.080> go<00:02:04.200> ahead<00:02:04.319> and<00:02:04.619> start<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.399> by

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
we'll go ahead and start that by

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.460 
we'll go ahead and start that by
throwing<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.690> air<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.080> I'll<00:02:07.350> go

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
throwing it up in the air so I'll go

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.130 
throwing it up in the air so I'll go
ahead<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.619> back<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.269> I'm<00:02:09.269> a<00:02:09.299> truck<00:02:09.600> in<00:02:09.780> air

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
ahead and back up and I'm a truck in air

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.830

the<00:02:57.410> loop<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.220> I'm<00:02:58.280> going<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.460> throw<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.760> as

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
the loop so I'm going to throw it as

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.320 
the loop so I'm going to throw it as
hard<00:02:59.000> as<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.450> possibly<00:02:59.480> could<00:03:01.210> against<00:03:02.210> this

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
hard as I possibly could against this

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:12.080 
hard as I possibly could against this
little<00:03:02.600> stone<00:03:02.780> part<00:03:02.990> right<00:03:03.110> over<00:03:03.140> here<00:03:03.410> so

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.050 

there<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.180> go<00:03:13.269> finally<00:03:14.260> cracked<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.680> so

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
there you go finally cracked it so

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.759 
there you go finally cracked it so
that's<00:03:16.060> what<00:03:16.269> would<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.629> probably<00:03:16.959> take<00:03:17.170> me<00:03:17.590> to

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
that's what would it probably take me to

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.350 
that's what would it probably take me to
crack<00:03:17.950> your<00:03:18.069> phone<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.790> thing<00:03:19.000> did<00:03:19.150> really
