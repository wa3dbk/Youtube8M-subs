inches<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.670> way<00:03:05.940> too<00:03:06.000> big<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.870> five<00:03:07.500> or<00:03:07.769> even<00:03:07.799> a

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
inches is way too big a five or even a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.220 
inches is way too big a five or even a
five<00:03:08.519> point<00:03:08.849> one<00:03:09.030> inch<00:03:09.180> display<00:03:09.599> is<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.959> sweet

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
five point one inch display is the sweet

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.050 
five point one inch display is the sweet
spot<00:03:10.379> for<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.739> lot<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.950> people<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.909> would

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
spot for a lot of people and I would

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.270 
spot for a lot of people and I would
have<00:03:12.209> even<00:03:12.480> been<00:03:12.659> fine<00:03:12.959> with<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.200> 5.5<00:03:14.069> inch

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
have even been fine with a 5.5 inch

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.160 
have even been fine with a 5.5 inch
display<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:15.000> get<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.959> note

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
display I get that this is the note

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.839 
display I get that this is the note
series<00:03:16.379> but<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:16.859> is<00:03:17.010> borderline<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.760> it

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
series but this is borderline of it

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.150 
series but this is borderline of it
becoming<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.389> small<00:03:18.720> tablet<00:03:19.079> this<00:03:19.799> makes<00:03:20.040> it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
becoming a small tablet this makes it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.680 
becoming a small tablet this makes it
unusable<00:03:20.430> with<00:03:20.790> one<00:03:20.970> hand<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.480> if<00:03:21.569> you're

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
unusable with one hand and if you're

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.479 
unusable with one hand and if you're

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.589 
thinking about adding a case to it then
it'll<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.940> much<00:03:24.209> more<00:03:24.239> difficult

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
it'll be that much more difficult

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.300 
it'll be that much more difficult

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
the note 5 the last and final reason is

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.920 
the note 5 the last and final reason is
the<00:04:31.130> lack<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.580> vibrate<00:04:32.030> switch<00:04:32.420> this<00:04:32.750> is

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
the lack of a vibrate switch this is

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.540 
the lack of a vibrate switch this is
something<00:04:33.230> I<00:04:33.320> use<00:04:33.530> every<00:04:33.560> single<00:04:33.950> day<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.490> it

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
something I use every single day and it

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.130 
something I use every single day and it
really<00:04:34.700> becomes<00:04:35.060> annoying<00:04:35.420> having<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:35.990> turn

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
really becomes annoying having to turn

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.900 
really becomes annoying having to turn
