previous video I did mention that the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.940 
previous video I did mention that the
faster<00:03:23.360> you<00:03:23.510> do<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.810> line<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.410> cleaner<00:03:24.710> that

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
faster you do the line the cleaner that

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.130 
faster you do the line the cleaner that
the<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.910> liner<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.420> going<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.750> look<00:03:26.930> the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
the the liner is going to look the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.890 
the the liner is going to look the
slower<00:03:27.770> you<00:03:28.010> do<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:29.180> more<00:03:29.210> jagged<00:03:29.720> lines

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
slower you do it the more jagged lines

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.600 
slower you do it the more jagged lines
