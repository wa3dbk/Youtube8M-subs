00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hello everyone in this series of videos, I 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.010
 told her dacha 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.440
 spring fieldwork here next to 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.369
 land which is intended for landing 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.189
 is there something growing cherry constantly 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.119
 such a cherry roots and prevent rub 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 be held 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 sprouts and now this pit means rummaging in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.939
 first of all in order to these 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.570
 roots, as it were on the water feet on the eye as well 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.290
 I dug this side to 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 separate these roots chop them off but the second 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 the function is that there it will be possible to fertilize 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.079
 land at the same time and raise her 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.140
 do more horizontally here 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.129
 starts from rica blade in this place 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.340
 as if a hillock of the north side curtains and 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.980
 that means three functions at once 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.780
 form cut means you are level ground 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.270
 and 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:08.390
 Means leaves and waste there still some 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:12.360
 put there to fertilize the lands 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.610
 so what else and mi vida waste here 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.759
 second cushion let 's go for 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.110
 we have long been lifted up such something like 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.570
 there's nothing here that read it like 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.640
 would a good fertilizer nutrition her here 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.040
 here they drank a pillow because 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.100
 throwing away like so easy then 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.799
 which is a pity but like nowhere from there she 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.590
 entered as fertilizer on top is all you can 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.520
 fences and almost excess leaves which 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.079
 Well, of course it would not indicate 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.079
 no moq we have quite a lot 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.899
 it turns out and you can always 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:55.250
 to fertilize some kind of land i 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:58.909
 lover of any warm beds and for you 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.000
 different method let's say the soil is very it is all 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.149
 helped in this way and it turns out 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.149
 we are beautiful at this place 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:12.200
 preposition warm bed for the future all 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.660
 this can be spilled with an aqueous solution 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.650
 mullein to better it all 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.250
 there began to start the rotting process but 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.920
 and besides Tanya, it turned out like this 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.569
 useful work box
