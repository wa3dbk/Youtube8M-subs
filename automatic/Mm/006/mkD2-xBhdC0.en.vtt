00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.210
 the cell cycle 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.410
 every living cell comes from another that 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.410
 previously it has been divided 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.800
 the cell cycle is a process through 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:28.060
 of which a cell progresses from a 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.349
 cell division to the following 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.960
 the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.340
 It consists of two parts 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.340
 interfaces and phase m 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:52.210
 the interface in turn includes three phases 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:52.210
 what are you and what are you 2 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 phase m for its part comprises two 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:06.150
 mitosis and cyto sinesis stages 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.229
 here we will refer essentially to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.229
 the interface 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.780
 when a cell is in an interface 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.390
 the chromosomes are in the form of 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.360
 chromatin in varying degrees of 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.840
 condensation 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.210
 in this scheme a cell is represented 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.900
 2n diploid with two pairs of chromosomes 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:37.620
 homologs differentiated by colors 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.960
 the two long chromosomes are homologous 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.229
 one from another 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:48.540
 equally the two short chromosomes are 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.030
 homologs each other the pink chromosomes 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.040
 come from one of the parents and 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.040
 the greens of the other parent 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.320
 in phase 1 the cell begins to 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.380
 transcribe and translate genes and 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.460
 progressively grows increasing mass 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.460
 and size 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.220
 when the cell has reached certain 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.420
 magnitudes of mass and size enters the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.460
 phase of DNA synthesis that lasts 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.940
 since the beginning of the replication of 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.480
 until all the DNA has been 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.480
 replicated 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.790
 here there is also transcription and 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.840
 active translation so the cell 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.840
 keep growing 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.670
 at the end of the phase s the cell has 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:56.000
 turned tetraploid what in this 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:00.300
 scheme is expressed as 4 n equal to 8 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.180
 this means that the cell has 8 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.019
 chromosomes in total 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.390
 here phase s ends so the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:16.200
 cell goes to stage g 2 in this phase 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.800
 the cell continues to grow and prepare 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.480
 to divide 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.180
 at the end of phase 2 the cell has 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 grown has doubled its material 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.410
 genetic and is ready to start the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.400
 phase m that takes this name for being the 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.210
 stage where mitosis is performed 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.140
 ilãcito sinesis mitosis is the 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:48.460
 Duplicate cellular genome separation 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:52.490
 in two sets of identical chromosomes 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.560
 the cyto sinesis is the division of a 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:00.280
 cell in two daughter cells 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.430
 at the end of each cycle each of the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.000
 two resulting cells begins its 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.099
 own cycle there are various cells 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.190
 totally differentiated as neurons 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.650
 erythrocytes and muscle cells that do not 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.919
 they are divided at all as they have 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:25.120
 abandoned the cell cycle and remain 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:29.430
 in a phase called g 0 of which no longer 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:33.639
 continue to phase s the cell cycle 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:37.030
 is highly regulated and each of 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.669
 its phases includes at least one point of 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.470
 control in which the 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:47.040
 correct completion of the processes 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.940
 the start of a phase depends on the 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.110
 previous phases have been completed 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.520
 correctly 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:00.449
 who perform this control 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.139
 the enzymes sedeca and the cyclicals 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:06.870
 in humans there are genes called 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:10.469
 sedeca which code for without 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.949
 known cyclin-dependent loops 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:16.230
 also as sedeca enzymes for their 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.530
 acronym in Spanish 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.980
 the cycling as are proteins 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:28.950
 synthesize progressively during 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:32.729
 phases of 1s g2 and that they degrade in the 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.610
 phase m of each cycle 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:38.169
 what are the control points of the 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.129
 cell cycle 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:45.490
 in phase 1 it is verified that the mass 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:48.159
 cellular and growth be 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.569
 enough to support the cycle 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:55.749
 cellular in phase s you have to 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.840
 verify that the DNA is intact without 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:03.150
 no harm 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:06.150
 in phase 2 the verification consists of 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.800
 that each DNA sequence has been 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:13.970
 replicated once and only once 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:18.540
 in phase m it is verified that the cineto 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:21.240
 choirs are forming pairs correctly 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.900
 so that the distribution of chromosomes 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.310
 be equitable between the two cells 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.190
 daughters 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.450
 if the cell passes the verification in the 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:36.250
 check Point 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:40.020
 the cycle continues otherwise it 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:43.020
 blocks errors in the cell cycle 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.060
 can result in defective cells 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.930
 which converts them into cells 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.550
 scheduled to die to the process of 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.569
 programmed cell death 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:59.020
 it is called apoptosis 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:02.710
 in cancer that constitutes another 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:06.159
 alteration of the cell cycle the cells 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.800
 multiply indefinitely as they have 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:11.279
 lost the ability to block the 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.279
 cycle 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:19.629
 the cell cycle is exposed in a
