00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.970 

so<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.080> guess<00:00:01.890> it's<00:00:02.100> all<00:00:02.220> warmed<00:00:02.550> up<00:00:02.699> now

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:05.980 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.920 

temperatures<00:00:06.790> at<00:00:06.970> normal

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
temperatures at normal

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.680 
temperatures at normal
one<00:00:09.920> more<00:00:10.220> redneck<00:00:10.639> modification<00:00:11.510> is<00:00:11.660> that

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
one more redneck modification is that

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.140 
one more redneck modification is that
this<00:00:12.350> kind<00:00:12.769> of<00:00:12.830> engine<00:00:13.040> has<00:00:13.459> what's<00:00:13.820> called<00:00:14.059> a

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
this kind of engine has what's called a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.330 
this kind of engine has what's called a
high<00:00:14.330> swirl<00:00:14.780> head<00:00:15.110> it's<00:00:15.350> a<00:00:15.500> weird<00:00:15.830> shape<00:00:16.070> head

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
high swirl head it's a weird shape head

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.999 
high swirl head it's a weird shape head
design<00:00:16.700> it<00:00:17.050> makes<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.230> fuel<00:00:18.500> burn<00:00:18.770> more

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
design it makes the fuel burn more

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.670 
design it makes the fuel burn more
efficiently<00:00:19.070> and<00:00:19.730> stuff<00:00:19.939> like<00:00:20.119> that<00:00:20.360> so<00:00:20.750> it

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
efficiently and stuff like that so it

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.339 
efficiently and stuff like that so it
was<00:00:21.830> kind<00:00:22.009> of<00:00:22.070> restrictive<00:00:22.700> so<00:00:22.970> I've<00:00:23.349> reshaped

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
was kind of restrictive so I've reshaped

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.319 
was kind of restrictive so I've reshaped
the<00:00:24.560> cylinder<00:00:24.950> heads<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:25.489> give<00:00:25.640> lower<00:00:26.149> the

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
the cylinder heads to give lower the

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.569 
the cylinder heads to give lower the
compression<00:00:26.899> so<00:00:27.050> I<00:00:27.079> can<00:00:27.320> add<00:00:27.500> more<00:00:27.770> boost<00:00:28.099> and

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
compression so I can add more boost and

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.810 
compression so I can add more boost and
to<00:00:29.570> give<00:00:29.750> it<00:00:29.869> higher<00:00:30.050> flow<00:00:30.470> so<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:31.340> ports<00:00:31.640> are

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
to give it higher flow so the ports are

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.569 
to give it higher flow so the ports are
slightly<00:00:32.029> modified<00:00:32.329> too<00:00:33.070> that<00:00:34.070> didn't<00:00:34.399> cost

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
slightly modified too that didn't cost

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.450 
slightly modified too that didn't cost
nothing<00:00:34.750> just<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:35.840> bit<00:00:36.020> of<00:00:36.190> tinkering<00:00:37.190> around

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.799 

now<00:00:40.460> of<00:00:40.550> course<00:00:40.730> this<00:00:40.940> car<00:00:41.239> is<00:00:41.329> incredibly

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
now of course this car is incredibly

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.099 
now of course this car is incredibly
fast<00:00:43.239> well<00:00:44.239> at<00:00:44.629> least<00:00:44.839> for<00:00:45.079> its<00:00:45.230> day<00:00:45.730> way<00:00:46.730> back

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
fast well at least for its day way back

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.610 
fast well at least for its day way back

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
an hour 0 to 60 was considered quite

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.599 
an hour 0 to 60 was considered quite
fast<00:00:53.870> especially<00:00:54.230> for<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.589> four-cylinder<00:00:55.309> car

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
fast especially for a four-cylinder car

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:02.319 
fast especially for a four-cylinder car
and<00:00:56.440> quarter<00:00:57.440> miles<00:00:57.710> in<00:00:58.159> the<00:00:59.030> mid<00:00:59.210> 40s<00:01:00.640> so<00:01:01.640> you

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
and quarter miles in the mid 40s so you

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.079 
and quarter miles in the mid 40s so you
know<00:01:02.449> that's<00:01:02.719> pretty<00:01:03.019> good<00:01:03.460> but<00:01:04.460> today's

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
know that's pretty good but today's

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.210 
know that's pretty good but today's
standards<00:01:05.600> that's<00:01:05.840> not<00:01:06.050> not<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.770> greatest

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
standards that's not not the greatest

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.320 
standards that's not not the greatest
but<00:01:07.430> still<00:01:07.640> you've<00:01:07.760> got<00:01:07.850> has<00:01:07.940> been<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.120> lot<00:01:08.300> of

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
but still you've got has been a lot of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.790 
but still you've got has been a lot of
money<00:01:08.510> to<00:01:08.720> get<00:01:08.870> that<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.260> I<00:01:09.320> didn't<00:01:09.560> spend<00:01:09.710> a

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
money to get that and I didn't spend a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.890 
money to get that and I didn't spend a
lot<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:09.979> money<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.340> make<00:01:10.520> this<00:01:10.760> but<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:11.510> can't

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
lot of money to make this but I can't

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.570 
lot of money to make this but I can't
really<00:01:12.050> express<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.710> too<00:01:12.860> much<00:01:12.980> I'm<00:01:13.250> driving

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
really express it too much I'm driving

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.040 
really express it too much I'm driving
on<00:01:13.700> growl<00:01:13.940> because<00:01:14.360> soon<00:01:14.510> as<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.780> gets<00:01:14.900> to

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
on growl because soon as it gets to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.380 
on growl because soon as it gets to
3,000<00:01:15.680> rpm<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.160> goes<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.640> hyper<00:01:16.850> boost<00:01:17.180> and

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
3,000 rpm that goes to hyper boost and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.780 
3,000 rpm that goes to hyper boost and
then<00:01:17.450> attack<00:01:17.750> just<00:01:18.020> buries<00:01:18.380> itself<00:01:18.740> I'll<00:01:19.550> show

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
then attack just buries itself I'll show

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.030 
then attack just buries itself I'll show
you<00:01:19.850> when<00:01:20.030> I<00:01:20.120> turn<00:01:20.270> around<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:21.500> that's<00:01:21.860> only

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
you when I turn around and that's only

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.080 
you when I turn around and that's only
with<00:01:22.220> half<00:01:22.430> throttle<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:25.340> I'll<00:01:25.520> give<00:01:25.760> it<00:01:25.910> half

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
with half throttle so I'll give it half

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.030 
with half throttle so I'll give it half
gas<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.780> just<00:01:26.960> wait<00:01:27.170> a<00:01:27.200> tiny<00:01:27.500> bit<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.920> then

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
gas you just wait a tiny bit and then

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.760 
gas you just wait a tiny bit and then
see<00:01:28.250> what<00:01:28.400> happens

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609 

you<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.460> what<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.670> mean<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.119> we'll<00:01:33.960> try<00:01:34.109> second

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you see what I mean now we'll try second

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.270 
you see what I mean now we'll try second

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.970 

see<00:01:40.880> tat<00:01:41.210> jump<00:01:41.570> jumped<00:01:42.410> up<00:01:42.560> in<00:01:42.800> the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
see tat jump jumped up in the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.980 
see tat jump jumped up in the
speedometer<00:01:43.850> way<00:01:44.000> 20<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.480> 120

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.050 
speedometer way 20 to 120
we<00:01:47.350> went<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.620> overboost<00:01:48.070> for<00:01:48.370> a<00:01:48.400> second<00:01:48.880> I

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
we went to overboost for a second I

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.630 
we went to overboost for a second I
might<00:01:49.450> not<00:01:49.630> have<00:01:49.660> my<00:01:50.130> wastegate<00:01:51.130> delay<00:01:51.400> system

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
might not have my wastegate delay system

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.210 
might not have my wastegate delay system
adjusted<00:01:52.210> properly<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:53.290> is<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.620> first<00:01:53.890> year

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
adjusted properly so is this first year

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.080 
adjusted properly so is this first year
again<00:01:54.490> half<00:01:54.910> gas

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
again half gas

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.980 
again half gas
out<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.300> control<00:01:59.970> second<00:02:01.290> gas

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.320 

just<00:02:06.439> instantly<00:02:06.890> hits<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.250> hundred<00:02:07.610> case<00:02:07.820> as<00:02:08.149> it

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
just instantly hits a hundred case as it

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.520 
just instantly hits a hundred case as it
goes<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.660> hyper<00:02:08.840> boost

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
goes to hyper boost

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.740 
goes to hyper boost
so<00:02:10.220> it's<00:02:10.399> awesomely<00:02:10.970> fun<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.360> road<00:02:11.540> when

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
so it's awesomely fun on the road when

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.870 
so it's awesomely fun on the road when
you<00:02:11.870> get<00:02:12.020> some<00:02:12.200> traction

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.180 

and<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.080> see<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> dust<00:02:17.620> marks<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.160> a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
and you can see the dust marks on a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.570 
and you can see the dust marks on a
driveway<00:02:18.490> where<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.390> lit<00:02:19.630> up<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.960> those<00:02:20.110> gears

and<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.730> dust<00:02:21.970> clouds<00:02:22.240> just<00:02:22.540> drifting<00:02:23.470> away

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.330 

now<00:02:37.710> we<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.490> racists<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.420> farm<00:02:39.690> field

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
now we have racists on the farm field

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.770 
now we have racists on the farm field
against<00:02:41.340> other<00:02:41.490> field<00:02:41.820> cars<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.390> stuff<00:02:42.570> and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
against other field cars and stuff and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.680 
against other field cars and stuff and
it<00:02:42.840> always<00:02:43.140> loses<00:02:43.590> against<00:02:44.100> most<00:02:44.310> cars

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
it always loses against most cars

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.150 
it always loses against most cars
problem<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.380> never<00:02:46.560> stops<00:02:47.010> spinning

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
problem is it just never stops spinning

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.840 
problem is it just never stops spinning
off-road<00:02:48.140> dirt<00:02:49.140> gravel<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:50.040> doesn't<00:02:50.370> matter

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
off-road dirt gravel it doesn't matter

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.030 
off-road dirt gravel it doesn't matter
the<00:02:51.630> driver<00:02:51.840> car<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.260> doesn't<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.650> fun<00:02:52.890> you

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
got to actually be on pavement or it

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:02.270 
got to actually be on pavement or it
just<00:02:55.020> loses<00:02:55.290> every<00:02:55.860> race<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.920> guess<00:03:02.100> I'll

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
just loses every race so I guess I'll

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.470 
just loses every race so I guess I'll
put<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.490> away<00:03:02.580> for<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> little<00:03:03.270> while
