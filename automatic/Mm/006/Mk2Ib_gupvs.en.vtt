right on around and again it's gonna
leave<00:04:08.019> me<00:04:08.169> about<00:04:08.410> two-thirds<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:09.280> put<00:04:09.970> in<00:04:10.180> a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
leave me about two-thirds to put in a

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.150 
leave me about two-thirds to put in a
head<00:04:11.500> now<00:04:11.709> I'm<00:04:12.069> typical<00:04:12.519> sculpin<00:04:13.090> patterns<00:04:13.449> I

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
head now I'm typical sculpin patterns I

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.560 
head now I'm typical sculpin patterns I
usually<00:04:15.160> like<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.879> a<00:04:15.940> little<00:04:16.120> bit<00:04:16.299> longer

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
usually like it a little bit longer

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.029 
usually like it a little bit longer
because<00:04:16.780> if<00:04:17.199> you<00:04:17.289> look<00:04:17.500> at<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.680> stickleback

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
because if you look at the stickleback

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.890 
because if you look at the stickleback
on<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.400> sculpin<00:04:18.760> i<00:04:18.940> reach<00:04:19.389> in<00:04:19.599> with<00:04:19.720> my

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
on the sculpin i reach in with my

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.380 
on the sculpin i reach in with my
scissors<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.470> i<00:04:20.530> actually<00:04:20.709> cut<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.430> with<00:04:22.210> the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
scissors and i actually cut it with the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.360 
scissors and i actually cut it with the
edge<00:04:22.539> of<00:04:22.570> my<00:04:22.750> cesare<00:04:23.140> not<00:04:23.260> cut<00:04:23.469> it<00:04:23.590> off<00:04:23.740> that

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
edge of my cesare not cut it off that

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.600 
edge of my cesare not cut it off that
allows<00:04:24.849> us<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:25.150> be

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
allows us to be

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.059 
allows us to be
paper<00:04:26.060> taper<00:04:26.689> right<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.110> through<00:04:27.379> okay<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:27.919> it

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 
paper taper right on through okay so it

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.040 
paper taper right on through okay so it
gives<00:04:28.250> me<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.430> nice<00:04:28.699> signal<00:04:29.479> back<00:04:29.780> going

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
gives me a nice signal back going

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.790 
gives me a nice signal back going
