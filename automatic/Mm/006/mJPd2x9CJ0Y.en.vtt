small box and a couple PC fans now you
can<00:00:37.390> get<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.600> pc<00:00:37.930> fans<00:00:38.200> at<00:00:38.380> the<00:00:38.470> store<00:00:38.739> but<00:00:39.220> i

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
can get the pc fans at the store but i

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.770 
can get the pc fans at the store but i
just<00:00:39.550> so<00:00:39.670> happen<00:00:39.700> to<00:00:39.970> have<00:00:40.090> a<00:00:40.180> dead<00:00:40.450> unit

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
just so happen to have a dead unit

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.000 
just so happen to have a dead unit
laying<00:00:40.930> around<00:00:41.050> that<00:00:41.380> i<00:00:41.440> pulled<00:00:41.710> them<00:00:41.800> out<00:00:41.949> of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
laying around that i pulled them out of

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.890 
laying around that i pulled them out of
I'm<00:00:42.370> also<00:00:42.640> gonna<00:00:42.850> wire<00:00:43.090> everything<00:00:43.449> up<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.870> a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
I'm also gonna wire everything up to a

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.390 
I'm also gonna wire everything up to a
switch<00:00:44.199> that<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.470> got<00:00:44.650> at<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.770> electronics

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
switch that I got at the electronics

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.070 
switch that I got at the electronics
store<00:00:45.460> because<00:00:46.059> it<00:00:46.180> makes<00:00:46.330> it<00:00:46.480> much<00:00:46.660> easier<00:00:46.930> to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
store because it makes it much easier to

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.720 
store because it makes it much easier to
turn<00:00:47.350> on<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:47.770> off<00:00:47.830> the<00:00:48.190> first<00:00:48.460> order<00:00:48.699> of

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
turn on and off the first order of

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.220 
turn on and off the first order of
business<00:00:48.850> is<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.360> cut<00:00:49.510> some<00:00:49.720> holes<00:00:49.900> for<00:00:50.080> the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
business is to cut some holes for the

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.650 
business is to cut some holes for the
fans<00:00:50.559> we<00:00:51.160> need<00:00:51.340> to<00:00:51.430> make<00:00:51.550> an<00:00:51.670> intake<00:00:52.059> and<00:00:52.330> an

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
fans we need to make an intake and an

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.750 
fans we need to make an intake and an
outtake<00:00:52.840> standard<00:00:53.800> hardware<00:00:54.190> applies<00:00:54.520> I'm

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
outtake standard hardware applies I'm

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.790 
outtake standard hardware applies I'm
going<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.239> be<00:00:55.330> using<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.780> makeshift<00:00:56.350> dremel

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
going to be using a makeshift dremel

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.350 
going to be using a makeshift dremel
tool<00:00:56.980> here<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.370> then<00:00:57.880> I'm<00:00:58.000> going<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.149> cut

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
tool here and then I'm going to cut

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.970 
tool here and then I'm going to cut
these<00:00:58.480> holes<00:00:58.540> out<00:00:58.930> if<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.380> don't<00:00:59.470> have<00:00:59.590> that

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
these holes out if you don't have that

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.590 
these holes out if you don't have that
laying<00:01:00.250> around<00:01:00.340> you<00:01:00.790> can<00:01:00.940> always<00:01:01.149> improvise

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
laying around you can always improvise

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.510 
laying around you can always improvise
and<00:01:02.050> cut<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.380> holes<00:01:02.559> out<00:01:02.739> some<00:01:03.040> other<00:01:03.220> way

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.040 

then<00:01:06.520> I'll<00:01:06.820> do<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.149> same<00:01:07.180> thing<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.899> the<00:01:08.020> other

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
then I'll do the same thing to the other

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.760 
then I'll do the same thing to the other
side<00:01:08.229> as<00:01:08.560> well<00:01:09.810> when<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.080> done<00:01:11.259> we're

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
side as well when this is done we're

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.200 
side as well when this is done we're
almost<00:01:11.800> ready<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.250> move<00:01:12.399> on<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.729> next<00:01:13.000> step

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
almost ready to move on to the next step

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.300 
almost ready to move on to the next step
now<00:01:13.420> that<00:01:13.840> our<00:01:14.050> holes<00:01:14.259> are<00:01:14.470> cut<00:01:14.680> we're<00:01:15.070> going

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
now that our holes are cut we're going

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.700 
now that our holes are cut we're going
to<00:01:15.399> put<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.850> fans<00:01:16.149> on<00:01:16.360> top<00:01:16.690> of<00:01:16.899> them<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.259> seal

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
to put the fans on top of them and seal

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.650 
to put the fans on top of them and seal
them<00:01:17.860> down<00:01:18.100> I'm<00:01:18.340> going<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.610> use<00:01:18.759> hot<00:01:19.000> glue<00:01:19.030> but

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
them down I'm going to use hot glue but

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.999 
them down I'm going to use hot glue but
you<00:01:19.750> could<00:01:19.930> easily<00:01:20.170> improvise<00:01:20.800> with

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
you could easily improvise with

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.920 
you could easily improvise with
something<00:01:21.250> like<00:01:21.430> superglue<00:01:22.000> maybe<00:01:22.660> even

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
something like superglue maybe even

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.660 
something like superglue maybe even
Elmer's<00:01:23.440> if<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.680> put<00:01:23.860> enough<00:01:24.039> on<00:01:24.220> there<00:01:24.520> and

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
Elmer's if you put enough on there and

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.400 
Elmer's if you put enough on there and
here's<00:01:25.240> our<00:01:25.390> unit<00:01:25.660> with<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.869> two<00:01:26.080> fans

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
here's our unit with the two fans

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.650 
here's our unit with the two fans
mounted<00:01:26.890> right<00:01:27.070> on<00:01:27.130> top<00:01:27.520> now<00:01:28.240> it's<00:01:28.450> time<00:01:28.630> to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
mounted right on top now it's time to

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.690 
mounted right on top now it's time to
move<00:01:28.899> on<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.289> wiring<00:01:29.530> process<00:01:30.160> first<00:01:30.550> we

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
move on to the wiring process first we

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.190 
move on to the wiring process first we
need<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.940> connect<00:01:31.209> the<00:01:31.240> fans<00:01:31.539> cables<00:01:31.929> together

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
need to connect the fans cables together

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.480 
need to connect the fans cables together
we're<00:01:32.619> then<00:01:32.740> going<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.979> head<00:01:33.100> over<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.369> the

we're then going to head over to the

we're then going to head over to the
switch<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.030> tie<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.539> red<00:01:34.810> cables<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.740> ACC
