 greetings another video back from 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.900
 vacation and the depression of after 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.730
 vacation as always is a video of 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.930
 Greetings but like this time we are not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.650
 as many as last week as the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.520
 I will do in the end 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.160
 First of all, explain the title of 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.890
 the video well in the video is 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.320
 Nuclear title of the fucking guiri more than 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.910
 nothing because there was a guiri that clear 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.640
 as we do not know let's take uve 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.400
 sachs because there are times when there is a dike 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.190
 It is not very bad and so it takes advantage of 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.630
 that this as your grief and uncle no no no 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.120
 I think nothing but swarm 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.620
 uncles canine unit that is like that and then I 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.240
 I thought the game was over and 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.180
 that I did not get the nuclear one so I 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.940
 shit your everything that bobs on it and 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.229
 good in a lot of related things 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.050
 with him since he thought that he has not 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.100
 removed is a nuclear a bit slow 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.840
 not nuclear moved with the 94 almost like 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.660
 I was always playing with keko and 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.030
 Netherlands think anyone else is me 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.710
 forget someone tell me and it was a 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.890
 quite pretty good game I do not know if 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.600
 I made a 55 4 and about 9,000 points the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.440
 true that 9,000 points without domain is 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 a burrada are enough points 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.720
 and good the video today I also take advantage 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.950
 to recommend a channel that is between 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.650
 bugs that you will have a description 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.090
 which is about animals explains you 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.430
 animal things and they have told me if 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.200
 he could tell his channel since they have few 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.630
 subscribers and the benefits will go 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.120
 intended for a protective 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.610
 of animals so go through the channel 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.580
 and it's a good cause and the animals 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.800
 they need help and these guys because the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.950
 they will also help that the channel 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.530
 molina hd is going to make a few draws 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.780
 He told me that whenever it's 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.640
 more in the channel that was 250 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.110
 approximately because he wants to avoid 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.720
 I know how many things also happen for your 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.440
 channel and tell you also a news 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.330

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.900
