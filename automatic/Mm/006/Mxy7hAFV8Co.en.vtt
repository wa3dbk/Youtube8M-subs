00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
that even though we're mother and

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.460 
that even though we're mother and
daughter<00:03:55.700> we<00:03:55.940> can't<00:03:56.209> go<00:03:56.630> on<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.930> same<00:03:57.170> server

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
daughter we can't go on the same server

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.550 
daughter we can't go on the same server
and<00:03:57.739> play<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.600> we'll<00:03:59.780> have<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.079> figure<00:04:00.260> out<00:04:00.530> a

and play so we'll have to figure out a

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.170 
and play so we'll have to figure out a
different<00:04:00.799> way<00:04:01.040> maybe<00:04:01.130> we<00:04:01.579> can<00:04:01.700> just<00:04:01.820> hang<00:04:02.030> out

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
different way maybe we can just hang out

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.580
