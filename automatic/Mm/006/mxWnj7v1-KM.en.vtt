than the image on your screen we see a
new<00:00:29.560> kind<00:00:29.740> of<00:00:29.890> aircraft<00:00:30.040> very<00:00:30.550> clearly

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
new kind of aircraft very clearly

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.780 
new kind of aircraft very clearly
4runner<00:00:31.540> in<00:00:31.750> origin<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.259> Spartan<00:00:32.770> 4<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.219> then

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
4runner in origin a Spartan 4 and then

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.150 
4runner in origin a Spartan 4 and then
this<00:00:34.180> guy<00:00:34.450> like<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.410> aircraft<00:00:35.770> he's<00:00:35.950> very

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
this guy like the aircraft he's very

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.310 
this guy like the aircraft he's very
clearly<00:00:36.609> a<00:00:36.640> forerunner<00:00:37.030> origin<00:00:37.629> but<00:00:37.989> unlike

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
clearly a forerunner origin but unlike

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.229 
clearly a forerunner origin but unlike
anything<00:00:38.620> we've<00:00:38.920> really<00:00:39.160> seen<00:00:39.399> before<00:00:39.429> he

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
anything we've really seen before he

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.270 
anything we've really seen before he
strongly<00:00:40.690> resembles<00:00:41.109> the<00:00:41.199> Didact<00:00:41.620> but<00:00:41.859> a<00:00:42.010> bit

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
strongly resembles the Didact but a bit

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.759 
strongly resembles the Didact but a bit
too<00:00:42.309> small<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:43.510> what<00:00:43.719> is<00:00:43.899> he<00:00:44.050> while<00:00:44.499> we<00:00:44.620> don't

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
too small so what is he while we don't

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.770 
too small so what is he while we don't
have<00:00:44.890> many<00:00:45.100> definitive<00:00:45.699> details<00:00:46.089> we<00:00:46.449> do<00:00:46.629> know

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
have many definitive details we do know

forerunner warrior servant there's
plenty<00:00:59.649> of<00:00:59.710> indication<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.370> there<00:01:00.550> are

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
plenty of indication that there are

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.160 
plenty of indication that there are
other<00:01:00.940> surviving<00:01:01.510> forerunners<00:01:02.019> in<00:01:02.050> the

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
universe only time will tell though I'm

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.030 
universe only time will tell though I'm
leaning<00:01:04.690> more<00:01:05.019> towards<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.470> guy<00:01:05.620> being<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.920> new

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
leaning more towards the guy being a new

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.399 
leaning more towards the guy being a new
type<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.280> Promethean<00:01:06.940> robot<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.600> course<00:01:08.170> that

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
type of Promethean robot of course that

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.530 
type of Promethean robot of course that
begs<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.799> question<00:01:09.189> where<00:01:09.670> did<00:01:09.790> it<00:01:09.820> come<00:01:10.119> from

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
begs the question where did it come from

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.600 
begs the question where did it come from
well<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.320> entry<00:01:11.649> for<00:01:11.829> the<00:01:11.890> Promethean<00:01:12.430> Knight

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
well the entry for the Promethean Knight

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.609 
well the entry for the Promethean Knight
provides<00:01:13.060> something<00:01:13.750> of<00:01:13.869> an<00:01:13.960> answer<00:01:14.229> while

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
provides something of an answer while

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.560 
provides something of an answer while
the<00:01:14.710> current<00:01:14.890> UNSC<00:01:15.610> has<00:01:15.820> only<00:01:16.030> recorded

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
the current UNSC has only recorded

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.600 
the current UNSC has only recorded
encounters<00:01:17.020> with<00:01:17.200> four<00:01:17.439> specific<00:01:17.950> variations

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
encounters with four specific variations

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.580 
encounters with four specific variations
of<00:01:18.729> Promethean<00:01:19.299> Knight<00:01:19.509> it<00:01:19.750> can<00:01:20.200> be<00:01:20.320> inferred

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
of Promethean Knight it can be inferred

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.080 
of Promethean Knight it can be inferred
that<00:01:20.770> there<00:01:20.890> might<00:01:21.070> potentially<00:01:21.399> be<00:01:21.729> further

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
that there might potentially be further

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.060 
that there might potentially be further
variations<00:01:22.810> designed<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.439> fill<00:01:23.680> more

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
variations designed to fill more

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.459 
variations designed to fill more
specialized<00:01:24.579> roles<00:01:24.909> in<00:01:25.329> short<00:01:25.990> there<00:01:26.289> could

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
specialized roles in short there could

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.039 
specialized roles in short there could
be<00:01:26.500> untold<00:01:27.460> varieties<00:01:28.119> of<00:01:28.149> Prometheans<00:01:28.869> that

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
be untold varieties of Prometheans that

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.020 
be untold varieties of Prometheans that
we<00:01:29.140> have<00:01:29.229> yet<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.469> encounter<00:01:29.700> much<00:01:30.700> like<00:01:30.909> how

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
we have yet to encounter much like how

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.789 
we have yet to encounter much like how

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
343 could just as easily add new

this new guy while I was excited at
first<00:01:44.109> I<00:01:44.350> can't<00:01:44.619> really<00:01:44.740> say<00:01:45.039> that<00:01:45.070> that

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
first I can't really say that that

first I can't really say that that
lasted<00:01:45.909> really<00:01:46.359> it's<00:01:46.659> just<00:01:46.780> another<00:01:47.140> humanoid

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740
