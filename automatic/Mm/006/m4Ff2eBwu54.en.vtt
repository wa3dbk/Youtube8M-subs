00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.890 
every single one of these young ladies
have<00:02:32.130> dreamed<00:02:32.580> about<00:02:32.760> since<00:02:33.390> they<00:02:33.630> first

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
have dreamed about since they first

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.930 
have dreamed about since they first
walked<00:02:34.200> into<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.590> gym<00:02:37.370> shayla<00:02:38.370> worley<00:02:38.519> on

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
walked into that gym shayla worley on

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.220 
walked into that gym shayla worley on
the<00:02:39.150> vault<00:02:39.390> where<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.630> can<00:02:39.750> she's<00:02:39.959> going<00:02:40.140> to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
the vault where you can she's going to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.080 
the vault where you can she's going to
fit<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.410> Elfie<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.950> know<00:02:41.070> she<00:02:41.489> key<00:02:41.730> fit<00:02:41.940> in

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
fit in Elfie you know she key fit in

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.479 
fit in Elfie you know she key fit in
beautifully<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.930> events<00:02:43.800> like<00:02:43.920> uneven<00:02:44.130> bars

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
beautifully on events like uneven bars

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.100 
beautifully on events like uneven bars
and<00:02:44.790> balance<00:02:45.120> being<00:02:45.300> because<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.660> think<00:02:45.930> that's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
and balance being because I think that's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.890 
and balance being because I think that's
her<00:02:46.470> artistry<00:02:47.040> an<00:02:47.310> event<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.819> this<00:02:48.120> vault

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
her artistry an event like this vault

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.110 
her artistry an event like this vault
this<00:02:49.110> isn't<00:02:49.560> an<00:02:49.709> extremely<00:02:50.340> difficult<00:02:50.550> vault

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
this isn't an extremely difficult vault

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.759 
this isn't an extremely difficult vault
I<00:02:51.269> think<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.569> Americans<00:02:52.080> have<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.440> put<00:02:52.620> up

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
I think the Americans have to put up

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.009 
I think the Americans have to put up
much<00:02:53.040> stronger<00:02:53.730> much<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:54.150> difficult<00:02:54.450> bolts

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
much stronger much more difficult bolts

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.949 
much stronger much more difficult bolts
than<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.350> it's<00:02:55.920> only<00:02:56.160> valued<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.120> 5.5

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
than this it's only valued out of a 5.5

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.870 
than this it's only valued out of a 5.5
blind<00:02:58.739> landing<00:02:58.980> makes<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.489> really<00:02:59.760> difficult

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
blind landing makes it really difficult

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.720 
blind landing makes it really difficult
to<00:03:00.390> stick<00:03:00.750> she<00:03:01.470> knows<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.549> is

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
where she struggles a little bit she's

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.380 
where she struggles a little bit she's
got<00:03:04.170> some<00:03:04.620> weak<00:03:04.799> form<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.269> obviously
