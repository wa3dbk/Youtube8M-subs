when<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.920> comes<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> considering<00:00:50.490> your<00:00:50.700> frame

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
when it comes to considering your frame

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.130 
when it comes to considering your frame
I<00:00:51.120> recommend<00:00:51.420> shooting<00:00:51.630> a<00:00:51.660> nice<00:00:51.780> wide<00:00:52.110> angle

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
I recommend shooting a nice wide angle

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.870 
I recommend shooting a nice wide angle
landscape<00:00:52.950> with<00:00:53.070> nothing<00:00:53.400> in<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:53.580> foreground

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
landscape with nothing in the foreground

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.730 
landscape with nothing in the foreground
also<00:00:54.780> consider<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.260> move

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
also consider your move

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.930 
also consider your move
what's<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.040> start<00:00:56.310> point<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.640> what's<00:00:56.850> your

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
what's your start point and what's your

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.310 
what's your start point and what's your
end<00:00:57.090> point<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.450> to<00:00:57.540> be<00:00:57.630> make<00:00:58.080> sure<00:00:58.200> you're

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
end point going to be make sure you're

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.570 
end point going to be make sure you're
gonna<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.560> no<00:00:58.680> complications<00:00:59.280> before<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
gonna have no complications before you

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.310 
gonna have no complications before you
actually<00:00:59.670> start<00:00:59.850> shooting<00:01:00.390> when<00:01:01.170> shooting

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
actually start shooting when shooting

actually start shooting when shooting
long<00:01:01.620> exposures<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.310> does<00:01:02.430> become<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.670> little

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
long exposures it does become a little

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.399 
long exposures it does become a little
bit<00:01:02.910> more<00:01:03.030> tricky<00:01:03.240> you<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.660> absolutely<00:01:03.990> need

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
I get the correct exposure once I frame

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.379 
I get the correct exposure once I frame
to<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:49.499> shot<00:01:49.799> hit<00:01:50.310> my<00:01:50.399> shot<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.609> button<00:01:50.909> now<00:01:51.270> this

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
to my shot hit my shot a button now this

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:52.429 
to my shot hit my shot a button now this
is<00:01:51.479> why<00:01:51.569> I<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> use<00:01:51.899> my<00:01:52.049> intervalometer

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
is why I have to use my intervalometer

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.499 
is why I have to use my intervalometer
because<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> two-second<00:01:53.549> exposure<00:01:53.609> as<00:01:54.299> soon<00:01:54.450> as

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
because a two-second exposure as soon as

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.179 
because a two-second exposure as soon as
I<00:01:54.569> hit<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:54.810> shutter<00:01:55.170> button<00:01:55.469> I<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.069> bit

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
I hit my shutter button I like the bit

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.319 
I hit my shutter button I like the bit
camera<00:01:56.459> shake<00:01:56.639> which<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:56.999> produce<00:01:57.119> an

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
camera shake which will produce an

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.199 
camera shake which will produce an
unsharp<00:01:57.810> image<00:01:58.139> so<00:01:58.740> instead<00:01:59.039> I<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.999> to<00:02:00.119> use

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
unsharp image so instead I like to use

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.300 
unsharp image so instead I like to use
my<00:02:00.240> intervalometer<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:01.020> set<00:02:01.770> my<00:02:01.889> interval

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
my intervalometer here set my interval

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.609 
my intervalometer here set my interval
to<00:02:02.429> about<00:02:02.639> 12<00:02:02.969> seconds<00:02:03.389> so<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:04.139> I<00:02:04.170> hit<00:02:04.319> start

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to about 12 seconds so when I hit start

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.139 
to about 12 seconds so when I hit start
the<00:02:04.920> remote<00:02:05.130> will<00:02:05.249> automatically<00:02:05.759> fire<00:02:05.939> the

the remote will automatically fire the
camera<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.139> have<00:02:07.289> ten<00:02:07.499> seconds<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.100> pick

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
camera and then have ten seconds to pick

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.940 
camera and then have ten seconds to pick

up my camera move my tripod reframe up

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.040 
up my camera move my tripod reframe up
and<00:02:11.430> leave<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.120> don't<00:02:12.599> ever<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.959> touch

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and leave it I don't ever have to touch

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.059 
and leave it I don't ever have to touch
the<00:02:13.230> shutter<00:02:13.349> button<00:02:13.650> again<00:02:13.709> because<00:02:14.010> the

the shutter button again because the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.140 
the shutter button again because the
remote<00:02:14.250> will<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.849> me

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
remote will do it for me

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.180 
remote will do it for me
when<00:02:15.930> continuing<00:02:16.319> your<00:02:16.410> move<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.920> could<00:02:17.069> use

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
when continuing your move you could use

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.740 
when continuing your move you could use
a<00:02:17.220> bit<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.430> chalk<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.910> floor<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.360> evilly

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
a bit of chalk on the floor and evilly

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.240 
a bit of chalk on the floor and evilly
mark<00:02:18.959> out<00:02:19.140> distances<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:19.830> when<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.040> move<00:02:20.130> your

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
mark out distances so when you move your

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.620 
mark out distances so when you move your
tripod<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.670> know<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:20.849> going<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.000> be<00:02:21.090> exact<00:02:21.420> I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
tripod you know it's going to be exact I

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.690 
tripod you know it's going to be exact I
simply<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.650> use<00:02:22.890> my<00:02:23.010> shoe<00:02:23.280> because<00:02:23.640> I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
simply like to use my shoe because I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.250 
simply like to use my shoe because I
know<00:02:23.760> it's<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.000> consistent<00:02:24.480> size<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.230> I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
know it's a consistent size so I

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.720 
know it's a consistent size so I
typically<00:02:25.650> pick<00:02:25.860> up<00:02:25.980> my<00:02:26.040> tripod<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.460> move<00:02:26.610> it

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
typically pick up my tripod and move it

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.100 
typically pick up my tripod and move it
a<00:02:26.850> shoe<00:02:27.150> length<00:02:27.330> or<00:02:27.540> half

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
a shoe length or half

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.390 
a shoe length or half
depending<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.680> how<00:02:28.770> many<00:02:28.830> shots<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.190> want<00:02:29.340> to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
depending on how many shots I want to

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.540 
depending on how many shots I want to
take<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:30.560> then<00:02:31.560> bring<00:02:31.710> all<00:02:31.920> my<00:02:32.070> shots<00:02:32.280> into

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
take I then bring all my shots into

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.920 
take I then bring all my shots into
Adobe<00:02:32.790> Lightroom<00:02:32.940> 5<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> bit<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.840> editing

Adobe Lightroom 5 for a bit of editing
now<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.710> don't<00:02:34.830> have<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.220> do<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.610> can

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
now I don't have to do this I can

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.370 
now I don't have to do this I can
actually<00:02:35.820> skip<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.270> step<00:02:36.450> completely<00:02:37.020> and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
actually skip this step completely and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.750 
actually skip this step completely and
go<00:02:37.470> straight<00:02:37.620> into<00:02:37.710> my<00:02:37.860> editing<00:02:38.100> software<00:02:38.310> but

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
go straight into my editing software but

go straight into my editing software but
as<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.970> started<00:02:39.180> raw<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.990> could<00:02:40.140> push<00:02:40.260> my

as I started raw and I could push my
images<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> little<00:02:41.160> bit<00:02:41.250> further<00:02:41.460> without

stabilization<00:05:03.150> we'll<00:05:03.720> zoom<00:05:03.960> in<00:05:04.110> on<00:05:04.229> the<00:05:04.349> image

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
stabilization we'll zoom in on the image

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.140 
stabilization we'll zoom in on the image
ever<00:05:04.710> so<00:05:04.889> slightly<00:05:05.099> and<00:05:05.400> then<00:05:05.580> we<00:05:05.669> no<00:05:05.789> loss<00:05:05.970> in

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
ever so slightly and then we no loss in

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.719 
ever so slightly and then we no loss in
quality<00:05:07.099> so<00:05:08.099> I'm<00:05:08.159> just<00:05:08.310> going<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.520> label<00:05:08.610> the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
quality so I'm just going to label the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:09.800 
quality so I'm just going to label the
hyperlapse<00:05:09.030> looks<00:05:09.300> like<00:05:09.419> without<00:05:09.599> any

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
hyperlapse looks like without any

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.140 
hyperlapse looks like without any
stabilization<00:05:10.770> done<00:05:10.919> so<00:05:11.159> I'll<00:05:11.250> go<00:05:11.430> here<00:05:11.699> hit

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
stabilization done so I'll go here hit

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.450 
stabilization done so I'll go here hit
Ram<00:05:12.360> preview<00:05:12.740> so<00:05:13.740> this<00:05:13.889> is<00:05:13.979> what<00:05:14.069> my<00:05:14.159> hatbox

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
Ram preview so this is what my hatbox

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.100 
Ram preview so this is what my hatbox
looks<00:05:14.729> like<00:05:14.909> without<00:05:15.180> any<00:05:15.389> stabilization

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
looks like without any stabilization

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.869 
looks like without any stabilization
don't<00:05:16.289> see<00:05:16.650> it's<00:05:16.800> quite<00:05:16.889> jittery<00:05:17.400> but

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
don't see it's quite jittery but

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.059 
don't see it's quite jittery but
generally<00:05:18.240> pretty<00:05:18.599> good

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
generally pretty good

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.409 
generally pretty good
suddenly<00:05:20.069> the<00:05:20.190> stupid<00:05:20.550> song<00:05:20.909> keeps<00:05:21.120> going<00:05:21.300> in

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
suddenly the stupid song keeps going in

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:22.909 
suddenly the stupid song keeps going in
and<00:05:21.569> out<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:21.990> might<00:05:22.199> actually<00:05:22.319> start<00:05:22.680> from<00:05:22.830> a

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
and out so I might actually start from a

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.350 
and out so I might actually start from a
little<00:05:23.159> bit<00:05:23.250> further<00:05:23.550> on<00:05:23.759> so<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.210> that

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
little bit further on so that that

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.020 
little bit further on so that that
doesn't<00:05:24.509> affect<00:05:24.690> our<00:05:25.199> hyperlapse<00:05:25.979> about<00:05:26.639> here

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
doesn't affect our hyperlapse about here

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.390 
doesn't affect our hyperlapse about here
so<00:05:27.840> when<00:05:28.500> I<00:05:28.560> go<00:05:28.680> over<00:05:28.889> to<00:05:28.949> my<00:05:29.069> effects<00:05:29.280> and

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
so when I go over to my effects and

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.570 
so when I go over to my effects and
presets<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.940> warp<00:05:30.569> stabiliser<00:05:31.500> so<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.430> can

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
presets you warp stabiliser so I can

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.430 
presets you warp stabiliser so I can
drop<00:05:32.699> that<00:05:32.819> on<00:05:32.940> which<00:05:33.389> warp<00:05:33.930> stabilizer<00:05:34.319> is

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
drop that on which warp stabilizer is

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.050 
drop that on which warp stabilizer is
now<00:05:34.530> going<00:05:34.710> to<00:05:34.800> analyze<00:05:35.190> all<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.669> information

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
now going to analyze all the information

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.879 
now going to analyze all the information

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
don't have to stabilize manually I'm

don't have to stabilize manually I'm
just<00:05:49.680> going<00:05:49.800> show<00:05:49.889> you<00:05:49.919> how<00:05:50.069> to<00:05:50.130> do<00:05:50.340> that<00:05:50.810> and

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
just going show you how to do that and

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.430 
just going show you how to do that and
just<00:05:52.440> hide<00:05:52.949> warp<00:05:53.310> stabilizer<00:05:53.789> for<00:05:54.000> now<00:05:54.440> get

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
just hide warp stabilizer for now get

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.860 
just hide warp stabilizer for now get
your<00:05:55.710> track<00:05:55.889> here<00:05:56.159> and<00:05:56.909> you<00:05:57.029> click<00:05:57.150> stabilize

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870

so<00:06:00.900> you<00:06:00.990> get<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.229> tracking<00:06:01.620> points<00:06:02.029> you<00:06:03.029> drag

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
so you get to tracking points you drag

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.490 
so you get to tracking points you drag
these<00:06:03.449> tracking<00:06:03.659> boats<00:06:03.870> over<00:06:04.110> to<00:06:04.259> a<00:06:04.289> feature

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
these tracking boats over to a feature

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.719 
these tracking boats over to a feature
that's<00:06:04.770> common<00:06:05.099> throughout<00:06:05.279> the<00:06:05.430> entire

that I simply click analyze forward it's

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.149 
that I simply click analyze forward it's
a<00:06:24.090> little<00:06:24.330> bit<00:06:24.419> of<00:06:24.509> a<00:06:24.569> slower<00:06:24.840> process<00:06:25.050> and<00:06:25.650> you

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
a little bit of a slower process and you

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:27.589 
a little bit of a slower process and you
