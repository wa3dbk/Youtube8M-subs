00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.320
 how about friends how have they been i am 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.629
 ryder here with another video more and this time 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.270
 for a little review of what is the 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.220
 new textures package if it destroys you 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.100
 I'm a little over the throat but 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.390
 try again to talk a little and then 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.919
 I just want to show you for 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.499
 people who are not yet downloaded this 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.329
 package because it is I recommend it 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.669
 very much right now I have a 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.009
 $ 100 no armor armor 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.579
 this texture pack is fine 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.469
 I think that the 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.199
 here are the armors this is coming 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.579
 being that of the leather and the 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.179
 diamond that he is making with a 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.699
 army of the first the golden one overcoming 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.070
 like firefighters and this I do not know that in 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.689
 reality is and it catches my attention 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.489
 is this rope that is being like a 

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:55.250
 tie bag and we all see 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.409
 we see that the structures look 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.359
 quite well as I had already said in the 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.189
 previous video outline this package 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.519
 it's being more than everything for 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:08.869
 constructions that of 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.310
 cities houses things like that but the truth 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.520
 I like it very much, I think it makes the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.069
 second package that I like about 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.630
 all those who have left and around here 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.569
 I have some things prepared for 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.850
 show them and this I did with the help of 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:24.979
 some friends that when I was doing 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.330
 this they accidentally joined 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.570
 I had the game as 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.560
 to get more people 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.440
 well sir a friend who was this 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.990
 I think iron grabs apologize because 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.840
 I walk a little more than the throat is a 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.730
 it was grasp of the sud enter the other 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.610
 friend I do not remember at this time your 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.890
 name but they have come to help me 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.260
 put all those blocks because I wanted it 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.470
 be to show you what is being 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.570
 this the new structures of the items 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.990
 as we can see here we have the the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.960
 envelopes in this manner will now see by 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.299
 here we have him 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.300
 music block is being 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.459
 as a speaker you can see this very well 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.620
 That's what I said is being more 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.530
 everything to build these 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.430
 structures and they are being like 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.610
 more ways for a house as there were 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.170
 said in the previous video that something 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.750
 that had caught my attention 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.750
 what was it about the lamps 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.819
 here is this is the blog are if what 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.280
 we put for example suppose that this 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.980
 is a roof and we put it there because 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.150
 it's pretty pro and that's what I 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.920
 It caught my attention and that has 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.870
 liked quite that the blog are now 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.790
 It's like a lamp 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.310
 pretty pretty 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.049
 and the others as you can see the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.239
 structures everything is being for 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.489
 build the wool have some 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.040
 pretty good structures like 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.819
 bricks and can be combined very well 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.560
 in a building or a house 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.439
 if the truth is pretty good 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.569
 packages and I think it's worth to 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:14.659
 buy it as I said it costs a dollar 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.740
 in the package here I put 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.930
 what is the oven 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.630
 here we see the chest that is quite 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.690
 pretty the enchantment table and the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.540
 character table the tights as they come 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.990
 being equal the little boat here is 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.600
 put a little bee put in there and then for 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.670
 here we have two paintings the tables that 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.440
 they come as they give us the form of 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.810
 one clock other than an oven or a 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.090
 fireplace of those modern one 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.010
 computer creepers pigs and good is 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.900
 It's pretty enough but those are 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.410
 I liked parents very much here 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.810
 we have some portions and bottles and 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.000
 well over here we have the bed that is 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.760
 it's pretty good the doors that I 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.860
 They liked it a lot and we see the 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.380
 portal that looks with a different effect 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.210
 I really like how it looks too 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.130
 this lamp caught my attention 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.770
 bright that looks pretty good 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.280
 I really liked the cane, too, how 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.620
 you see here we have it and now we're going 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.550
 to see a little of what is doing 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.500
 other things can see the little heads 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.750
 they have changed a little bit not so much 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.910
 but yes 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.220
 I think that's all the truth is 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.950
 pretty good package and I hope you know what 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.420
 buy, it's really pretty good and 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.660
 Well, I do not hope you liked it 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.940
 this little memory that is not of much 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.550
 importance but what I think there is 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.530
 some people who have not 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.510
 bought yet and I just wanted them 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.220
 recommend it for recording is quite 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.650
 good and good, that's all 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.120
 today I did not upload a map so I'm a 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.370
 little bad throat and I did not have 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.320
 a lot of time and this video is being recorded 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.780
 military of truth but it is sure that 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.100
 tomorrow they will have it good I am I am 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.100
 ryder and until next time
