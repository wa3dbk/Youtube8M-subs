00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi friends from youtube i am your rock friend 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.120
 and hell below I will introduce you 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.120
 the berlin theory 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.920
 in ocarina of time link dark is the 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.810
 subjefe of the water temple that appears 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.420
 as the dark reflection of the link in the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.700
 water the room has the floor covered by 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.460
 a shallow layer of water and in the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.710
 center there is a tree when passing by the side 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.080
 of the tree the reflection of the inc in the water 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.870
 will disappear to appear later as a 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.910
 Spooky clone his voice is the same 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.730
 that the inc's just that with one more tone 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.650
 serious acts as the mirror of the inc 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.840
 imitating all the attacks he makes with 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.180
 the sword so it's hard to damage it 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.980
 with the master sword while the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.360
 continuous battle dark link 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.739
 gradually it becomes less 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.409
 transparent until it's 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.270
 completely opaque when defeated 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.250
 the tree and the illusory pond 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.860
 disappear and the door opens in front 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.080
 to the inc the next room contains 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.659
 the object that this enemy guards 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.790
 dark link long hook is 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.130
 considered one of the most enemies 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.200
 difficult of the game he can 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.240
 counteract the sword attacks of 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.549
 link easily and in fact you can 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.720
 jump on the sword fixing link 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.940
 in its place 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.480
 also if dark link does this while 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.910
 is 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.800
 totally opaque way to attack aline 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.260
 during the brief moment when he jumps to 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.420
 his sword in about a minute 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.460
 It will be semi transparent and will not attack the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.010
 link but still counteract their 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.140
 attacks whenever dark link is 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.420
 reached by an attack through qaeda 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.860
 of the soil and it will materialize again 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.810
 behind the inc 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.030
 however link can accelerate the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.000
 process using dean fire a 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.220
 block attack speak the vigorous sword 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.990
 it also works well in this fight and 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.910
 that the dark inco can not block the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.670
 attacks of this long weapon with much 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.590
 ease the amount of damage needed 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.780
 to defeat the dark inco is equal to 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.970
 current number of heart containers 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.890
 of link so the fight is easier 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.140
 the less containers of heart 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.210
 has link another easy way to 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.790
 defeat him is to shoot him with the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.860
 dark link hook will dodge it and it will be 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.890
 vulnerable to a sword stroke during 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.690
