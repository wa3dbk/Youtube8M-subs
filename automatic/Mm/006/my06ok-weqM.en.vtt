00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.690
 a person needs all this in the video 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.580
 of today is one more way then for gta 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
 san andreas hemose today a way well 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.750
 simple but a lot of people were asking 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.640
 that I live and cover that you will be able 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.510
 the cover behind a wall of a 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.430
 car 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.769
 This generates wherever you want this way is 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.960
 very light very simple is the installation 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.000
 it is very easy and will soon have a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.380
 video here most updated this way 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.210
 it's because a gringo is making a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.219
 much better than the one I'm going 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.649
 for you now but it will only be released 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.030
 at the end of the year so if you are seeing 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.340
 this video long after I 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.410
 I posted it looks at the description maybe already 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.969
 have the video link of a version 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.770
 better than the Guild is doing maybe 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.469
 on his site that he said that at the end 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.449
 of the year but in a much better version but 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.570
 This one here is very good, there are no mistakes. 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.520
 it is very easy installation is not heavy 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.079
 the command is very simple then you 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.789
 I will not have any difficulty 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.949
 and I recommend it to anyone who wants this 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.780
 kind of fashion is and how it always makes a 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.489
 copy of the original gta san files 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.710
 andreas because if you want to remove 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.560
 Your mold is the only way to do it. 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.330
 This is a copy of the files and let's 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.520
 for installation 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.410
 the people now go to the installation 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.170
 here is very simple in the description of the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.610
 video is already the link you download in fashion 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.300
 and you will download in extract as 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.650
 ever 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.200
 by the description of the man in the video I'm going 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.450
 leave a link to a video that shows the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.220
 installation of the bookstore that is the 4 to whom 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.830
 there is going to have to install attack on 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.720
 description is only to follow this video that 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.860
 is the description that you were not 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.990
 Right, right. 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.460
 another notice in the description will also 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.950
 be the link of a program that people 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 will use for installation then you 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.250
 to download the program does not need 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.410
 install the program, just download 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.900
 extract and download a template if you do not 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.910
 It's 44 and I was going to be there too. 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.020
 here the link in the video then 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.670
 let's see there 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.560
 the first thing you will do is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.690
 here, then, in the folder in the way 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.060
 will be in the description and you will arrive 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.940
 here you will see this folder opens 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.680
 copy this file here copy and 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.390
 now we are going to find part 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.640
 of gta san andreas that page which 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.740
 contains all files from cgt to 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.209
 find my voice coalition 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.190
 You, there we go. 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.709
 here is mine this folder that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.930
 You have to find this page and 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.810
 there are all the files coming here 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.670
 You come here in the crel in the open folder 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.739
 and glue against ov 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.300
 That's why you have to have clear 4 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.890
 installed in gta nÃ© 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.040
 if you do not have this page or go 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.500
 There you are, you come back here on the page. 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.959
 gt initial the analyzes just are not you 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.550
 Need more fiddling here so you can 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.860
 close the folder 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.000
 and here in the move from the mold also 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.130
 It's going to close because we're not going 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.709
 use it we'll use it now 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.170
 the program to install in case here 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.000
 this second folder than this first 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.040
 part we've just talked about missing 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.959
 second that has here gt3 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.030
 this file here does not have to be tampered with 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.120
 It's not necessary I did not see 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.640
 need but if any 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.580
 thing asking you to add in gta 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.830
 you copy the file there and paste it into the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.410
 early part of gts years on that page 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.690
 tn all files and paste if the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.060
 I ask for something of the genre, but I 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.239
 probably will not ask can close 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.910
 here so now I will come here 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.410
 program is already here and I have already 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.630
 I told you, they do not need to be there. 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.100
 just open directly through the iconic 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.430
 video download arriga 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.470
 here you see here open and now we 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.140
 again will find part of the gta 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.850
 san andreas is mine, this is the one here 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.380
 this game here that you have to 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.540
 located and have these files here 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.660
 coming to it you will open this folder 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.760

 In this room I clicked on it and it goes now. 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.200
 select the template folder, I already 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.420
 I solved my here is pretty fast 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.000
 this one bets the way you go 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.180
 Finding here opens this door 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 gt3 sanction this file clicks on April 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.910

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:26.010
 tactical that you click she will carry 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.480

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.880
 san andreas, I'm not going to do it here 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.350

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.390
 You do what he's going to carry. 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.210
 it will not make any mistake I assure you that in the case 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.900
 there is only close and the installation was only 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.090
 that 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.800
 Doubts left here in the comments then 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.630

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.400

 It's really working, okay? Come on. 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.540
 staff fits here then gta san andreas 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.200

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.160

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.480
 You will stand if looking at 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.490
