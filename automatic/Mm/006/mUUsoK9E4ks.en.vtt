00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.370
 yes hello I call you because in 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.280
 did I was in transit so in zombies 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.210
 and the bus driver left before 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:52.570
 as I arrive from quillan to horns 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.940
 how in transit so at the stop at 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.920
 the zombie transit stop is actually the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:06.059
 bus driver he honked when he 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:06.059
 saw me and the parties on line 3 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.880
 so I was at transit stop and 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.250
 bus drivers in hymn to sight he has 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.720
 honked and he left usually he 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.490
 does it like that but he waits for me when 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.780
 even where he opens the doors and I 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.030
 run after the bus and I jump in 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.820
 but then that he left the skin to the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:30.340
 doors I do not know because normally 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.229
 the weather all the way round 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.960
 that they go through there closed everything and that 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.460
 I have a little too much time in fact and months 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:43.329
 here in Lille have prepared well I'm going to 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:45.100
 to actually kill you can not 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:51.549
 remember bus more I had taken the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.139
 tower where the turbine is not bad and then 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.700
 in addition I fight on the map I had 

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:55.929
 found there the ladder to go up to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.240
 so I could have at worst 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.679
 run is mounted on the bus but it is 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.679
 really gone too fast this time 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.020
 trucks and if there are the zombies arrive 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.610
 so what I hurry up there are the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.050
 zombies that happens of course as he 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.880
 wants to go there they will have more and 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:29.500
 further down to transit stopping I you 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.490
 assure that there is and then after we pass 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.490
 by serbia all 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.090
 but if in fact I have no gun 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:49.129
 laser so I do not know if I'm going 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:51.879
 able to neutralize them all goodbye 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.879
 but maybe I 'll die 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.890
 king
