00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 I greet you my dear 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.650
 sports friends i'm simon newer 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.629
 muscle mass in this video is about 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.580
 your questions of the week I answer 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.290
 your questions with me in the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.090
 comments below my videos 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.019
 and just pick this one out for me 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.299
 and will again ask your questions 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.039
 This week I found it was yes 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.270
 very exciting videos from me 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.710
 different areas 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 For example, I have a pretty good fight 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.789
 strong video about the masculine whey 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.279
 protein and there of course 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.660
 the question on what does her flair for 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 given this video 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.500
 I tell you honestly for this 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.489
 not even get video at all 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.649
 I did not get anything 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.210
 I was neither animated to this video 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.520
 make of flair but only of you 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.020
 I still have it before or even only 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.969
 someday spoken with flair 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 I just want to keep saying 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.539
 if I try to make such a video 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.309
 I always as factually as possible 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.450
 because it does not help 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.860
 shoot it brings nothing 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.309
 Anything in the sky too 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.199
 praise 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.579
 I will neither be with anyone at 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.020
 I'll lick ass yet 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.160
 get rid of someone just because 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.760
 I do not own these products myself 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.920
 Selling 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.750
 I'm just about the greatest possible 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.910
 factuality and I believe mine 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.920
 I'm really good at this video 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.450
 made so come now to another 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.820
 video which I apparently also good 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.799
 that's what the video did to me 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.330
 is driving in this video I have 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.970
 Just explain it to you like mine 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.369
 attitude to money to happiness to success 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.799
 is and that I just criticize it yes 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.960
 I criticize that is some fitness 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.610
 Yeah, of course, start now, of course 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.030
 These three things I addressed 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.250
 have success and money with each other 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.619
 equate to a wide range 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.479
 cook and sell this wide 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.250
 yes there will be success again and the people 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.650
 brought but the question is he really 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.170
 who succeeds in the end or 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.180
 the one who succeeds will be successful anyway 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.799
 already achieved something about himself as the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.210
 greatest stylized or maybe 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.009
 those who believe I would have to 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.720
 now panting behind and now 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.880
 just like that and exactly that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.470
 I do the same things in person 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.420
 just think it's a pity that we will 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.920
 clear from the subject of fitness we 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.390
 are in the scene sometime too 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.799
 I did not need any prototypes 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.540
 I want to be a role model 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.369
 so just stay the way I am and 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.590
 I think with this opinion stands in 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.479
 the fitness scene relatively alone there 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.819
 Of course, there are many spectators and it 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.869
 Here are over 1000 positive reviews 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.489
 that makes it easy for me as well 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.739
 indicate that the right 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.659
 things have spoken but I'm fine 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.099
 nevertheless, just keep it simple 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.200
 just so the young people among you 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.670
 to say we humans are all 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.590
 human moment as I am with it 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.709
 meant a weak spot and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.989
 While this is for material things and money 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.299
 us can be made very quickly before 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.219
 the money and material is the same 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.989
 and that makes you happy and that 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.609
 that success is and from that you can 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.019
 to cook a wonderful soup 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.819
 I have now in volvo yesterday 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.299
 advertising seen from volvo that's just 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.530
 a car not just for her 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.859
 proletively 1 cars are known or 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.000
 for her in the macho though have this 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.129
 sign of volvo is a bit 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.019
 machohaft whatever 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.760
 even in this ad was exactly 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.549
 These three things are equated 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.709
 Success Luck and money and that's where you talk 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.480
 of course emotions and emotions 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.790
 are always something then that too 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.980
 Mind overworked but I believe there 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.540
 I just have to, I just had to 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.459
 let's get rid of my opinion 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.199
 and that was well received and I will always 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.760
 stand up for this opinion 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.900
 area and I think I have with 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.569
 I really believe this video 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.859
 Some people helped so look now 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.120
 Let's, another video now 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.500
 Maybe you can do some sports 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.810
 to talk a little bit more 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.650
 the reverse curls i have with sarah 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.569
 have made 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.280
 I've found that pretty well 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.959
 and she had a mega before that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.459
 Crisp biceps program and at the end 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.409
 we wanted to do this video again 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.849
 and then she had to do it again 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.379
 really nice to bite through 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.909
 Here is a very interesting question 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.189
 I'm looking for right now because it works 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.829
 namely, pain in the exercise 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:43.530
 short question why does the exercise 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.449
 cool w so between lower and upper arm 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.159
 I suppose very strongly you mean this 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.810
 area of ​​the poor so here 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.569
 this cool as you describe it 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.489
 between upper and lower arm I go 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.009
 assuming that if you look at the 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.479
 Dumbbell bar with weights owns this 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.669
 you then directly with great weight you 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.000
 initially without being done in one up 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.889
 to have 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.810
 without you perhaps also successively in 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.280
 to have increased the weights purely 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.259
 that simply means the weighty one 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.000
 Increase pyramids like with one 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.769
 Small weight in the first sentence of the beginning 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.449
 with the second set then something 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.609
 use larger weight in the third 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:16.480
 or fourth sentence then only to the 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.910
 maximum training weight 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.040
 working on this is my tip warmup and 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.440
 just slowly increase so that yours 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.700
 you get used to these loads of muscle 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.770
 allowed to naturally remember just 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.660
 this cool as you describe it 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.540
 it probably just the zone where the 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.640
 biceps muscle puts on so sets here 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.140
 the biceps he is so with it 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.910
 connected to the rest of the body 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.710
 and if that area of ​​course, too 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.030
 first these loads are not used 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.130
 is not the other way around 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.350
 is made really warm then it can in 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.700
 Worst case even with the demolition 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.230
 of the muscle end 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.910
 I was now with the doctor myself 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.950
 his pictures have been shown by one 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.960
 Ukrainian professional bodybuilders the 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.550
 pact oral so the chest muscle 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.350
 demolished and the doctor has it 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.070
 moored again is of course great 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.900
 images 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.070
 if you imagine a professional 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.840
 bodybuilder really that ne 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.030
 has turkey breast and traveled from it 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.040
 abdominal muscle and quickly back at the 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.450
 bench press, incidentally, happened then 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.860
 of course already so the images me 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.110
 but then they also shape me 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.360
 that's why it's very important in 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.470
 these areas where these cool is must 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.180
 to be made hot 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.130
 There are also some good ones by now 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.330
 athletes go because I can you also what 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.460
 link under the video 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.960
 but that does not replace a roma program 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.030
 and also this slow one 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.690
 is on certain exercises 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.060
 a good tip 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.770
 so now I'm here again 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.630
 totally out of nonsense with this video 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.790
 not so long you can of course 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.530
 comment and from your comments 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.030
 usually a new video makes me easy 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.590
 to pay close attention to the things the 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.510
 you want to know and in this sense 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.920
 See you in the next video many 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.920
 greetings from your simon
