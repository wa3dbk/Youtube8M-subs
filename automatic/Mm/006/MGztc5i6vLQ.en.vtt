00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.719 
their best but not for my selfish
purposes<00:01:54.180> more<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.430> just

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
purposes more just because you know just

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
purposes more just because you know just
I<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.149> would<00:01:57.240> make<00:01:57.390> them<00:01:57.689> actually<00:01:58.259> feel

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I think it would make them actually feel

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.139 
I think it would make them actually feel
better<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:59.040> better<00:01:59.280> intentions<00:01:59.969> than

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
better I have better intentions than

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.770 
better I have better intentions than
Ibanez<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.189> harsh<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.610> Ava<00:02:02.850> so

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
Ibanez I would not be as harsh as Ava so

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.119 
Ibanez I would not be as harsh as Ava so
I<00:02:05.299> can<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.329> could<00:02:06.600> understand<00:02:07.500> Ava

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
I can I could understand Ava

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.059 
I can I could understand Ava
but<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> would<00:02:08.759> never<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:10.200> would

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
but I would never be like that I would

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.770 
but I would never be like that I would
say<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.489> film<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:13.739> good<00:02:14.190> lesson<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:15.150> know

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
say this film is a good lesson to know

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.050 
say this film is a good lesson to know
that<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.110> grass<00:02:16.349> isn't<00:02:16.739> always<00:02:17.190> greener<00:02:17.700> on

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
that the grass isn't always greener on

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.699 
that the grass isn't always greener on
the<00:02:18.180> other<00:02:18.300> side<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.989> always<00:02:19.349> say<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
the other side I always say like the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.010 
the other side I always say like the
grass<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.099> greener<00:02:20.400> where<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.580> water<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:21.150> so

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
grass is greener where you water it so

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.570 
grass is greener where you water it so
but<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> also<00:02:22.470> think<00:02:22.739> it's<00:02:22.860> good<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.069> Tyler

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
but I also think it's good that Tyler

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.119 
but I also think it's good that Tyler
really<00:02:23.730> flips<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.420> everyone<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.290> has<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
really flips it on everyone and has the

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.460 
really flips it on everyone and has the
temptation<00:02:26.760> being<00:02:27.510> more<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.170> girls

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
temptation being more so that girls

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.009 
temptation being more so that girls
issue<00:02:28.770> as<00:02:29.220> opposed<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.970> male<00:02:30.390> issue<00:02:30.660> which

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
issue as opposed to the male issue which

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.759 
issue as opposed to the male issue which
you<00:02:31.140> typically<00:02:31.500> see<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:31.920> films<00:02:33.440> say<00:02:34.440> what<00:02:34.620> you

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
you typically see in films say what you

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.830 
you typically see in films say what you
will<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.340> girl<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.790> hustler<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.450> can

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
