America's<00:00:15.450> Cup<00:00:15.630> I've<00:00:15.809> been<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.139> you've

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
America's Cup I've been and you've

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.620 
America's Cup I've been and you've
always<00:00:16.440> had<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> feeling<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:18.240> your<00:00:18.390> speed

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
always had a feeling of what your speed

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.769 
always had a feeling of what your speed
differences<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.939> you<00:00:20.939> know<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.240> are<00:00:21.270> stronger

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
differences and you know we are stronger

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.109 
differences and you know we are stronger
or<00:00:21.840> were<00:00:22.020> you're<00:00:22.170> weaker<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.130> today<00:00:23.820> I

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
or were you're weaker and and today I

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.870 
or were you're weaker and and today I
think<00:00:24.480> both<00:00:24.660> things<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.439> don't<00:00:25.590> have

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
think both things we really don't have

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.490 
think both things we really don't have
much<00:00:26.880> idea<00:00:27.090> at<00:00:27.359> all<00:00:27.480> especially<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.199> we're<00:00:28.410> in

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
much idea at all especially is we're in

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.870 
much idea at all especially is we're in
lighter<00:00:28.680> wind<00:00:28.920> conditions<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.460> again<00:00:29.699> that's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
lighter wind conditions so again that's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.580 
lighter wind conditions so again that's
another<00:00:29.970> variable<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.320> either<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
another variable that you know either a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.080 
another variable that you know either a
smear<00:00:32.070> us<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.399> Selden<00:00:32.759> they're<00:00:32.910> much

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
smear us of Selden they're much

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.690 
smear us of Selden they're much
everyone's<00:00:33.899> fully<00:00:34.829> focused<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.579> they've

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
everyone's fully focused on what they've

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
everyone's fully focused on what they've
got<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.410> probably<00:00:37.410> there's<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> bit<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
got to do probably there's a bit of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.310 
got to do probably there's a bit of
nerves<00:00:38.190> around<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.899> expected

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
nerves around but that's that's expected

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.130 
nerves around but that's that's expected
and<00:00:40.649> probably<00:00:41.100> should<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.690> no<00:00:42.690> really<00:00:42.989> nice

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and probably should be no really nice

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
and probably should be no really nice
feeling<00:00:43.440> actually<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.250> has<00:00:44.399> always<00:00:44.520> been

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
feeling actually this has always been

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:54.670 
feeling actually this has always been
the<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.000> goal<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.210> everyone

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.760 

first<00:01:25.390> rice<00:01:25.539> was<00:01:25.750> just<00:01:26.229> not<00:01:26.350> believable
