ones that we now have the animations
unspell<00:00:11.099> effects<00:00:11.490> for<00:00:11.639> now<00:00:12.179> first<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.540> all<00:00:12.599> we

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
unspell effects for now first of all we

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.360 
unspell effects for now first of all we
have<00:00:12.960> seen<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.259> model<00:00:13.440> before<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.130> two

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
have seen this model before but two

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.499 
have seen this model before but two
things<00:00:14.490> you'll<00:00:14.700> notice<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> bit<00:00:15.389> of

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
things you'll notice is a bit of

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.420 
things you'll notice is a bit of
glimmering<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.619> doesn't<00:00:17.310> look

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
glimmering going on here doesn't look

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.340 
glimmering going on here doesn't look
fully<00:00:17.789> featured<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> minute<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:18.840> imagine

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
fully featured at the minute but imagine

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
fully featured at the minute but imagine
it<00:00:19.439> would<00:00:19.529> have<00:00:19.680> something<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.130> do<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.369> maybe

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it would have something to do with maybe

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.490 
it would have something to do with maybe
a<00:00:21.060> burst<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.539> energy<00:00:21.660> coming<00:00:22.080> out<00:00:22.230> from<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a burst of energy coming out from the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
a burst of energy coming out from the
top<00:00:22.650> or<00:00:22.920> something<00:00:23.130> like<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:24.060> there's

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
top or something like that then there's

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.769 
top or something like that then there's
also<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.750> bit<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.970> just<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.240> spell<00:00:27.510> effect

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
also a bit of a just like a spell effect

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.609 
also a bit of a just like a spell effect
there<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> lantern

there on the lantern

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.960 
there on the lantern
I<00:00:28.650> think<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.130> actor<00:00:29.340> looks<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:29.760> cool<00:00:29.910> i

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
I think this actor looks really cool i

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.849 
I think this actor looks really cool i
like<00:00:30.359> how<00:00:30.539> shooting<00:00:31.080> stuff<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> sides

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
like how shooting stuff out of the sides

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.560 
like how shooting stuff out of the sides
there<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.489> got<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> good<00:00:32.910> profile<00:00:33.329> this

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
there it's got a good profile this

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.450 
there it's got a good profile this
weapon<00:00:33.960> i<00:00:34.110> think<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.040> looking<00:00:35.219> kind

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
weapon i think it really is looking kind

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.490 
weapon i think it really is looking kind
of<00:00:35.550> cool<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.600> one<00:00:36.780> definitely<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.380> big

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
of cool so this one definitely a big

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.410 
of cool so this one definitely a big
plus<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:37.739> me<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.399> hopefully<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.149> spell

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
plus for me and hopefully if that spell

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.940 
plus for me and hopefully if that spell
effect<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.930> polished<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.500> little<00:00:40.770> bit

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
effect was just polished up a little bit

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.860 
effect was just polished up a little bit
it<00:00:41.430> could<00:00:41.520> look<00:00:41.610> pretty<00:00:41.850> nice<00:00:42.000> still<00:00:42.750> though<00:00:42.809> i

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it could look pretty nice still though i

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.060 
it could look pretty nice still though i
do<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.140> where<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.379> jumps<00:00:43.680> up<00:00:43.770> horizontally

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
do like where it jumps up horizontally

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.709 
do like where it jumps up horizontally
like<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.480> pretty

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
like that I think that's really pretty

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.220 
like that I think that's really pretty
cool<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.860> would<00:00:47.010> look<00:00:47.160> well<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.879> game<00:00:48.230> ok

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
cool and that would look well in game ok

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.319 
cool and that would look well in game ok
so<00:00:49.289> next<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.190> now<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.820> wait<00:00:51.059> for

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so next we have this now just wait for

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.639 
so next we have this now just wait for
it<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.539> take<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> minute<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.440> guy<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
it all take a minute for this guy to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.299 
it all take a minute for this guy to
fire<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.520> when<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> does<00:00:54.719> very<00:00:55.590> very<00:00:56.039> cool

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
fire up but when it does very very cool

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.510 
fire up but when it does very very cool
and<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.960> said<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.440> may<00:00:58.649> take<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> minute

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and that said it may take a minute

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
and that said it may take a minute
weapon<00:00:59.940> itself<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.510> mean<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.870> pretty<00:01:01.050> cool<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
weapon itself I mean it's pretty cool it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.439 
weapon itself I mean it's pretty cool it
this<00:01:01.859> thing<00:01:02.129> look<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.940> middle<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
this thing look like in the middle the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
this thing look like in the middle the
the<00:01:03.690> spinning<00:01:04.019> around<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.439> looks<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.890> little

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the spinning around it looks a little

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.179 
the spinning around it looks a little
bit<00:01:05.250> odd<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:07.409> know<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
bit odd and I don't know what it is it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.640 
bit odd and I don't know what it is it
just<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.840> probably<00:01:10.170> because<00:01:10.439> we're

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
just I think it's probably because we're

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
just I think it's probably because we're
not<00:01:10.770> seeing<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.340> game<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.850> motion<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.540> only

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
not seeing it in game in motion the only

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.140 
not seeing it in game in motion the only
thing<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> moving<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.490> that's<00:01:14.760> moving<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
thing is moving that that's moving is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.700 
thing is moving that that's moving is
this<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.509> maybe<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> doesn't<00:01:16.049> look<00:01:16.229> too<00:01:16.409> great

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
this so maybe it doesn't look too great

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.399 
this so maybe it doesn't look too great
but<00:01:16.740> oh<00:01:17.159> yeah<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.939> boom<00:01:18.409> so

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
but oh yeah there we go boom so

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
but oh yeah there we go boom so
essentially<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.549> kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> fires<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.659> goes

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
essentially it kind of fires up it goes

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.230 
essentially it kind of fires up it goes
in<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.080> no<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.520> ok<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> goes<00:01:24.119> all

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
in this no you know ok it goes all

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.359 
in this no you know ok it goes all
molten<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.780> starts<00:01:25.080> jumping<00:01:25.860> about<00:01:26.009> place<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
molten it starts jumping about place I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.380 
molten it starts jumping about place I
think<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:26.970> cool

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
think that's really cool

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.890 
think that's really cool
also<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> floats<00:01:28.500> which<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> thing<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.689> what

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
also it floats which is a thing now what

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.270 
also it floats which is a thing now what
what<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.229> guys<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.619> about<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.920> well

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
what do you guys think about this well

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.850 
what do you guys think about this well
what<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> seems<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> replicate<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
what it seems to do is replicate the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.469 
what it seems to do is replicate the
animal<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> mouth<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.880> an<00:01:36.000> animal<00:01:36.390> or

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
animal like the mouth of an animal or

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.580 
animal like the mouth of an animal or
something<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.439> see

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
something like that because you can see

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.469 
something like that because you can see
these<00:01:37.710> two<00:01:37.890> tusks<00:01:38.369> kind<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.700> closing<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
these two tusks kind of closing in I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.690 
these two tusks kind of closing in I
think<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.200> cool<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.770> its<00:01:41.490> default

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
think that's cool in its default

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.109 
think that's cool in its default
position<00:01:41.880> maybe<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:42.869> looking<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.710> cool<00:01:44.119> but

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
position maybe not looking so cool but

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.539 
position maybe not looking so cool but
when<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.720> actually<00:01:45.750> fully<00:01:46.649> goes<00:01:47.040> into<00:01:47.340> motion

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
when it actually fully goes into motion

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.100 
when it actually fully goes into motion
and<00:01:47.909> starts<00:01:48.149> moving<00:01:48.329> then<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> think<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.049> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and starts moving then I think it's a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
and starts moving then I think it's a
really<00:01:49.320> nice<00:01:49.470> weapon<00:01:49.790> overall<00:01:50.790> though<00:01:50.939> it's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
really nice weapon overall though it's

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.730 
really nice weapon overall though it's
pretty<00:01:51.479> solid<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.470> definitely

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
pretty solid and it's definitely

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380 
pretty solid and it's definitely
indicative<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> fact<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.909> lot<00:01:54.240> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
indicative of the fact that a lot of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
indicative of the fact that a lot of
weapons<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.930> warlords<00:01:55.200> are<00:01:55.590> being<00:01:56.250> made<00:01:56.520> more

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
weapons and warlords are being made more

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.080 
weapons and warlords are being made more
interesting<00:01:58.340> alright<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.549> next<00:01:59.670> speaking<00:01:59.969> of

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
interesting alright so next speaking of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.679 
interesting alright so next speaking of
interesting<00:02:00.360> weapons<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> blue

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
interesting weapons this is a blue

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.450 
interesting weapons this is a blue
quality<00:02:03.689> item<00:02:04.020> actually<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.130> think<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
quality item actually and I think that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.540 
quality item actually and I think that
up<00:02:05.579> Hut<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.509> very<00:02:06.840> very<00:02:07.259> cool<00:02:07.560> blue<00:02:07.890> it's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
up Hut it's a very very cool blue it's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.550 
up Hut it's a very very cool blue it's
it's<00:02:08.910> gone<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:10.110> there<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.440> it's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it's gone as you can see there but it's

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.900 
it's gone as you can see there but it's
very<00:02:10.619> different<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.280> looks<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
very different one it looks like it

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.510 
very different one it looks like it
comes<00:02:12.209> from

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
comes from

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.310 
comes from
Moon<00:02:12.850> Valley<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.330> little<00:02:13.600> bit<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.840> bug<00:02:14.020> going

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
Moon Valley a little bit of a bug going

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.650 
Moon Valley a little bit of a bug going
on<00:02:14.470> there<00:02:14.830> but<00:02:15.130> overall<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.970> think<00:02:16.270> that's<00:02:16.450> a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
on there but overall I think that's a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.110 
on there but overall I think that's a
just<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.320> really<00:02:17.590> different<00:02:17.890> gun<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.580> there

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
just a really different gun and there

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.000 
just a really different gun and there
are<00:02:19.240> some<00:02:19.510> transmog<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.740> going<00:02:20.920> to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
are some transmog that this is going to

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.280 
are some transmog that this is going to
look<00:02:21.160> fantastic<00:02:21.370> with<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.240> think<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:23.050> know<00:02:23.110> for

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
look fantastic with I think you know for

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.600 
look fantastic with I think you know for
the<00:02:23.350> people<00:02:23.590> who<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.710> don't<00:02:24.010> want<00:02:24.250> they<00:02:24.490> want

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
the people who just don't want they want

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.820 
the people who just don't want they want
a<00:02:24.730> traditional<00:02:24.850> gun<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.690> think<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.350> them<00:02:26.500> this

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
a traditional gun I think for them this

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.490 
a traditional gun I think for them this
is<00:02:27.040> really<00:02:27.340> going<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.940> be<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:29.200> really<00:02:29.350> going

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
is really going to be it's really going

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.620 
is really going to be it's really going
to<00:02:29.590> be<00:02:29.650> kind<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:29.890> nice<00:02:30.150> all<00:02:31.150> right<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.450> let's

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
to be kind of nice all right so let's

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.300 
to be kind of nice all right so let's
just<00:02:31.750> jump<00:02:32.110> through<00:02:32.290> these<00:02:32.440> bows<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.100> reason

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
just jump through these bows the reason

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.170 
just jump through these bows the reason
I<00:02:33.370> put<00:02:33.520> them<00:02:33.640> here<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.820> because<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.030> haven't

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
I put them here is because I haven't

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.790 
I put them here is because I haven't
covered<00:02:34.420> them<00:02:34.630> before<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.200> don't<00:02:35.620> know<00:02:35.680> exactly

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
covered them before I don't know exactly

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.100 
covered them before I don't know exactly
what<00:02:36.220> cult<00:02:36.490> they<00:02:36.610> are<00:02:36.760> they<00:02:37.000> are<00:02:37.210> but<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.480> really

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
what cult they are they are but I really

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.600 
what cult they are they are but I really
like<00:02:38.290> them<00:02:38.530> they're<00:02:38.800> they're<00:02:39.340> sort<00:02:39.520> of

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
like them they're they're sort of

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.220 
like them they're they're sort of
they're<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.880> little<00:02:40.030> bit<00:02:40.180> more<00:02:40.240> simple<00:02:40.720> yes<00:02:41.020> but

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
they're a little bit more simple yes but

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.330 
they're a little bit more simple yes but
I<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.560> way<00:02:41.650> they're<00:02:41.800> kind<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.010> covered

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
I like the way they're kind of covered

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.580 
I like the way they're kind of covered
in<00:02:42.430> iron<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.850> bone<00:02:43.120> but<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.960> way<00:02:44.110> that's<00:02:44.350> not

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
in iron and bone but in a way that's not

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.530 
in iron and bone but in a way that's not
ridiculously<00:02:45.280> extravagant<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.240> I<00:02:46.270> think

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
ridiculously extravagant so I think

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.260 
ridiculously extravagant so I think
these<00:02:46.660> are<00:02:46.720> some<00:02:47.140> really<00:02:47.470> nice<00:02:48.100> bow<00:02:48.820> models

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
these are some really nice bow models

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.420 
these are some really nice bow models
all<00:02:49.840> right<00:02:50.080> so<00:02:50.230> next<00:02:50.410> up<00:02:50.650> Ron<00:02:50.920> I'm<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> little

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
reason I put it here is just because I

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.390 
reason I put it here is just because I
think<00:02:55.570> it's<00:02:55.750> really<00:02:56.020> well<00:02:56.860> it's<00:02:56.980> really<00:02:57.160> cool

think it's really well it's really cool
but<00:02:57.760> one<00:02:58.120> little<00:02:58.450> thing<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.750> want<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.050> mention

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
but one little thing I want to mention

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.050 
but one little thing I want to mention
is<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.590> I'm<00:03:00.070> pretty<00:03:00.430> sure<00:03:00.760> there's<00:03:01.000> a

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
is that I'm pretty sure there's a

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.660 
is that I'm pretty sure there's a
scaling<00:03:02.050> error<00:03:02.200> going<00:03:02.590> on<00:03:02.770> here<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.220> think

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
scaling error going on here I think

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.270 
scaling error going on here I think
there's<00:03:03.970> no<00:03:04.240> way<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.840> well<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.710> guess<00:03:05.950> they

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
there's no way that well I guess they

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.100 
there's no way that well I guess they
could<00:03:06.550> make<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.820> sword<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.390> big<00:03:07.570> for<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.840> human

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
could make a sword that big for a human

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.510 
could make a sword that big for a human
but<00:03:08.230> I'm<00:03:08.350> not<00:03:08.500> particularly<00:03:08.920> sure<00:03:09.130> if<00:03:09.370> they

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
but I'm not particularly sure if they

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.540 
but I'm not particularly sure if they
will<00:03:10.020> just<00:03:11.020> look<00:03:11.500> at<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.710> hand<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:12.070> don't<00:03:12.250> think

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
will just look at the hand I don't think

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.760 
will just look at the hand I don't think
that's<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.240> don't<00:03:13.300> think<00:03:13.510> that's<00:03:13.780> all<00:03:14.020> in<00:03:14.320> scale

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
that's I don't think that's all in scale

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.470 
that's I don't think that's all in scale
at<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.040> minute<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.790> I'm<00:03:15.880> just<00:03:16.060> going<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:16.270> talk

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
at the minute so I'm just going to talk

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.800 
at the minute so I'm just going to talk
about<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.780> weapon<00:03:17.110> model<00:03:17.410> itself<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.810> oh

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
about the weapon model itself and oh

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.660 
about the weapon model itself and oh
look<00:03:20.740> at<00:03:20.860> me<00:03:20.950> hitting<00:03:21.130> buttons<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.610> I

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
look at me hitting buttons that I

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.640 
look at me hitting buttons that I
shouldn't<00:03:21.940> hit<00:03:22.090> yeah<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.840> think<00:03:22.959> this<00:03:23.260> weapon

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
shouldn't hit yeah I think this weapon

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.430 
shouldn't hit yeah I think this weapon
is<00:03:23.860> really<00:03:24.370> really<00:03:24.910> cool<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:26.050> is<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.320> course

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
is really really cool this is of course

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.010 
is really really cool this is of course
brutal<00:03:27.070> savage<00:03:27.400> blabla<00:03:27.970> as<00:03:28.030> we<00:03:28.300> all<00:03:28.480> know<00:03:28.720> but

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
brutal savage blabla as we all know but

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.960 
brutal savage blabla as we all know but
I<00:03:29.230> like<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.709> curved<00:03:29.920> end<00:03:30.220> on<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.490> top<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.820> like

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
I like the curved end on the top I like

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.280 
I like the curved end on the top I like
to<00:03:31.090> where<00:03:31.209> there's<00:03:31.360> lots<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.570> little<00:03:31.690> juts<00:03:32.050> and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
to where there's lots of little juts and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.900 
to where there's lots of little juts and
spikes<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.920> like<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.490> way<00:03:33.580> through<00:03:33.730> there's

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
spikes I like the way through there's

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.640 
spikes I like the way through there's
quite<00:03:34.120> clearly<00:03:34.510> some<00:03:34.810> wear<00:03:35.020> and<00:03:35.230> tear<00:03:35.440> on<00:03:35.590> the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
quite clearly some wear and tear on the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.440 
quite clearly some wear and tear on the
blade<00:03:35.920> itself<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.580> think<00:03:36.730> that's<00:03:37.030> really<00:03:37.209> cool

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
blade itself I think that's really cool

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.810 
blade itself I think that's really cool
and<00:03:37.840> then<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:38.470> got<00:03:38.680> this<00:03:38.800> nice<00:03:39.040> big<00:03:39.280> burst<00:03:39.640> of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
and then it's got this nice big burst of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.520 
and then it's got this nice big burst of
color<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.420> through<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.720> middle<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.230> I

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
color going through the middle and I

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.020 
color going through the middle and I
think<00:03:41.740> what's<00:03:41.920> particularly<00:03:42.400> nice<00:03:42.850> is

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
think what's particularly nice is

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.699 
think what's particularly nice is
especially<00:03:43.540> here<00:03:43.720> in<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.320> green<00:03:44.530> one

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
especially here in this the green one

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.070 
especially here in this the green one
and<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:44.950> red<00:03:45.130> one<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:46.450> suppose<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.959> blue

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
and the red one and I suppose the blue

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.740 
and the red one and I suppose the blue
one<00:03:47.230> as<00:03:47.410> well<00:03:47.700> it's<00:03:48.700> not<00:03:48.910> washed<00:03:49.330> out<00:03:49.540> the

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
one as well it's not washed out the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.900 
one as well it's not washed out the
color<00:03:49.930> that's<00:03:50.320> just<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.770> nice<00:03:50.950> solid<00:03:51.400> old<00:03:51.520> green

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
color that's just a nice solid old green

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.970 
color that's just a nice solid old green
that's<00:03:52.120> bright<00:03:52.450> an<00:03:52.720> interesting<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.500> cool<00:03:53.709> I

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
that's bright an interesting and cool I

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.680 
that's bright an interesting and cool I
think<00:03:54.340> that's<00:03:54.640> really<00:03:54.880> important<00:03:55.450> for<00:03:55.510> a

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
think that's really important for a

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.540 
think that's really important for a
world<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:55.959> warcraft'<00:03:56.350> designs<00:03:56.709> because<00:03:57.430> they

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
world of warcraft' designs because they

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.040 
world of warcraft' designs because they
have<00:03:57.700> been<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.910> little<00:03:58.209> bit<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.510> wash<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.930> in

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
have been a little bit to wash that in

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.780 
have been a little bit to wash that in
the<00:03:59.110> past<00:03:59.320> okay<00:03:59.830> I<00:03:59.860> know<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.220> blade<00:04:00.430> itself

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
the past okay I know the blade itself

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.820 
the past okay I know the blade itself
isn't<00:04:01.150> particularly<00:04:01.570> colorful<00:04:02.200> but<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:02.650> just

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
isn't particularly colorful but I just

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.290 
isn't particularly colorful but I just
think<00:04:02.920> having<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.340> splash<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.850> color<00:04:03.910> in

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
think having that splash of color in

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.720 
think having that splash of color in
there<00:04:04.480> really<00:04:05.140> does<00:04:05.350> help<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.250> also<00:04:06.400> like

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
there really does help and I also like

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.310 
there really does help and I also like
the<00:04:06.850> way<00:04:06.940> that<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.330> tip<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.660> this<00:04:07.780> blade<00:04:08.080> it

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
the way that the tip of this blade it

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.479 
the way that the tip of this blade it
just<00:04:08.470> kind<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.680> looks<00:04:08.830> like<00:04:08.890> it's<00:04:09.100> very<00:04:09.250> good

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
just kind of looks like it's very good

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.750 
just kind of looks like it's very good
for<00:04:09.570> yeah<00:04:10.620> stabbing<00:04:11.620> but<00:04:11.709> also<00:04:11.890> just<00:04:12.160> slashing

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
for yeah stabbing but also just slashing

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.670 
for yeah stabbing but also just slashing
like<00:04:13.300> for<00:04:13.480> an<00:04:13.540> outward<00:04:13.690> slash<00:04:14.140> it<00:04:14.350> just<00:04:14.500> looks

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
like for an outward slash it just looks

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.990 
like for an outward slash it just looks
like<00:04:14.770> it<00:04:14.920> would<00:04:14.980> really<00:04:15.190> slice<00:04:15.520> things<00:04:15.790> up

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
like it would really slice things up

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.820 
like it would really slice things up
pretty<00:04:16.209> well<00:04:16.330> so<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.080> think<00:04:17.169> that's<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:17.560> really

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
pretty well so I think that's a really

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.430 
pretty well so I think that's a really
nice<00:04:18.160> weapon<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.880> yeah<00:04:19.570> well<00:04:19.900> done<00:04:20.080> blizzard

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
nice weapon and yeah well done blizzard

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.070 
nice weapon and yeah well done blizzard
anyway<00:04:20.890> let's<00:04:21.190> move<00:04:21.400> on<00:04:21.580> to<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:21.910> next<00:04:22.090> batch

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
anyway let's move on to the next batch

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.290 
anyway let's move on to the next batch
all<00:04:23.320> right<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:23.860> next<00:04:24.070> we<00:04:24.370> have<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:24.790> staff<00:04:25.120> and

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
all right so next we have this staff and

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.670 
all right so next we have this staff and
I<00:04:25.330> was<00:04:25.450> kind<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.660> convenient<00:04:26.200> because<00:04:26.290> right

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
I was kind of convenient because right

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.810 
I was kind of convenient because right
as<00:04:26.890> I<00:04:27.010> moved<00:04:27.220> away<00:04:27.340> from<00:04:27.460> around<00:04:27.730> a<00:04:27.760> little

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
as I moved away from around a little

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.960 
as I moved away from around a little
champion<00:04:28.390> Firefox<00:04:29.200> crashed<00:04:29.620> awesome<00:04:30.340> anyway

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
champion Firefox crashed awesome anyway

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.540 
champion Firefox crashed awesome anyway
and<00:04:31.330> so<00:04:31.840> we<00:04:31.930> have<00:04:32.020> these<00:04:32.140> staffs<00:04:32.470> they<00:04:33.250> are<00:04:33.370> not

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
and so we have these staffs they are not

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.370 
and so we have these staffs they are not
massively<00:04:34.060> animated<00:04:34.630> but<00:04:34.840> there's<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.170> spell

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
massively animated but there's a spell

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.540 
massively animated but there's a spell
back<00:04:35.590> there<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:35.980> I<00:04:36.010> thought<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.310> was<00:04:36.370> worth

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
back there so I thought it was worth

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.000 
back there so I thought it was worth
showing<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:37.090> think<00:04:37.540> as<00:04:37.690> far<00:04:37.720> as<00:04:37.930> staffs<00:04:38.320> go<00:04:38.650> they

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
showing I think as far as staffs go they

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.490 
showing I think as far as staffs go they
look<00:04:39.310> kind<00:04:39.730> of<00:04:39.820> pretty<00:04:40.000> I'm<00:04:40.720> not<00:04:40.960> pretty<00:04:41.230> but

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
look kind of pretty I'm not pretty but

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.590 
look kind of pretty I'm not pretty but
they<00:04:41.710> they<00:04:41.860> look<00:04:42.040> good

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
they they look good

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.640 
they they look good
they've<00:04:43.600> got<00:04:43.750> a<00:04:43.780> pretty<00:04:43.990> cool<00:04:44.170> profile<00:04:44.620> I

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
they've got a pretty cool profile I

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.430 
they've got a pretty cool profile I
think<00:04:44.980> there<00:04:45.100> are<00:04:45.250> Akua<00:04:45.720> styled<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:47.080> just

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
think there are Akua styled the just

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440 
think there are Akua styled the just
when<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.860> put<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.130> sort<00:04:48.670> of<00:04:48.730> in<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.240> shape

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
when you put it sort of in this shape

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.180 
when you put it sort of in this shape
that<00:04:49.630> reminds<00:04:50.050> me<00:04:50.110> of<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:50.350> bird's<00:04:50.590> beak<00:04:50.890> a

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
that reminds me of a bird's beak a

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.040 
that reminds me of a bird's beak a
little<00:04:51.880> bit<00:04:52.030> so<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.240> think<00:04:52.360> that's<00:04:52.690> where<00:04:52.900> these

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
little bit so I think that's where these

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.050 
little bit so I think that's where these
guys<00:04:53.110> could<00:04:53.470> come<00:04:53.620> from<00:04:53.770> but<00:04:54.310> overall<00:04:54.550> I<00:04:54.670> think

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
guys could come from but overall I think

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.780 
guys could come from but overall I think
just<00:04:55.420> some<00:04:55.690> nice<00:04:56.110> really<00:04:56.500> solid<00:04:56.800> web<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.280> not

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
just some nice really solid web and not

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.640 
just some nice really solid web and not
weapons<00:04:58.500> blast-off's

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
weapons blast-off's

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.890 
weapons blast-off's
then<00:05:00.160> finally<00:05:00.520> we<00:05:00.610> have<00:05:00.730> this<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.330> just<00:05:01.540> saw

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
then finally we have this and I just saw

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.900 
then finally we have this and I just saw
a<00:05:01.960> poster<00:05:02.410> on<00:05:02.440> wow<00:05:02.710> heads<00:05:02.980> and<00:05:03.280> thought<00:05:03.610> hey

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
a poster on wow heads and thought hey

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.650 
a poster on wow heads and thought hey
that's<00:05:04.780> that's<00:05:05.320> really<00:05:05.770> nice<00:05:05.980> actually<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.510> I

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
that's that's really nice actually and I

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.970 
that's that's really nice actually and I
really<00:05:07.930> like<00:05:08.050> this<00:05:08.200> weapon<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:08.620> know<00:05:08.680> we<00:05:08.890> had

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
really like this weapon I know we had

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.070 
really like this weapon I know we had
seen<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.250> like<00:05:09.670> a<00:05:09.700> kind<00:05:09.970> of<00:05:10.000> crappy<00:05:10.390> 2d<00:05:10.720> image<00:05:10.960> of

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
seen a like a kind of crappy 2d image of

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.480 
seen a like a kind of crappy 2d image of
this<00:05:11.200> one<00:05:11.260> beforehand<00:05:11.860> but<00:05:12.010> seeing<00:05:12.250> it<00:05:12.340> it's

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
this one beforehand but seeing it it's

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.880 
this one beforehand but seeing it it's
full<00:05:12.640> on<00:05:12.720> 3d<00:05:13.720> glory<00:05:13.990> really<00:05:14.470> has<00:05:14.560> been<00:05:14.710> pretty

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
full on 3d glory really has been pretty

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.470 
full on 3d glory really has been pretty
happy<00:05:15.070> I<00:05:15.400> think<00:05:15.670> if<00:05:15.820> you<00:05:15.910> are<00:05:16.030> rolling<00:05:16.270> around

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
happy I think if you are rolling around

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.170 
happy I think if you are rolling around
as<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:16.900> trained<00:05:17.350> eye<00:05:17.500> warrior<00:05:17.950> jewel<00:05:18.730> building

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
as a trained eye warrior jewel building

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.730 
as a trained eye warrior jewel building
one<00:05:19.300> of<00:05:19.420> these<00:05:19.540> would<00:05:19.780> look<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:20.530> doesn't

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
one of these would look it doesn't

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.990 
one of these would look it doesn't
really<00:05:20.890> look<00:05:21.040> jewel<00:05:21.280> wielding<00:05:21.670> actually

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
really look jewel wielding actually

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.840 
really look jewel wielding actually
right<00:05:22.810> if<00:05:23.080> you<00:05:23.380> look<00:05:23.500> at<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.740> hand<00:05:23.920> grip<00:05:24.280> that

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
right if you look at the hand grip that

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.550 
right if you look at the hand grip that
would<00:05:25.030> certainly<00:05:25.210> say<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.690> me<00:05:25.960> Jill<00:05:26.260> wield

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
would certainly say to me Jill wield

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.680 
would certainly say to me Jill wield
parts<00:05:27.010> looking<00:05:27.790> at<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:27.940> actual<00:05:28.270> size<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.630> the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
parts looking at the actual size of the

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.630 
parts looking at the actual size of the
weapon<00:05:29.050> I<00:05:29.140> think<00:05:29.169> Blizzard<00:05:29.620> might<00:05:30.310> make<00:05:30.520> this

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
weapon I think Blizzard might make this

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.030 
weapon I think Blizzard might make this
on<00:05:30.790> one<00:05:30.970> hand<00:05:31.230> not<00:05:32.230> a<00:05:32.260> hundred<00:05:32.710> percent<00:05:32.800> sure

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
on one hand not a hundred percent sure

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.740 
on one hand not a hundred percent sure
but<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:33.520> think<00:05:33.610> it's<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:33.970> really<00:05:34.180> nice<00:05:34.330> looking

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
but I think it's a really nice looking

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.840 
but I think it's a really nice looking
weapon<00:05:35.169> regardless<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:35.890> like<00:05:36.130> this<00:05:36.370> style<00:05:36.640> I

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
weapon regardless I like this style I

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.520 
weapon regardless I like this style I
like<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.120> crystalline<00:05:37.570> stuff<00:05:37.870> because<00:05:38.410> it

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
like the crystalline stuff because it

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.990 
like the crystalline stuff because it
just<00:05:38.680> puts<00:05:38.860> in<00:05:38.980> that<00:05:39.100> splash<00:05:39.400> of<00:05:39.580> color<00:05:39.640> that

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
just puts in that splash of color that

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.940 
just puts in that splash of color that
I've<00:05:40.090> been<00:05:40.300> missing<00:05:40.660> from<00:05:40.810> a<00:05:40.900> few<00:05:41.140> World<00:05:41.770> War

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
I've been missing from a few World War

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.980 
I've been missing from a few World War
Craft<00:05:42.160> sets<00:05:42.460> and<00:05:43.060> also<00:05:43.390> I<00:05:43.419> just<00:05:43.480> think<00:05:43.780> some<00:05:43.930> of

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
Craft sets and also I just think some of

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.270 
Craft sets and also I just think some of
this<00:05:44.080> crystal<00:05:44.470> stuff<00:05:44.680> is<00:05:44.830> going<00:05:45.040> to<00:05:45.130> look

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
this crystal stuff is going to look

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.920 
this crystal stuff is going to look
pretty<00:05:45.310> well<00:05:45.850> with<00:05:46.120> some<00:05:46.330> of<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:46.510> new<00:05:46.630> sets

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
pretty well with some of the new sets

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.960 
pretty well with some of the new sets
especially<00:05:47.169> that<00:05:47.620> new<00:05:47.650> paladin<00:05:48.280> one<00:05:48.430> because

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
especially that new paladin one because

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.580 
especially that new paladin one because
it's<00:05:49.090> got<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.480> hints<00:05:49.720> of<00:05:49.780> purple<00:05:49.960> in<00:05:50.260> it<00:05:50.350> so<00:05:50.500> if

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
it's got the hints of purple in it so if

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.960 
it's got the hints of purple in it so if
you<00:05:50.650> could<00:05:50.770> pick<00:05:50.919> that<00:05:51.070> up<00:05:51.130> in<00:05:51.430> your<00:05:51.460> weapon

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
you could pick that up in your weapon

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.940 
you could pick that up in your weapon
and<00:05:52.180> you<00:05:53.140> know<00:05:53.230> kind<00:05:53.440> of<00:05:53.500> pick<00:05:53.650> up<00:05:53.770> on<00:05:53.860> those

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
and you know kind of pick up on those

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.560
