soon<00:00:41.219> sack<00:00:41.969> three<00:00:42.390> non<00:00:42.870> akimbo<00:00:43.760> variance<00:00:44.760> wow

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
soon sack three non akimbo variance wow

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.389 
soon sack three non akimbo variance wow
that's<00:00:45.690> pretty<00:00:45.870> epic<00:00:46.050> right<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.800> that's

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that's pretty epic right so that's

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.799 
that's pretty epic right so that's
essentially<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> vector<00:00:48.480> like

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
essentially going to be a vector like

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.420 
essentially going to be a vector like
that<00:00:48.960> looks<00:00:49.140> exactly<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.860> vector<00:00:50.280> right

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that looks exactly like a vector right

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.470 
that looks exactly like a vector right
there<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.969> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> handle<00:00:51.390> like

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
there I think it's going to handle like

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
there I think it's going to handle like
the<00:00:51.510> vector<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.289> gonna<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.590> pretty<00:00:52.770> much

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the vector that's gonna be pretty much

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.770 
the vector that's gonna be pretty much
like<00:00:53.160> getting<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> brand<00:00:53.670> new<00:00:53.760> SMG<00:00:54.180> which<00:00:54.539> could

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
like getting a brand new SMG which could

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.270 
like getting a brand new SMG which could
be<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.170> fun<00:00:55.289> i<00:00:55.320> can't<00:00:55.620> wait<00:00:55.800> test<00:00:56.129> that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
be a lot of fun i can't wait test that
