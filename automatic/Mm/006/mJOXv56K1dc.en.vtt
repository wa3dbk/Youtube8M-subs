00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
everybody else and he takes that with a

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.680 
everybody else and he takes that with a
grain<00:04:45.140> of<00:04:45.170> salt<00:04:45.320> does<00:04:45.770> he<00:04:46.240> show<00:04:47.240> some<00:04:47.450> emotion

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
at times sure who wouldn't but to sit

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.030 
at times sure who wouldn't but to sit
there<00:04:50.420> and<00:04:50.510> take<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.720> like<00:04:50.990> he<00:04:51.140> does<00:04:51.320> is<00:04:51.680> an

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
there and take it like he does is an

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.740 
there and take it like he does is an
amazing<00:04:52.520> thing<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:52.790> me<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.330> then<00:04:53.450> to<00:04:53.540> be<00:04:53.660> able

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
amazing thing to me and then to be able

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.750 
amazing thing to me and then to be able
to<00:04:53.900> come<00:04:54.080> out<00:04:54.230> and<00:04:54.410> play<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.430> think<00:04:55.670> he

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
to come out and play and I think he

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.310 
to come out and play and I think he
takes<00:04:55.970> all<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.420> pressure<00:04:56.720> off<00:04:56.960> our<00:04:57.140> guys

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
takes all that pressure off our guys

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.380 
takes all that pressure off our guys
when<00:04:57.770> he<00:04:57.800> goes<00:04:58.040> out<00:04:58.280> there<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.820> is<00:04:59.060> able<00:04:59.180> to

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
when he goes out there and is able to

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.700 
when he goes out there and is able to
take<00:04:59.600> it<00:04:59.780> and<00:04:59.870> they<00:04:59.930> see<00:05:00.110> how<00:05:00.230> he's<00:05:00.410> hanging<00:05:00.650> on

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
take it and they see how he's hanging on

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.170 
take it and they see how he's hanging on
I<00:05:00.770> think<00:05:00.830> he<00:05:01.070> sets<00:05:01.280> a<00:05:01.370> good<00:05:01.460> example<00:05:01.520> that<00:05:02.060> way

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
I think he sets a good example that way

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.760 
I think he sets a good example that way
my<00:05:02.840> all-time<00:05:02.960> favorite<00:05:03.440> moment<00:05:03.650> hasn't

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
my all-time favorite moment hasn't

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.240 
my all-time favorite moment hasn't
happened<00:05:04.100> yet

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
made it you know all the way through and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.700 
made it you know all the way through and
just<00:05:14.360> kind<00:05:14.510> of<00:05:14.540> weird<00:05:14.690> to<00:05:14.780> think<00:05:14.810> about<00:05:15.020> that

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
just kind of weird to think about that

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.900 
just kind of weird to think about that
never<00:05:16.070> thought<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.340> would<00:05:16.400> come<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.640> an<00:05:16.790> end

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
never thought it would come to an end

never thought it would come to an end
but<00:05:17.090> here<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.420> I<00:05:17.690> don't<00:05:18.200> really<00:05:18.350> know<00:05:18.500> how
