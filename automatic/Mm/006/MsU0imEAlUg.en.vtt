the things that we used to think was

that the brain never changed that the

that the brain never changed that the

brain we were born with was the brain we

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.710 
brain we were born with was the brain we
died<00:01:35.470> with<00:01:35.799> this<00:01:36.729> was<00:01:36.940> based<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.690> idea

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
died with this was based on the idea

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.000 
died with this was based on the idea
that<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:39.250> brain<00:01:39.490> cells<00:01:39.909> don't<00:01:40.510> reproduce<00:01:41.049> and

if they don't reproduce the brain must

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.590 
if they don't reproduce the brain must
not<00:01:44.200> change<00:01:44.619> but<00:01:45.580> what<00:01:45.790> they've<00:01:45.970> learned<00:01:46.299> is

things that poor diets do is they

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.319
