00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:29.039
 Good evening bio evolutionary today 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:32.820
 we will prepare the romantic bourguignon ai 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.030
 mushrooms a raw variant of pole 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.880
 those who are not classical Swiss, we already have 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.160
 proposed a vegan variant but now the 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.360
 turn of our raw food friends is right 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.610
 that they too have their own 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.220
 bourguignon and for romantic evenings 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.660
 a mushroom leads to another mushroom 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.850
 atheist mushroom to me 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.790
 etc. etc. so to do this 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.100
 bourguignonne we will replace the small pieces of 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.920
 meat protagonists of the classic 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.500
 Swiss burkina with champignon mushrooms 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.660
 whose lemon marinating time is 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.299
 very short for the time it takes 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.359
 meat to cook in the broth as far as 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.640
 concerns the tools we will need one 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:15.569
 manual electric juicer not 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.649
 import a bourguignonne service 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:21.810
 excluding the stove 15 will serve 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.200
 simply skewers the dishes 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:31.490
 divided into sections where you can put the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.829
 various sauces and bowls mushrooms 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.679
 for sauces for sauces then 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.649
 of bowls brought back to the center today 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.539
 that to put the typical furnace of the 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.789
 bourguignon and we will put a holster 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.450
 reported with the emulsion to make 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:52.049
 marinate the mushrooms with regard to 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.929
 the ingredients we will need 300 g of 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.859
 champignon mushrooms cut with the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.920
 mandolin or already purchased cut 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:06.689
 in slices the most beautiful we will put them from 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.030
 part of waste in another bowl e 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.880
 then they will be part of the emulsion i 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.510
 mushrooms must 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.730
 be well washed and dried a lot but 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.980
 very well perhaps using a cloth 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.090
 of cotton with regard to 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.500
 the emulsion will need the juice 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.440
 squeezed out of 45 pink salt lemons e 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.840
 precisely these mushroom waste per 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.780
 as for sauces we will 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.670
 we offer five sauces each 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.470
 you can find salsa in ours 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.560
 playlist dedicated to raw food recipes 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.630
 then try to find the sauce 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.000
 that best suits you 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.890
 this is just a proposal anyway 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.290
 we added to raw food mayonnaise 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.350
 the mousse of reggina in the variant 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:07.450
 pesto alla obviously raw 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:11.380
 Sicilian rocket pesto and mousse 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.190
 of nuts and avocado and because at the base 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.550
 of the bourguignon is the use of the 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.580
 stove we do not want the fire there 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.800
 miss you during this evening and then 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.490
 we will make a candle absolutely 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.010
 natural with a beautiful orange we will create 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.410
 so a candle 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.460
 we will not miss the fire during this 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.670
 evening and we will replace in this way not 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.580
 only the fire of the burner of the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.700
 bourguignon but also the fire of one 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:50.470
 beeswax candle that we anyway 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.330
 we do not use natural candles there 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.150
 there are so many types 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.680
 we have chosen this though if 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.510
 do a search on the internet and 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.550
 find many variations 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.709
 anyway to do this with 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.420
 the orange must be cut in half 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:11.310
 the orange keep the petiole inside 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.930
 that is, you must not cut it and deprive it 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.620
 the orange half of the rancia of the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.680
 the inner segments then fills with 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.240
 vegetable oil is fine any 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.949
 type of vegetable oil 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.630
 the small must be higher respect 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.120
 at the oil level 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.520
 let's put aside our chain e 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.500
 we will go on when we are starting 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.850
 to prepare our opinion was 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:44.229
 start with the preparation of 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:55.270
 people first thing then we draw 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:05:02.190
 the juice of the pink salt lemons i 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:05.550
 clippings of mushrooms and we will not use for 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.160
 the merger of the shipping colonels 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.130
 we aim at our point of covering of 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:17.050
 reaching out to the center of the table 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:22.260
 put the cup with the mushrooms 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:26.349
 champignons and to be immersed in emotion 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:30.990
 we add our candle to that between 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.949
 the other when we turn it on will do 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.539
 delicious scent 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.539
 let's light our candle 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:47.919
 Here we do immerse and the excitement a 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:50.199
 mushroom and leave it for about two minutes 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.129
 no longer to speed up times obviously 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.949
 on hold 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:06:06.089
 that the sea mushroom we can 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:06:06.089
