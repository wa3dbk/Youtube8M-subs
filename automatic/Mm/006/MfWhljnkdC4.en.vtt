00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.340
 let's make some homemade muffins 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.759
 the ingredients that we need are 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.820
 sugar flour a royal yeast envelope 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.290
 a pinch of salt lemon zest 3 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.290
 milk eggs 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.180
 we have put the eggs java team and here 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.000
 is of smoothies when they are well foam 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.500
 two are starting sponges we are going to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500
 proceed to add the sugar 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.510
 since we have the eggs mounted that 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.219
 have tripled their volume and have 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.170
 bleached let's proceed to add the 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.170
 sunflower oil and milk 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.240
 we already have our ingredients well 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.990
 integrated we proceed to mix in the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.470
 salt previously sifted 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.610
 the yeast 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.610
 and the lemon zest 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.720
 and we mix 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.990
 and we already add this mixture 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.990
 to our here 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.270
 we're going to do it twice 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.570
 always with enveloping movements 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.570
 inside out 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.400
 to avoid that we are some 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.340
 and emphasizing 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.040
 at the base 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.709
 let's go with the rest 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.640
 envolvent movements 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.450
 and 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.450
 yes 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.090
 here is well integrated 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.800
 and we will proceed to fill our 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.800
 capsules 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.719
 to fill the capsules I use 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.230
 a pastry bag in this case 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.230
 disposable 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.060
 we have our shake 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.060
 the one in our sleeve 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.800
 and we will proceed to fill our 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.300
 capsules and we use pre-silicone 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.880
 because this is going to help me that in the 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.010
 cooking the muffins do not deform and 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.010
 do not leave the perfect muffins 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.270
 but let's proceed 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.790
 to cut that is not too big 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:00.090
 because this will help us control 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.890
 the jet then the capsules that I use 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.890
 are from 7 or 8 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.740
 is the size that I like the most 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.940
 Well, we have this lot here 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:26.410
 muffin 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.410
 stuffed for the tip 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.370
 and it takes a half and I'll drive it again 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.220
 so what are we going to do now is 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.000
 add a little sugar on top 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.000
 of our muffins 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:49.590
 to take the students we will leave 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:53.100
 between 18 and 24 capsules 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:56.210
 we preheat our 970 degrees and 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.640
 we introduce the muffins in the same 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.760
 here we have them and we are going to cook them 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.770
 for 19 minutes well we have here 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.900
 our freshly baked muffins the 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.390
 we just got out of the oven we're going to 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.280
 leave here rest for 5 minutes and 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.260
 then we will remove them from the molds and 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.960
 we will let cool on a grid 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.190
 Well, we are already dismantling 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.630
 our muffins with care of not 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.630
 burn us because they are hot 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.180
 and already with this that is the last look that 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.980
 they send in this aspect that paints and good 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.980
 the taste the already unbeatable taste
