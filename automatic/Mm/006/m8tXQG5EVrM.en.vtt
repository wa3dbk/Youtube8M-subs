00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
well one experiment seems like it worked

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.720 
well one experiment seems like it worked
pretty<00:00:06.640> well<00:00:07.830> which<00:00:08.830> is<00:00:09.070> I<00:00:09.219> was<00:00:09.370> asked<00:00:09.669> a

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
pretty well which is I was asked a

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.100 
pretty well which is I was asked a
question<00:00:09.759> a<00:00:10.209> while<00:00:10.450> ago

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
question a while ago

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.800 
question a while ago
if<00:00:13.289> avocados<00:00:14.289> could<00:00:15.039> grow<00:00:15.369> in<00:00:15.669> aquaponics<00:00:16.270> and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
if avocados could grow in aquaponics and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.390 
if avocados could grow in aquaponics and
here's<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:19.960> answer<00:00:20.140> I<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:22.750> told<00:00:23.080> that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
here's the answer I was told that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.930 
here's the answer I was told that
avocados<00:00:24.400> don't<00:00:24.820> like<00:00:25.120> wet<00:00:25.450> feet<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:26.940> they

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
avocados don't like wet feet and they

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.830 
avocados don't like wet feet and they
would<00:00:28.210> not<00:00:28.390> grow<00:00:28.660> in<00:00:28.750> aquaponics<00:00:29.940> there<00:00:30.940> is<00:00:31.270> my

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
would not grow in aquaponics there is my

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.250 
would not grow in aquaponics there is my
avocado<00:00:32.379> girl<00:00:32.829> from<00:00:33.039> Pitt<00:00:33.809> mind<00:00:34.809> you<00:00:34.989> I<00:00:35.019> didn't

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
avocado girl from Pitt mind you I didn't

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.810 
avocado girl from Pitt mind you I didn't
start<00:00:35.499> the<00:00:35.649> pit<00:00:35.859> in<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.190> bed<00:00:36.370> I<00:00:36.399> might

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
start the pit in the bed I might

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.290 
start the pit in the bed I might
actually<00:00:37.390> try<00:00:37.719> that<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:39.129> this<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.609> an<00:00:39.999> avocado

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
actually try that but this is an avocado

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.340 
actually try that but this is an avocado
that<00:00:41.230> I<00:00:41.260> grew<00:00:41.679> from<00:00:41.710> pit<00:00:42.159> in<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.989> sorry<00:00:47.289> I

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
that I grew from pit in I'm sorry I

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.040 
that I grew from pit in I'm sorry I
think<00:00:47.530> maja<00:00:47.800> grew<00:00:48.069> this<00:00:48.190> one<00:00:48.399> this<00:00:49.120> one<00:00:49.390> I<00:00:49.629> grew

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
think maja grew this one this one I grew

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.340 
think maja grew this one this one I grew
from<00:00:50.559> I<00:00:51.390> remember<00:00:52.390> I<00:00:52.420> grew<00:00:52.539> this<00:00:52.690> one<00:00:52.870> in<00:00:52.989> soil

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
from I remember I grew this one in soil

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.399 
from I remember I grew this one in soil
or<00:00:53.649> if<00:00:53.769> I<00:00:53.859> grew<00:00:54.159> this<00:00:54.309> one<00:00:54.579> ah<00:00:54.989> yes<00:00:55.989> that's<00:00:56.170> what

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
or if I grew this one ah yes that's what

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.829 
or if I grew this one ah yes that's what
this<00:00:56.589> was<00:00:56.769> growing<00:00:56.979> in<00:00:57.100> soil<00:00:57.280> I'm<00:00:57.519> sorry<00:00:57.850> that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
this was growing in soil I'm sorry that

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.829 
this was growing in soil I'm sorry that
I<00:00:59.409> used<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.739> grow<00:00:59.920> them<00:01:00.069> in<00:01:00.249> in<00:01:01.059> a<00:01:01.300> little<00:01:01.569> water

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
I used to grow them in in a little water

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.950 
I used to grow them in in a little water
with<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.889> toothpicks<00:01:03.639> but<00:01:03.879> anyway<00:01:04.180> so<00:01:04.839> this

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
with the toothpicks but anyway so this

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.420 
with the toothpicks but anyway so this
is<00:01:05.019> one<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.469> was<00:01:05.649> grown<00:01:05.979> in<00:01:06.360> soil<00:01:07.360> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
is one that was grown in soil and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.889 
is one that was grown in soil and
transplanted<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:10.439> guess<00:01:11.439> about<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:13.570> was<00:01:13.719> in<00:01:13.810> the

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
transplanted I guess about it was in the

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.950 
transplanted I guess about it was in the
fall<00:01:14.140> so<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:15.189> was<00:01:15.399> roughly<00:01:15.939> five<00:01:16.420> six<00:01:16.810> months

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
fall so it was roughly five six months

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.929 
fall so it was roughly five six months
ago<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:18.390> she<00:01:19.390> was<00:01:19.420> much<00:01:20.110> smaller<00:01:20.469> than<00:01:20.680> this

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
ago and she was much smaller than this

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.139 
ago and she was much smaller than this
and<00:01:21.939> now<00:01:22.270> as<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.600> can<00:01:22.750> see<00:01:23.729> she's<00:01:24.729> certainly

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
and now as you can see she's certainly

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.450 
and now as you can see she's certainly
growing<00:01:25.539> she's<00:01:25.960> certainly<00:01:26.409> happy<00:01:26.860> she<00:01:27.189> made

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
growing she's certainly happy she made

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.810 
growing she's certainly happy she made
the<00:01:27.700> whole<00:01:27.729> winter<00:01:28.469> actually<00:01:29.469> in<00:01:30.250> my<00:01:30.579> garage

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
the whole winter actually in my garage

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.539 
the whole winter actually in my garage
aquaponics<00:01:31.780> which<00:01:31.920> gets<00:01:32.920> down<00:01:33.159> into<00:01:33.369> the

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
aquaponics which gets down into the

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.690 
aquaponics which gets down into the
forties<00:01:33.939> at<00:01:34.090> night<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:36.189> there's<00:01:36.460> anything

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
forties at night and if there's anything

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.099 
forties at night and if there's anything
wrong<00:01:36.850> with<00:01:37.119> this<00:01:37.630> avocado<00:01:38.109> I<00:01:39.960> wouldn't<00:01:40.960> know

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
wrong with this avocado I wouldn't know

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.740 
wrong with this avocado I wouldn't know
I<00:01:41.409> couldn't<00:01:42.039> tell<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:42.399> it's<00:01:42.640> it's<00:01:43.030> leaves<00:01:43.479> are

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
I couldn't tell you it's it's leaves are

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.550 
I couldn't tell you it's it's leaves are
as<00:01:43.899> green<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:44.590> beautiful<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.469> the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
as green and beautiful is some of the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.529 
as green and beautiful is some of the
ones<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:47.829> have<00:01:47.859> in<00:01:48.070> soil<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.549> fact<00:01:48.820> that<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.090> think

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
ones I have in soil in fact that I think

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.249 
ones I have in soil in fact that I think
the<00:01:49.600> leaves<00:01:49.810> here<00:01:50.049> might<00:01:50.259> be<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.859> deeper<00:01:51.429> green

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the leaves here might be a deeper green

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.380 
the leaves here might be a deeper green
so<00:01:53.259> anyway<00:01:53.560> she's<00:01:53.920> happy<00:01:54.340> now<00:01:54.850> mind<00:01:55.149> you<00:01:55.299> I'm

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
so anyway she's happy now mind you I'm

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.440 
so anyway she's happy now mind you I'm
not<00:01:55.420> going<00:01:55.719> to<00:01:55.780> keep<00:01:55.929> her<00:01:56.109> here<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:58.329> I'll<00:01:58.420> end

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
not going to keep her here but I'll end

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.109 
not going to keep her here but I'll end
up<00:01:58.719> doing<00:01:59.049> is<00:01:59.170> transplanting<00:01:59.890> her<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.460> her<00:02:01.060> own

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
up doing is transplanting her to her own

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.200 
up doing is transplanting her to her own
bed<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:03.009> just<00:02:03.219> keep<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.520> experiment<00:02:04.030> going

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
bed and I just keep the experiment going

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.660 
bed and I just keep the experiment going
you're<00:02:04.479> just<00:02:04.630> trying<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:05.020> see

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.940 

one<00:02:09.240> if<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.630> get<00:02:09.780> avocado<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.470> fruit<00:02:10.740> I

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
one if I can get avocado to fruit I

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.950 
one if I can get avocado to fruit I
think<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.430> good<00:02:11.610> six<00:02:12.270> or<00:02:12.360> seven<00:02:12.720> years

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
think that's a good six or seven years

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.650 
think that's a good six or seven years
but<00:02:13.230> i<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:13.440> some<00:02:13.530> other<00:02:13.680> trees<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.340> are

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
but i got some other trees that are

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.570 
but i got some other trees that are
around<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:15.990> years<00:02:16.320> but<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.860> know<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.400> one's

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
around for years but you know this one's

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.500 
around for years but you know this one's
coming<00:02:17.850> behind<00:02:18.000> him<00:02:19.790> will<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:20.910> coming<00:02:21.210> up<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.450> a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
coming behind him will be coming up on a

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.190 
coming behind him will be coming up on a
year<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:22.110> about<00:02:22.520> five<00:02:23.520> months<00:02:23.790> or<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.270> but<00:02:24.690> she

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
year in about five months or so but she

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.390 
year in about five months or so but she
looks<00:02:25.410> really<00:02:25.770> good<00:02:25.920> for<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.310> year<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:28.400> anyway

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
looks really good for a year and anyway
