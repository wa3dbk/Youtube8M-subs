00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
well so let's talk about about core

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.670 
well so let's talk about about core
because<00:01:36.570> core<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.930> my<00:01:37.020> opinion<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.470> probably

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
because core in my opinion is probably

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.679 
because core in my opinion is probably
one<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> most<00:01:38.100> unique<00:01:38.640> maps<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.509> we've
