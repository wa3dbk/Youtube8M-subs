00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:49.410 
off but i'll have a go there they go now
and<00:01:38.860> cover<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.220> ground<00:01:39.400> pretty<00:01:39.640> quickly

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.030 

well<00:01:50.420> I'm<00:01:50.540> working<00:01:50.900> these<00:01:51.050> are<00:01:51.380> mullet<00:01:51.830> keeps

well I'm working these are mullet keeps
very<00:01:52.280> thoroughly<00:01:52.870> around<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:54.020> edges<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.790> and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
very thoroughly around the edges and and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.219 
very thoroughly around the edges and and
that<00:01:55.970> in<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.270> endeavor<00:01:56.480> to<00:01:56.630> hopefully<00:01:56.870> find

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
that in the endeavor to hopefully find

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.550 
that in the endeavor to hopefully find
some<00:01:57.380> small<00:01:57.740> pieces<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.220> gold<00:01:59.320> seven<00:02:00.320> found

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
some small pieces of gold seven found

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.350 
some small pieces of gold seven found
anything<00:02:00.800> yet<00:02:00.950> but<00:02:01.280> only<00:02:01.520> been<00:02:01.670> detecting<00:02:02.150> for

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
anything yet but only been detecting for

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.190 
anything yet but only been detecting for
half<00:02:02.540> an<00:02:02.690> hour<00:02:02.840> or<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:04.690> gold<00:02:05.690> obviously<00:02:06.140> is

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
half an hour or so gold obviously is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.130 
half an hour or so gold obviously is
very<00:02:06.290> very<00:02:06.650> hard<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.040> find<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:08.840> have<00:02:09.020> to

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
very very hard to find and you have to

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.270 
very very hard to find and you have to
put<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.410> hard<00:02:09.619> yards<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.340> find<00:02:10.490> a<00:02:10.670> piece<00:02:10.880> so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
put the hard yards in to find a piece so

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.740 
put the hard yards in to find a piece so
hopefully<00:02:13.280> I'll<00:02:13.550> find<00:02:14.020> some<00:02:15.020> soon<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:16.750> it's

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
hopefully I'll find some soon but it's

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.420 
hopefully I'll find some soon but it's
quite<00:02:18.170> possible<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.800> may<00:02:18.890> not<00:02:18.920> find<00:02:19.250> any

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
quite possible and may not find any

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.520 
quite possible and may not find any
today

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.480 

well<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.650> hard<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.920> believe<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.460> the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
well it's hard to believe this is the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.590 
well it's hard to believe this is the
craic<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:29.030> was<00:02:29.150> bone<00:02:29.510> dry<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.950> other<00:02:31.070> day<00:02:31.600> when

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
craic it was bone dry the other day when

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.780 
craic it was bone dry the other day when
we're<00:02:32.750> here<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.230> it's<00:02:33.620> now<00:02:33.830> filled<00:02:34.130> up<00:02:34.370> any<00:02:34.550> he

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
we're here and it's now filled up any he

target anyway let's get back to some

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.759 
target anyway let's get back to some
detecting<00:03:24.659> it's<00:03:25.659> amazing<00:03:26.140> what<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.409> see<00:03:26.620> when

detecting it's amazing what you see when

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.490 
detecting it's amazing what you see when
you're<00:03:26.920> quite<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.849> bush<00:03:28.090> there's<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.900> frog<00:03:29.260> day

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
you're quite the bush there's a frog day

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.880 
you're quite the bush there's a frog day
he's<00:03:29.829> been<00:03:30.069> mating<00:03:31.170> it's<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.319> classic<00:03:32.680> case<00:03:32.829> of

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
he's been mating it's a classic case of

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.089 
he's been mating it's a classic case of
having<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.310> make<00:03:33.689> high<00:03:34.689> while<00:03:35.019> though<00:03:38.099> will

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
having to make high while though will

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.390 
having to make high while though will
the<00:03:39.250> rain<00:03:39.459> pours<00:03:40.829> maybe<00:03:41.829> I'll<00:03:42.040> mix<00:03:42.189> that

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
the rain pours maybe I'll mix that

00:03:42.400 --> 00:04:14.390 
the rain pours maybe I'll mix that
around

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.349 

not<00:04:15.400> sure<00:04:15.580> they're<00:04:15.760> invading<00:04:15.970> their<00:04:16.239> privacy

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
not sure they're invading their privacy

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.110 
not sure they're invading their privacy
or<00:04:16.750> not<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.910> frogs<00:04:19.299> are<00:04:19.480> mating<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.340> eggs

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
or not the frogs are mating so the eggs

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.470 
or not the frogs are mating so the eggs
can<00:04:22.360> be<00:04:22.450> hatched<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:22.900> lay<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:24.340> place<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.389> the

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
can be hatched and lay the place in the

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.250 
can be hatched and lay the place in the
water<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.870> develop<00:04:26.169> into<00:04:26.380> tadpoles<00:04:27.660> now<00:04:28.660> if

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260

noticed here the white patches here our

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.610 
noticed here the white patches here our
in<00:05:20.710> fact<00:05:20.950> frogs<00:05:21.280> born<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:22.389> this<00:05:23.080> is<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.380> same

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
in fact frogs born so this is the same

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.560 
in fact frogs born so this is the same
day<00:05:23.860> as<00:05:24.070> I<00:05:24.190> seen<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.610> frogs<00:05:24.910> down<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.330> creek

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
day as I seen the frogs down the creek

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.590 
day as I seen the frogs down the creek
that<00:05:25.600> study<00:05:25.990> that<00:05:26.229> day<00:05:27.039> after<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:28.000> rains<00:05:28.300> had

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
that study that day after the rains had

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.820 
that study that day after the rains had
arrived<00:05:29.669> and<00:05:30.669> they've<00:05:30.820> already<00:05:31.000> got<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.360> eggs

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
arrived and they've already got the eggs

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.860 
arrived and they've already got the eggs
which<00:05:32.830> are<00:05:32.950> probably<00:05:33.220> action<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.729> it<00:05:33.910> within

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
which are probably action to it within

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.170 
which are probably action to it within
days<00:05:35.139> probably<00:05:35.530> into<00:05:35.800> tadpoles<00:05:36.280> they've

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
days probably into tadpoles they've

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.500 
days probably into tadpoles they've
gotta<00:05:37.419> move<00:05:38.050> quickly<00:05:38.410> before<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:39.510> water

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
gotta move quickly before the water

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.670 
gotta move quickly before the water
disappears<00:05:43.050> so<00:05:44.050> um<00:05:44.700> yeah<00:05:45.900> that<00:05:46.900> green<00:05:47.260> tree<00:05:47.560> in

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
disappears so um yeah that green tree in

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.950 
disappears so um yeah that green tree in
the<00:05:47.770> distance<00:05:48.100> there<00:05:48.280> is<00:05:48.340> another<00:05:48.930> type<00:05:49.930> of

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
the distance there is another type of

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.900 
the distance there is another type of
tree<00:05:50.470> that's<00:05:50.680> commonly<00:05:51.100> associated<00:05:51.669> the

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
tree that's commonly associated the

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.570 
tree that's commonly associated the
goldfields<00:05:52.510> here<00:05:52.630> in<00:05:52.720> Victoria<00:05:56.280> there's<00:05:57.280> even

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
goldfields here in Victoria there's even

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.430 
goldfields here in Victoria there's even
dragon<00:05:58.060> flies<00:05:58.270> buzzing<00:05:58.630> around<00:05:58.810> now<00:05:59.110> how<00:05:59.320> on

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
dragon flies buzzing around now how on

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.659 
dragon flies buzzing around now how on
earth<00:05:59.530> they<00:05:59.590> know<00:05:59.950> that<00:06:00.160> there's<00:06:00.310> water<00:06:00.460> here

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
earth they know that there's water here

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.310 
earth they know that there's water here
I<00:06:00.880> don't<00:06:01.180> know<00:06:01.360> but<00:06:01.570> I<00:06:01.630> guess<00:06:01.840> they<00:06:01.990> can<00:06:02.139> cover

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
I don't know but I guess they can cover

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
I don't know but I guess they can cover
large<00:06:03.070> distances<00:06:03.220> quickly<00:06:04.289> but<00:06:05.289> yeah<00:06:06.039> they're

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
large distances quickly but yeah they're

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.010 
large distances quickly but yeah they're
buzzing<00:06:06.520> around<00:06:06.789> I'm<00:06:07.150> not<00:06:07.180> so<00:06:07.479> sure<00:06:07.510> that<00:06:07.720> it

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
buzzing around I'm not so sure that it

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.279 
buzzing around I'm not so sure that it
be<00:06:08.310> advised<00:06:09.310> her<00:06:09.550> womb<00:06:09.849> lay<00:06:10.090> their<00:06:10.300> eggs<00:06:10.539> here

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
be advised her womb lay their eggs here

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.900 
be advised her womb lay their eggs here
because<00:06:11.650> they<00:06:11.830> think<00:06:11.889> despond<00:06:12.460> would<00:06:12.639> dry<00:06:12.849> it

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
because they think despond would dry it

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.909 
because they think despond would dry it
before<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.450> eggs<00:06:14.020> could<00:06:14.260> develop<00:06:14.470> into<00:06:14.680> the

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
before the eggs could develop into the

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.250 
before the eggs could develop into the
mud<00:06:15.070> eyes<00:06:15.220> which<00:06:15.550> are<00:06:15.669> the<00:06:15.789> young<00:06:16.260> dragonfly

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
mud eyes which are the young dragonfly

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.070 
mud eyes which are the young dragonfly
larvae

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.409 

well<00:06:22.009> I've<00:06:22.099> been<00:06:22.129> working<00:06:22.639> the<00:06:22.729> paddock<00:06:23.090> over

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419
