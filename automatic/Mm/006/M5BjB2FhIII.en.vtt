 the team closed imagined hunger because 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.759
 I was not in the fat bath tomorrow. 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.800
 changed my maranguape car boss in 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:31.480
 white line denied discovered my 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.879
 want to seek a way from the years in this 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.220

 house maria do cielo baraka ambiel the champion 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.030
 baby not in the front is that there is one more 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.820
 of many chances of on ba2 cover three 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.050
 I have created a this year as two 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.839
 micro days 11 science modi most part 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.540
 of these series and did not cry nor did the hawks 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:09.530
 fifth of us this episode are expected to fall 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.200
 three four five episodes so it is 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.930
 Let's hope the story is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.950
 different simple is not loud for my 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.440
 The first phase only lives to sow because the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.869
 at this time sign turkish chbosky 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.670
 post is not news to anyone but with 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.380
 few people in portugal just from 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.360
 performance and with few people here in 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.759
 channel of their importance 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.310
 I'll clean it up and make your mother happy 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.220
 question makes sense and series to much 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.929
 few people see that beyond if we do not 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.020
 we got captivated among these people 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.929
 believe that there is not much motivation to 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.299
 continue to make videos of this game 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.369
 in this case in beautiful escapes 13 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.960
 How do you know the team has not had 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.110
 availability because of the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.630
 60's tests with schools to school 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.090
 is over and I'm practically 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.090
 holidays so now I'm going to have more time 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.159
 available and how you now have more time 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.020
 free I finally came back to think that 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.979
 lives in bh as he was coming to a 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.350
 understanding 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.049
 so I ended up hooking again 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.890
 of michael oher and to create that this 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:18.680
 sir that ended up in the x exchanges 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.500
 and as estrogen left from videos by 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.510
 Incredible as it seems from emea ended up by 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.239
 join the useful to the pleasant of castro 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.700
 I was showing that this series that is a 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.500
 little different from the others because I 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.690
 I want to teach an online story. 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.739
 citing the video to advance a 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.049
 little different 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.560
 I think it's cool to be a way to captivate 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.720
 your attention and 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.330
 we do include more attention 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.540
 Russians showed interest in Inmetro 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.849
 and many people thanks to the regimes have to 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.190
 take some in 13 more interest in 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.530
 It's good to go in together and I think 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.480
 It was very rewarding. 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.580
 I guess who is really your goal 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.390
 give more importance to change will come 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.430
 because our fish not team maybe 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.069
 of such importance that it deserved 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.709
 because I made many shades good just like this 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.400
 how is it like the other news the ball at 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.700
 zero 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.319
 so I believe ox exchange for 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.890
 keep on top that around you a 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.900
 basket chick I'm not sure but I do not 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.299
 I was very sad for maybe 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.599
 when you wanted to create a 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.470
 Ford team has a pic closer to the 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.870
 first 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.090
 but I'm quite happy because I 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.470
 until you reach the starting position until you 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.690
 although enclosed in quotation marks 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.510
 I'll be late, maybe it's only in January. 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.910
 I 'll be able to reach that mark. 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.310
 so until then he came out to have a good 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.019
 team to achieve a record 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.220
 to correct the playoffs and 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.829
 this team 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.609
 what I said ney that the new one can 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.549
 update so much we already have cult - a 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.980
 germinate group is to have partners and 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.180
 Mexico, our initial is quite 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.370
 stable 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.260
 so I do not need to worry 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.019
 now at this early stage in winning games 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.690
 because I came out that james harden is a player 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.370
 which marks the 20 30 points per game and the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.489
 own michael our team on the back 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.350
 as well as a bad thing that this team 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.870
 have is that I have to be fighting for 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.359
 starting position with these two players 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.880
 arango felt good to me incredible that 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.610
 look like one is in the shower 20 will be the 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.350
 contrary to being brooks coming from the bank but 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.150
 the coach knows he's good 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.310
 cool that our last one takes in itself 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.050
 I said I think this is how it is then 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.300
 left in the area seems like 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.889
 but the truth is that the tire 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.620
 control I actually think that this 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.070
 brightness 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.660
 plays from the beginning but finally 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.880
 here is mine you can keep doing 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.250
 Slam dunk is an athletic can save the 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.620
 loose blood to high is in is 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.630
 Pretty good 2011 are pretty good 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.880
 to pick up today are also nature 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.090
 help a lot because I can do it 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.340
 that the sebastião runs very fast is 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.800
 a type of player whose son does not 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.600
 lose a thumb that is pretty good on 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.090
 triple because I think it also turns out 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.790
 take the joke just send the ball 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.160
 it's simple this way it 's more expensive 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.650
 because it involves more voice and participation 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.789
 because then you have to develop several 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.050
 relatives my debtor is to send triples 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.830
 medium and short distance launches 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.690
 of 60 a curious fact is that although the 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.260
 my thumb is not good 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.150
 to send wheats and there is medium seed 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.320
 and short distance is quite good in 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.479
 free throws 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.570
 supposedly he is an athlete can stay 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.729
 giving 2010 is good in any kind of bid 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.770
 almost no me in the freerolls is 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.849
 fairly good and has a percentage of 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:46.030
 more than 79% which is quite reasonable 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.280
 in my opinion all the 9 million in 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.229
 alike is not just the looks at all 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.910
 the league winners I have one 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.590
 the best percentages and think 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.050
 reach the public to explain my 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.419
 presence is the main objective is 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.820
 to be a look of the year 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.370
 I have been already recorded several games 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.310
 on-line bridge merit is to start here by 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.770
 this fish will have the back of 10 23 bridge 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.289
 because we want to increase allotment 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.229
 slightly this fasc for the 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.750
 15 6 bridge because in the first place of the 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.960
 dolo crime can is brad will dos 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.520
 used with 16 bridges will 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.349
 be a rather curious fight because 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.729
 we also have other looks like this is the case 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.949
 to decrease it 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.470
 then he should write your very 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.419
 team this player are as soon as the 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.550
 title they wanted they won a position 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.510
 the start of the season because 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.820
 has not played any games yet. 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.490
 I did not like it and I have to be there. 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.380
 to fight two players while in the 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.450
 group and day the girl will be a 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.130
 very good challenge and I think this will 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.140
 have and I think this week will be 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.840
 Different I think I finally got 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.810
 finish a series of councilors cover 3 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.750
 What is going to be the house to stop it? 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.180
 Are you going to need to go? 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.290
 how many sisters this year when 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:08.160
 with drugs athlete ocs josh t 26 bridge 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.750
 normal display by me and the rest 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.510
 players were also quite well. 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.140
 with the test with the 23 bridges of our 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.940
 side 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.490
 the bank is to contribute a lot I read with 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.770
 ten bridges not bad for a second game 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.540
 is also the father falling quite in 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.980
 first game so thats it i just hope 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.990
 do not be resist do not forget 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.140
 have left and above all sign up for 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:31.340
 more of whom der does not escape 3 in fifa and 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.340
 3 say sun
