formula which you can follow to achieve

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.140 
formula which you can follow to achieve
most<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.650> them<00:00:49.800> would<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.820> me<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> show

most of them would you like me to show

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.880 
most of them would you like me to show
you

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.250 

we'll<00:00:54.670> start<00:00:54.969> it<00:00:55.149> with<00:00:55.269> just<00:00:55.510> an<00:00:55.870> ordinary

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
we'll start it with just an ordinary

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.310 
we'll start it with just an ordinary
body<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.940> this<00:00:58.149> look<00:00:58.390> ordinary<00:00:58.570> doesn't<00:00:59.170> look

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
body and this look ordinary doesn't look

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.099 
body and this look ordinary doesn't look
heroic<00:00:59.769> is<00:01:00.760> there<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.059> reason<00:01:01.479> for<00:01:01.510> this

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
heroic is there a reason for this

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.039 
heroic is there a reason for this
well<00:01:02.829> let's<00:01:03.129> have<00:01:03.280> a<00:01:03.339> look<00:01:03.600> most<00:01:04.600> average

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
well let's have a look most average

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.730 
well let's have a look most average
bodies<00:01:05.680> men<00:01:06.549> or<00:01:06.700> women<00:01:07.030> are<00:01:07.540> about<00:01:07.990> 7<00:01:08.500> heads

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
bodies men or women are about 7 heads

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.420 
bodies men or women are about 7 heads
high<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.420> if<00:01:10.780> we<00:01:10.990> keep<00:01:11.140> our<00:01:11.320> height<00:01:11.590> but<00:01:11.950> extend

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
high so if we keep our height but extend

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.700 
high so if we keep our height but extend
the<00:01:12.549> width<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:12.970> little<00:01:13.210> bit<00:01:13.420> maybe<00:01:14.380> the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
the width a little bit maybe the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.529 
the width a little bit maybe the
characters<00:01:15.250> getting<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.210> bit<00:01:16.390> more

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
characters getting a bit more

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.630 
characters getting a bit more
interesting<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.860> if<00:01:17.979> we<00:01:18.130> are<00:01:18.250> even<00:01:18.610> more

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
interesting and if we are even more

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.929 
interesting and if we are even more
width<00:01:19.270> then<00:01:20.080> we<00:01:20.500> begin<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.070> have<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
width then we begin to have the

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.749 
width then we begin to have the
superhero<00:01:22.810> we<00:01:23.679> think<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.009> this<00:01:24.159> hero<00:01:24.490> as

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
superhero we think of this hero as

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.210 
superhero we think of this hero as
Superman<00:01:25.539> but<00:01:26.200> I<00:01:26.259> suppose<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.740> started<00:01:27.100> with
