00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:12.760
 The bending of the bend leads to the left end of the guitar 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:18.370
 Raising or lowering drag to push the line that changes is how to play the field 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:22.960
 At this time there is no correlation with the performance of any left-handed acoustic guitar 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:24.850
 Since the tension is used relatively more than the electric guitar , 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.970
 It is characteristic 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:33.460
 Well , when you're done, 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:38.620
 Figure out when one of the left, the pitch from one part of the field, let's party banding 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:42.750
 Let's take a look at how the part looks like. 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.750
 It is changing with ding. 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.860
 Well 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.620
 Sound 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:57.780
 And this time basically one, two, two, three and a half lines 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:04.580
 Oh, I'm bending upwards 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:09.250
 And fish line 5, line 4 will bend downwards down the line. 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.230
 We will see, should listen to the sound coming from one six beonjul 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.650
 Obanshupo 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.880
 4 times about 2 5 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.060
 Third side 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.229
 Wool sound coming week 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.229
 General line coming 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:37.200
 So that you pull to change from one field to the second change 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:42.270
 Let's be banding. And in general, when we're on the score 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:48.119
 Air usually called when a change to a reaction represented by the number one-half 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.000
 And when the title to change a note after the full word the word riraneun 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.549
 I use it to mark the score 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.479
 Let's look at the sheet music below . 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.509
 It looks like 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.140
 I 'll take these two words here. 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.140
 Well 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.980
 Now the basic market is skt . 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.530
 This week the ropes and once the choking look up the reaction from the general line of 7% 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.110
 I'll try. 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.790
 Sound 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:32.800
 One of many well Ugh Ying coming party 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.090
 To find the Tidori negative chromatic MYPA one particular reaction choking 2 minutes 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.590
 I played it . 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.910
 I once again looked example by comparing the left and right 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.910
 Your 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.690
 or a te
