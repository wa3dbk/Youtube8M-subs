00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.390
 a happy waidmanns healing from the 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.230
 beautiful deer revier left in 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:44.210
 poland in hinterpommern this braven 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.700
 Stag I joined nb last night 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.390
 termination of the bushes light so against 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.870
 20 o'clock are allowed to shoot 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:02:00.440
 this deer was a brute and 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:04.010
 has operated his animals and at the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.220
 last point I cry then 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:14.380
 This beautiful deer succumbs to it 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.380
 is a degree 1 16 end straight 16 end 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.870
 about eleven years old and I have to say 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:29.930
 I am very pleased and thankful that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:33.739
 I with the professional office bald this trip 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.010
 in pomerania was allowed to compete and 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.550
 my yacht colleagues are equally grateful 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.640
 and happy that we are exploiting this big one 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.700
 could do in the last week 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.700
 Thank you very much 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.160
 Waidmannsheil and greetings from the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.930
 formally game-rich yes that's really 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.389
 top results not only the 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.889
 Shots outside also the track that 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.870
 it already the madness 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.210
 and who the last days 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.020
 nobody would have pursued that for 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.660
 kept possible 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.860
 let's see how it goes on please 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.139
 I apologize for the delay 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.330
 the transmission we have big problems 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.910
 with the line she breaks again 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.560
 Together we do not have a fixed line too 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.990
 but only have a radio connection 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.449
 and that's just not sure us 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.789
 try Mondays to Fridays before 11 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.830
 to be online on our site and 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.880
 I hope that in the future it is about 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.740
 now two parts 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.910
 about the amount of data in a transmission 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.130
 to reduce 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.440
 So stay true to us 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.900
 again tomorrow, come again new 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.030
 results and then they are I hope 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.610
 Let's forget about the competition 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.289
 but this time out for a little break 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.289
 then it goes on with it
