00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
okay in this video we're going

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.650 
okay in this video we're going
things<00:00:10.900> this<00:00:11.170> is<00:00:11.380> the<00:00:12.180> triple<00:00:13.180> wick<00:00:13.510> alcohol

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
things this is the triple wick alcohol

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.350 
things this is the triple wick alcohol
in<00:00:15.990> my<00:00:16.110> last<00:00:16.290> video<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.980> might<00:00:17.940> they'll<00:00:18.150> see

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
in my last video you might they'll see

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.030 
in my last video you might they'll see
better<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.869> video<00:00:19.230> that's<00:00:19.470> made<00:00:19.770> from

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
better in this video that's made from

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.970 
better in this video that's made from
just<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.400> small<00:00:20.520> yeast<00:00:20.910> jar<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.200> this<00:00:22.770> is<00:00:22.950> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
just a small yeast jar and this is a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.980 
just a small yeast jar and this is a
indoor<00:00:23.640> setup<00:00:24.090> I'm<00:00:24.360> running<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:24.960> of

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
indoor setup I'm running off of

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.850 
indoor setup I'm running off of
denatured<00:00:25.710> alcohol<00:00:25.860> this<00:00:26.369> time<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.650> burns

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
denatured alcohol this time and it burns

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.400 
denatured alcohol this time and it burns
much<00:00:29.130> cleaner<00:00:29.540> you<00:00:30.540> don't<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.810> some<00:00:31.080> foot

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
much cleaner you don't have some foot

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.770 
much cleaner you don't have some foot
there<00:00:31.739> that's<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.340> burning<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.060> isopropyl

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
there that's from burning and isopropyl

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.610 
there that's from burning and isopropyl
alcohol<00:00:34.190> better<00:00:35.190> known<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.579> rubbing<00:00:36.120> alcohol

alcohol better known as rubbing alcohol
you<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.800> here<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.220> three<00:00:38.820> fire<00:00:39.090> bricks

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
you see here I have three fire bricks

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.410 
you see here I have three fire bricks
just<00:00:40.560> common<00:00:41.190> brick<00:00:41.399> would<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.700> fine<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.270> main

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
just common brick would be fine the main

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.670 
just common brick would be fine the main
things<00:00:42.630> just<00:00:42.870> make<00:00:43.020> sure<00:00:43.170> they<00:00:43.350> don't<00:00:43.470> have

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
things just make sure they don't have

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.880 
things just make sure they don't have
holes<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> sides<00:00:45.110> but<00:00:46.110> pretty<00:00:46.530> much<00:00:46.680> any

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
holes in the sides but pretty much any

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.310 
holes in the sides but pretty much any
brick<00:00:47.190> will<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.179> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.750> I've<00:00:48.899> got<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
brick will do and then I've got like a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.599 
brick will do and then I've got like a
floor<00:00:49.590> tile<00:00:50.000> down<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.410> gives<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.980> non

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
floor tile down here so this gives a non

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.939 
floor tile down here so this gives a non
flammable<00:00:53.969> surface<00:00:54.929> and<00:00:55.260> relatively<00:00:55.739> heat

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
flammable surface and relatively heat

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.270 
flammable surface and relatively heat
resistant<00:00:56.519> surface<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
resistant surface to use you know to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.689 
resistant surface to use you know to
turn<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.789> into<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.629> heater<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.670> bought<00:01:02.670> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
turn this into a heater I bought a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.850 
turn this into a heater I bought a
couple<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.269> clay<00:01:03.539> flowerpots<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> some<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
couple of clay flowerpots and some of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.060 
couple of clay flowerpots and some of
you've<00:01:05.040> probably<00:01:05.309> already<00:01:05.670> seen<00:01:05.940> evils<00:01:07.070> tea

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
you've probably already seen evils tea

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.470 
you've probably already seen evils tea
light<00:01:08.600> heaters<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:11.040> they<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:12.300> limited

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
light heaters and they have very limited

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.410 
light heaters and they have very limited
heat<00:01:13.050> output<00:01:13.320> because<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> fact<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
heat output because of the fact that the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
heat output because of the fact that the
candles<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.710> really<00:01:16.950> generate<00:01:17.370> very<00:01:17.550> many

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
candles don't really generate very many

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.899 
candles don't really generate very many
BTUs<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.710> again<00:01:19.890> you're<00:01:20.040> gonna<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.369> some<00:01:20.579> soot

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
BTUs so again you're gonna see some soot

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.109 
BTUs so again you're gonna see some soot
from<00:01:21.270> earlier<00:01:21.930> experiments<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.619> I've<00:01:22.740> done

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
from earlier experiments that I've done

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.969 
from earlier experiments that I've done
with<00:01:24.119> isopropyl<00:01:24.509> alcohol<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.500> all<00:01:25.590> I've<00:01:25.770> done

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
with isopropyl alcohol but all I've done

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.260 
with isopropyl alcohol but all I've done
is<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.130> taking<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.229> bolt<00:01:28.610> some<00:01:29.610> nuts<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> some

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
is just taking a bolt some nuts and some

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.480 
is just taking a bolt some nuts and some
washers<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.560> I've<00:01:31.649> got<00:01:31.799> these<00:01:31.950> flower<00:01:32.250> pots

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
washers and I've got these flower pots

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.639 
washers and I've got these flower pots
that<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.299> hole<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> bottom<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.229> then

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
that have a hole in the bottom and then

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.999 
that have a hole in the bottom and then
they<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.979> three<00:01:35.310> holes<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> sides<00:01:37.009> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
they have three holes on the sides and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.490 
they have three holes on the sides and
so<00:01:38.250> what<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> offset<00:01:39.390> these<00:01:39.869> holes<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
so what I do is I offset these holes and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
so what I do is I offset these holes and
you<00:01:40.680> could<00:01:40.860> actually<00:01:41.070> add<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.850> these<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
you could actually add more of these to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.760 
you could actually add more of these to
capture<00:01:42.810> more<00:01:42.990> heat<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.710> does

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
capture more heat but what this does

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.080 
capture more heat but what this does
that<00:01:44.009> work<00:01:44.369> sound<00:01:44.789> like<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> thermal<00:01:45.450> battery

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
that work sound like a thermal battery

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.609 
that work sound like a thermal battery
so<00:01:48.090> by<00:01:48.210> offsetting<00:01:48.630> them<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.140> kind<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
so by offsetting them you kind of make a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.260 
so by offsetting them you kind of make a
more<00:01:50.490> snakey<00:01:51.090> flow<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.810> increase<00:01:52.590> him<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:53.009> of

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
more snakey flow and increase him out of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.420 
more snakey flow and increase him out of
surface<00:01:54.270> area<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.960> hot<00:01:55.680> gases<00:01:56.250> from

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
surface area that the hot gases from

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.770 
surface area that the hot gases from
combustion<00:01:56.880> come<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.420> contact<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:59.719> so<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
combustion come in contact with so to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.080 
combustion come in contact with so to
turn<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.320> into<00:02:01.560> heater<00:02:04.609> simply<00:02:05.609> screw<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
turn this into heater simply screw that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.870 
turn this into heater simply screw that
on<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.490> up<00:02:08.729> over

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:20.690 

just<00:02:12.880> like<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.810> creates

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.740 

relatively<00:02:21.700> safe

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.660 

would<00:02:25.350> produce<00:02:25.620> heat<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.190> don't<00:02:26.340> have<00:02:26.520> any

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
would produce heat you don't have any

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.510 
would produce heat you don't have any
open<00:02:27.090> flames<00:02:27.420> papers<00:02:28.110> not<00:02:28.260> gonna<00:02:28.410> fall<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
open flames papers not gonna fall and

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.230 
open flames papers not gonna fall and
hit<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.060> within<00:02:30.900> reason<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.700> after<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> while

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
hit that within reason and after a while

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.000 
hit that within reason and after a while
the<00:02:33.780> fact<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.140> already<00:02:34.290> feel<00:02:34.650> these<00:02:34.830> are

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the fact I already feel these are

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.340 
the fact I already feel these are
starting<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.490> warm

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
starting to get warm

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.780 
starting to get warm
these<00:02:37.350> will<00:02:37.530> begin<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:38.010> absorb<00:02:38.340> energy

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
these will begin to absorb energy

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.500 
these will begin to absorb energy
instead<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> heat<00:02:39.990> rising<00:02:40.800> upward

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
instead of all the heat rising upward

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.810 
instead of all the heat rising upward
these<00:02:42.510> collects<00:02:43.290> heat<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.610> heat

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
these collects heat and then the heat

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.390 
these collects heat and then the heat
radiates<00:02:45.240> outward<00:02:46.130> another<00:02:47.130> neat<00:02:47.370> feature

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
radiates outward another neat feature

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.000 
radiates outward another neat feature
about<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.900> setup<00:02:50.270> is<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.770> actually

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
about the setup is that you can actually

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.700 
about the setup is that you can actually
pull<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:55.470> alcohol<00:02:55.800> burner<00:02:56.100> back<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.530> can

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
pull the alcohol burner back and you can

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.770 
pull the alcohol burner back and you can
set<00:02:59.630> like<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> small<00:03:00.990> pot<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.230> water<00:03:01.500> up<00:03:02.160> over

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
set like a small pot of water up over

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.500 
set like a small pot of water up over
actually<00:03:03.780> I'm<00:03:03.840> gonna<00:03:03.960> have<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.200> move<00:03:04.350> this

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
actually I'm gonna have to move this

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.450 
actually I'm gonna have to move this
back<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.570> little<00:03:06.750> bit<00:03:07.080> more<00:03:10.130> but<00:03:11.130> then<00:03:11.310> you

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
back a little bit more but then you

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.400 
back a little bit more but then you
could<00:03:11.640> use<00:03:11.820> this<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.090> cook<00:03:13.550> or<00:03:14.550> boil<00:03:14.940> water<00:03:15.410> and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
could use this to cook or boil water and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.210 
could use this to cook or boil water and
you'll<00:03:16.680> notice<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:18.570> makes<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.930> very<00:03:19.200> very<00:03:19.860> nice

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
you'll notice it makes it very very nice

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.690 
you'll notice it makes it very very nice
even<00:03:20.610> flame<00:03:20.910> over<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.360> bottom<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.840> pan

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.830 

that's<00:03:26.700> what<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.000> gonna<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:27.360> right<00:03:27.540> now<00:03:27.810> just

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that's what I'm gonna do right now just

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.130 
that's what I'm gonna do right now just
leave<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.890> on<00:03:29.330> there<00:03:30.330> we're<00:03:30.690> gonna<00:03:30.780> look<00:03:30.959> at

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
leave that on there we're gonna look at

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.020 
leave that on there we're gonna look at
the<00:03:31.260> time<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.680> 4:23<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.430> I'll<00:03:35.670> come<00:03:35.880> back

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
the time it is 4:23 and I'll come back

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.790 
the time it is 4:23 and I'll come back
when<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.510> boiling<00:03:39.470> alright<00:03:40.470> we've<00:03:40.650> got

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
when this is boiling alright we've got

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.120 
when this is boiling alright we've got
us<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.070> good<00:03:41.190> boil<00:03:41.489> going<00:03:41.610> now<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.830> their<00:03:43.830> time

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
us a good boil going now and their time

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.750 
us a good boil going now and their time
it<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.940> 4:30<00:03:45.480> for<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.950> little<00:03:47.310> didn't<00:03:47.610> take

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
it is 4:30 for so little didn't take

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.970 
it is 4:30 for so little didn't take
long<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.000> boil<00:03:48.300> a<00:03:48.420> quart<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.690> water<00:03:48.980> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
long to boil a quart of water the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.890 
long to boil a quart of water the
temperature<00:03:50.400> would<00:03:50.640> have<00:03:50.790> been<00:03:50.940> about<00:03:51.330> sixty

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
temperature would have been about sixty

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.420 
temperature would have been about sixty
degrees<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.410> estimate<00:03:52.920> my<00:03:53.040> well<00:03:53.220> water

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
degrees that estimate my well water

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.300 
degrees that estimate my well water
coming<00:03:53.820> in<00:03:53.940> at<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.320> boil<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:55.890> quart<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.130> water

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
coming in at so to boil a quart of water

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.259 
coming in at so to boil a quart of water
and<00:03:56.900> like<00:03:57.900> prob<00:03:58.170> about<00:03:58.200> nine<00:03:58.650> 10<00:03:59.130> minutes<00:03:59.489> or

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
and like prob about nine 10 minutes or

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.740 
and like prob about nine 10 minutes or
so<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:01.860> is<00:04:01.980> not<00:04:02.190> bad<00:04:02.489> especially<00:04:03.300> for

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
so it is not bad especially for

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.910 
so it is not bad especially for
something<00:04:04.080> that<00:04:04.440> was<00:04:04.650> nearly<00:04:05.190> free<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.550> build

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.010 

and<00:04:10.920> then<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.520> get<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.150> back<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.390> being<00:04:12.720> uses

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
and then to get this back to being uses

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.390 
and then to get this back to being uses
here<00:04:13.380> all<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.620> have<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.830> do<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:13.950> just<00:04:14.160> push

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
here all you have to do you just push

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.699 
here all you have to do you just push
the<00:04:14.700> alcohol<00:04:15.480> stove<00:04:15.810> back<00:04:16.320> under<00:04:16.620> the

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
the alcohol stove back under the

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.940 
the alcohol stove back under the
flowerpots<00:04:18.080> then<00:04:19.080> we'll<00:04:19.200> continue<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.739> pretty

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
flowerpots then we'll continue to pretty

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.479 
flowerpots then we'll continue to pretty

definitely<00:04:25.200> seems<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.500> be<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.710> way<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.860> go<00:04:26.070> so

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
definitely seems to be the way to go so

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.260 
definitely seems to be the way to go so
