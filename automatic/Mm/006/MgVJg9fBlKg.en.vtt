00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.969
 I am very pleased thrilled 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.639
 have won a world championship and 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.070
 good is also in proportion what 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.529
 waste and I've made it dust that I'm the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.050
 I'm muscular 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.240
 very very tired I am going we have 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.030
 recovered but muscularly above all 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.500
 Well, very sore, very sore 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.020
 until they start to warm up a bit 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.780
 the hinges the truth that staying by 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.820
 there like like a lazy bear in the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.379
 race yesterday was the one that I take the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.310
 not the longest but the one that most 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.649
 time use and good everything you know 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.500
 that everything is a bit aimed at 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.510
 to be able to run with a little bit of guarantees 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 the car mb I do not think it's still going to be 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.680
 a career practically twice as 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.460
 hours of what I'm doing up 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.230
 now they were 80 and 83 kilometers and well 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.820
 that the organization gave a time 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.399
 estimated 9 hours 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.399
 I saw very clearly that we were going to take 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.719
 more for that reason of the kilometers and if 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.790
 they were well measured and watching the 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.160
 unevenness 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.820
 Well that's not the truth that does not wait 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.870
 it will take ten and a half hours but 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.970
 approaching at 10 o'clock so yes 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.560
 I counted on it sometimes you can get 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.270
 even disorient and not know exactly 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.150
 at what point of the circuit are you then 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.150
 and that I like yes that I like to divide it 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.460
 in use the refreshments to divide 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.020
 the circuit and that's what I was saying 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.680
 I carried in each boat I knew what I 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.960
 it was until the next 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.660
 supplies then this neutral me 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.920
 I think that because of the circumstances 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.090
 for being a field to everyone for being 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.960
 here in chamonix not 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.210
 with this environment so beast and for 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.539
 also how I found myself in the race 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.280
 brand in a memorable race I 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.840
 I would have liked to arrive with a little more 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.079
 of advantage but good either 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.079
 missing 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.140
 go down half an hour the time would not have 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.550
 could of course that gift and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.280
 finding myself right could have been a 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.800
 little bit more I began to notice shocks like that 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.539
 At times I was good at times I went wrong and if 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.120
 I want some time that the pace was 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.819
 was a little under a little yes that 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 has been able to reduce the time but neither 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.590
 yesterday anka the world championship and what 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.600
 who rewarded was winning the race no no 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.450
 time is an important appointment that we 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.830
 is this season is the poster of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.930
 montblanc 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.960
 so I'd like to do more races and 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.820
 we have planned now on the 13th 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.710
 val d'isère for example we have a 65 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.720
 km also of world cup but but 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.070
 come on if I see that I'm not recovered or 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.040
 that after that will cost me 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.840
 recover more to get the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.130
 we discard with the body jotero that 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.930
 I have now I think it's not time 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.930
 to give advice because iván 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.940
 I would advise you not to do it but I 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.880
 I think that above all the most important thing is 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.270
 go very very little by little and make careers 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.810
 and to consider yourself in the challenges that go a 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.000
 little bit according to the preparation that 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.470
 you have to do and the time 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.260
 have to train and with your 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.450
 conditions that is not do not do things that 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.730
 then they will be able to pass bill through 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.430
 that I do not even thank you to enjoy 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.250
 because it's a bit disproportionate 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.250
 with the time you have to train
