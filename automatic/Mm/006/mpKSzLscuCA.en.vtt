00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.929
 Good morning , Robert. Good morning to you. 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.640
 get spectacular sport 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.200
 now we see that it is to say that the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.599
 Proof is good for those who like the sea. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.440
 calm after a Saturday it had wind 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.030
 rough seas 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.070
 Sunday dawned very well O 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 And that's what you can think at home. 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.109
 our nothing to call so it's very easy 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.210
 do not swim in the sea any sea is very 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.990
 different given in pools to show 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.220
 their differences 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.830
 we set up a special report 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.050
 that we receive now the scenery is so 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 inviting who knows how to swim soon 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.829
 think if I can in the pool that the sea 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 it will be easy 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.250
 the crossing of the forts shows that this 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.250
 association is not so simple 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.000
 at first to swim in the sea until it seems 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.750
 quieter as the future body 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.390
 best 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.670
 in practice this is not reflected in the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.040
 wear is also higher in the sea due to 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.910
 saltwater dehydrates 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.650
 faster 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.190
 the main difficulty is the orientation 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:05.449
 in the clear water of the workshops is easy 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.880
 then straight since this then who 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.040
 make crossings you need to take your head off the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.220
 water and look forward to the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.979
 direction in this movement of the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.229
 the hip ends up sinking and the 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.130
 legs and arms need to do more 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.310
 force 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.410
 You have to suppose with 75 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.729
 strokes per minute instead of tacos 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.869
 6460 strokes with a minute that would be a 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.100
 more elongated side 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.100
 You have to be a motorcycle. 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.340
 another important difference here at sea 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.990
 athletes swim together without that 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.360
 demarcation of spaces that exists in the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.570
 pool the smartest you can 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.470
 find an advantage in this 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.659
 whenever a player is thus 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.990
 Coladinho at the feet of a rival he 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.009
 can save energy 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.640
 basically who's back there and 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.090
 saves 11% of oxygen in the 6% 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.740
 and reduce the heart rate by 38%. 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.110
 muscle fatigue 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.610
 all that reaches the end of the three 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.720
 one thousand five hundred meters 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.720
 It is not a player any 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.480
 absolutely everything is scientific
