00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.410
 upper middle class driving around the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.280
 Spend 30,000 euros and then correct 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.200
 save fuel 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.880
 Sounds tempting when you get the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.469
 Type designation of the cars does not see 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.630
 because nobody knows which engine 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.660
 underneath and at the latest volvo 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.300
 The r design looks for at least 300 ps 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.519
 from small diesel for the sparfüchse 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.080
 under the sheet the occurrence of the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.510
 Business class above 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.560
 that's what these three bonnets promise 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.630
 The Mercedes has just got its look 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 brushed up the facelift of the c class 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.510
 is still the measure of all things in 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.700
 things comfort 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.219
 but the c-class will be with everyone 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.020
 generation always sportier that too 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.820
 when benz no longer in there is what 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.829
 it says nothing new 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.770
 the c 180 cdi has almost 2 2 liter displacement 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.410
 makes 120 ps and accelerates in 10 8 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.199
 second to 100 that the best in 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.930
 this comparison also the 208 km / h 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.320
 topspeed diesel tip only at 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.909
 consumption he has to give himself beaten 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.280
 55 liters of diesel are in our test 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.560
 good but just not one place 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.710
 The Mercedes offers the most 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.070
 space in the trunk 475 liters are 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.330
 again top the facelift of the c class that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.140
 can be described as quite successful 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.090
 become 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.340
 This car offers the most drivers 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.350
 and also the most comfortable sitting but that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.490
 one expects of a benz too 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.900
 but and the surprise comes a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.759
 a little bit he still has the biggest 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.020
 motor most of the ps and also the most 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.740
 torque means he is doing right 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.810
 Forward 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.659
 Unfortunately, the whole thing has a hook 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.650
 and that is one must say as always at 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.630
 mercedes unfortunately the price at 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.750
 base price is the stuttgarter than 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.850
 only above the 30,000 euro mark in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.579
 comparable equipment peter pc 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.890
 even over 35,000 euros in the class 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.060
 test compares so that it is clearly 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.770
 at the top 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.460
 but that is not the case in this case 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.460
 necessarily positive 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.140
 the Munich residents come with their little ones 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.420
 diesel in the bare base under 30,000 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.800
 euro out in this test is comparison 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.050
 the bmw even the cheapest with 31.500 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.160
 However, he still lacks 20 euros 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.780
 automatic climate control for 770 euro surcharge 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.610
 Beyond any number games is the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.030
 BMW remains the benchmark in matters 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.440
 Dynamiklenkung indeed felt the fun on 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.560
 Gas that's his strength 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.720
 even though he's called 316 de has one 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.760
 two-liter engine also here is not 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.760
 more in it what the machine says 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.980
 makes 115 ps and accelerates to 11 1 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.019
 seconds to 100 first surprise 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.780
 Mercedes is faster at the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.860
 topspeed the bmw has to with 202 km / h 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.410
 to be satisfied 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.810
 But he is right at the front in terms of consumption 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.739
 52 liters are compared with this 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.690
 unbeatable 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.220
 even though we do not like it 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.220
 the sporting waiver is 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.310
 the 3 bmw from Munich drives 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.230
 meanwhile a few years already 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.270
 the hump and from the outside as well as from 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.410
 inside design about as surprising 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.100
 find leather pants on the Munich 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.230
 oktoberfest 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.240
 but what is surprised is that the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.620
 small diesel anyway the sporty 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.600
 character of bmw receives 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.280
 he clearly a weak start and the 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.200
 engine is also throttled but if you 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.820
 economical and still sporty about the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.600
 wants to wiggle corners then that goes with the 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.600
 you still best 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.820
 the bmw is a little over the years 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.800
 come but he is still a very 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.660
 good car in the space conditions 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.610
 is there everywhere in midfield 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.230
 In the back you even have the most 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.020
 Legroom or even the trunk 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.000
 is not bad with 460 liters 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.830
 bavaria is doing well everywhere 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.390
 also fun and are in this 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.390
 compare even the cheapest 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.969
 The Volvo S60 is mixing the scene on it 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.920
 has the cheapest entry level in 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:59.060
 the base costs only 27,000 950 euros 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.000
 However , he has in our test version 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.010
 already a higher equipment line 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.680
 including automatic climate control comes to that 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.599
 the optik package includes 17 meters 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.730
 comparable equipment to mercedes 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.470
 and bmw is the volvo then on the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.060
 same price level as the German 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.220
 premium products 32 1350 euro range 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.410
 only for midfield a bargain itself 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.110
 So different from the volvo has the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.870
 smallest motor the 16 liter machine 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.090
 but still has 115 ps and is up 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.039
 also much less in the acceleration 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.380
 and also in the hands it topspeed 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.210
 not for the front places 11.9 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.150
 Seconds pass by up to 100 of the brand 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.340
 and at 195 km / h is over 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.460
 for the volvo is in the consumption with 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.320
 5 5 liters at mercedes level despite 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.990
 This abstinence is also made by the 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.370
 Volvo quite fun 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.470
 the sweden have said we are building 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.560
 times the most beautiful car rims in the 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.699
 R-design rear diffuser with double exhaust 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.820
 painted mirrors the entire 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.010
 coupéform just says awesome box 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.070
 But beauty is not all the copy 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.150
 from the cost just also headroom 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.530
 trunk volume and this very whole 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.599
 small diesel paired with the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.659
 front drive of the cost, unfortunately, too 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:14.949
 driving dynamics so he sees the fastest 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:17.240
 out is actually but slow 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.949
 Nevertheless, the late do not have to 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.110
 behind the German hide the 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.400
 Volvo offers an aggressive alternative 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.810
 in the upper middle class 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.969
 had a good one 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.770
 safety equipment and you can too 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.129
 Almost all driver assistance systems for 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.259
 order the s60 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.490
 but that's not enough for the victory 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.590
 especially his weak 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.659
 resale value and also the deductions 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.349
 the space offered by the sporty 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.990
 coupe form 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.340
 cost point in the first place fencing 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.370
 the two Germans so among themselves 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.889
 off at mercedes is the more modern and 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.500
 better car but the price prevented 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.050
 the overall victory of bmw is cheaper and 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.909
 still drives agile place one 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.909
 in this case to the bavaria from munich
