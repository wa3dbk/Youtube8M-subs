00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
I just got another pair of the as your

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.350 
I just got another pair of the as your
app<00:00:11.519> runs<00:00:13.099> sub<00:00:14.099> ground<00:00:14.400> versions<00:00:14.880> actually

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
app runs sub ground versions actually

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.250 
app runs sub ground versions actually
and<00:00:15.650> this<00:00:16.650> time<00:00:16.949> even<00:00:17.130> I'm<00:00:17.369> not<00:00:17.520> sure<00:00:17.730> if

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
and this time even I'm not sure if

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.900 
and this time even I'm not sure if
they're<00:00:19.260> authentic<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:20.010> they're<00:00:20.670> replicas<00:00:21.210> or

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
they're authentic or they're replicas or

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.230 
they're authentic or they're replicas or
because<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.150> seller<00:00:24.600> didn't<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:26.240> picture

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
because the seller didn't have a picture

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.269 
because the seller didn't have a picture
of<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:29.340> boot<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> description<00:00:31.070> yeah<00:00:32.070> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
of the boot in the description yeah so

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.240 
of the boot in the description yeah so
that<00:00:32.460> means<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.940> them<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:34.050> eBay<00:00:34.370> year<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
that means I get them on eBay year and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.610 
that means I get them on eBay year and
hopefully<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.940> already<00:00:39.360> zero<00:00:39.690> prime<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.440> all

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
hopefully they already zero prime so all

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.459
