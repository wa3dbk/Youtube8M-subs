00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.639
 frank from android next at ifa 2014 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.260
 tackles event 2 from samsung here has the 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.460
 Korean manufacturers are just his new 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.520
 Flagship presented 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.320
 the samsung galaxy note 4 and i have 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.119
 just my own galaxy note 3 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.670
 what do we want? 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.009
 keep both devices side by side and 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.710
 compare so you see the fronts 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.110
 are actually relatively similar 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.060
 the samsung galaxy note 3 still 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.010
 the old samsung button configuration 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.570
 it is used in the middle 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.789
 the home button is clear but right 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.860
 below you have back button left and 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.250
 took multitasking button while relaxing 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.270
 and 4 we have one here on the back 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.020
 button but here is the multitasking 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.840
 button 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.730
 and yes the screen size has changed 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.910
 not changed both devices have one 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.980
 screen diagonal of 5.7 inches 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.199
 however , the old galaxy touch resolves 3 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.560
 just in quotes in full hd so 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.770
 1920 1080 on while the galaxy note 4 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.460
 a weg.de resolution has 2560 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.290
 x 1440 so not the first time 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.090
 most important feature so the so 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.350
 a lot to the front first you see the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.170
 devices are really really relative 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.439
 but that does not apply anymore 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.430
 to the side to the galaxy note 3 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.290
 There is another old one here 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.030
 plastic frame, although in such a 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.340
 Metal look but you feel that relative 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.900
 Clearly this is plastic if you can 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.040
 that sums up are also fresh 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.399
 small grooves on it 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.740
 while the galaxy note 4 the optics of 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.049
 galaxy alpha r means we have here 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.540
 a metal frame and here are on 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.890
 such small hills in each corner i 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.560
 hope you can see halfway here 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.659
 on the video and also the buttons are 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.429
 now 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.049
 with everyone and that feels total 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.210
 a bit better in the hand 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.329
 also here at the side that is one 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.240
 milled bit and the acts 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.700
 a bit higher on the top 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.459
 we have a similar configuration 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 I would think this here first left 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.780
 We also have an app from jack here 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.959
 galaxy note 3 the infrared interface 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.440
 Here it looks so similar on the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.660
 the right side is the power 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.010
 button continues to quit on the hunt 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.690
 same height 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.209
 On the bottom we have at the galaxy 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.000
 note 3 this year increased a bit 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.590
 enlarged micro usb plug is the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.790
 now my galaxy note 4 can no longer 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.250
 Unfortunately, you can not see it here now 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.310
 Here's where the old device was 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.989
 down the mono speaker is the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.269
 now on the galaxy note 4 on the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.829
 rear side of a piece for the sp 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.930
 here is the sp right now not in there 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.989
 because he is moored here that is 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.819
 but at the same position the galaxy 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.769
 note 4 also has three microphones 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.470
 while the galaxy note 3 of my knowledge 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.870
 only has two and here the loud 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.769
 loudness rocker who has here probably 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.900
 loose the volume button that is at 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.670
 galaxy note 3 still such a one-piece 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.349
 they would have been at the galaxy 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.299
 note we are really two such now 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.190
 very well 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.849
 printable keys on the back have 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.669
 with both devices such a rugby art 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.489
 imitation leather could almost be said 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.650
 that feels reasonably good, though 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.030
 of course plastic and here 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.530
 the cameras is also a big one 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.500
 to make a difference during the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.230
 galaxy note 3 still a 3 10 megapixel 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.209
 camera I would say 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.489
 durchwachsene results produced 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.410
 the galaxy note 4 now has a 16 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.329
 megapixel camera with optical 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.930
 image stabilizer and directly below 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.950
 also the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.230
 the heart rate monitor well you have to 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.159
 not necessarily or used now 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.840
 maybe not necessarily much 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.989
 fitness purposes, however, has samsung 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.069
 share the device or this hardware 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.579
 yet another function donated 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.230
 if you record cfs then you can here 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.870
 with dissolve by simply the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.420
 finger on it so yes puts the front camera 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.010
 has also joined the galaxy note 3 1 at 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.989
 galaxy note 4 improved a bit 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.090
 this is now a 37 megapixel model 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.010
 the exact resolution of the predecessor can 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.989
 I do not quantify exactly now 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.419
 However, this is also here now 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:19.359
 bit more sensitive to light and one has 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:20.440
 also the possibility of one that the 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.199
 front camera is also a bit 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.970
 wide - angle so much in the 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.830
 software has done a little something 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.479
 sp integration has now continued 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.650
 refined at the galaxy note 4 I'll 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.630
 now on individual examples, however 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.820
 not enter and also the multitasking 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.900
 has improved that means to 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.780
 Example that if you are so here 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.060
 you can just go through that 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.210
 traverse it from the upper right 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.099
 screen margin a bit smaller 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.400
 okay that's the show effect now 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.659
 I'm not sorry right now 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.389
 but you can also take ours 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.919
 normal fans and galaxy note 4 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.830
 I'll show you that too 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.210
 So I would say oh so inner values 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.490
 still in galaxy note 4 ticking 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.889
 snapdragon 805 quartz with 2.7 gigahertz 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.449
 should give on a core variant the 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.009
 was not shown here on the ifa and 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.949
 galaxy note 3 was still a snapdragon 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.180
 800 with 2 3 gigahertz in it otherwise 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.699
 three gigabytes of ram 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.430
 in both models and 32 gigabytes 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.389
 internal and via micro sd card 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.460
 expandable memory these are the 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.169
 most important specifications oh so 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.479
 almost forgotten in the galaxy note 4 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.080
 is also here below now 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.460
 Fingerprint sensor in it 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.440
 and now I hope I have none 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.289
 important data forgets both devices 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.300
 are very good i all galaxy note 3 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.190
 owners now, however, see first 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.289
 not necessarily the urge to cover 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.909
 even if this is just me 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.400
 better processing here at the galaxy 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.440
 note 4 but very nice 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.240
 at least on the test device and 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.370
 yes that was it for comparison first 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.789
 between galaxy note 3 and 4 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.020
 I am frank from android next de us 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.400
 see us at the next video if it is 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.639
 Michael and you subscribe 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.639
 See you
