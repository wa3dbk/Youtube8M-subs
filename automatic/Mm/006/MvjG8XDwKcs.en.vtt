00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 when in the ninety-eighth year the company 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.670
 ford showed the focus of the first generation he 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.980
 surprised not only with his sharp design 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.820
 new age style but also the quality of performance 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.029
 for which he was rewarded with the title of the best 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.000
 car of the year 99 in europe a year 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.800
 later became the best of us not surprising 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.980
 that he became one of the most popular 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.970
 cars in the focus class 2 generation 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.219
 entered the market in 2004 and developed 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.170
 successful cest vicik and not only in the market 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.239
 but they also lied where the company was 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:45.510
 stopped the best automakers 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:47.730
 the sixth and seventh years of the 3rd generation and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.489
 appeared in the eleventh year and since 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.250
 does not represent the company to the program for 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.890
 he is one of the market champion 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.430
 over a million are sold every year in the world 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430
 magic tricks 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.360
 it seemed why to update without it 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.880
 successful car but years with 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.760
 competitors lead their why on the market 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 there is an updated focus to find out 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.470
 updated focus on it is not necessary 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.729
 to focus all the differences on the face this 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.250
 new headlights new hood and this zil him 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 I feel like giving way as well as me 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.890
 I can not fail to note more elegant 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.440
 rear optics 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.390
 if you have a garage garage, what do you mean 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.690
 So that the focal point of the updated focus is 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.830
 open high but practically not 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.110
 stand for the external dimensions of the machine 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.259
 has smooth walls internally 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.570
 in the approach we not only dokatka but also and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.640
 sound amplifier is a distinctive 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.830
 feature maximum configuration 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
 titanium x 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.740
 the multimedia system sing unlike 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.960
 my classmates 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.149
 the focus already has two comfortable handles for 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.520
 trunk closure 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.350
 There is enough space for the foot 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.750
 which can be put generation 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.850
 seating and for the knees and especially for 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.280
 heads and this despite the fact that the height of the meter 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.950
 eighty four besides niche doors 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.600
 still want to note and taynichki here 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.780
 here and here 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.019
 from the elements of comfort I want to note 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.150
 comfortable armrest with cup holders 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.310
 two-level light and even knobs with 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.620
 lift lifts they are here too 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.079
 there is a rear window does not go down 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.370
 the end of the updated focus on the new steering wheel 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.130
 Front Panel 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.680
 center console but even maximum 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.950
 complete set of food x skinned 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.739
 steering wheel and coveralls in the salon abundance 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.570
 hard plastic updated focus 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.560
 received and new engines of the family 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.410
 ecoboost 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.570
 in this case we have under the hood 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.380
 gasoline engine volume 1 and 5 and 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.780
 power of attention 150 horsepower but 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.200
 what is even more interesting in his twisting 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.170
 moment 240 newton meters are developing already 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.940
 two thousand 600 rpm this is for 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.720
 the engine can be paired with 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.130
 six-speed robotic 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.710
 in a short transfer but in this case 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.020
 in on 6-speed mechanics and not be afraid 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.180
 and not worth it because here 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.760
 installed a special system that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.120
 automatically raises turns as 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.850
 only you let go of the clutch 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.030
 say that this is the best mechanic in 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.810
 class but it works gas is wrong with 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.900
 gears hard 150 horsepower 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.690
 much or little of the most powerful trick 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.270
 first generation was called st170 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.240
 and the numbers in this title meant exactly 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.250
 and the amount of horsepower here is 150 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.150
 horsepower but honestly then 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.570
 they are felt somewhere forces on 110 topics not 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.250
 less dynamics at the car at a height of up to 100 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.760
 kilometers an hour it accelerates in 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.680
 various 8 point nine seconds 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.380
 managed focus behind 100 felt 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.330
 rally genes let it be a stamp 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.580
 but the suspension 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.950
 combines great balance 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.510
 handling with comfort turns 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.690
 the car comes in confidently 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.390
 but I personally lacked a reverse effort 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.390
 on the steering wheel it feels empty
