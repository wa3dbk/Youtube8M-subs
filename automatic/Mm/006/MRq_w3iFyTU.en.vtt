00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello MIUIers, my name is Izadi and today I bring you the review of the external battery of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.069
 Xiaomi, the My Power Bank. 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.759
 The Xiaomi Mi Power Bank, as its name indicates, is Xiaomi's external battery. 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.080
 It has an amazing capacity of 10,400 mAh, higher than most external batteries, 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.640
 which are usually 5,000, 3,000 or even 2,000 mAh. Your body is made in one piece 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.789
 aluminum and has two ports: a micro USB to charge the same battery and 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.850
 a standard USB to be able to charge any USB device whether it's a mobile, tablet or 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.139
 anything else. 

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:41.729
 The anodized aluminum housing gives it an elegant look, with premium finish and a 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.289
 solidity that gives very good feeling in the hand. Something unusual in this type of devices 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.019
 They are usually made of cheap plastic. At the top you have the mentioned ports, 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.299
 LED lights that indicate the remaining battery and a button, that although it seems that it is of 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.829
 On and off, all it does is turn on the aforementioned LEDs. Battery 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.909
 detects when it is connected to a device and starts charging automatically and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.740
 it stops when it is already fully loaded. In the body we only find the logo of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.700
 Xiaomi and its old website now replaced by mi.com. To end with the physical tour, 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.210
 in the lower part we find information such as its capacity or its different specifications, 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.679
 Yes, totally in Chinese. 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.060
 Although its size or weight are not its star characteristics are not at all exaggerated. On 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.189
 all if we compare them with other batteries. This one for example is 5200 and as you can see 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.030
 My Power Bank is not anywhere near twice as big. 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.310
 Regarding the capacity, it behaves more or less as described in its page. Can 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.020
 load the Mi3 about 2 and a half times and the 3rd generation iPad up to 70%. Doing 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.749
 calculations gives us, taking into account the loss of the conversion, about 7000-8000 mAh real. 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:01.710
 Nothing bad. In addition, when loading to 2.1 A the wait is less than with the standard charger 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.569
 1A. 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.499
 In my point of view, its only shortcomings are not having a second USB port for 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:12.920
 can load two devices simultaneously and their availability. As almost everyone will know, 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.739
 Xiaomi only operates in very specific countries and unfortunately neither Spain nor Latin America 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.110
 are included. Therefore the only way to achieve it is through web pages that 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.280
 They import these products from China. This brings another problem and is that of fakes. 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.400
 Being a successful product, several companies try to take advantage of the pull and fill the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.680
 market for much lower copies. Under the button I like I'll leave a link where 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.459
 You will find the differences between the original model and a copy to know if the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.140
 your is the good one. (http://foro.miui.es/index.php?topic=7351.0). Anyway, I recommend you buy it 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.390
 from the page of our new collaborator technospain.es where you can buy mobile phones, 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.459
 accessories and much more without worrying about their originality or shipping and customs since 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.829
 They are shipped from Spain so your purchases will arrive a lot sooner and without unexpected costs. 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.269
 In short, the Xiaomi Mi Power Bank is undoubtedly one of the best batteries in the market. 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.140
 Its aluminum construction, its high capacity and its low price make this battery a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.750
 essential accessory for any trip, excursion or even for users who do not 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.459
 They manage to arrive without recharging at the end of the day. 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.720
 Well, so far today's video, if you liked it, do not forget to give the
