impressed there where as before when i
tried<00:02:37.260> out<00:02:37.410> paranoid<00:02:37.770> android<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:38.670> is

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
tried out paranoid android and this is

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.300 
tried out paranoid android and this is
like<00:02:38.970> about<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> month<00:02:39.960> ago<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.770> battery

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
like about a month ago the battery

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.040 
like about a month ago the battery
drained<00:02:41.610> really<00:02:41.880> really<00:02:42.090> quickly<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.450> while

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
drained really really quickly so while

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.630 
drained really really quickly so while
we're<00:02:43.260> looking<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.890> wrong<00:02:44.040> control<00:02:44.460> here

to<00:03:09.720> toggle<00:03:09.990> toggles<00:03:10.830> looks<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.100> lot<00:03:11.220> different

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
to toggle toggles looks a lot different

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.910

as<00:03:11.790> well<00:03:12.000> before<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.900> entire<00:03:13.290> section<00:03:13.620> here

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
as well before this entire section here

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.590 
as well before this entire section here
was<00:03:14.070> too<00:03:14.280> small<00:03:14.670> section<00:03:15.120> at<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.239> bottom<00:03:15.390> of

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
was too small section at the bottom of

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.520 
was too small section at the bottom of
the<00:03:15.690> screen<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.110> looks<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.320> they

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
the screen but it looks like they

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.160 
the screen but it looks like they
actually<00:03:17.090> expanded<00:03:18.090> upon<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.930> you

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
actually expanded upon it so you can you

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.110 
actually expanded upon it so you can you
know<00:03:19.260> have<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.500> bigger<00:03:20.190> view<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.700> things<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.090> you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
know have a bigger view of things so you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.550 
know have a bigger view of things so you
can<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.360> course<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:22.080> just<00:03:22.290> drag<00:03:22.530> and

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
can of course you know just drag and

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.860 
can of course you know just drag and
drop<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.220> rearrange<00:03:24.180> things<00:03:24.390> as<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.750> would
