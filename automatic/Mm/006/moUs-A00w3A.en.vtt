what we're able to do by coming here is

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.800 
what we're able to do by coming here is
get<00:01:08.430> everyone<00:01:08.729> together<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.119> we're<00:01:09.390> able<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
get everyone together so we're able to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.749 
get everyone together so we're able to
have<00:01:10.049> more<00:01:10.649> of<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.920> standard<00:01:11.340> operating

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
have more of a standard operating

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.429 
have more of a standard operating
procedure<00:01:12.210> by<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:12.810> being<00:01:13.020> able<00:01:13.079> to<00:01:13.200> come<00:01:13.409> out

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
procedure by then being able to come out

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
procedure by then being able to come out
here<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:13.920> work<00:01:14.189> hands-on<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.969> the<00:01:15.060> house

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
here and work hands-on with the house

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.480 
here and work hands-on with the house
and<00:01:15.539> actually<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.350> how<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.679> goes<00:01:16.859> together<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and actually see how it goes together in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.069 
and actually see how it goes together in
the<00:01:17.579> ease<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.969> which<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.299> does<00:01:18.509> go<00:01:18.719> together

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
the ease in which it does go together

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.109 
the ease in which it does go together
they<00:01:19.679> can<00:01:19.859> give<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.070> bid<00:01:20.399> with<00:01:20.520> confidence<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
they can give a bid with confidence and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.590 
they can give a bid with confidence and
not<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.689> raise<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.469> price<00:01:22.679> up

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
not have to raise the price up

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.060 
not have to raise the price up
artificially<00:01:24.600> inflate<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.170> cover<00:01:25.500> an

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
artificially inflate it to cover an

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.370 
artificially inflate it to cover an
unknown<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.850> don't<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:27.990> were<00:01:28.079> really

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
unknown I don't think there were really

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.800 
unknown I don't think there were really
any<00:01:28.619> special<00:01:29.340> skills<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.850> building<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.359> Deltek

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
any special skills to building a Deltek

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.319 
any special skills to building a Deltek
home<00:01:31.109> I<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.249> key<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.880> need<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.119> get

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
home I think the key is you need to get

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.910 
home I think the key is you need to get
your<00:01:33.509> measurements<00:01:33.990> right<00:01:34.140> coming<00:01:34.590> off<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
your measurements right coming off the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.800 
your measurements right coming off the
foundation<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.759> need<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.969> be<00:01:36.060> plumb<00:01:36.420> level

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
foundation you need to be plumb level

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.469 
foundation you need to be plumb level
and<00:01:36.899> square<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:38.789> after<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.359> goes

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and square and then after that it goes

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.630 
and square and then after that it goes
together<00:01:39.659> pretty<00:01:39.840> pretty<00:01:40.439> easily<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
together pretty pretty easily it's a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.090 
together pretty pretty easily it's a
step<00:01:41.880> by<00:01:41.909> step<00:01:42.060> process<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.990> far<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.380> how<00:01:44.039> to

install the walls as far as the clips

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.090 
install the walls as far as the clips

we had all the walls up and that's the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
building the one thing that they do walk

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.780 
building the one thing that they do walk
away<00:03:05.810> with<00:03:06.079> is<00:03:06.379> they<00:03:06.860> walk<00:03:07.069> away<00:03:07.250> with<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
away with is they walk away with the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.759 
away with is they walk away with the
fact<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.150> they<00:03:08.390> know<00:03:08.629> that<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.290> was<00:03:09.500> a<00:03:09.530> lot

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
fact that they know that this was a lot

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.289 
fact that they know that this was a lot
simpler<00:03:10.099> to<00:03:10.220> put<00:03:10.430> together<00:03:10.549> than<00:03:10.970> what<00:03:11.150> they

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
simpler to put together than what they

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.509 
simpler to put together than what they
had<00:03:11.480> looked<00:03:11.660> at<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.200> plans<00:03:12.500> they<00:03:13.250> walk

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
had looked at on the plans they walk

away knowing that they've got technical
support<00:03:15.950> 24/7<00:03:16.790> they<00:03:17.660> know<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.500> they're<00:03:19.130> not

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
support 24/7 they know that they're not

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.449 
support 24/7 they know that they're not

buying a box of toothpicks trying to put
it<00:03:22.549> together<00:03:22.670> they're<00:03:23.090> buying<00:03:23.389> a<00:03:23.480> solid

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
it together they're buying a solid

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.949 
it together they're buying a solid
engineered<00:03:24.859> product<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:26.150> they<00:03:26.389> know<00:03:26.599> fits

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
engineered product that they know fits

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.080 
engineered product that they know fits
together<00:03:27.139> they<00:03:28.040> know<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.430> constructed

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
together they know is constructed

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.750 
together they know is constructed
properly<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:29.840> they<00:03:30.230> know<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:30.650> over<00:03:30.859> built<00:03:31.489> I

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
properly and they know it's over built I

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.789 
properly and they know it's over built I
think<00:03:32.180> they've<00:03:32.599> done<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.840> very<00:03:32.900> good<00:03:33.170> job<00:03:33.349> and

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
think they've done a very good job and

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.430 
think they've done a very good job and
it's<00:03:33.950> really<00:03:34.220> good<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:35.690> know<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:35.840> think<00:03:36.019> it's<00:03:36.380> a

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
it's really good you know I think it's a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.140 
it's really good you know I think it's a
much<00:03:36.590> better<00:03:36.769> idea<00:03:36.919> to<00:03:37.250> build<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.639> panels<00:03:38.000> in

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
much better idea to build the panels in

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.520 
much better idea to build the panels in
the<00:03:38.239> factory<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.780> then<00:03:38.930> ship<00:03:39.139> them<00:03:39.260> out<00:03:39.410> and

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
the factory and then ship them out and

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.500 
the factory and then ship them out and
put<00:03:39.680> them<00:03:39.709> together<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.340> there's<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.269> lot<00:03:41.389> of

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
put them together so there's a lot of
