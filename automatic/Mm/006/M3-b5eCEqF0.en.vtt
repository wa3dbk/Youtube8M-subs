00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
on base taking the one end paper and the

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:33.219 
on base taking the one end paper and the
next

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.709 

again<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.439> little<00:01:34.649> off-center<00:01:35.359> make<00:01:36.359> sure<00:01:36.509> all

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
again a little off-center make sure all

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.929 
again a little off-center make sure all
those<00:01:36.929> ends<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:39.590> what<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.859> to<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.429> I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
those ends are in what I like to do is I

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.620 
those ends are in what I like to do is I
roll<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.810> ends<00:01:43.259> once<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.130> twice<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.880> then

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
roll on the ends once to twice and then

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.870 
roll on the ends once to twice and then
I'll<00:01:45.869> start<00:01:46.109> moving<00:01:46.789> down<00:01:49.219> so<00:01:50.219> I<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.700> that

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
I'll start moving down so I can get that

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.380 
I'll start moving down so I can get that
full<00:01:51.209> range<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:55.189> can<00:01:56.189> take<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.609> one<00:01:56.819> off<00:01:57.030> again

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
full range I can take this one off again

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.600 
full range I can take this one off again
and<00:01:58.490> refasten<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.209> have<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:04.610> beach

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and refasten so here we have a beach

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.059 
and refasten so here we have a beach
wave<00:02:06.060> technique<00:02:09.110> that's<00:02:10.110> again<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.679> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
wave technique that's again going to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.240 
wave technique that's again going to
create<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.760> dropped<00:02:12.329> curl<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.799> she's<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.190> to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
create a dropped curl so she's going to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.030 
create a dropped curl so she's going to
have<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.730> little<00:02:15.540> bit<00:02:15.690> flatter<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.530> top<00:02:16.739> and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
have a little bit flatter on the top and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.240 
have a little bit flatter on the top and
then<00:02:17.810> more<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.049> curl<00:02:19.379> on<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.709> round

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
then more of that curl on the round

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.330 
then more of that curl on the round
overhead<00:02:23.810> if<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.109> have<00:02:25.230> any<00:02:25.470> kind<00:02:25.769> of<00:02:25.829> ends

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
overhead if you have any kind of ends

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.000 
overhead if you have any kind of ends
that<00:02:26.879> are<00:02:26.910> sticking<00:02:27.030> out<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.140> what<00:02:28.920> you

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
that are sticking out like this what you

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.099 
that are sticking out like this what you
can<00:02:29.129> do<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.519> called<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:30.030> band-aid<00:02:30.510> where<00:02:30.989> you

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
can do is called a band-aid where you

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:40.729 
can do is called a band-aid where you
take<00:02:31.349> an<00:02:31.560> end<00:02:31.769> paper<00:02:33.530> wrap<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:39.739> spray

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
take an end paper wrap that in spray

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.449 
take an end paper wrap that in spray
down<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> little<00:02:41.400> water<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:43.739> use<00:02:44.280> your

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
down with a little water and use your

00:02:44.459 --> 00:03:07.520 
down with a little water and use your
comb<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.540> rub<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.900> in
