it just depends on where they are when

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.520 
it just depends on where they are when
they<00:01:16.640> need<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.850> put<00:01:17.210> down<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.780> what<00:01:18.290> they're

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
they need to put down and what they're

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
going to use and these habitats are very

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.010 
going to use and these habitats are very
important<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.190> them<00:01:22.340> because<00:01:22.550> it<00:01:23.090> helps<00:01:23.810> them

to continue their journey it gives them

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.240 
to continue their journey it gives them
a<00:01:26.780> place<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.320> rest
