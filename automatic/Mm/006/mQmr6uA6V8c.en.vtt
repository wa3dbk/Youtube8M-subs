00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
time I know that there's a lot of you

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.050 
time I know that there's a lot of you
who<00:03:48.300> are<00:03:48.390> very<00:03:48.980> iffy<00:03:49.980> about<00:03:50.100> buying<00:03:50.580> Michelle

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060

Phan's<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.860> beauty<00:03:52.860> product<00:03:53.220> line<00:03:53.400> and

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
Phan's of beauty product line and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.620 
Phan's of beauty product line and
I<00:03:55.510> guess<00:03:56.830> there's<00:03:57.830> enough<00:03:58.280> reason<00:03:58.670> behind<00:03:59.360> it

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
I guess there's enough reason behind it

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.510 
I guess there's enough reason behind it
that<00:03:59.690> you<00:04:00.230> would<00:04:00.410> be<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.590> fee<00:04:00.860> because<00:04:01.130> it's

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
that you would be a fee because it's

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.090 
that you would be a fee because it's
from<00:04:02.360> Thailand<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.230> it<00:04:03.530> takes<00:04:03.800> a<00:04:03.920> while<00:04:04.040> for

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
from Thailand and it takes a while for

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.760 
from Thailand and it takes a while for
to<00:04:04.460> get<00:04:04.610> here<00:04:07.120> though<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.150> think<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.750> would<00:04:09.560> be

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
to get here though I think it would be

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.270 
to get here though I think it would be
really<00:04:10.040> good<00:04:10.340> like<00:04:11.000> good<00:04:11.270> free<00:04:11.510> if<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.810> try<00:04:12.080> it

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
really good like good free if you try it

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.320 
really good like good free if you try it
especially<00:04:13.280> if<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.520> just<00:04:13.730> have<00:04:13.880> like<00:04:14.030> dry

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
especially if you just have like dry

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.500 
especially if you just have like dry
skin<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:16.850> have<00:04:17.030> really<00:04:17.390> good

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
skin and you have really good

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.250 
skin and you have really good
moisturizer<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.350> back<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:18.799> up

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.580 

and<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:23.220> guess<00:04:23.730> so<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.570> don't<00:04:25.200> really<00:04:25.320> want<00:04:25.560> to

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
and I guess so I don't really want to

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.440 
and I guess so I don't really want to
sway<00:04:25.830> ate<00:04:26.040> your<00:04:26.220> opinions<00:04:26.820> or

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
sway ate your opinions or

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.530 
sway ate your opinions or
thing<00:04:27.630> but<00:04:28.490> if<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.610> can't<00:04:30.000> find<00:04:30.210> anything

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
thing but if you can't find anything

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.350 
thing but if you can't find anything
