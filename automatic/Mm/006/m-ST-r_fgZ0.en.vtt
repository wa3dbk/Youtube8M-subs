now<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> wired<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
now I wired it up here so that I have a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.060 
now I wired it up here so that I have a
thumb<00:00:44.190> switch<00:00:44.719> then<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.960> use<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.590> my<00:00:46.739> hand

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
thumb switch then I can use with my hand

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.000 
thumb switch then I can use with my hand
and<00:00:47.629> then<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.989> talk<00:00:49.230> transmitted<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and then I can talk transmitted on the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
and then I can talk transmitted on the
air<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.940> whatever<00:00:51.149> radio<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.930> selected

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
air with whatever radio I have selected

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.279 
air with whatever radio I have selected
now<00:00:53.250> everything<00:00:53.670> runs<00:00:53.940> through<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.360> eq+<00:00:54.930> by

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
now everything runs through this eq+ by

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.520 
now everything runs through this eq+ by
w2i<00:00:55.890> hy<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:57.270> compresses<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.050> audio<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
w2i hy which compresses the audio and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.400 
w2i hy which compresses the audio and
does<00:00:58.680> some<00:00:58.920> EQ<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.050> from<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.320> can

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
does some EQ on it and from here I can

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.670 
does some EQ on it and from here I can
select<00:01:01.760> one<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> two<00:01:03.149> HF<00:01:03.719> radios<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.409> have

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
wired and the PTT switch works for

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.310 
wired and the PTT switch works for
either<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:08.159> now<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> also<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.600> foot<00:01:10.170> switch

matter which one I key it provides the
ground<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:08.990> line

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
ground on this line

grounds out this line to my light and

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.510 
grounds out this line to my light and
from<00:04:15.860> there<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.310> have<00:04:17.209> an<00:04:17.330> output<00:04:17.510> on<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.200> light

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
from there I have an output on the light

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.690 
from there I have an output on the light
that<00:04:19.520> goes<00:04:19.700> into<00:04:19.970> my<00:04:20.150> EQ<00:04:20.570> plus<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.700> it

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
that goes into my EQ plus and it

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.450 
that goes into my EQ plus and it
provides<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.330> ground<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.290> EQ<00:04:24.770> plus<00:04:25.010> and

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
provides the ground to the EQ plus and

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.520 
provides the ground to the EQ plus and
that's<00:04:25.580> what<00:04:25.730> that<00:04:25.910> wants<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.330> see<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:26.930> from

that's what that wants to see and from

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.440 
that's what that wants to see and from
there<00:04:27.770> that'll<00:04:28.130> switch<00:04:28.400> whatever<00:04:29.000> through

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
there that'll switch whatever through

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.750 
there that'll switch whatever through
this<00:04:29.600> switch<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:30.140> can<00:04:30.169> select<00:04:30.560> either<00:04:30.800> rig<00:04:31.550> one

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.740 
lights it up was originally wired for
120<00:05:50.900> volt<00:05:51.110> AC<00:05:51.350> but<00:05:52.070> I<00:05:52.130> wanted<00:05:52.430> to<00:05:52.550> use<00:05:53.120> 12<00:05:53.450> volts

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
120 volt AC but I wanted to use 12 volts

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.530 
120 volt AC but I wanted to use 12 volts
in<00:05:53.840> my<00:05:53.960> project<00:05:54.490> now<00:05:55.490> the<00:05:55.640> other<00:05:55.910> half<00:05:56.000> the

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
in my project now the other half the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.120 
in my project now the other half the
lower<00:05:56.690> half<00:05:56.900> this<00:05:57.140> relay<00:05:57.470> will<00:05:57.650> also<00:05:57.980> engage

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
lower half this relay will also engage

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.840 
lower half this relay will also engage
so<00:05:58.640> pin<00:05:58.850> 9<00:05:59.060> will<00:05:59.300> come<00:05:59.450> up<00:05:59.540> to<00:05:59.690> 10<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:00.850> that

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
so pin 9 will come up to 10 and that

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.090 
so pin 9 will come up to 10 and that
provides<00:06:02.330> I<00:06:02.600> have<00:06:02.720> a<00:06:02.750> ground<00:06:03.080> hooked<00:06:03.500> up<00:06:03.710> there

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
provides I have a ground hooked up there

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.490 
provides I have a ground hooked up there
so<00:06:05.030> that<00:06:05.060> I'll<00:06:05.270> provide<00:06:05.480> the<00:06:05.990> grounding

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
so that I'll provide the grounding

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.100 
so that I'll provide the grounding
circuit<00:06:06.920> which<00:06:07.460> is<00:06:07.490> completely<00:06:08.090> an<00:06:08.390> isolated

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.160 
practice to put a diode across the coil
of<00:06:25.340> the<00:06:25.460> relay<00:06:25.760> because<00:06:26.330> when<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.780> relay

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
of the relay because when the relay

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.350 
of the relay because when the relay
disengages<00:06:27.980> it<00:06:28.100> can<00:06:28.220> cause<00:06:28.430> a<00:06:28.460> spike<00:06:28.880> on<00:06:29.150> your

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.970 
12 volt line which can harm equipment at
times<00:06:33.490> so<00:06:34.490> that's<00:06:34.820> the<00:06:34.970> basic<00:06:35.500> wiring<00:06:36.500> diagram

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
times so that's the basic wiring diagram

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.670 
times so that's the basic wiring diagram
and<00:06:37.340> how<00:06:37.460> I<00:06:37.490> wired<00:06:37.820> the<00:06:37.940> light<00:06:38.240> into<00:06:38.690> my<00:06:38.870> Shack

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680
