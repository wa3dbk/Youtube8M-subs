00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.370 
previously and then you have them all
anyways<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.880> know<00:03:15.940> fifty<00:03:16.270> five<00:03:16.450> levels<00:03:17.140> later

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
anyways you know fifty five levels later

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.980 
anyways you know fifty five levels later
so<00:03:17.740> I<00:03:18.190> think<00:03:18.580> that's<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:19.030> really<00:03:19.060> cool<00:03:19.450> token

so I think that's a really cool token
throw<00:03:20.260> in<00:03:20.410> there<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:21.580> finally<00:03:22.060> there's<00:03:22.270> going

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
throw in there and finally there's going

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.750 
throw in there and finally there's going
to<00:03:22.660> be<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.810> master<00:03:23.230> prestige<00:03:23.680> emblem<00:03:24.250> in<00:03:24.400> black
