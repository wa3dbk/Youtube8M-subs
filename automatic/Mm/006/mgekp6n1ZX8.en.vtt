the odyssey to ball is fantastic for

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
the odyssey to ball is fantastic for
lining<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.450> two<00:01:22.080> balls<00:01:22.320> quite<00:01:22.619> easy<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> line

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
lining up two balls quite easy to line

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
lining up two balls quite easy to line
up<00:01:23.310> put<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> third<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.630> very

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
up put a third there and you can very

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.440 
up put a third there and you can very
easily<00:01:25.080> see<00:01:25.710> whether<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> club<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.700> online<00:01:26.939> or

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
easily see whether the club is online or

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.810 
easily see whether the club is online or
not<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:29.130> line<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> little<00:01:29.640> bit

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
not and if you go off line a little bit

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.609 
not and if you go off line a little bit
you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> see<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.780> clearly<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.439> think

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you can see it really clearly I think

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.219 
you can see it really clearly I think
that's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> fantastic<00:01:32.520> aid<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.689> alignment<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
that's a fantastic aid for alignment and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.499 
that's a fantastic aid for alignment and
again<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> line<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
again if you get the line right and you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
again if you get the line right and you
get<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> hands<00:01:36.900> leading<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.590> will<00:01:37.799> make<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
get the hands leading you will make the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.060 
get the hands leading you will make the
short<00:01:38.579> ones<00:01:38.900> now<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.380> very<00:01:40.829> unusual

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
short ones now this is a very unusual

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
short ones now this is a very unusual
looking<00:01:41.520> putter<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.750> further<00:01:43.020> feature

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
looking putter and one further feature

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.469 
looking putter and one further feature
is<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.100> Odyssey<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.820> hollowed<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
is that Odyssey have hollowed out the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.600 
is that Odyssey have hollowed out the
inside<00:01:45.840> almost<00:01:46.290> completely<00:01:46.799> they've<00:01:47.430> also

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
inside almost completely they've also

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
inside almost completely they've also
given<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.240> really<00:01:48.659> soft<00:01:48.990> insert<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
given it a really soft insert and the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
given it a really soft insert and the
upshot<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> ball<00:01:51.689> comes

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
upshot of that is that the ball comes

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.410 
upshot of that is that the ball comes
off<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.799> very<00:01:53.040> softly<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.759> perfect

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
off actually very softly a perfect

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380 
off actually very softly a perfect
putter<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.320> quick<00:01:55.649> greens<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:56.969> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
putter I think on quick greens or if you

putter I think on quick greens or if you
like<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> fairly<00:01:58.170> accelerating

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
like to have a fairly accelerating

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.230 
like to have a fairly accelerating
stroke<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.579> don't<00:01:59.790> want<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> ball

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
stroke and you don't want the ball

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.969 
stroke and you don't want the ball
shooting<00:02:00.719> off<00:02:00.840> too<00:02:01.110> quickly<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.710> too<00:02:01.860> much

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
shooting off too quickly with too much

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:11.199 
shooting off too quickly with too much
space

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209
