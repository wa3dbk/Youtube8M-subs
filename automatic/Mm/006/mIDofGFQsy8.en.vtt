00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.890
 here we are going to accept here what we have 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.680
 what to do is to arrange the photo so that 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.230
 remain the same with the white box that 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.590
 just done is what comes 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.320
 asking youtube if it is bigger 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.600
 good more and the white box comes out 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.640
 worry because you walk from here in photo 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.580

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.080

 everything we want but only has the 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.830
 that's why we put it somewhere else and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.509

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.180
