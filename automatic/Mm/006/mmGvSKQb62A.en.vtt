00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
thing over here this is a picture of the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.610 
thing over here this is a picture of the
larger<00:00:41.590> one<00:00:41.830> and<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:43.239> not<00:00:43.449> got<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:44.080> use<00:00:44.350> the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
larger one and have not got to use the

larger one and have not got to use the
larger<00:00:45.100> one<00:00:45.280> but<00:00:45.520> I<00:00:45.850> assume<00:00:46.360> it's<00:00:46.510> going<00:00:46.630> to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
larger one but I assume it's going to

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.979 
larger one but I assume it's going to
come<00:00:46.840> in<00:00:46.960> in<00:00:46.989> certain<00:00:47.410> situations<00:00:48.570> where<00:00:49.570> you

is<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:12.070> actually<00:02:12.220> insert<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.360> just<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:13.900> a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
is you actually insert this just like a

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.340 
is you actually insert this just like a
glue<00:02:14.260> tab<00:02:14.610> into<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> mini<00:02:15.940> lifter<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.600> what

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
glue tab into the mini lifter and what

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.170 
glue tab into the mini lifter and what
it<00:02:17.470> does<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:18.160> gives<00:02:18.430> you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
it does it gives you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780 
it does it gives you
a<00:02:19.209> little<00:02:19.810> gap<00:02:20.109> right<00:02:20.140> here<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:21.549> you<00:02:21.640> can

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
a little gap right here that you can

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.110 
a little gap right here that you can
slide<00:02:22.239> up<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.689> the<00:02:22.719> panel<00:02:23.370> close<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.879> mini

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
slide up to the panel close the mini

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.440 
slide up to the panel close the mini
lifter<00:02:28.260> into<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.769> panel<00:02:30.189> so<00:02:30.790> literally<00:02:31.150> it's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
lifter into the panel so literally it's

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.679 
lifter into the panel so literally it's
the<00:02:31.629> same<00:02:32.109> principle<00:02:33.040> as<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.310> last<00:02:34.120> few<00:02:34.450> tools

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
the same principle as the last few tools

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.360 
the same principle as the last few tools
but<00:02:35.469> I'm<00:02:35.560> going<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.739> tell<00:02:35.859> you<00:02:35.980> here<00:02:36.159> I've<00:02:36.250> been

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
but I'm going to tell you here I've been

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.819 
but I'm going to tell you here I've been
playing<00:02:36.700> with<00:02:36.819> this<00:02:37.000> thing<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.540> has<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:38.290> lot

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
playing with this thing this has a lot

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.970 
playing with this thing this has a lot
more<00:02:38.889> accuracy<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.030> power<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:41.620> can<00:02:41.739> get<00:02:41.889> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
more accuracy and power you can get the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.750 
more accuracy and power you can get the
job<00:02:42.219> done<00:02:42.250> either<00:02:42.879> way<00:02:43.299> but<00:02:44.139> for<00:02:45.099> convenience

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
job done either way but for convenience

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.030 
job done either way but for convenience
of<00:02:45.969> use<00:02:46.269> this<00:02:46.569> will<00:02:46.750> probably<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.200> my<00:02:47.319> go-to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
of use this will probably be my go-to

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.720 
of use this will probably be my go-to
edge<00:02:48.670> tool<00:02:49.510> at<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.409> point<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.280> does<00:02:51.489> have

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
edge tool at this point and it does have

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.780 
edge tool at this point and it does have
your<00:02:52.060> convenient<00:02:53.159> hole<00:02:54.159> that's<00:02:54.400> milled<00:02:54.639> out

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
your convenient hole that's milled out

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.000 
your convenient hole that's milled out
right<00:02:55.060> here<00:02:55.359> and<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:56.049> is<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.439> you<00:02:56.470> can<00:02:56.799> get<00:02:56.980> a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
right here and that is so you can get a

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.750 
right here and that is so you can get a
direct<00:02:57.280> visual<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.950> damage<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.639> you're

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
direct visual to the damage that you're

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.729 
direct visual to the damage that you're
working<00:03:00.939> on<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.329> edge<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.870> door<00:03:02.109> but

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
working on the edge of the door but

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.920 
working on the edge of the door but
anyhow<00:03:03.099> let's<00:03:03.549> um<00:03:03.790> let's<00:03:04.030> just<00:03:04.389> go<00:03:04.480> ahead<00:03:04.599> and

into the mini lifter let me get you good

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.099 
into the mini lifter let me get you good
good<00:03:20.889> visual<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.430> slide<00:03:22.419> it<00:03:22.689> into<00:03:22.840> place

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
good visual that slide it into place

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.280 
good visual that slide it into place
okay<00:03:23.859> and<00:03:24.220> I'm<00:03:25.060> actually<00:03:25.269> able<00:03:25.659> to<00:03:25.930> believe<00:03:26.169> it

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
okay and I'm actually able to believe it

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.080 
okay and I'm actually able to believe it
or<00:03:26.379> not<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.560> mean<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:27.069> actually<00:03:27.549> holds<00:03:27.940> in

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
or not I mean this actually holds in

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.360 
or not I mean this actually holds in
quite<00:03:28.540> well<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.739> know<00:03:30.069> you<00:03:30.129> would<00:03:30.340> think

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
quite well so you know you would think

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.339 
quite well so you know you would think
that<00:03:30.609> it<00:03:30.760> would<00:03:30.819> be<00:03:30.879> loose<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.659> and<00:03:31.930> easily

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
that it would be loose and and easily

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.349 
that it would be loose and and easily
fall<00:03:32.590> off<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:33.010> would<00:03:33.340> eventually<00:03:33.669> if<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.120> shook

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
fall off it would eventually if I shook

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.210 
fall off it would eventually if I shook
it<00:03:34.389> up<00:03:34.599> in<00:03:34.750> debt<00:03:34.930> there<00:03:35.169> see<00:03:35.500> now<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.769> fell<00:03:35.949> off

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
it up in debt there see now it fell off

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.229 
it up in debt there see now it fell off
but<00:03:37.209> in<00:03:37.840> normal<00:03:38.819> circumstances<00:03:39.819> just<00:03:40.120> to

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
but in normal circumstances just to

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.420 
but in normal circumstances just to
balance<00:03:40.479> that<00:03:40.870> there's<00:03:41.109> really<00:03:41.590> not<00:03:42.010> an<00:03:42.220> issue

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
balance that there's really not an issue

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.899 
balance that there's really not an issue
that<00:03:43.359> was<00:03:43.510> one<00:03:43.689> of<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.870> big<00:03:44.139> things<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.909> look

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
that was one of the big things that look

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.219 
that was one of the big things that look
at<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.090> down<00:03:46.239> here<00:03:46.419> that<00:03:46.540> was<00:03:46.659> one<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.049> big

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:47.229 
at you down here that was one of the big

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.469 
at you down here that was one of the big
things<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:47.889> actually<00:03:48.159> thought<00:03:48.699> whenever

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
things that I actually thought whenever

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.080 
things that I actually thought whenever
I<00:03:49.540> first<00:03:49.780> received<00:03:50.019> this<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.949> that<00:03:51.250> balancing

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
I first received this is that balancing

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.899 
I first received this is that balancing
this<00:03:52.419> in<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.259> mini<00:03:53.530> lifter<00:03:54.009> was<00:03:54.549> gonna<00:03:54.669> give

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
this in the mini lifter was gonna give

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.749 
this in the mini lifter was gonna give
me<00:03:55.090> problems<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:56.709> as<00:03:56.859> you<00:03:56.949> can<00:03:57.040> see<00:03:57.099> it<00:03:57.400> can

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:57.759 
me problems but as you can see it can

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.770 
me problems but as you can see it can
fall<00:03:58.209> out<00:03:58.239> but<00:03:59.079> in<00:03:59.500> any<00:04:00.220> regard<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.819> mean<00:04:01.030> it's

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
you you just tighten the mini lifter

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.750 
you you just tighten the mini lifter
like<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.229> would<00:04:26.409> on<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.560> glue<00:04:26.860> tab<00:04:27.159> to<00:04:27.520> your

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
like you would on a glue tab to your

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.200 
like you would on a glue tab to your
desired<00:04:29.219> strength

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
desired strength

you know I was really surprised that the
mini<00:04:34.430> lifter<00:04:34.850> would<00:04:35.060> would<00:04:35.510> do<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:35.930> well<00:04:36.200> on

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
mini lifter would would do so well on

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.210 
mini lifter would would do so well on
this<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.920> mean<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.670> can<00:04:37.880> rip<00:04:38.420> a<00:04:38.720> very<00:04:39.680> big<00:04:39.950> high

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
this I mean you can rip a very big high

what<00:04:56.060> we're<00:04:56.210> gonna<00:04:56.300> be<00:04:56.450> testing<00:04:56.690> here<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.200> how

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
what we're gonna be testing here is how

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.810 
what we're gonna be testing here is how
well<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.710> pushes<00:04:58.040> through<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.370> double<00:04:58.670> layer

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
well it pushes through the double layer

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.850 
well it pushes through the double layer
which<00:04:59.570> is<00:04:59.690> back<00:04:59.900> here<00:05:00.170> and<00:05:00.290> then<00:05:00.440> if<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.650> see

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
which is back here and then if you see

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.070 
which is back here and then if you see
the<00:05:01.010> seam<00:05:01.310> line<00:05:01.550> right<00:05:01.850> here<00:05:02.060> that's<00:05:02.600> a<00:05:02.720> triple

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
the seam line right here that's a triple

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.050 
the seam line right here that's a triple
layer<00:05:03.380> because<00:05:03.800> you've<00:05:03.980> got<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.850> back

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
layer because you've got the the back

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.030 
layer because you've got the the back
layer<00:05:05.330> here<00:05:05.600> in<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.750> middle<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.650> layer<00:05:06.890> on

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
layer here in the middle the layer on

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.080 
layer here in the middle the layer on
the<00:05:07.160> top<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.720> then<00:05:08.720> also<00:05:09.140> the<00:05:10.070> fold<00:05:10.400> over<00:05:10.850> from

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
the top and then also the fold over from

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.600 
the top and then also the fold over from
the<00:05:11.210> door<00:05:11.420> skin<00:05:11.800> so<00:05:12.800> we'll<00:05:12.950> be<00:05:13.010> testing<00:05:13.370> both

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
the door skin so we'll be testing both

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.520 
the door skin so we'll be testing both
of<00:05:13.850> them<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.240> we'll<00:05:14.780> see<00:05:14.930> how<00:05:15.050> well<00:05:15.290> that<00:05:15.320> we

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
of them and we'll see how well that we

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.010 
of them and we'll see how well that we
can<00:05:15.680> push<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:15.890> high<00:05:16.160> spot<00:05:16.490> into<00:05:16.790> the<00:05:17.330> other<00:05:17.600> side

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
can push a high spot into the other side

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.680 
can push a high spot into the other side
of<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:18.620> panel<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:19.550> here's<00:05:19.760> a<00:05:19.850> quick<00:05:20.210> look<00:05:20.630> at

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
of the panel and here's a quick look at

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.160 
of the panel and here's a quick look at
the<00:05:21.080> hookup<00:05:21.560> here<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:22.790> see<00:05:22.970> if<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.180> can<00:05:23.390> slide

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
the hookup here and see if I can slide

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.830 
the hookup here and see if I can slide
it<00:05:24.380> right<00:05:24.560> on<00:05:24.740> in<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:26.030> you<00:05:26.120> can<00:05:26.240> kind<00:05:26.420> of<00:05:26.510> see

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
it right on in and you can kind of see

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.050 
it right on in and you can kind of see
now<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.620> I've<00:05:27.710> actually<00:05:27.920> got<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.640> mini<00:05:28.820> lift

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
now that I've actually got the mini lift

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.700 
now that I've actually got the mini lift
her<00:05:29.180> feet<00:05:29.210> right<00:05:29.660> here<00:05:29.720> on<00:05:30.230> the<00:05:30.320> front<00:05:30.560> of<00:05:30.620> the

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
her feet right here on the front of the

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.330 
her feet right here on the front of the
panel<00:05:30.950> I've<00:05:31.850> got<00:05:32.120> my<00:05:32.740> tip<00:05:33.740> right<00:05:33.980> here<00:05:34.010> on<00:05:34.250> the

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
panel I've got my tip right here on the

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.210 
panel I've got my tip right here on the
back<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:34.880> this<00:05:35.360> hole<00:05:35.900> here<00:05:36.230> is<00:05:36.770> so<00:05:36.980> you<00:05:37.040> can

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
back and this hole here is so you can

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.070 
back and this hole here is so you can
actually<00:05:37.400> see<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.450> dent<00:05:38.720> that<00:05:38.840> you're

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
it from the top I haven't really tried

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.050 
it from the top I haven't really tried
to<00:05:45.590> look<00:05:45.800> through<00:05:46.100> it<00:05:46.190> from<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.400> bottom<00:05:46.880> but

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
to look through it from the bottom but

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.510 
to look through it from the bottom but
you<00:05:47.090> can<00:05:47.180> kind<00:05:47.900> of<00:05:48.080> see<00:05:49.070> through<00:05:49.250> there<00:05:49.490> a

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
you can kind of see through there a

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.940 
you can kind of see through there a
little<00:05:49.970> bit<00:05:50.210> from<00:05:50.420> the<00:05:50.510> top<00:05:50.540> as<00:05:50.990> well<00:05:51.200> but<00:05:51.770> this

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
little bit from the top as well but this

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.940 
little bit from the top as well but this
is<00:05:52.010> definitely<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:53.060> best<00:05:53.270> vantage<00:05:54.020> point<00:05:54.380> Wow
