00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:09.110
 Battlefield 3 is becoming a fan 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:12.059
 art battlefield 3 far away from a fan 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.389
 and that is medal of honor so it is 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.680
 basically the same thing for battlefield 3 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.820
 only it is present in one 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.290
 different design or one 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.810
 other wallpaper is provided 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.640
 background image and such and that is one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.260
 Oscar of the types of this design 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.570
 is here and that is it 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.740
 one of china's studios i know 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.450
 not if it is a single person 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.629
 but I think that's really very 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.070
 cool and clearer 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.170
 especially for the people the men of honor 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.280
 did not do that because mettler of that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.420
 many people do not know that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.059
 still have the game 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.800
 it has a game browser, so to speak 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.510
 battlelog in the middle of it as you have to 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.730
 Do not start play over medlock that is 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.019
 the horny but I once looked at it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 really does not find the same server 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.800
 if you look over battlelog or hall 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.690
 mimts out of the game server browser 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.399
 so to speak, the server last in that 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.710
 available there are always different 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.640
 server resp 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.620
 server that you can see 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.789
 john or it can is 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.589
 probably also on the region though 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.120
 that does not matter but I would times 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.770
 say that really looks very good 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.570
 and if we are honest 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.710
 hand open penis that looks yet 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.470
 reality or 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.140
 So I think that's the belief 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.150
 future what actually a hit 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 should strike if the real ones 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 want to make a good way 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.510
 Of course, this is the design or 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.950
 the optical is not always what we are 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.360
 really bothered in battlefield 3 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.490
 or medal of honor 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.170
 warfighter but that there are so many bugs 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.060
 So I could tell you here 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.770
 it has always been that bug that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 I get any of them here 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.680
 I do not know why that was probably 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.900
 perhaps at the servers perhaps on the bed lures 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700
 But for example, it's been me since 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.750
 believe for several months so that one 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.880
 for example if you are on the server 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.910
 joint down here opens a window 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.230
 This window was here on the lower left 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.210
 and I really liked that a lot 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.050
 below this is really fair 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.460
 a stain 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.440
 So if you are a server for example 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.180
 3 and then someone wants to pull down 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.220
 you can not usually go down okay well 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.260
 but it is probably only now 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.940
 What I mean if somebody does that too 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.280
 I played one last time 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.140
 I kind of problem with that here 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.899
 both stood here 0 the 0 friends online 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.180
 or 0 friends are offline and as me 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.910
 that has clicked offline , the hike 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.330
 people have been displayed 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.980
 often online and somehow glad 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.300
 around and above here was someone on the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.650
 server down here was someone open 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.180
 server but not really in one 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.740
 good row or organized 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.360
 and since the patch is really a lot 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.150
 got better but I really think so 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.580
 that this really is the future 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.620
 Of course, that does not have to be that way 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.000
 I would definitely be happy with it 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.890
 what his design really 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.110
 would work so let me 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.360
 your opinion and we will come 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.940
 Now on the topic of what really made me 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.660
 especially for the people who enjoyed 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.250
 go in a server and any 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.470
 The pilots are really exposed 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.030
 can not fly so it's about one 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.920
 test area for the people not so 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.020
 have a lot of experience with vehicles 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.940
 It really is a very good way to do that 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.480
 to learn whole and all the same 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.800
 alone 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.450
 So you do not have to be on a particular 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.860
 go server and say hey i try 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.810
 in this round somehow a 20s 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.490
 squad with the helicopter alone without 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.410
 to somehow have people in the teamspeak 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.060
 and that will probably be the one 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.010
 Possibility to be for the people 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.510
 to get along well in the helicopter 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.760
 maybe it will be this too 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.880
 test grounds cause that one 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.680
 with the tvt v rocket can get along well 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.630
 or hold any particular goal 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.860
 I have to hit a specific target 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.090
 also somehow moved to the right that 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.700
 I really could 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.620
 very well imagine but it is yes 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.420
 if there is really so much time 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.660
 It's for such a thing except you just have 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.430
 An extra team for that because I think they are 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.860
 do not really do anything for free and 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.860
 especially not really about the game 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.360
 and yes we can 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.980
 hope or speculate whether 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.590
 the whole thing will really be in there 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.480
 I think it was so 1 shooting terrain 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.100
 yes also in the speech respectively 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.720
 some people have talked about it 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.860
 maybe one, but one 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.630
 shooting gallery would give 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.520
 for different vehicles with which one 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.280
 actually these weapons reviews or 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.810
 weapons could represent much better and 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.390
 maybe could adjust as well 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.209
 far these targets are and that 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.200
 would indicate on this high drop on 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.940
 and I really like that very much 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.830
 cool and if that's really in there 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.330
 also for infantrymen that one 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.340
 somehow a test site for it or has 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.049
 a shooting gallery then you guys can 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.190
 be prepared for it yes if so 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.230
 definitely a lot of people there 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.210
 join in I try with some 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.039
 The whole thing through too much and keeps 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.270
 even if this is to present 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.389
 terrain will not work 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.860
 I try that 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.180
 somehow different and me 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.039
 I hope you enjoyed that again 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.379
 the whole thing is me 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.460
 also a thing still wants to 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.069
 what I can ever addressed 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.719
 and indeed it is the new multiplayer 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.749
 map somehow in a trailer 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:45.120
 has seen the thing is so we 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:47.189
 so had the lÃ¼the 09 , so to speak 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.469
 or again means something like that 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.150
 artwork came up for dice and there 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.889
 it was also about the entrance of the then 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.110
 somehow breaks and the whole city 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.870
 flooded and I can not 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.909
 imagine differently than that there is this 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.129
 this idea has taken from him and 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.199
 that will probably be really cool 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:08.310
 if you look for example on the map 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.599
 is right the trunk said the dam where 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.979
 I probably do not think that one 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.689
 but somehow you can do otherwise 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:17.490
 I would say that will be pretty 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:19.560
 pretty much the right one sees you 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.900
 Also, two big ships intended 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.270
 shook container and another 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.759
 small island where the fw flag is on it 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.169
 and I would say that one too 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.870
 opodo can use 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.550
 on the left there is something under it 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.650
 What I can not read but looks 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.569
 like a submarine and I hope that 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.219
 We can let ourselves be surprised 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.819
 surprise us and see you next time 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.819
 your opinion
