00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.430
 hi hello friends how are my name is 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.139
 earl gÃ³mez you already know my treaties of 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.760
 contacts can find in the 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.160
 description of the video my accounts of 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.400
 facebook and twitter if they have any 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.609
 question we all already know how to join a 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.030
 client computer or a server computer to a 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.650
 domain we already know the whole process by 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.480
 middle of the server manager if we are in 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.430
 windows server or through the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.120
 system configuration if we are in 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.629
 a client team but to put the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.230
 harder we are going to join a team to 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.850
 some domain by means of power shell 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.649
 then we must have already 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.540
 configured what is our card 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:52.000
 network with the ip address with what is 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.340
 our server dns in this case is the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.410
 mine or if we are by or have a hcp 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.600
 we are not going to have to configure anything 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.030
 but we must have the team in the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.680
 network then let's open our power 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.549
 be the first thing we must confirm is 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.950
 that we must have connection with our 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.960
 domain controller server then 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.500
 let's throw a pin 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.570
 to check if we have a connection 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.090
 there with our server as they can 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.550
 see here I'm having connection with the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.190
 same then once verified this 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.290
 yes we are going to proceed with the union of 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.210
 our domain of our team to 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.380
 domain and you already know apply for server 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:37.740
 applies for customer with this cmd led the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.740
 cmd led is from computer 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.840
 with the domain name parameter and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.120
 we write the name of our domain 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.490
 that in this case mine is jota ge a it 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.720
 we can also pass parameters to him 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.720
 for example credential 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.220
 with this credential we are going to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.690
 be able to establish the credentials of 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.360
 domain for example haiti voltage 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.479
 for who is the administrator and the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.180
 password will not ask for them too 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.660
 we can set the parameters as or 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.790
 patch 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.650
 to establish what the unit is 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.500
 organizational where you are going to join the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.050
 team for example I can tell you that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.100
 the team is going to unite and unite itself in 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.190
 the equal the organizational unit 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.440
 jg there is that and so then we will be able to 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.690
 also unite it there but if we 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.910
 we want to not complicate so many we can 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.640
 leave it alone with the command of the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.980
 computer domain name and the 2000 name 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.590
 of the domain because in this way it is going to 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.930
 join the organizational unit or the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.670
 container set the default and 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.410
 here he will ask us for the credentials 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.970
 for our domain as you can see 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.270
 automatically then we are going to 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.360
 write them let's tell you what is 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.230
 administrator 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.530
 and my password that I can not tell you 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.650
 let's hit enter and here it goes 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.080
 begin to perform the process to 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.590
 be able to join our domain this is going to 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.090
 take a few seconds here and we're going to have 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.940
 our team and we're going to have to 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.480
 restart there we can also pass you 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.430
 the script parameter subtract here we can 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.340
 see what the changes warning tells us 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.709
 will be effective after restarting the computer 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.430
 jg a of c02 which in this case is my 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.330
 team then we can also spend 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.220
 automatically the subtract command for 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.930
 that it automatically reboots not 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.330
 we can do it manually 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.090
 we are going to close here and we are going to restart 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.209
 our server team in this case I'm going 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.390
 to restart it and we will verify that in 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.730
 my domain controller here in what 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.480
 is the director and how can you see this jg 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.800
 ads 01 we go here here to what is capi 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.900
 director i 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.720
 and if I'm going to set up we're going to 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.420
 update here as you can see I already have 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.250
 my team united the domain by means of 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.020
 power shares would also happen with what 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.630
 is the record of ns is created in our 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.000
 dns and we have no problem 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.190
 then you know we're going to expect 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.769
 restart our team here quickly 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.230
 for what it is here we are going to have 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.870
 our team 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.650
 to see what has been attached to our 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.820
 domain veridically that has not happened 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.040
 nothing weird 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.100
 We are waiting for it to end 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.650
 to log in to be able to see that 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.060
 our domain is there 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.130
 automatically here we have our 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.440
 team back and now we are going to 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.320
 start with the other 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.500
 user already in our domain jg aite in 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.500
 this case I will start with 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.500
 administrator 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.350
