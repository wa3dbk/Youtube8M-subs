00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:09.529
 the living of poems and the fotonovelas 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.529
 planets that it rains 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.590
 you have to Taiwanese how are you expecting 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.860
 are very well welcome to a mod 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.930
 of gta 5 if you notice here there is a rocket 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.730
 or something that looks like a rocket is in fact 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.980
 a helicopter but above has these 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.080
 things that make it look like a rocket and 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.630
 It's super good, I think lately 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.369
 these mods that uploaded from míster tomás 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.379
 which is the French that did the mod of 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.360
 jet pack our actor not favorite power 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.460
 no good no no porn actor so that 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.140
 Do not be confused but it is that more illusion 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.239
 say that it is porn actor that makes the 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.250
 mods imagine a porn actor that 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.739
 let's make it cool but not good 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.660
 that we are seeing this this thing more 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.449
 well that it's flying apart that it 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.370
 it feels weird to see something like that in gta 5 like 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.890
 that the only thing we see that flies good 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.620
 the helicopters and those things but like 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.719
 that a fucking rocket is weird is weird to see 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.640
 a rocket flying lately been 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.129
 watching some very good mods 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.630
 I tried to get the best or 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.369
 just the ones that I like the most 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.679
 to share with you 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.570
 I found that jetta thing not what 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.820
 I found I found it and I asked it 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.490
 who did it today are saying that you 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.990
 you did it you did not do it no no 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.119
 I did not do the mode I did mod 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.159
 I do not know how to put it on my console either 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.590
 I knew how to put the two I would put 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.570
 then show it to him from my screen and 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.520
 to be able to do a review a little more 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.380
 detailed dare to teach them every aspect 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.299
 tell them what is good in what is 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.729
 I'm going to do that when I leave 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.310
 the gta 5 of pc because right now I can not 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.590
 not be the game not come out or rather in 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.210
 console is more difficult to put the mods 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.310
 spend the two you have to download 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.679
 put it healthy to an usb then the disk 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.299
 hard then the game then I do not know what and 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.399
 then it does not even come out you do not make a 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.530
 Desmadre then I'm waiting for me 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.690
 more to remove to 5 pc to share 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.759
 the mods plus we're already 210 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.959
 from bank robberies many have told me 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.659
 that because I have not gone up lately 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.950
 both gta 5 as before has been for the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.959
 fact that I'm waiting for them to come out 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.670
 bank robberies because they know that 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.770
 when robberies go to banks I go to 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.170
 go up a lot of that I'm going to play with 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.700
 you in 360 and good in one and in addition 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.709
 I'm doing other things or I'm 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.810
 planning other things for the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.610
 robberies for the channel simply 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.890
 I wanted to teach this way a rocket in 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.019
 gta 5 looks pretty good is very 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.450
 similar to the jet to the good, maybe not 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.450
 similar is the same person who made him 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.269
 the jetpack then has like style 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.800
 the style of the jetpack mod is 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.200
 I wanted to share they had asked me more 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.340
 mods this was more than anything by request 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.500
 of you who had told me that 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.540
 upload a little more mods to the channel not 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.420
 I do it because as I just told you 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.849
 I do not know how to put them in 360 or in the xbox 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.500
 one and better I'll wait for it to come out 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.209
 the game I started that there is less than one 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.120
 month or good if it is like a month and 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.190
 little bit since it comes out in pc we will put 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.319
 I will teach them in more detail 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.110
 I'm going to explain all those things that 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.640
 like and end of the conversation leave your 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.709
