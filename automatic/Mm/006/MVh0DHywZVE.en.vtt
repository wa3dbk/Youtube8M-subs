guns great do not get me wrong but it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.369 
guns great do not get me wrong but it
seems<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.730> manageable<00:00:48.149> only<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.960> I'd

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
seems to be manageable only up to I'd

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.459 
seems to be manageable only up to I'd
say<00:00:49.680> about<00:00:49.710> 30<00:00:50.250> meters<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.870> gets<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.320> little

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
say about 30 meters and it gets a little

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.080 
say about 30 meters and it gets a little
challenging<00:00:53.070> after<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.789> will<00:00:53.879> more

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
challenging after that you will more

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.459 
challenging after that you will more
than<00:00:54.239> likely<00:00:54.300> blow<00:00:54.840> through<00:00:55.079> an<00:00:55.199> entire

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
than likely blow through an entire

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.410 
than likely blow through an entire
magazine<00:00:55.739> trying<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> kill<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> guy<00:00:56.730> 50<00:00:57.120> 60

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
hand kills great great rate of fire but

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
hand kills great great rate of fire but
an<00:01:06.720> extremely<00:01:07.470> rebellious<00:01:08.010> amount<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.640> recoil

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
an extremely rebellious amount of recoil

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
an extremely rebellious amount of recoil

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
gun you burn through a mag in like a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
gun you burn through a mag in like a
second<00:01:17.040> flat<00:01:17.220> watch<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:17.900> like<00:01:18.900> it's

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
second flat watch right here like it's

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.990 
second flat watch right here like it's
it<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:20.009> seems<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:20.729> through

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it just seems like you just go through

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.310 
it just seems like you just go through
ammo<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.540> pick<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> double<00:01:22.200> or

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
ammo can you pick up the double or

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.350 
ammo can you pick up the double or
triple<00:01:22.439> kill<00:01:22.740> yes<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:24.000> very

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
triple kill yes but it's very very

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
triple kill yes but it's very very
challenging<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.350> may<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.710> me<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
challenging and it may just be me and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
challenging and it may just be me and
they<00:01:26.130> shoot<00:01:26.189> at<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> same<00:01:26.820> rate<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> seems

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
they shoot at the same rate but it seems

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.999 
they shoot at the same rate but it seems
like<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.900> burned<00:01:28.110> through<00:01:28.320> ammo<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.860> gun

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
like I burned through ammo with this gun

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.170 
like I burned through ammo with this gun
a<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.369> quicker<00:01:29.549> than<00:01:29.790> some<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
a little bit quicker than some of the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
a little bit quicker than some of the
others<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.020> i'm<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.770> sure<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.220> right

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
others and i'm not sure what it is right

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.950 
others and i'm not sure what it is right
here's<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> prime<00:01:33.090> example<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.840> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
here's the prime example of what this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
here's the prime example of what this
gun<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.470> long<00:01:34.680> range<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.820> right

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
gun can do long range that's right

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.350 
gun can do long range that's right
approximately<00:01:36.780> deck<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.320> does<00:01:37.500> nothing<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
approximately deck it does nothing and

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.359 
approximately deck it does nothing and

no<00:03:21.300> shots<00:03:21.570> if<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.810> seems<00:03:21.960> like<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.290> recoil

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
no shots if it seems like the recoil

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.290 
no shots if it seems like the recoil
does<00:03:22.800> not<00:03:22.950> pick<00:03:23.130> up<00:03:23.280> where<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.520> not<00:03:23.670> noticeable
