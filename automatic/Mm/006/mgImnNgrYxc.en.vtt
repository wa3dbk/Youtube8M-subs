00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.009
 Hi, friends, how are you? 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.710
 our very well watching metro channel 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.570
 stop this time I bring you a 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.870
 application with which we will be able to 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.780
 use our camera as live 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.100
 wallpaper as good as a blow this 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.460
 application is called transparent 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.379
 launcher and before you start it if 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.980
 you download it in this is the icon if 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.510
 you come in as you see this is a 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.879
 bit weird and has received a lot of criticism 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.970
 bad because the truth is not there 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.020
 very rare the subject how you are using the 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.119
 camera this is us the truth these 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.240
 ads did not give them much are ads 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.680
 from other things I do not see them much 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.210
 meaning but what they have noticed is 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.570
 that for example there is a section that says 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.360
 in ibc 7 transparent if you give it 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.910
 there you are going to have a theme type and 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.630
 I am 7 as you see and using then the 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.220
 camera like as wallpaper as you 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.080
 they have all the applications without 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.210
 However, I did not like it at all 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.160
 this and that 's why I just nothing 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.590
 decide or show them with the 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.909
 function that I use that is to use 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.609
 the camera as 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.310
 for that, they only go to the bottom of 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.430
 screen 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.500
 and select 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.210
 good back with launcher try scripts 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.130
 several for example has one of the s 4 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.780
 bring one of him from a focus and you're 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.340
 people are so weird they can try the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.470
 I tried aids and I did not like the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.120
 I 'm the only one that I'm going to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.640
 show is to use the camera as 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.370
 wallpaper you give in a wanted 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.160
 back with screens launcher and as you can see 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.450
 Well, I'm using and they say 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.500
 define as wallpaper 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.479
 and so 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.330
 As you can see, I am already using my camera 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.410
 like as wallpaper not to make it look 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.530
 transparent type no 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.910
 then that is the effect that they are going to 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.340
 get with this trade as 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.620
 launcher the truth is not very good 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.390
 but which I do not use anymore I 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.520
 focus more towards the wallpaper only 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.470
 to use the camera yes yes yes 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.850
 you keep it going to generate a 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.370
 little bit of battery spending because they have 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.260
 that must be the camera 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.640
 not turned on but it is for you 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.360
 know at least this type of 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.860
 effect on your device and good friends 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.860
 How are you saying goodbye? 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.920
 liked this video is a quick video 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.750
 nothing showing him is this little 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.840
 application we call from like that so that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.090
 you are going to use your camera as 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.520
 like hit and but it's not a visual effect 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.380
 pretty curious 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.850
 and good friends I know saying goodbye 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.000
