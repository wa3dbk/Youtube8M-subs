00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.910
 no 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.500
 hello everyone 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.020
 I have the pleasure to meet you for 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.460
 a new video recipe 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.119
 Today we'll tackle your turn 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.009
 at the apple 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.660
 called by us also patrol 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.649
 so for this recipe we need 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.970
 a broken dough of a few apples a 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:34.920
 little flour and gilding sugar and a 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.430
 fashion the ear of which I realize a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.880
 rise is 250 g of flour for the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.680
 pastry 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.030
 I made this dough the day before for 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.620
 facilitate work 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.380
 today I only have to take it 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.200
 to the booster so I take a friend I 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.760
 take about 300 g of dough 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.750
 it all depends on your size of mussels 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.750
 started thinly spreading 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.369
 so we spread out about one or two 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.020
 millimeters not make it too thick 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.060
 otherwise we have not reached who is in 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.950
 below to imbibe the apple juice and 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.940
 if the dough is too thick your dough 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.850
 does not mean that they have conveyed 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:35.180
 paws and spread thinly and I start 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:37.610
 to think in cast iron so especially well there 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.550
 well darkly marry the dough properly 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.660
 well your dough on your mold especially 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.660
 correctly in the nooks 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.910
 we cut the surplus pasta so the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.910
 first step is done we went dark 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.260
 and I'm going to start cutting apples 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.239
 which follows price of granny apples 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.830
 because I like these apples you 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.360
 can take and to which I'm going 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.790
 take any variety of 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.590
 apple so I cut is good 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.209
 finally it's true that I'm laying 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.560
 the Apollo shooting inside it's not going to 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.050
 problem I fill my pie background 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.290
 so here for this mold I took holy 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.290
 paul 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.170
 who then a fake your pie your 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.689
 are art is filled with apples we go there 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.840
 add on so I take my forehead 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:40.599
 late on it's time that your dough background 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.849
 is filled with apples we will spread our 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.950
 hat on a tower that is a tale 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.370
 art + 1 sculpin had something to 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.170
 interior 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.510
 and if it's a different tone as 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.099
 jets apples and german do pie to 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:57.639
 the same thickness that you will do so 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:59.909
 not very thick here I go on the 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.909
 boot 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.970
 and I start to know myself sugar a 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:31.610
 second then a third way nor 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.610
 the gas valves present on my condition 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.550
 so I take a horror that I have 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.190
 realized so we 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.810
 was not one I incorrectly 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.970
 I come to deposit the gilding with the help of a 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.010
 brush on the edge of our pie prices 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.760
 able to weld my hat I wanted 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.760
 put it on it 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.879
 one of them prides himself so I come 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:08.600
 properly dark to flatten maufront 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.249
 late adc 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.100
 it's going to marry 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:14.370
 the generic edges of 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.500
 once my two passions food and 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.920
 I start by cutting the surplus as 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.920
 see you later 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.580
 we 'll soon be finished I'm sleeping 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.590
 above my hat entirely 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.240
 especially for gilding avoid excess 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.240
 in it's not very good sign 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.680
 here is the pie and golden 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.580
 so here is my turn and gilded and 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.150
 more than 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.130
 6 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.700
 let's see a small structure so at 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:19.350
 using my thumb I press towards 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.300
 outside and using noah watches 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.620
 I press inward as if this 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.380
 for that plays the best oriented you 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.480
 see I start to hold by end on 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.310
 pushes both sides while the 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.590
 world whose india is this from our hand 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.350
 the most interior is simply 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.190
 it's not very complicated and it changes 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.830
 regular tournament 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.210
 so here before putting it in the oven 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.100
 go sting in the oven to allow 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.200
 Evaporation of the stewed stops 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.940
 I'm baking my name on it for 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.800
 let evaporate your turn time otherwise 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.860
 it's going to swell here so I cook it in 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.920
 a hot oven at 175 degrees during 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.900
 about 45 minutes 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.580
 so the times indicated and temperature 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.920
 indicated his good level 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.770
 we wait every day is different we 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.720
 can vary by 5 degrees the time of 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.340
 cooking can reign also I claim that 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.960
 it seems as little varied compared to 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.090
 the thickness of your dough in the 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.860
 amount of apples read inside 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.860
 this is a base I would like 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.540
 so once my turn is out 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.900
 of the oven as here I take syrup to 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.880

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.030
 of the tournament here to give a little bit of 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:33.400
 shine
