00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
you lost and he laughs no so you know my

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.999 

so<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> non<00:01:07.350> memory<00:01:07.680> people<00:01:07.920> may

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
so I think of that non memory people may

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.069 
so I think of that non memory people may
think<00:01:08.039> that's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.430> bad<00:01:08.549> memory<00:01:08.789> but<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.180> me

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
think that's a bad memory but it's me

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.220 
think that's a bad memory but it's me
it's<00:01:10.350> very<00:01:10.409> fond<00:01:10.770> memory<00:01:11.159> even<00:01:11.640> though

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
it's very fond memory even though

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.050 
it's very fond memory even though
