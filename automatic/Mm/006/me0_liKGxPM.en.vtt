orange<00:02:22.090> jumpman<00:02:22.600> logo<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.230> more<00:02:24.130> orange<00:02:24.520> as

orange jumpman logo and more orange as

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.880 
orange jumpman logo and more orange as
we<00:02:24.970> get<00:02:25.120> onto<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.420> shoe<00:02:25.660> also<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> back

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
we get onto the shoe also on the back

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.740 
we get onto the shoe also on the back
here<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.370> personally<00:02:27.910> i<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.330> is

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
here and personally i think that that is

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.890 
here and personally i think that that is
what<00:02:29.620> adds<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.220> really<00:02:30.460> nice<00:02:30.790> distinct<00:02:31.480> look<00:02:31.720> to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
what adds a really nice distinct look to

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.120 
what adds a really nice distinct look to
shoot<00:02:32.290> i<00:02:33.390> think<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.600> it's<00:02:35.230> what<00:02:35.740> makes<00:02:35.920> this

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
shoot i think that it's what makes this

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.710 
shoot i think that it's what makes this
shoe<00:02:36.370> stand<00:02:36.670> out<00:02:36.820> from<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.030> rest<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.600> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
shoe stand out from the rest of the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.830 
shoe stand out from the rest of the
shoes<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> pack<00:02:38.530> because<00:02:39.520> they<00:02:40.120> lack<00:02:40.450> that

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
shoes in the pack because they lack that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.740 
shoes in the pack because they lack that
kind<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.500> feature<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.640> fours<00:02:42.940> initially

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
kind of feature like the fours initially

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.690 
kind of feature like the fours initially
i<00:02:43.810> like<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.260> forest<00:02:44.710> better<00:02:45.130> than<00:02:45.340> all<00:02:45.550> of

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
i like the forest better than all of

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.240 
i like the forest better than all of
these<00:02:45.850> i<00:02:46.090> thought<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:47.470> four<00:02:47.710> is<00:02:47.860> really

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
these i thought that the four is really

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.100 
these i thought that the four is really
the<00:02:48.370> best<00:02:48.400> ones<00:02:48.880> but<00:02:49.150> then<00:02:49.330> after<00:02:49.720> taking<00:02:49.960> a

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
the best ones but then after taking a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.890 
the best ones but then after taking a
closer<00:02:50.380> look<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.920> then<00:02:51.100> looking<00:02:51.430> at<00:02:51.580> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
closer look and then looking at the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.330 
closer look and then looking at the
rachel<00:02:52.900> fours<00:02:53.200> Toro<00:02:53.800> Bravo<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.910> felt<00:02:55.660> like<00:02:55.720> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
rachel fours Toro Bravo I felt like the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.220 
rachel fours Toro Bravo I felt like the
the<00:02:57.340> forest<00:02:57.970> part<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.840> were<00:02:58.930> part<00:02:59.200> of

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
the forest part of that were part of

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.020 
the forest part of that were part of
this<00:02:59.350> pack<00:02:59.620> just<00:03:00.130> did<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.370> really<00:03:00.580> looks<00:03:00.850> so

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
this pack just did it really looks so

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.160 
this pack just did it really looks so
good<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:02.910> that's<00:03:03.910> basically<00:03:04.180> why<00:03:04.780> i<00:03:04.810> went

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
good and that's basically why i went

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.220 
good and that's basically why i went
with<00:03:05.260> these<00:03:05.530> befores<00:03:06.310> look<00:03:06.550> kind<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.910> late

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
with these befores look kind of late

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.120 
with these befores look kind of late
they<00:03:08.230> weren't<00:03:08.380> different<00:03:08.770> nice<00:03:08.890> pair<00:03:09.100> of

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
they weren't different nice pair of

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.440 
they weren't different nice pair of
sneakers<00:03:09.520> don't<00:03:09.700> get<00:03:09.790> me<00:03:09.880> wrong<00:03:10.090> but<00:03:10.120> they

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
sneakers don't get me wrong but they

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.020 
sneakers don't get me wrong but they
just<00:03:10.660> look<00:03:10.780> kind<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.050> plain<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:11.560> me<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.760> files

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
just look kind of plain to me the files

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.630 
just look kind of plain to me the files
i<00:03:13.270> like<00:03:13.480> them<00:03:13.690> but<00:03:13.840> most<00:03:14.560> stores<00:03:15.310> weren't

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
i like them but most stores weren't

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.910 
i like them but most stores weren't
really<00:03:15.790> releasing<00:03:16.330> them<00:03:16.590> they<00:03:17.590> were<00:03:17.650> pretty

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
really releasing them they were pretty

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.640 
really releasing them they were pretty
exclusive<00:03:18.910> such<00:03:19.090> as<00:03:19.239> one<00:03:19.420> with<00:03:19.540> these<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:20.380> i'm

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
exclusive such as one with these so i'm

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.699 
exclusive such as one with these so i'm
i'm<00:03:21.250> happy<00:03:21.610> with<00:03:21.730> them<00:03:22.560> really<00:03:23.560> nice

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.250 
i'm happy with them really nice
materials<00:03:24.489> used<00:03:25.030> on<00:03:25.330> these<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.840> think<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
materials used on these I think the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.930 
materials used on these I think the
materials<00:03:26.830> they<00:03:26.950> pick<00:03:27.220> for<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.519> shoe<00:03:27.730> were

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
materials they pick for the shoe were

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.759 
materials they pick for the shoe were
perfect<00:03:29.220> quality<00:03:30.630> was<00:03:31.630> great<00:03:32.080> craftsmanship

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
perfect quality was great craftsmanship

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.580 
perfect quality was great craftsmanship
was<00:03:33.100> great<00:03:33.420> however<00:03:34.420> there<00:03:35.170> were<00:03:35.290> some

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
was great however there were some

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.770 
was great however there were some
quality<00:03:36.190> issues<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:36.820> they're<00:03:37.420> kind<00:03:37.690> of

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
quality issues that they're kind of

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.540 
quality issues that they're kind of
minor<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:41.140> know<00:03:41.230> kind<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.830> minor<00:03:42.040> but<00:03:42.400> also

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
minor you know kind of minor but also

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.890 
minor you know kind of minor but also
kind<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:43.030> it's<00:03:43.750> hard<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.989> explain<00:03:44.230> but<00:03:45.220> um<00:03:45.280> I

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
kind of it's hard to explain but um I

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.810 
kind of it's hard to explain but um I
think<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.470> craftsmanship<00:03:48.190> on<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.400> was

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
think that the craftsmanship on this was

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.680 
think that the craftsmanship on this was
good<00:03:49.980> not<00:03:50.980> even<00:03:51.070> good<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.519> was<00:03:51.640> excellent<00:03:52.239> no

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
good not even good it was excellent no

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.130 
good not even good it was excellent no

the
to<00:04:01.750> shoot<00:04:02.020> and<00:04:02.260> also<00:04:03.040> here<00:04:03.670> we<00:04:03.850> cut<00:04:04.330> up<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
to shoot and also here we cut up the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.830 
to shoot and also here we cut up the
midsole<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.460> air<00:04:09.610> bags<00:04:09.850> here<00:04:10.150> it's

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
midsole and in the air bags here it's

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.720 
midsole and in the air bags here it's
orange<00:04:11.260> as<00:04:11.380> well<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.890> think<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.250> adds<00:04:12.460> a<00:04:12.580> nice

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
orange as well I think that adds a nice

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.050 
orange as well I think that adds a nice
touch<00:04:13.260> here<00:04:14.260> on<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.620> midsole<00:04:15.160> also<00:04:15.910> has<00:04:16.030> a

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
touch here on the midsole also has a

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.110 
touch here on the midsole also has a
really<00:04:16.299> nice<00:04:16.480> paint<00:04:16.780> job<00:04:16.840> I'm<00:04:17.820> really<00:04:18.820> nice

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
overall in my opinion also I think that

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.220 
overall in my opinion also I think that
you<00:04:26.230> know<00:04:26.320> from<00:04:27.220> afar<00:04:27.550> this<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.180> shoe<00:04:28.420> looks

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
you know from afar this the shoe looks

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.170 
you know from afar this the shoe looks
great<00:04:29.560> from<00:04:29.770> far<00:04:30.100> up<00:04:30.340> close<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.760> looks<00:04:30.790> great

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
great from far up close it looks great

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.330 
great from far up close it looks great
but<00:04:31.510> um<00:04:31.750> if<00:04:32.350> you're<00:04:32.560> expecting<00:04:32.890> something

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
but um if you're expecting something

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
not sure what happened maybe it was

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.040 
not sure what happened maybe it was
packaging<00:05:35.669> maybe<00:05:35.910> got<00:05:36.150> damaged<00:05:36.479> during<00:05:36.660> then

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
packaging maybe got damaged during then

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.400 
packaging maybe got damaged during then
or<00:05:37.410> whatever<00:05:37.919> it<00:05:38.100> is<00:05:38.750> however<00:05:39.750> they<00:05:39.930> did<00:05:39.990> get

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
or whatever it is however they did get

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.290 
or whatever it is however they did get
damaged<00:05:41.010> you<00:05:41.160> know<00:05:41.340> there's<00:05:41.669> some<00:05:41.820> pretty<00:05:42.030> bad

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
damaged you know there's some pretty bad

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.590 
damaged you know there's some pretty bad
creasing<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:43.800> maybe<00:05:44.550> that's<00:05:44.880> just<00:05:45.090> I<00:05:45.330> think

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
creasing so maybe that's just I think

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.020 
creasing so maybe that's just I think
that's<00:05:45.750> just<00:05:46.130> common<00:05:47.130> to<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.520> material

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
that's just common to the material

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.750 
that's just common to the material
because<00:05:48.840> this<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.229> wait<00:05:49.530> and<00:05:49.740> i<00:05:50.039> think<00:05:50.280> you

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
because this is wait and i think you

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.800 
because this is wait and i think you
know<00:05:50.789> you<00:05:50.940> can<00:05:51.090> already<00:05:51.210> tell<00:05:51.360> that<00:05:51.510> this<00:05:51.660> is

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
know you can already tell that this is

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.300 
know you can already tell that this is
going<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:51.990> crease<00:05:52.289> real<00:05:52.560> easily<00:05:52.800> so<00:05:53.130> i'm<00:05:53.220> going

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
going to crease real easily so i'm going

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.129 
going to crease real easily so i'm going
to<00:05:53.370> take<00:05:53.550> some<00:05:53.699> foot<00:05:53.970> care<00:05:54.510> of<00:05:54.600> these<00:05:54.690> sneakers
