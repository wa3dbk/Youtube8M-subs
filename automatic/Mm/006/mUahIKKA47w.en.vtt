say yes and that ends up taking more

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.149 
say yes and that ends up taking more
time<00:01:48.180> than<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.200> would<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.350> said<00:01:49.619> what<00:01:50.009> would

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
time than it would have said what would

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.090 
time than it would have said what would
have<00:01:50.280> taken<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.119> said<00:01:51.299> yes<00:01:52.100> so

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
sometimes guess is just an easy way to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.490 
sometimes guess is just an easy way to
save<00:01:56.610> yourself<00:01:56.939> time<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.810> know<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> do

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
something good so we spent 10 minutes on

something good so we spent 10 minutes on
the<00:02:00.869> con<00:02:01.079> when<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.409> hung<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.490> hit<00:02:03.180> me<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the con when we hung up it hit me a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.149 
the con when we hung up it hit me a
little<00:02:03.570> bit<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.409> did<00:02:04.710> something

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and I teared up a little thinking about

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.040 
and I teared up a little thinking about
the<00:02:08.280> possibility<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.479> these<00:02:09.660> six

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
I just do this in the hopes that it

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.630 
I just do this in the hopes that it
helps<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.090> touches<00:02:33.480> somebody<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:35.400> sit

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
helps and touches somebody and to sit

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.170 
helps and touches somebody and to sit
there<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:37.670> maybe<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.030> these

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
there and think that maybe one of these

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.850 
there and think that maybe one of these
kids<00:02:39.390> looked<00:02:39.720> up<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.019> me<00:02:40.170> or<00:02:40.319> maybe<00:02:40.500> they<00:02:40.650> all

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
kids looked up to me or maybe they all

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.000 
kids looked up to me or maybe they all
did<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.459> just<00:02:41.720> by<00:02:42.720> taking<00:02:42.989> this<00:02:43.290> ten<00:02:43.590> minutes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
did and just by taking this ten minutes

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.940 
did and just by taking this ten minutes
could<00:02:44.489> have<00:02:44.580> changed<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.510> direction<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
could have changed the direction of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.800 
could have changed the direction of
somebody<00:02:47.459> we<00:02:47.640> can<00:02:47.790> all<00:02:47.940> think<00:02:48.239> back<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
somebody we can all think back to the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.020 
somebody we can all think back to the
time<00:02:48.840> where<00:02:49.650> somebody<00:02:50.130> left<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.549> positive

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
time where somebody left a positive

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.330 
time where somebody left a positive
impact<00:02:51.239> on<00:02:51.600> us<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.500> changed<00:02:52.980> our<00:02:53.100> lives

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
impact on us that that changed our lives

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.009 
impact on us that that changed our lives
I'm<00:02:54.150> not<00:02:54.269> saying<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.660> I'm<00:02:54.750> changing

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
I'm not saying that I'm changing

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.470 
I'm not saying that I'm changing
people's<00:02:55.709> lives<00:02:55.799> maybe<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.459> am<00:02:56.700> maybe<00:02:56.730> I'm<00:02:57.239> not

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
people's lives maybe I am maybe I'm not

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.990 
people's lives maybe I am maybe I'm not
but<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.680> fact<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.069> we<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.610> look<00:02:59.730> back<00:02:59.940> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
but the fact that we can look back and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.670 
but the fact that we can look back and
know<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.420> somebody<00:03:00.840> had<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> positive<00:03:01.290> impact

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
know that somebody had a positive impact

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.580 
know that somebody had a positive impact
because<00:03:02.130> they<00:03:02.400> took<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.910> time<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.349> there

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
because they took the time to be there

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.759 
because they took the time to be there
for<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.330> was<00:03:06.840> much<00:03:07.080> easier<00:03:07.110> for<00:03:07.650> me<00:03:07.739> to

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
for you so it was much easier for me to

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.470 
for you so it was much easier for me to
say<00:03:07.950> yes<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.430> sit<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:08.880> talk<00:03:09.090> with<00:03:09.299> these

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
say yes and sit here and talk with these

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.449 
say yes and sit here and talk with these
kids<00:03:09.780> because<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.200> was<00:03:10.319> one<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.709> was<00:03:10.860> great<00:03:11.190> and

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
kids because it was one it was great and

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.220 
kids because it was one it was great and
it's<00:03:11.790> something<00:03:12.000> easy<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.110> was

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
it's something easy to do and it was

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.800 
it's something easy to do and it was
nice<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.709> do<00:03:13.980> i<00:03:14.220> also<00:03:14.640> sent<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> teacher<00:03:15.450> the

hopefully in a positive way so that's

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.420
