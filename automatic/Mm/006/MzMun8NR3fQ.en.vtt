00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.230
 the event has just ended 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.959
 most important astronomical of the year 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.259
 we took to the track to tell you about it 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.869
 the most anticipated horse event of 2015 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.419
 we will do it in the company of the driver more 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.290
 affirmed of the Milanese piazza pippo 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:27.500
 gubellini good morning everyone good morning 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:31.340
 maura is born as a structure of 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.390
 gallop training and will be used 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.010
 at the center of the trot 's show 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.710
 where the trotting races will take place 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.940
 good to ask foo like his 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.220
 family from gallop has passed to the prot 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.590
 but my grandfather was obviously gone 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.590
 jockey the gallop which unfortunately does not 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.270
 i never got to know morin in 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.120
 run in 47 47 are I remember well and 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.850
 then continue to a father of mine starting 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.360
 galloping and then for weight reasons later 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.610
 a few years has finished it started at 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.670
 trot for which I was born too strand 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.409
 and I started my first runs see them 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.789
 obviously in the old racecourse then 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.670
 anything 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.520
 today we are here we see together 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.889
 go horse ride I went riding that 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.139
 with the belly I let myself die so 

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:30.010
 if this stage they tried we did 

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:32.530
 even a couple of years when I was young 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.370
 galloping amount was beautiful though 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.570
 like my father, I like to eat a lot 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.460
 perfect we are happy because 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.070
 we have an extraordinary talent 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.850
 I wanted to ask you about the strengths and weaknesses of 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.270
 San Siro trots the old podium but you know 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.430
 defects all who talked about it maybe 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.350
 when the track was renewed 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.960
 that they had done that sincerely 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.540
 I don't remember my 15th year practice 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.850
 tells a very hard track for which 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.280
 obviously many horses suffered 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.049
 for which it was in my opinion is the only one 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.690
 defect for the rest for me have been 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.330
 so many qualities has been my life 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.819
 started there my first race I won 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.069
 my first grand prize is on this one 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.319
 really live a layer of lapillus in 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.870
 so as to make it softer more 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.510
 soft what these advantages will be but 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.180
 certainly for horses of course 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.959
 joints will be less and less 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.900
 resentful so by now it's a classic in 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.580
 all the racetracks of europe perhaps in the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.260
 world I don't know that in America it's so much that 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.120
 I don't go but in all the mini positions 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.819
 of Europe is a classic horse now 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.580
 runs when he can and 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.380
 manages to give a fantastic line 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.220
 manages to express all his 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.920
 potentiality 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.440
 you really like running dirt which it is 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.410
 the real reason why horses 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.330
 dirt roads go much more in my opinion than 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.049
 sure it's the most natural thing they have 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.340
 so obviously when looking for 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.230
 fix them with one of the iron fittings 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.829
 weight means that there are problems 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.350
 articular or something for which he for me 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.420
 horse at maximum speed of del core 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.090
 bolt for which he ran later 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.790
 so a huge advantage for you 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.660
 alessia but facing the curve at the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.660
 first curve 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.010
 the track will be 25 meters wide and the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.780
 slope of the curves will be of or 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.920
 eleven percent is an effect 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.430
 splendid but I would say yes 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.440
 optical smug wonderful in the first one 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.140
 time I come to see you really are 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.480
 very dumbfounded it seems to be 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.760
 perhaps according to my point of view one 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.470
 of the most beautiful racetracks in the world that it is 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.470
 saved for which there is but to be on 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.049
 vallo also on the straights there will be 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.390
 a gradient of 5 percent this 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.880
 could help the horses that are turning around 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:04:00.340
 outside I would always like 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:04.700
 been found by the first being valentia 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.440
 certainly it is a good thing but I would say 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.230
 that the track is spectacular 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.360
 really nice i'm looking forward to not not 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.260
 I'm looking forward to starting again 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.420
 how much you missed the home track 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.870
 I would say not so much but so much there 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.670
 then I would be living right up there 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.630
 track I have always lived there since 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.840
 small for which in these two years to 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.390
 morning when I go to wake myself up 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.030
 gay daughter to take her to school e 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.280
 obviously see these last two years 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.400
 a racecourse falling to pieces has been is 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.550
 It was a really disappointing thing is 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.190
 obviously it was more and more tiring 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.530
 tiring because obviously where to look 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.800
 to go to go around to i 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.440
 others can tell me when it was the i pod with 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.740
 I started and I grew up 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.680
 in fact everything was defined the scale of 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.510
 trot why always do i 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.740
 owners for the fast track 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.570
 what is there but for sure I was there 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.320
 we can always be more important than Italy 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.300
 it was the most important in Italy and then 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.610
 also for the reason of all the great ones 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.650
 awards that were always made in Milan 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.020
 with lots of channels abroad then 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.050
 everyone obviously every we could to his 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.210
 because all the scale though because maybe 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.810
 we were near the stadium there was one 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.360
 huge stand the old racecourse was 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.460
 really nice though obviously now 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.950
 yes we change we are in a place I would say 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.680
 magnificent all open so you change 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.510
 these defined at the racecourse of the park 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.370
 compared to the roman ipod path that 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.160
 it was a metropolitan racecourse 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.560
 what the big differences will be but 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.300
 we are not so many differences 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.370
 galloping 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.740
 we are at a hundred meters from the crow flies 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.919
 old the poor for whom I think not 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.770
 both for me it can be can be better 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.440
 seen and considered that the other so much 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.870
 many masonry things maybe here with 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.520
 a little more green if I receive maybe 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.620
 attract some more people a little 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.630
 people families young people 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.970
 we hope they come to meet him at 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.940
 this new one will be very important to 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.560
 raise for the old 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.080
 in the mistress of the path which is the race 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.790
 that excited you more than you have 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:30.660
 visa to which I have participated but perhaps 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.430
 the most important race was mine 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.930
 first grand prize is mangelli is not 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.440
 was more a big push convinced that the 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.500
 first was full length with gaines for 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:43.800
 instead mangelli for me unforgettable 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:47.340
 very young he was twenty years old 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.110
 the classic race that ended up that is 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.300
 They ended three years were all 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.520
 ovals from America I give nothing to me 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.410
 this American of owners of the 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.260
 gentlemen of reds training the pearl 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.180
 that I went to drive in america and it is 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.020
 special status for the simple reason 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:06.000
 which was final batteries for which 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.060
 exciting to stay all day e 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.010
 for me, everything is winning 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.240
 to nyon and I rest with all my parents 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:18.360
 friends then I was 19 years old 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.849
 so who would you like to challenge in 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.970
 these 9 with this new facility on 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.410
 this new track but I certainly hope 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.680
 of course to challenge all mine 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:31.229
 Italian colleagues and then let's see some 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.900
 uncertain if everything goes well obviously i 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.789
 great prizes are very important let's hope 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.410
 that some foreigners also come 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:41.870
 but one in particular 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.870
 but yes perhaps it is the usual enrico
