00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:57.199
 new equipment fans on the net today 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.439
 But in this video I'm going to 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.559
 the filezinho the genre silly in general 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:06.140
 although for the dressing room 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.610
 So, guys, I want to talk about the lady game. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.060
 of legends 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.000
 it is of the genus way some means a 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.799
 online multiplayer beautiful horizontina 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.130
 it was produced and distributed by 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.600
 right games and the funniest is that 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.759
 the iov legend developers justify 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.310
 and types of drugs 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.929
 they also participated in when 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.299
 develop the endowment 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:38.210
 in fact iof leds it is inspired in dowry 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.729
 The flash book is the futile play ie it is 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.579
 only you enter the link in the description and 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.829
 download the game without any other 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.950
 characters you can acquire with the 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.299
 own game money but you too 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.880
 you can not pay 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:59.389
 the cash to acquire more easily it is 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.810
 focused on pv pp is because bp means 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:04.159
 player versus player that is the kills kills 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 then you will find others 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.170
 players 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.550
 your level and then I'll follow what's the most 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.220
 strong or who will win and move us and 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.300
 always its base and enemy base in 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.410
 around the base have the second and protect the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.840
 base and beyond the boys who are types 60 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.310
 that you are not supported 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.860
 attacking him in this verse in the book 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.290
 filÃ©zin I think all the ways 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.080
 You can make the team play against 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.569
 or boat you make a team with your 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.580
 friends and will play against the monkey 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.330
 This is good for you to train because 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.590
 beginner the same experience a 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.430
 new character that you just 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.019
 buy and not wanted in bpn is to know 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.010
 those who already know the character ends 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.380
 dying and disturbing the team 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:05.630
 in the east business in some game modes 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:08.330
 like the 25 that is 545 can be yes against 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.850
 pb cycle even or against the boat 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:17.180
 the 3 x 3 same thing and the domain 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:21.109
 and each character has his or her ability 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.940
 all have me with the latter that the ultimate 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.790
 approach the character and is the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.350
 who can decide the last one in fight 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.019
 the two teams meet and start a 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.120
 battle him and that will win the team that 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.260
 more prepared for what made the best 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:44.120
 strategy and only one game that I do not 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.739
 I'll talk 'Look, you did not like it, but you do. 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.930
 to stop judging a book by its cover and 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:54.260
 playing just right for this game is good or not 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.480

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.770
