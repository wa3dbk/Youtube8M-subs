dangerous it's a little bit easier you

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.680 
dangerous it's a little bit easier you
just<00:00:16.289> need<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.529> buy<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> field<00:00:17.039> scooped<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.690> you

just need to buy a field scooped and you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.179 
just need to buy a field scooped and you
can<00:00:18.810> see<00:00:18.960> there<00:00:19.170> after<00:00:19.439> sport<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.100> this

standard Sidewinder and then the next
thing<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.010> need<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.609> go<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.810> star<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
thing you need to do is go to a star and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.100 
thing you need to do is go to a star and
here<00:00:30.599> I'm<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.960> jumping<00:00:31.320> into<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.590> system<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
here I'm just jumping into a system and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.870 
here I'm just jumping into a system and
I<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.590> it'll<00:00:34.800> put<00:00:35.100> me<00:00:35.250> right<00:00:35.280> next<00:00:35.820> to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
I know that it'll put me right next to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.069 
I know that it'll put me right next to
the<00:00:36.000> star<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.690> system<00:00:37.219> and<00:00:38.750> while<00:00:39.750> I

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
the star for this system and while I

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
the star for this system and while I
remain<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.770> super<00:00:41.129> cruise<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
remain in super cruise I'm just going to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.959 
remain in super cruise I'm just going to
fly<00:00:42.840> into<00:00:43.340> what<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.370> guess<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.820> would<00:00:44.940> call

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
fly into what I guess you would call

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.139 
fly into what I guess you would call
little<00:00:45.539> /<00:00:45.690> atmosphere<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.160> star<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:50.149> as

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
little / atmosphere of this star and as

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.889 
little / atmosphere of this star and as
I<00:00:51.300> fly<00:00:51.570> through<00:00:53.390> through<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.840> see<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
I fly through through that you see I I

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
I fly through through that you see I I
increase<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> heat<00:00:58.260> level<00:00:58.680> within<00:00:59.250> my<00:00:59.579> ship

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
increase the heat level within my ship

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.619 
increase the heat level within my ship
but<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> also<00:01:00.600> collect<00:01:01.379> fuel<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.420> bit<00:01:03.539> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
but I also collect fuel so it's a bit of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.240 
but I also collect fuel so it's a bit of
a<00:01:03.719> balancing<00:01:03.899> act<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.979> careful

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
a balancing act you have to be careful

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.690 
a balancing act you have to be careful
with<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> heat<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.430> too

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
with the heat on and if you get too

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.210 
with the heat on and if you get too
close<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.540> star<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.409> well<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.010> can

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
close to the star as well you can

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.700 
close to the star as well you can
obviously<00:01:12.090> drop<00:01:12.570> out<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> super<00:01:13.229> cruise<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
obviously drop out of super cruise and

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.289 
obviously drop out of super cruise and
then<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.250> stopped<00:01:14.580> right<00:01:14.939> next<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
then you kind of stopped right next to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.830 
then you kind of stopped right next to
the<00:01:15.420> star<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:15.960> high<00:01:16.140> high<00:01:16.920> heat<00:01:17.189> others

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.330 

complete<00:01:23.329> and<00:01:24.619> over<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.829> right<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.219> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
complete and over on the right if you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340 
complete and over on the right if you
look<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.609> the<00:01:26.700> fuel<00:01:26.969> bar<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.929> see<00:01:28.170> it's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
look at the fuel bar you can see it's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.880 
look at the fuel bar you can see it's
kind<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.950> gradually<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:30.469> as<00:01:31.469> I<00:01:31.649> make

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
kind of gradually going on as I make

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.080 
kind of gradually going on as I make
each<00:01:32.100> run<00:01:32.429> here<00:01:32.789> and<00:01:33.000> unfortunately<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:34.939> went<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
each run here and unfortunately I went a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
each run here and unfortunately I went a
little<00:01:36.299> bit<00:01:36.479> too<00:01:36.719> close<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.649> dropped

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
little bit too close there and I dropped

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.600 
little bit too close there and I dropped
our<00:01:38.159> activities<00:01:38.819> with<00:01:39.299> my<00:01:39.869> heat<00:01:40.140> already<00:01:40.610> up

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
our activities with my heat already up

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.529 
our activities with my heat already up
to<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.810> hundred<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.229> fifty<00:01:43.500> percent<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
to one hundred and fifty percent and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.819 
to one hundred and fifty percent and
that<00:01:45.539> did<00:01:45.750> actually<00:01:45.929> damage<00:01:46.380> might<00:01:46.590> hold

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
that did actually damage might hold

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.609 
that did actually damage might hold
quite<00:01:47.069> a<00:01:47.130> bit<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.299> what<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> found<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.289> kind<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
quite a bit so what I found is kind of a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.669 
quite a bit so what I found is kind of a
safest<00:01:51.859> rotation<00:01:52.859> to<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.479> go<00:01:55.289> in<00:01:55.439> with

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
safest rotation to do is to go in with

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.699 
safest rotation to do is to go in with
in<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.369> upper<00:01:57.299> levels<00:01:57.630> there<00:01:57.869> until<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.439> he

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
in the upper levels there until the he

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.709 
in the upper levels there until the he
gets<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.159> about<00:01:59.280> ninety<00:01:59.939> percent<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.569> then

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
gets to about ninety percent and then

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.580 
gets to about ninety percent and then
just<00:02:00.929> kind<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.170> peel<00:02:01.409> off<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.420> meat<00:02:03.590> turn

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
just kind of peel off the meat turn

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.359 
just kind of peel off the meat turn
round<00:02:05.810> wait<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:06.989> the<00:02:07.079> shoot<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> cool<00:02:07.649> down<00:02:07.679> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
round wait for the shoot to cool down to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.880 
round wait for the shoot to cool down to
maybe<00:02:08.910> seventy<00:02:09.450> percent<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.019> then<00:02:10.289> head<00:02:10.560> head

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
maybe seventy percent and then head head

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.850 
maybe seventy percent and then head head
back<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.280> again<00:02:11.519> and<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:15.480> vertical<00:02:16.110> lines<00:02:16.620> you

can see at the left and right side of

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.619 
can see at the left and right side of

and the kind of ring around the staff
and<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.819> will<00:02:26.940> stop<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.420> going<00:02:28.139> to

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
and and that will stop you going to

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:38.440 
and and that will stop you going to
close

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.070 

and<00:02:38.660> maybe<00:02:39.590> one<00:02:40.010> more<00:02:40.190> pass<00:02:40.520> here<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.150> that'll

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
and maybe one more pass here and that'll

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.000 
and maybe one more pass here and that'll
be<00:02:42.319> my<00:02:42.560> tank<00:02:42.860> full<00:02:43.099> of<00:02:43.160> fuel<00:02:43.459> again

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
be my tank full of fuel again

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.320 
be my tank full of fuel again
unfortunately<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.819> a<00:02:46.849> little<00:02:47.120> bit<00:02:47.300> of

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
unfortunately I have a little bit of

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.430 
unfortunately I have a little bit of
damage<00:02:47.629> from<00:02:48.019> when<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.230> got<00:02:49.160> too<00:02:49.370> hot<00:02:49.610> earlier

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
damage from when I got too hot earlier

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.390 
damage from when I got too hot earlier
but<00:02:51.440> really<00:02:51.769> it's<00:02:51.890> as<00:02:51.980> simple<00:02:52.129> as<00:02:52.340> that

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
but really it's as simple as that

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.699 
but really it's as simple as that
there's<00:02:52.790> nothing<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.269> deploy<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:54.290> just<00:02:54.530> have

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
there's nothing to deploy you just have

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.030 
there's nothing to deploy you just have
to<00:02:54.739> have<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.250> fuel<00:02:55.489> scoop<00:02:55.849> fitted<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.040> fly

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
to have the fuel scoop fitted and fly

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:09.760 
to have the fuel scoop fitted and fly
near<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.400> star<00:02:58.640> it's<00:02:59.150> simple<00:02:59.569> at<00:02:59.720> night

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.830
