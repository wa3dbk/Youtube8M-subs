00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
project so when we turned it into a
novel<00:01:52.830> I<00:01:53.250> still<00:01:53.700> want<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.060> chance<00:01:54.300> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
novel I still want to get a chance to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.200

draw<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.690> all<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.350> fun<00:01:55.560> parts<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.160> as<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
draw the all the fun parts and as the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.850 
draw the all the fun parts and as the
book<00:01:57.360> becomes<00:01:57.660> darker<00:01:58.050> and<00:01:58.170> darker<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.590> think
