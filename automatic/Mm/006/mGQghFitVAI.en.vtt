00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.230
 today I am accompanied in this video 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.940
 because today I have the honor of telling in 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.400
 house with a 1 ban has come this morning 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.900
 and I'm extorting him with cookies 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.009
 dog that we bought this morning 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.009
 and let's go 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.360
 you want one 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.360
 I do not know what they are but it smells super good 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.160
 of ham and cheese 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.290
 seriously 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.550
 if they did not look so bad so 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.510
 if it's good, it's good 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 but no 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.050
 to 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.820
 yes 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.270
 I like it 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.410
 today I have seen that it is surely going 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.970
 to see one by one input and exit the 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.220
 flat around here because it's not going to be 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.230
 still until he naps like that 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.620
 that was good truth 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.230
 today is a new video here in the section 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.270
 of the stoke and is that yesterday Monday when 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.830
 I uploaded a new photo to instagram in the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.900
 that announced what the book of 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.970
 harry potter who played this week that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.040
 touches harry potter and the mystery of 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.440
 prince 'but for this I need something 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.150
 super super important to be able to not 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.550
 just spend the afternoon or the beginning 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.800
 mental but to activate a little and 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.780
 is 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.910
 a coffee that I'm telling you right now is 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.550
 boiling but I would owe it but 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.770
 then I realized one thing and 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.810
 I want to tell you about it and they are the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.310
 wonderful joint readings 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.720
 surely most of you already 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.820
 you know what a reading is 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.800
 joint is basically a challenge that you 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.780
 you propose together with other people to 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.560
 read the same novel within a period of 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.870
 weather 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.850
 you can read a novel 23 that you 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.470
 you want and the term is variable in 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.149
 function of the available time that you have 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.040
 doing a little how my life has been 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.020
 as a reader since I started with the 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.490
 blog and since I started with the channel and 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.620
 I realized that I have done a great 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.150
 number of joint reading readings 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.800
 joint of the seven novels of harry 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.930
 potter of the six novels of jane 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.820
 austen also that along with alan to the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.400
 readings of the trudi canavan novels 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.380
 or even with other bloggers ebook I had 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.330
 other romantic genre novels or 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.800
 science fiction any other book that 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.570
 it's the good thing about joint readings 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.700
 because I like joint readings 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.770
 which is a very positive element of power 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.140
 participate in these types of challenges is that 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.390
 you first share experiences with others 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.710
 people with the case of reading 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.170
 joint that we organize now in it 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.750
 then we set out to read time 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.640
 every day and be able to determine then in a 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.020
 term of about six days that I think that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.550
 I had about six hundred pages each 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.440
 book then one thing that you 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.270
 you find is that you read every day 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.370
 those 100 pages and then we could 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.840
 commenting through social networks 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.670
 and it was great because you could 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.050
 exchange impressions see what is it 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.330
 that we liked what is not 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.430
 we squared off what theories we had about 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.750
 what is going to happen then like 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.850
 Today has not given you time to read the 100 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.410
 pages that you had thought about and you 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.330
 accumulate for the next day you have 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.430
 the 100 pages that touch you that day more 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.870
 the 100 pages of the previous day which 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.030
 It's great because if you love the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.310
 plot you will read 200 pages at a stretch 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.470
 and then it will almost cost you to leave the novel 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.480
 but on the other hand you miss a day of 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.069
 comment those 100 pages with the other 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.080
 person because you get a yes that has 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.519
 fulfilled its part of the goal but if 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.350
 he has not given you all the advantages 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.430
 that he saw the joint readings is 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.739
 that under my point of view are 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.360
 tremendously funny because 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.069
 example the novels of jane austen i 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.290
 I've read them a lot of times 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.519
 but I had always read them alone now 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.319
 I'm seeing them together with other 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.720
 people just like a tweet through 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.730
 of the hashtag lc jane austen and I make a 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.709
 comment a comment that surely 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.660
 it would stay in my mind if they read it 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.769
 novel the law was for myself but that 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.780
 Now I can share with other people 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.250
 to be able to manifest it because that's what it's for 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.260
 a joint reading to be able 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.850
 externalize all the thoughts that 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.280
 you have in your head and that sometimes you 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.900
 you guard and that you can tell others 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.209
 people to see if they think what 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.739
 same because it's really ingenious and 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.930
 I hope it's the bad part of participating in 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.570
 a joint reading on these two things 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.829
 that are bad so to speak person 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.570
 together with the other people you 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.729
 propose the goal of reading by 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.560
 example 100 pages daily or 8 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.810
 daily chapters but that when 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.950
 finish reading those 100 pages or those 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.530
 eight chapters you stay as saying 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.840
 one page plus a chapter and tomÃ¡s and al 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.060
 end then you end up moving forward a lot 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.470
 more in the plot 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.450
 so in many cases it can be 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.190
 that the objective that you mark is like this 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.740
 as a little flexible then terms 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.180
 reading you then 120 pages of the place 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.980
 they said until the character appears 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.470
 that he likes or solves a 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.000
 plot that you had well in mind ok of 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.650
 chapter in chapter a chapter then 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.100
 ends is reading the novel of a 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.100
 sitting 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.720
 today I made coffee with cinnamon worth coffee 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.120
 with milk with cinnamon and is very very 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.800
 well you have tried us but the 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.480
 coffee with milk with cinnamon and the second 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.860
 so to speak bad that you see the 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.260
 joint readings is that you for example 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.820
 you can program reading together with another 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.140
 person or together with other people 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.820
 mark you the goal of reading by 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.890
 example a book a week as is the 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.750
 case of harry potter and in the case of 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.580
 three first books is something very very 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.550
 easy to get because they are books of 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.860
 250 pages or a little thing like that but they arrive 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.660
 the fat Harry Potter books that 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.100
 just does not give you time to read them in a 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.920
 week because you have other readings 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.660
 or because you have 1,357 things to do 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.670
 you prevent you can follow a 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.440
 regular reading rhythm that you too 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.910
 have you programmed then confessed that I think 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.010
 that I have a problem regarding the 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.420
 joint readings because one thing is 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.760
 that you join a joint reading 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.710
 because you really want to read that 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.990
 book and you sign up like a reading 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.220
 joint every four months and one thing is 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.170
 that you are doing several readings 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.910
 together at the same time and surely 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.190
 is another person propose me hey patri te 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.670
 I want to read you 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.550
 blah blah talk with together and I will tell 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.410
 if I will surely say yes because I 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.630
 love the joint readings are very 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.460
 fun and surely you can not have 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.990
 material time at the end of the day to 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.850
 to be able to read but if I have to stay 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.380
 until 4 in the morning dedicating myself to 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.210
 read those 100 pages that we have 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.280
 I'm going to do it because I'm 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.080
 It seems like something very funny watching 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.600
 although I love the joint readings 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.880
 and I greatly enjoy them I think that 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.140
 for a season I'm going to keep a 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.690
 little distance so that we have 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.540
 liked as well as my reflection bar 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.980
 comments on joint readings 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.110
 literary challenges marathons and all these 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.270
 confessed things that I am addicted to 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.950
 the joint readings I love the 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.020
 I enjoy and I would surely end 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.460
 pointing to 20 or 30 more along what 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.720
 that remains of the year so I hope that you 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.670
 I really liked the video that you have 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.710
 enjoyed this coffee with me and see you 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.710
 In the video a little kiss bye 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.550
 Hi all
