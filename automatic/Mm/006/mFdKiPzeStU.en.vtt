00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
patch here of i think i'm going to do

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.730 
patch here of i think i'm going to do
either<00:01:41.820> blue<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.299> red<00:01:42.509> probably<00:01:43.049> read<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
either blue or red probably read and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.600 
either blue or red probably read and
that<00:01:44.250> red<00:01:44.430> cover<00:01:44.670> exploding<00:01:45.240> outlet<00:01:46.610> so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that red cover exploding outlet so

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.670 
that red cover exploding outlet so
that's<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.509> Sun<00:01:48.810> blast<00:01:49.290> but

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
that's like not like a Sun blast but

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.969 
that's like not like a Sun blast but
just<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.040> Archie<00:01:51.030> blast<00:01:51.590> bits<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.799> red

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
just like a Archie blast bits of red

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.039 
just like a Archie blast bits of red
feeding<00:01:53.579> into<00:01:53.790> his<00:01:53.880> face<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.509> i'll<00:01:54.780> probably

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
feeding into his face and i'll probably

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.649 
feeding into his face and i'll probably
