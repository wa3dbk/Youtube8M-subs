 I leave you here below in the description 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.649
 of the video so let's start with the review 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.390
 once and for all this book is the 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.370
 first of the saga of the island of the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.649
 warm to this day are published 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.989
 five books they can all 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.300
 find in play store at a price that 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.340
 the truth I find that it is very low 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.659
 considering the fascinating ones that are 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.490
 even the book that I'm going to 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.890
 Talk below is free 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.899
 the book presents a reality in the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.479
 which bishop are in direct communication 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.549
 with celestial beings in which the 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.619
 angels send their sentinels to the 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.899
 land to meet different types of 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.640
 missions there is a whole hidden world to 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.070
 the eyes of ordinary people and 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.689
 streams in which deals are made with 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.000
 witches to be able to buy different 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.770
 types of ingredients and use these 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.350
 ingredients to be able to record runes 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.530
 but there is something strange something that even 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.350
 in this world causes fear strangeness and 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.780
 even rejection and there is a man 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.390
 which is called gray and has no 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.729
 soul nobody knows how this happened or by 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.009
 what electro is that all the people 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.959
 prefer rather to step away and not 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.940
 get in your way except for 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.039
 a few who seek it but only to 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.590
 can ask for help and that's how this 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.630
 book with mario 'so I think hiring 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.250
 the services to acquire so that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.319
 it can help you with a degree of 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.869
 problem that is not affecting and is that 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.459
 your daughter is possessed by a demon go 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.099
 so I think so in is a normal person 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:11.740
 because they are large amounts of money and 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.110
 not all obtained legally by 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.550
 he knows all this world knows that the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.980
 controlled financial institutions 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.230
 by demons and other creatures and even 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.390
 vampires then the gray finally 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.980
 accept this deal and come to the house of 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.310
 Mario so created together with his team 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.140
 this team is made up of Ã¡lex that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.410
 is described in the book as rather 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.190
 a handsome guy a super attractive guy 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.740
 seriously reserved something then we found a 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.500
 diego that is one day approximately 14 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.780
 years and finally we have xala which is 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.580
 the newest member of the team every 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.650
 one of these characters has its own 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.690
 pretty interesting story that is going 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.940
 developing along the rivers by 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.710
 example diego has an extra blessing 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.840
 directly by the angels rather 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.790
 for a specific one and this curse 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.490
 is that you can not say any 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.080
 kind of lying if your body does 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.150
 full of cramps that cause a 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.310
 tremendous pain so far the pillar burns 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.220
 therefore the brutal honesty that 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.110
 has no detours or anything to say 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.090
 things so it makes you more than one 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.340
 laughter during the sarko book 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.769
 recruited looks a little gray 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.470
 that had only heard rumors about 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.260
 of him and the truth is that nothing good but 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.269
 finally your curiosity and wins and accepts 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.310
 join this group and discover everything 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.200
 this world that was hidden from his eyes 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.360
 this character does not serve much to us 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.640
 the readers because he spends it 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.099
 asking questions all this is new 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.870
 for her and makes the others 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.239
 characters reveal super data 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.950
 important to go knowing us well 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.690
 what is all this history about 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.580
 while the gray is worried about you 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.819
 fulfill your part of the deal with mario so 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.860
 I believe in heaven an angel named mikael 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.959
 call your most trusted sentinel 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.750
 to commission a task very very 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.150
 important and we go channel and the earth and 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.190
 bring what is presented in front of 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.140
 angels to a conclave that these are going to 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.819
 make this meeting is extremely 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.310
 important because of the subject that is going to 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.049
 treat an angel was killed and the gray 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.239
 I was present when this happened 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.370
 after this all the angels 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.370
 they worried a lot because for the first 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.410
 once from creation they felt their life 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.150
 threatened therefore they had to discover 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.280
 who was at all costs like this 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.400
 murder is an exception to all regulations 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.010
 and also it is it concludes that the gray 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.050
 maybe you acs a lot and that's why 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.730
 requires your presence as soon as possible 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.950
 it's how you get to miriam you're in 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.139
 cinelandia by the angel I fall to the 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.270
 house so I think to be able to 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.760
 fulfill dream but you can fulfill the 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.250
 You can meet the gray your deal with various 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.810
 tancredo the angels killed to gray 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.030
 for killing one of his brothers 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.980
 if you want to know the answer to all 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.080
 these questions do not have to stop 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.000
 reading the bible the warm tones was 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.770
 a fact of this Spanish authors that 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.750
 all your books are connected 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.850
 characters that are repeating and 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.680
 stories that intertwine then yes 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.290
 you let yourself be captivated finished wanting 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.880
 read all your books points in favor and 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.820
 points against the bible of the 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.430
 fallen tomes the favor can I say that it is 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.080
 a completely captivating room the 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.300
 way of writing that this author has 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.940
 It makes you not even wonder if 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.910
 this could be real or not just what 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.889
 You take for granted it also makes you think what 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.840
 would happen if to truth our world 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.970
 there were all this kind of creatures 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.920
 the fact that the first book is 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.570
 for free I also consider it a hoot 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.490
 because the times that we are 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.160
 living today no one has more than enough 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.290
 money and it is a detail that is appreciated 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.910
 also if you did not know anything about this saga or 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.070
 even this author 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.930
 why not start with this total book 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.580
 there is nothing to lose against you 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.260
 I can say that if you are not a person 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.330
 patient you will take more than some 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.060
 disgust for each book that comes out 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.860
 you are asking more and more questions and 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.350
 you long for that moment when finally 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.410
 all the pieces fit and two questions 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.630
 be answered but this does not happen and 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.330
 On the contrary, Lee is another book and your 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.710
 questions do nothing but increase 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.630
 that has been all for today I hope that you 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.640
 have liked the review and are encouraged to 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.140
 read the bible of the corns this 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.740
 thanks for watching and we'll see you in a 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.740
 next video
