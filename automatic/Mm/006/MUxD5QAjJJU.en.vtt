square X encircle no idea really what
that<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> activates<00:02:08.789> move<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.539> I

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
that is for the activates move but I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.449 
that is for the activates move but I
don't<00:02:09.780> know<00:02:09.869> don't<00:02:10.709> quote<00:02:10.830> me<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
don't know don't quote me on that and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.770 
don't know don't quote me on that and
then<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.640> had<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.790> PlayStation<00:02:12.330> button<00:02:12.450> here

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
then we had the PlayStation button here

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.230 
then we had the PlayStation button here
Oh

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
Oh

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.930 
Oh
to<00:02:13.300> trigger<00:02:13.540> at<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.750> back<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.790> down<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
to trigger at the back and down the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.340 
to trigger at the back and down the
bottom<00:02:16.210> we<00:02:16.300> have<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.540> USB<00:02:16.810> port<00:02:17.140> for<00:02:17.200> charging

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
bottom we have the USB port for charging

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.950 
bottom we have the USB port for charging
and<00:02:20.850> not<00:02:21.850> actually<00:02:22.090> sure<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.510> bottom<00:02:22.780> one<00:02:22.930> is

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
and not actually sure that bottom one is

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.950 
and not actually sure that bottom one is
for<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:24.070> I'm<00:02:24.160> guessing<00:02:24.370> these<00:02:24.790> two<00:02:25.060> pins<00:02:25.780> he

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
for but I'm guessing these two pins he

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.870 
for but I'm guessing these two pins he
probably<00:02:26.320> put<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.680> on<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.070> charger<00:02:27.580> if<00:02:27.730> they

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
probably put it on to a charger if they

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.730 
probably put it on to a charger if they
have<00:02:28.030> an<00:02:28.120> accessory<00:02:28.630> out<00:02:28.840> then<00:02:29.440> across<00:02:29.680> the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
have an accessory out then across the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.650 
have an accessory out then across the
side<00:02:30.070> here<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.520> have<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.940> select<00:02:31.450> button

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
side here we just have the select button

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.640 
side here we just have the select button
and<00:02:32.370> start<00:02:33.370> button<00:02:33.700> across<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.120> side<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:35.470> is

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
and start button across the side this is

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.020 
and start button across the side this is
actually<00:02:35.950> pretty<00:02:36.130> comfortable<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.730> your<00:02:36.820> hand

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
actually pretty comfortable in your hand

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.560 
actually pretty comfortable in your hand

I find the Wii Remote a bit more
comfortable<00:02:41.020> than<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:41.320> but<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.100> in

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
comfortable than this but it is in

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.590 
comfortable than this but it is in
general<00:02:42.760> pretty<00:02:43.000> comfortable<00:02:43.510> they

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
general pretty comfortable they

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.670 
general pretty comfortable they
obviously<00:02:43.720> didn't<00:02:44.020> want<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.230> infringe<00:02:44.470> on

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
it and that's basically it you plug it

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.500 
it and that's basically it you plug it
into<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.800> USB<00:03:03.130> port<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:03.820> PlayStation<00:03:04.420> and

which<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.890> pretty<00:03:08.890> unique<00:03:08.980> feature

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
which is a pretty unique feature

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.320 
which is a pretty unique feature
actually<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:11.100> right<00:03:12.100> here<00:03:12.130> obviously<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:13.300> you

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
actually and right here obviously as you

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.790 
actually and right here obviously as you
saw<00:03:13.600> before<00:03:13.630> this<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.200> just<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.470> start<00:03:14.500> of

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
saw before this is just the start of

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.830 
saw before this is just the start of
disc<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.280> I'm<00:03:15.910> guessing<00:03:16.270> stood<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.510> bunch<00:03:16.690> of

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
disc and I'm guessing stood a bunch of

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.590 
disc and I'm guessing stood a bunch of
games<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:18.340> here's<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.610> strap<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.390> hopefully

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
games and here's a strap so hopefully

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.420 
games and here's a strap so hopefully
