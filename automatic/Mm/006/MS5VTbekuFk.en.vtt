not<00:01:16.330> anything<00:01:16.750> because<00:01:17.320> it's<00:01:17.560> it's<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.160> space

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
not anything because it's it's a space

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.480 
not anything because it's it's a space
issue<00:01:18.760> yeah

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.230 

if<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:23.360> tell<00:01:23.630> me<00:01:23.780> yeah<00:01:24.350> could<00:01:25.159> as<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.760> space

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
if you tell me yeah could as a space

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.609 
if you tell me yeah could as a space
today<00:01:26.600> because<00:01:26.960> we<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:27.260> are<00:01:27.380> building

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
today because we you are building

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.800 
today because we you are building
something<00:01:27.860> from<00:01:28.549> scratch<00:01:28.670> because<00:01:29.299> also

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
something from scratch because also

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.710 
something from scratch because also
maybe<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.800> lot<00:01:30.950> of<00:01:31.100> people<00:01:31.400> they<00:01:31.550> think<00:01:31.720> okay

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
maybe a lot of people they think okay

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.930 
maybe a lot of people they think okay
here<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.229> custom<00:01:33.800> and<00:01:34.010> here<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:34.430> do<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.610> it

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
here is a custom and here you do it it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.810 
here is a custom and here you do it it
doesn't<00:01:35.570> work<00:01:35.750> like<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:36.290> from<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.400> technical

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
doesn't work like this from a technical

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.850 
doesn't work like this from a technical
point<00:01:38.210> of<00:01:38.479> view<00:01:38.800> if<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:40.009> want<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.790> do<00:01:40.940> it<00:01:41.860> it's

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
point of view if you want to do it it's

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.850 
point of view if you want to do it it's
not<00:01:42.950> just<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.850> say<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.659> is<00:01:44.899> part<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.710> you

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
not just you say this is part of you

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.010 
not just you say this is part of you
I'll<00:01:46.159> give<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.759> land<00:01:47.119> it<00:01:47.479> is<00:01:47.780> the

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
I'll give you this land it is the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.499 
I'll give you this land it is the
logistic<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:48.950> how<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:49.340> work<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:50.270> have<00:01:50.360> to

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
logistic and how it work you have to

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.260 
logistic and how it work you have to
understand<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.220> every<00:01:52.220> passenger<00:01:52.700> if<00:01:53.060> he<00:01:53.210> is

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
understand that every passenger if he is

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.169 
understand that every passenger if he is
coming<00:01:53.659> for<00:01:53.930> example<00:01:54.020> in<00:01:54.560> transit<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.940> have

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
coming for example in transit you have

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.010 
coming for example in transit you have
to<00:01:56.420> get<00:01:56.630> him<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:58.119> outside<00:01:59.119> like<00:01:59.479> he<00:01:59.720> flying

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
to get him in and outside like he flying

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.310 
to get him in and outside like he flying
to<00:02:00.259> America<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:01.520> means<00:02:01.940> that<00:02:02.270> he<00:02:02.509> have<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:03.020> go

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
to America that means that he have to go

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.139 
to America that means that he have to go
out<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.280> end<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.670> there

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
out and end of there

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.029 
out and end of there
the<00:02:05.360> airport<00:02:05.810> not<00:02:05.990> necessary<00:02:06.500> out<00:02:06.679> of<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
the airport not necessary out of the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.969 
the airport not necessary out of the
perimeter<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.910> airport<00:02:08.170> his<00:02:09.170> baggage<00:02:09.500> got

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
perimeter of the airport his baggage got

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.180 
perimeter of the airport his baggage got
to<00:02:10.160> be<00:02:10.340> reverted<00:02:10.850> again<00:02:11.739> even<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.040> way

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
to be reverted again even in the way

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.750 
to be reverted again even in the way
leaving<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.000> airport<00:02:14.150> they<00:02:14.570> have<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.989> be<00:02:15.760> not

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
leaving the airport they have to be not

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.330 
leaving the airport they have to be not
to<00:02:17.000> mix<00:02:17.239> with<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.080> passenger<00:02:18.769> in<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
to mix with all the passenger in the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.520 
to mix with all the passenger in the
airport<00:02:19.790> even<00:02:20.000> they<00:02:20.330> are<00:02:20.480> secured<00:02:21.019> everything

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
airport even they are secured everything

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.150 
airport even they are secured everything
that's<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.670> process<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.110> there<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:24.830> many

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
that's the process so it there is many

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.780 
that's the process so it there is many
challenging<00:02:26.090> when<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.840> come<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.320> practice<00:02:27.790> so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
challenging when you come to practice so

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:39.890 
challenging when you come to practice so
you<00:02:28.910> have<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.269> visualize<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.230> how<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.739> works

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.830 

I<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.950> see<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.400> can't<00:02:41.849> say<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.060> sure<00:02:42.269> we<00:02:42.659> can

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
I can see I can't say for sure we can

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.559 
I can see I can't say for sure we can
accommodate<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.590> there<00:02:43.860> hundred<00:02:44.790> percent<00:02:45.239> you

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
accommodate it there hundred percent you

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.440 
accommodate it there hundred percent you
know<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.220> didn't<00:02:47.580> stop<00:02:47.909> us<00:02:47.940> into

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
know but we are we didn't stop us into

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.039 
know but we are we didn't stop us into
looking<00:02:48.840> at<00:02:49.769> it<00:02:50.010> at<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.700> existing<00:02:51.239> Airport<00:02:51.480> if

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
looking at it at the existing Airport if
