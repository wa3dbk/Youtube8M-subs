 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.880
 There was a question on Facebook last week. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.000
 I asked you to choose one dish between Omurice and Peppembab. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 The more people prefer omurice, so today I am going to make omirice. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
 For this recipe, you will need to: 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.710
 4 oz chicken breasts, cubes (110g) 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.210
 4 eggs 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.920
 البصل onions, chopped 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.830
 5 tablespoons of carrots, cut 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.420
 فص garlic clove, minced 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.550
 2 grain bowls short rice cooked 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.920
 4 tablespoons of tomato sauce 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 Vegetable oil for frying 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.960
 Salt and 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 Fresh ground pepper 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 First, in the presence of a crack in the egg bowl 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Add ملعقة teaspoon of salt and pepper. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 And whisk until the mixture is homogeneous 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.910
 Set aside. 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.000
 Then, add in vegetable oil in a large skillet 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 The heat is medium heat. 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 Add cubes in chicken breasts and fry for 3 minutes. 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.500
 Then add in the islands, 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.800
 Onions, 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.750
 Garlic. 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.370
 Season lightly with salt and pepper. 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.370
 Fry for 2-3 minutes or until soft vegetables. 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.200
 You can choose mushrooms instead of carrots if you want. 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.210
 Add rice short grain steamed and break any lumps. 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.710
 If you use hot rice, it is easy to break. 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.710
 And stir until mixed. 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.510
 Now out of the heat, add tomato sauce 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.330
 And stir until the mixture is homogeneous. 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.330
 Today I just added 4 tablespoons but you can increase the amount of sauce as you like. 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.620
 Then tasted 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And season with salt 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 The pepper is to your liking. 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.330
 Now lightly grease a small pan with vegetable oil. 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.330
 I am using a bottle of refillable spray oil today. 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.000
 Add half the egg mixture in the pan and cook the egg tortillas at low temperature. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 When eggs are almost done, place half the rice on top of the omelet in the middle. 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.630
 This is the first batch for 1 person. 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.250
 Then fold the top and bottom side of the omelet to cover the rice. 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.660
 Now cover the pan with a serving dish and carefully turn the pan over the plate. 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.580
 Voila! 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.680
 Appetizers with sauce. 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.180
 Today I'm using korean sauce, not Heinz. 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.080
 Do you prefer any brand of ketchup? 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.080
 I love the omurice with vegetables and fresh tomato slices. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Bon appetite. 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.500
 This is simple and simple Japanese soothing food. 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.740
 Today was Omurice and tomorrow it's an apple pie. 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.740
