really cool suggestion by dr GN nut so

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.410 
really cool suggestion by dr GN nut so
let's<00:00:40.140> try<00:00:40.350> that

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.990 

hey<00:00:45.420> there<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.670> an

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
hey there we go so this is a this an

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.270 
hey there we go so this is a this an
obsidian<00:00:48.270> box<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.010> redstone

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
obsidian box with just a redstone

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.279 
obsidian box with just a redstone
running<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.730> underneath<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> torch<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
running out underneath it to a torch to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.770 
running out underneath it to a torch to
go<00:00:52.559> sent<00:00:52.770> up<00:00:52.980> into<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> block<00:00:53.610> where<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.510> put

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
go sent up into the block where we put

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.150 
go sent up into the block where we put
the<00:00:54.899> torch<00:00:55.110> inside<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> contraption<00:00:58.160> this

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the torch inside of the contraption this

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.520 
the torch inside of the contraption this
obsidian<00:00:59.489> box<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.030> simply<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.350> what

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
obsidian box is simply here this is what

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
obsidian box is simply here this is what
happens<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> blow<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> TNT

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
happens if you blow that I'm out of TNT

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
happens if you blow that I'm out of TNT
up<00:01:03.719> otherwise<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.710> they<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> blow<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.310> at

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
up otherwise so they have to blow up at

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.460 
up otherwise so they have to blow up at
once

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
once

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.730 
once
we<00:01:10.979> could<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:13.979> these<00:01:14.220> down<00:01:17.210> whoops

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
we could so if I put these down whoops

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:27.690 
we could so if I put these down whoops
then<00:01:19.740> light<00:01:20.700> them<00:01:22.100> individually

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.160 

you<00:01:28.700> can<00:01:28.850> see<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.180> we<00:01:29.240> just<00:01:29.270> blew<00:01:29.720> up<00:01:29.930> the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
you can see that we just blew up the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.230 
you can see that we just blew up the
coal<00:01:30.500> block<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.160> didn't<00:01:31.460> get<00:01:31.640> any<00:01:31.790> diamond

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
coal block and I didn't get any diamond

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.050 
coal block and I didn't get any diamond
see<00:01:33.140> not<00:01:33.410> only<00:01:33.440> do<00:01:33.920> they<00:01:34.070> do<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.700> know<00:01:34.820> get<00:01:35.030> a

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
see not only do they do you know get a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.750 
see not only do they do you know get a
diamond<00:01:35.560> with<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.590> T<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:36.980> he<00:01:37.220> actually<00:01:37.610> gets

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
diamond with the T and he actually gets

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.490 
diamond with the T and he actually gets
pushed<00:01:38.090> off<00:01:38.330> by<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.720> shockwave<00:01:39.200> from<00:01:39.230> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
pushed off by the shockwave from the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.650 
pushed off by the shockwave from the
first<00:01:39.710> ones<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.490> they<00:01:40.640> have<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:41.030> be<00:01:41.150> set<00:01:41.360> to

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
first ones so they have to be set to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.320 
first ones so they have to be set to
explode<00:01:42.200> on<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.470> very<00:01:42.740> same<00:01:42.950> tick<00:01:43.190> but<00:01:44.150> if<00:01:44.240> I

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
explode on the very same tick but if I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.090 
explode on the very same tick but if I
do<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.660> I<00:01:44.690> will<00:01:44.990> always<00:01:45.290> get<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.620> single

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
do that I will always get a single

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.000 
do that I will always get a single
diamond<00:01:46.550> from<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.270> coal<00:01:48.170> block<00:01:48.410> which<00:01:48.830> is

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
diamond from a coal block which is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.140 
diamond from a coal block which is
pretty<00:01:49.670> nice<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.770> again<00:01:51.770> thanks<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.400> Dr<00:01:52.790> Jean
