question<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.370> well<00:04:05.030> what<00:04:05.180> about<00:04:05.300> eating<00:04:05.570> whole

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
question is well what about eating whole

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.199 
question is well what about eating whole
grains<00:04:06.320> I<00:04:06.620> think<00:04:07.070> good<00:04:07.220> for<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.610> grains

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
grains I think good for you grains

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.820 
grains I think good for you grains

thousand to ten thousand years ago to

thousand to ten thousand years ago to
take<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.080> evolutionary<00:04:12.650> perspective<00:04:12.950> you

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
take the evolutionary perspective you

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.289 
take the evolutionary perspective you
don't<00:04:13.970> need<00:04:14.120> grains<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.720> don't<00:04:15.170> eat<00:04:15.290> any<00:04:15.500> grains

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
don't need grains I don't eat any grains

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.000 
don't need grains I don't eat any grains
going<00:04:17.299> from<00:04:17.570> grains<00:04:17.870> we<00:04:18.169> now<00:04:18.320> go<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.620> something

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
going from grains we now go to something

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.510 
going from grains we now go to something
even<00:04:19.780> less<00:04:20.780> wise<00:04:21.080> in<00:04:21.470> my<00:04:21.620> opinion<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:22.340> is

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
even less wise in my opinion and that is

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.390 
even less wise in my opinion and that is
vegetarianism<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.780> human<00:04:24.169> species<00:04:24.650> evolved

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
vegetarianism the human species evolved

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.940 
vegetarianism the human species evolved
from<00:04:25.790> a<00:04:25.940> line<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.600> included<00:04:27.020> vegetarians<00:04:27.770> as

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
from a line that included vegetarians as

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.500 
from a line that included vegetarians as
well<00:04:28.130> as<00:04:28.250> meat-eaters<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:29.030> meat-eating

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
well as meat-eaters the meat-eating

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.170 
well as meat-eaters the meat-eating
human<00:04:29.960> eats<00:04:30.229> high<00:04:30.710> density<00:04:31.250> nutrients<00:04:31.910> could

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
human eats high density nutrients could

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.880 
human eats high density nutrients could
therefore<00:04:32.390> afford<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.050> have<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.200> small<00:04:33.590> stomach

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
therefore afford to have a small stomach

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.190 
therefore afford to have a small stomach
you<00:04:34.310> trade<00:04:34.550> stomach<00:04:35.030> for<00:04:35.210> brain<00:04:35.450> mass<00:04:35.750> so<00:04:36.110> they

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
you trade stomach for brain mass so they

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.140 
you trade stomach for brain mass so they
could<00:04:36.350> therefore<00:04:36.560> become<00:04:37.130> smarter<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:37.940> also

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
could therefore become smarter you also

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.600 
could therefore become smarter you also
gain<00:04:38.780> mobility<00:04:39.440> by<00:04:39.590> having<00:04:39.919> a<00:04:40.010> small<00:04:40.280> stomach

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
gain mobility by having a small stomach

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.460 
gain mobility by having a small stomach
so<00:04:41.120> if<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:41.660> wanted<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:41.990> look<00:04:42.260> like<00:04:42.320> a

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
so if you wanted to look like a

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.040 
so if you wanted to look like a
vegetarian<00:04:43.040> who<00:04:43.640> didn't<00:04:43.940> quite<00:04:44.120> make<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.450> have

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
vegetarian who didn't quite make it have

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.750 
vegetarian who didn't quite make it have
a<00:04:45.080> look<00:04:45.290> at<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.530> gorilla<00:04:45.860> that's<00:04:46.250> what<00:04:46.460> humans

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
a look at the gorilla that's what humans

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.490 
a look at the gorilla that's what humans
would<00:04:46.940> look<00:04:47.060> like<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.510> think<00:04:47.780> if<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.200> want<00:04:48.380> to

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
would look like I think if you want to

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.200 
would look like I think if you want to
live<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.680> long<00:04:48.860> time<00:04:48.919> in<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.700> kind<00:04:49.910> of<00:04:50.000> health

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
live a long time in the kind of health

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.780 
live a long time in the kind of health
that<00:04:51.020> I've<00:04:51.169> been<00:04:51.350> lucky<00:04:51.650> enough<00:04:51.680> to<00:04:51.979> enjoy<00:04:52.130> you
