00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.219
 I plead kid food is such a case simply because it eats it 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.219
 that does not work that's easy for me to bring the most important means 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:21.699
 Everything that you buy industrially is always a preserve and remains one 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.449
 I never know exactly what's inside and if I can myself manufacturer 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.329
 I work with fresh products so that I know exactly that in there too 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.710
 is included 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.149
 then it is very important to me that parents already please me in the 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.129
 The habit of cooking together means really cooking for yourself 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.090
 for the child something off and just create that 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.810
 and that children learn that one forgot to spend a little time 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.930
 That's just the food is done and not just just that 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.170
 quick death or a jar is opened 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.360
 On top of that, of course, it gives the children from the start to the 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.110
 Taste of the family kitchen can get used to that which is all that is in the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.480
 Beikost gives to get to know the children for what comes later 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.260
 So I have quite a great variety of tastes that really 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.070
 this div conversion to the family fund in the name facilitates that 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.120
 are so brief the most important points it is quite simple 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.770
 Weichert himself produces that experience in the consultation again and again 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.310
 Many parents in the evening simply have little faith in their own cooking 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.310
 and that's why I simply resort to industrial ignorance 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.640
 I'll show him with a small one, they turn fast and easy 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.830
 really a vegetable porridge impression of porridge and also a milk price 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.520
 those are things of a few minutes 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.320
 And nothing can go wrong and they will notice 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.120
 the more often you do it the more you get into the proteins anymore i load 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.540
 They do a part of Cremer's life-threatening work more together 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.450
 watching how easy and practical and fast it is just the complementary foods 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.500
 The row series are ready to go
