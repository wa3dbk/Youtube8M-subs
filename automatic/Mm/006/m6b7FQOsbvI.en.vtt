to this solenoid so they can distribute
it<00:02:05.480> now<00:02:06.480> what<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.050> do<00:02:07.350> without<00:02:07.800> even

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
it now what you can do without even

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.450 
right here if you're getting vacuum
check<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.710> other<00:04:51.830> side

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
check the other side

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.950 
check the other side
this<00:04:52.940> little<00:04:53.180> one<00:04:53.360> don't<00:04:53.570> worry<00:04:53.690> about<00:04:53.750> that

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
this little one don't worry about that

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.900 
this little one don't worry about that
that's<00:04:54.110> just<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.380> vent<00:04:54.620> one<00:04:54.860> so<00:04:55.670> we're

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
that's just a vent one so we're

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.400 
that's just a vent one so we're
concentrating<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.600> big<00:04:56.720> fat<00:04:56.960> one<00:04:57.140> on<00:04:57.230> here

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
concentrating the big fat one on here

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.670 
concentrating the big fat one on here
and<00:04:57.910> if<00:04:58.910> you're<00:04:59.090> getting<00:04:59.180> vacuum<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.080> then

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
and if you're getting vacuum and then

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.890 
and if you're getting vacuum and then
you<00:05:00.770> stick<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.190> onto<00:05:01.340> here<00:05:01.790> fully<00:05:02.420> back<00:05:02.660> onto

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
you stick it onto here fully back onto

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.050 
you stick it onto here fully back onto
here<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:06.050> it's<00:05:06.230> supposed<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.620> be<00:05:06.830> if<00:05:07.100> you're

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
here like it's supposed to be if you're

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.010 
here like it's supposed to be if you're
getting<00:05:08.390> vacuumed<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:10.750> shouldn't<00:05:11.750> turn

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
getting vacuumed this shouldn't turn

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.300 
getting vacuumed this shouldn't turn
when<00:05:12.560> you<00:05:12.590> spin<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.790> tire<00:05:14.710> so<00:05:15.710> if<00:05:16.070> you're

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
when you spin the tire so if you're

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.370 
when you spin the tire so if you're
getting<00:05:16.550> vacuum<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.270> it's<00:05:17.780> still<00:05:18.110> turning

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
getting vacuum and it's still turning

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.800 
getting vacuum and it's still turning
with<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:18.860> with<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.520> tire<00:05:19.730> then<00:05:20.540> we<00:05:20.660> know

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
with the with the tire then we know

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.240 
with the with the tire then we know
we've<00:05:20.990> got<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.140> problem<00:05:21.470> with<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.800> wheel<00:05:21.920> end

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
we've got a problem with the wheel end

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.760 
we've got a problem with the wheel end
we<00:05:22.580> need<00:05:22.700> to<00:05:22.790> take<00:05:22.970> it<00:05:23.150> off<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:24.470> go

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
we need to take it off and and go

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.070 
we need to take it off and and go
through<00:05:25.100> and<00:05:25.280> look<00:05:25.430> at<00:05:25.640> it<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:26.000> most<00:05:26.810> likely

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
through and look at it and most likely

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.130 
through and look at it and most likely
replace<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:27.830> be<00:05:27.920> ready<00:05:28.130> for<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:28.660> as<00:05:29.660> shown<00:05:30.110> in

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
replace it be ready for that as shown in

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.620 
replace it be ready for that as shown in
my<00:05:30.350> other<00:05:30.500> video<00:05:30.920> but<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.970> just<00:05:35.030> wanted<00:05:35.420> to<00:05:35.480> go

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
my other video but I just wanted to go

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.380 
my other video but I just wanted to go
over<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.080> real<00:05:36.260> quick<00:05:36.590> um<00:05:36.920> you<00:05:37.700> don't<00:05:37.970> need<00:05:38.180> a

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
over it real quick um you don't need a

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.860 
over it real quick um you don't need a
vacuum<00:05:38.960> gauge<00:05:38.990> or<00:05:39.470> any<00:05:39.590> special<00:05:39.950> tools

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
vacuum gauge or any special tools

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.620 
vacuum gauge or any special tools
necessarily<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:43.550> do<00:05:43.700> this<00:05:43.970> in<00:05:44.300> most

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
necessarily to do this in most

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.260 
necessarily to do this in most
situations<00:05:44.900> and<00:05:45.800> if<00:05:46.070> you<00:05:46.160> do<00:05:46.340> these<00:05:46.460> few<00:05:46.820> tests

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
situations and if you do these few tests

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.760 
situations and if you do these few tests
you<00:05:47.360> can<00:05:47.510> really<00:05:47.810> pinpoint<00:05:48.080> where<00:05:48.620> it's

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
you can really pinpoint where it's

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.160 
you can really pinpoint where it's
coming<00:05:48.980> from<00:05:49.100> and<00:05:49.550> what<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.330> issue<00:05:50.510> is<00:05:50.720> and

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
coming from and what the issue is and

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.600 
coming from and what the issue is and
why<00:05:51.740> it<00:05:51.800> is<00:05:52.130> or<00:05:52.460> is<00:05:52.700> not<00:05:52.780> turning<00:05:53.780> on<00:05:54.610> properly

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
why it is or is not turning on properly

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.180 
why it is or is not turning on properly
at<00:05:55.700> all<00:05:55.790> times
