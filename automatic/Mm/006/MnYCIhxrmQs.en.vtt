 Plate boundary moving the system along with Marlene 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.089
 there is 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.450
 A policy to cross the island from Hokuto on the summer 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.759
 Elongated rocky morbidity is a fissure eruption on the site 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.050
 It is a mark 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.570
 The criminals are slowly separating Iceland and spreading 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.719
 With the cat's tongue 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.190
 New growth is born and the story of Europe and America 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.690
 I am doing 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.430
 Even in high school, it looks good 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.970
 It is a place that falls on the edge of two plates 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.540
 Deteriorated US playboy's right side on the left 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.520
 Eurasia Plate 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.659
 In this example 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.629
 That is what lava solidified about 8000 years ago 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.839
 It has spread to this width over several years 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.790
 Or non-partisans are about 22.5 cm of the city in life 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.060
 He said that the first one should grow 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.750
 We move 2.5 centimeters in one year 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.860
 During the lifetime of human beings America and Europe 1 meter 80 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 Will be centimeters away 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.040
 Still if millions of years pass 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.470
 Thousands of people are used between the two continents 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.470
 doing 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.400
 The geology that was not covered by the people who went to the plate 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.430
 It has been less than the goal since the birth of a scholar agency 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 The same cm is to control various institutions involved from the New Year coast 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.840
 It starts from 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.280
 We can find out what matches the features 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 The site has been viewed / edited 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.440
 I went down the new city throne 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.110
 It's like hitting a child 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.510
 It is technical and very careful 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.499
 In consideration of every trace 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.499
 Trying to 6,000 continents 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.900
 More than 1 billion years ago 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.900
 The shape of the continent is rising 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.729
 It was a time when huge confrontation was finished 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.309
 One billion years ago 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.609
 Self-proclaimed war 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.759
 At the meeting the slack is gone and in a state 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.439
 Superpower was born 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.439
 At the same time 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.159
 Locations that hit the United States, which was the current task, are one after another 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.159
 was 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.739
 There was a big difference around it 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.069
 But at the same time it was different from the current continent
