00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.190
 good morning, I will all teach 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.779
 preparing a lemon sponge is worth the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 lemon sponge cake is the typical sponge cake 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.330
 which is used for everything first 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.520
 let's have 4 eggs the zest 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.980
 of lemon this you know the lemon the 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.650
 Peel the root with a yeast grater 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.090
 it looks like this chemical yeast I think for 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.610
 the cake I have not made raised the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.020
 baker because much oil is increased 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.000
 of sunflower there are people who milk oil 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.699
 olive and the fact of sunflower because the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 olive oil is very strong a yogurt 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.980
 of lemon flour and sugar this is people 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.290
 that says not first I'm going to mix the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.030
 eggs with flour I do not because everything 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.730
 this goes together you know it takes the same thing 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.520
 egg flour 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.989
 then as I see it silly me 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.870
 what I take is to throw everything we throw the 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.000
 yogurt the lemon zest 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.100
 the glass of yogurt you have to have there 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.239
 because there are practically we will leave the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.019
 measurements 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 we take the eggs 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.970
 so we shell four eggs 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.830
 It also depends on the size of the cake 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.830
 this for example from 4 eggs 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.680
 the sugar the sugar depends on the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.570
 people are worth me for example there are people 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.299
 who like more sweet less sweet 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.780
 because that depends is made from 1 to 2 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.210
 glasses 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.860
 then of yogurt this you have to 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.490
 take with the measure of the same yogurt 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.909
 then I'm going to take one and a half 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.330
 not a minor but a means and with this 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.330
 same 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.479
 Now here we add the flour 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.159
 oil of the last thing that we will throw for 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.990
 try to avoid being cut 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.049
 poquillo and not cut but 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.659
 so that we can give ourselves work then 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.670
 we take the flour 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.620
 and with the same measure of the glass of yogurt 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.570
 we will do it then 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.780
 here you see that it is very easy and very fast 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.820
 take the same glass of yogurt and throw 4 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.680
 of flour there are people who are there my 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.750
 I do not know what happened to me because as a smoothie 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.780
 I'm not going to complicate sifting 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.780
 thing that I'm going to beat after the right 4 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.560
 3 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.660
 and 4 I always take the measure of the glass of 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.810
 yogurt 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.840
 so this if you throw a glass of 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.880
 oil is practically the same 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.410
 measure does not matter a little more 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.300
 little less no matter 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.470
 then we throw the oil 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.110
 by last 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.480
 we cast yeast now we take 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.159
 our blender 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.959
 we chew the yeast 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.760
 chemical yeast is not yeast 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.010
 yeast 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.629
 chemistry 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.629
 and now to beat 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.390
 and when I have beaten all that effort 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.750
 how the dough goes because this takes a 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.120
 little bit 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.900
 the market has the consistency of a 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.850
 studied mass can be beaten a 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.500
 for example, you can not beat with 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.330
 those that have two blades is that 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.730
 not be looking for the truth because it is 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.970
 where I have it with better this with the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.970
 mixer 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.580
 then also not like that 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.580
 will complicate with a blender 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.150
 and this would be already the mass of the sponge cake 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.280
 so now what we are going to do is 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.810
 with a clean spoon we will clean 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.459
 this 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.849
 we must take advantage of all the masses 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.849
 possible 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.940
 two 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.610
 and now what we will do 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 will prepare the mold now 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.200
 this is a mold that opens this strip 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.760
 from here it overflows easily is one of 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.959
 the best molds because it takes too long 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.209
 fast then what it does with a 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.400
 You spoon yourself a little 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.680
 butter is worth it and you are well 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.800
 hands I'll see the one below so 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.009
 wash it well because this 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.139
 if you have to give the butter with the 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.940
 hand because if you start doing it with 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.460
 a language the truth that you are going to throw 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.540
 a week then what it does is 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.340
 well throw well on all sides 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.870
 I have already put the oven before 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.060
 heat to 210 degrees is worth it because it has 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.090
 to be half hot and then 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.270
 Now what we will do is incorporate 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.910
 you see everything is fine with good 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.120
 Butter 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.800
 Now with a spoon choose if you have 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.260
 a language you do with a language that 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.920
 I dreamed about what you have and I gave you 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.920
 this to the mold 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.230
 You see, we have already dumped the dough 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.300
 mold now what we do in putting it in 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.210
 the oven that I have put it to heat 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.600
 at 110 degrees ok there are people who put it 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.910
 to 560 to 180 that already as you will see I put it 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.770
 to 210 but let's face it I'm going to put 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:35.100
 189 It feels like a lot of scab 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.290
 and it is already closed and left 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.600
 good and leave the cake one hour 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:45.190
 then what we do is take it out 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.190
 and unmold what 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:53.990
 You see the cake is already made then 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.240
 what you do is already dismantle 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.539
 so that it does not burn and we already have 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.599
 our cake you know how it 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:05.449
 check this when in the oven 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:08.330
 what they have to do is pinch him and 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:11.000
 the dry stick has to come out if not the 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.340
 sponge cake would be raw vale and then 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.879
 If it would lower you, you have to let it 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.310
 cook so that I get off now if I do not 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.860
 you want for a pie to be removed if you're 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.750
 you cut this part off and invited him 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.409
 this part and what you do on a plate 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:29.090
 with peach syrup lomo made a 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.069
 little bit and they turn it around so that 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.130
 absorb the cake the peach and that 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.630
 would be the cake of the cake is not worth 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.460
 forget to subscribe to my channel as you see 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.110
 this is a lemon sponge cake 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.260
 very rich I have not tried yet but it's 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:45.650
 very rich because he has already done many 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.760
 every week new videos of later by 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.670
 Asia 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.400
 You see, it's the sponge inside that 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.260
 do not fool the rib but this 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.740
 It's also good so do not forget 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.740
 also eat it but look at the sponge cake 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.740
 spongy
