00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
motivated to get drawings out quicker

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.100 
motivated to get drawings out quicker
what<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:35.760> doing<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.420> starting

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
what I'm doing here is just starting

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.010 
what I'm doing here is just starting
from<00:00:37.290> left<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> right<00:00:37.770> or<00:00:37.980> our<00:00:38.610> left<00:00:38.940> right<00:00:39.210> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
from left to right or our left right so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.260 
from left to right or our left right so
I'm<00:00:40.440> working<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.980> his<00:00:41.129> right<00:00:41.399> arm<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.879> just

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
I'm working on his right arm and just

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.330 
I'm working on his right arm and just
trying<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> folds<00:00:43.260> rubbed<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
trying to get the folds rubbed in and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.940 
trying to get the folds rubbed in and
start<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> build<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.329> from<00:00:45.480> there<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.960> found

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
start to build up from there I found

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.770 
start to build up from there I found
that<00:00:47.129> shading<00:00:47.550> fabric<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.180> really

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that shading fabric can be really

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.600 
that shading fabric can be really
tedious<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> way<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.250> surface

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
tedious because of the way that surface

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.290 
tedious because of the way that surface
goes<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:52.340> then<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.460> start<00:00:53.760> working<00:00:53.820> on

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
goes in and out then I start working on

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.279 
goes in and out then I start working on
a<00:00:54.360> different<00:00:54.600> spot

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
a different spot

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
a different spot
so<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> better<00:00:57.000> understanding<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so that I have a better understanding of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.270 
so that I have a better understanding of
what's<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.100> darker<00:00:59.430> areas<00:01:01.280> I'm

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
what's going on in the darker areas I'm

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.100 
what's going on in the darker areas I'm
kind<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> guessing<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.270> dark<00:01:03.629> area

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
kind of guessing what the dark area

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.350 
kind of guessing what the dark area
looks<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.489> more<00:01:05.760> things<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.119> draw

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
looks like but the more things I draw

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.170 
looks like but the more things I draw
around<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.200> easier<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.710> shade<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.180> go

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
around it because easier to shade I go

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.570 
around it because easier to shade I go
on<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.659> work<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.650> details<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.400> lower

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
on to work on the details of this lower

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
on to work on the details of this lower
chest<00:01:11.970> again<00:01:12.659> slowly<00:01:13.020> building<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> up

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100 

after<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.370> I<00:01:26.400> start<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> block<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.480> the<00:01:27.690> rifle

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
after that I start to block in the rifle

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.400 
after that I start to block in the rifle
that<00:01:28.320> he's<00:01:28.920> holding<00:01:29.190> I'm<00:01:30.120> not<00:01:30.510> worried<00:01:31.350> about

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
that he's holding I'm not worried about

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.010 
that he's holding I'm not worried about
all<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> details<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.550> are<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:33.810> right

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
all the details that are in there right

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.440 
all the details that are in there right
now<00:01:34.080> I'm<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:35.400> getting<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.790> basic<00:01:35.940> shapes

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
now I'm just getting the basic shapes

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.810 
now I'm just getting the basic shapes
and<00:01:36.690> adding<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> ten<00:01:37.320> slots<00:01:37.590> by<00:01:38.340> adding<00:01:38.700> these

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and adding the ten slots by adding these

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.630 
and adding the ten slots by adding these
things<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.510> can<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.110> an<00:01:40.230> idea<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.160> spacing

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
things I can get an idea of the spacing

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.130 
things I can get an idea of the spacing
on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.540> rifle<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:44.480> cross<00:01:45.480> over<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> other

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
on the rifle I cross over to the other

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.650 
on the rifle I cross over to the other
side<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.860> start<00:01:47.370> working<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.820> his<00:01:48.000> radio<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
side and start working on his radio and

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.560 
side and start working on his radio and
what<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> believe<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.650> is<00:01:49.950> uh<00:01:50.010> his<00:01:50.670> pocket

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
what I believe is it is uh his pocket

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.540 
what I believe is it is uh his pocket
flap<00:01:51.950> there's<00:01:52.950> subtle

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
flap there's subtle

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.520 
flap there's subtle
rippling<00:01:54.000> around<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.720> stitch<00:01:54.960> line<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.410> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
rippling around the stitch line so it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.950 
rippling around the stitch line so it
took<00:01:55.680> some<00:01:55.740> time<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> build<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.820> I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.359 

definitely<00:02:00.960> didn't<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.440> get<00:02:01.650> too<00:02:02.070> dark

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
definitely didn't want to get too dark

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.880 
definitely didn't want to get too dark
too<00:02:02.850> fast<00:02:03.150> I<00:02:03.479> also<00:02:04.080> have<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> keep<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.680> mind

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
too fast I also have to keep in mind

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.250 
too fast I also have to keep in mind
that<00:02:05.070> his<00:02:05.430> left<00:02:06.210> side<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:06.660> our<00:02:06.690> right<00:02:07.020> side

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
that his left side or our right side

training to split his head into two

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.610 
training to split his head into two
parts<00:03:39.210> then<00:03:40.210> I<00:03:40.240> work<00:03:40.510> on<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.930> top<00:03:41.170> portion<00:03:41.380> of

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.700 

once<00:03:52.090> I'm<00:03:52.300> okay<00:03:52.570> with<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:53.140> work<00:03:53.440> on<00:03:53.590> the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
once I'm okay with it I work on the

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.950 
once I'm okay with it I work on the
bottom<00:03:53.980> portion<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.760> mask<00:03:54.970> which<00:03:55.330> has<00:03:55.690> the

bottom portion of the mask which has the

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.340 
bottom portion of the mask which has the
skull<00:03:56.200> detail<00:03:57.240> and<00:03:58.240> I<00:03:58.660> wanted<00:03:58.960> to<00:03:59.050> do<00:03:59.170> this

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
skull detail and I wanted to do this

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.890 
skull detail and I wanted to do this
after<00:03:59.860> because<00:04:00.460> visually<00:04:01.210> it<00:04:01.420> should<00:04:01.750> be

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
after because visually it should be

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.920 
after because visually it should be
darker<00:04:02.650> than<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:02.950> actual<00:04:03.220> mask<00:04:03.550> now<00:04:04.540> since<00:04:04.780> I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
darker than the actual mask now since I

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.130 
darker than the actual mask now since I
have<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.260> mass<00:04:05.440> drawn<00:04:05.770> and<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.550> know<00:04:07.120> how<00:04:07.780> dark

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
have the mass drawn and I know how dark

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.260 
have the mass drawn and I know how dark
to<00:04:08.410> go<00:04:08.560> without<00:04:08.800> having<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.370> skull<00:04:09.880> detail

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
to go without having the skull detail

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.670 
to go without having the skull detail
disappear<00:04:12.270> once<00:04:13.270> I<00:04:13.420> shape<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.690> skull<00:04:14.080> I<00:04:14.290> fill

the lens of for the glasses I also added
some<00:04:19.390> eyes<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:20.109> show<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.650> lens<00:04:20.859> is

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
some eyes to show that the lens is

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.270 
some eyes to show that the lens is
somewhat<00:04:21.340> transparent<00:04:22.680> then<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:23.830> add<00:04:24.040> some

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
somewhat transparent then I add some

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
highlights with my white prismacolor

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.420 
highlights with my white prismacolor
pencil<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.770> gouache<00:04:27.070> I<00:04:28.800> take<00:04:29.800> another<00:04:30.160> break

so<00:04:30.730> that<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:30.940> can<00:04:31.180> judge<00:04:31.600> what<00:04:31.930> areas<00:04:32.380> needs<00:04:32.650> to

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
so that I can judge what areas needs to

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.800 
so that I can judge what areas needs to
be<00:04:32.919> reworked<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:34.060> know<00:04:34.180> just<00:04:34.390> going<00:04:34.510> over<00:04:34.690> the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
be reworked you know just going over the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.790 
be reworked you know just going over the
whole<00:04:35.080> image<00:04:35.290> again<00:04:36.330> darkening<00:04:37.470> some<00:04:38.470> areas

and lightening some areas just depending

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.510 
and lightening some areas just depending
on<00:04:42.070> what<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:43.030> think<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.390> image<00:04:43.630> should<00:04:43.780> be<00:04:44.520> well

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
on what I think the image should be well
