00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello culeros I'm big 17 today I bring you 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.799
 a creepy pasta created by me 100% 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.750
 it's my first so if they find it 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.080
 see what I'll do next 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.330
 well let's get serious everything started 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 a few weeks a friend and I went to a 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.080
 around here to buy 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.210
 videogames of those that we say are not 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.189
 originals and we go quietly 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 walking buying new games and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.539
 others when we had already bought everything 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.279
 what we needed was towards a 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.289
 Something weird out of the way 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.480
 we had gone but we were closer 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.579
 so we went by the way to the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.559
 out we saw a rather odd position had 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.719
 eighties movies and other things 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.510
 old but what caught our attention 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.730
 it was that they sold videogames had games 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 something old, very ugly, so I did not see him 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.690
 importance so I walked away on that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 when I was going to get away from there my friend 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.309
 He stops me and shows me a game and I see 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.140
 what is the resident evil 6 I stayed 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.510
 amazed since the game still 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.340
 there were a few months left to go out there 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.469
 I take it and ask the seller how 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.149
 he got it the seller was something 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.110
 old but he said he got it 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.700
 direct from japan 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.890
 I was astonished 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.899
 I saw the box and the cover appeared something 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.030
 edited and bad done but I said poor 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.259
 old to buy the game as my 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.969
 friend no longer had money 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.740
 I had to buy it since in the post 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.810
 there was only one copy so what 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.700
 we bought and we left there already 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.409
 coming home my friend stayed for 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.420
 try that record that we did not believe that 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.579
 will work since the new consoles do not 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.590
 support so many or so easy games 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.659
 edited by third parties so we 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.610
 We were expecting one can not read the disk 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.159
 it is not compatible but for our 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.229
 surprise if it worked to see that it started to 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.179
 load we thought it would be someone else 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.399
 resident but after the signs of 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.500
 capcom put on the sign of resident 6 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.720
 seeing that my friend and I got excited 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.970
 as we could not believe it anymore 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.099
 we had the game before anyone else in that 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.140
 we calmed down, we started to play 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.209
 at that moment something strange happened not 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.489
 he heard the classic macabre voice that says 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.770
 the name of the game but only a music 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:00.689
 something depressing for my taste to start 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.819
 the game only came the modality of 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.470
 campaign it was strange to me but I thought that 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.659
 just being connected to live me 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.700
 would allow to see the other options but 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.950
 since the game still did not come out I did not 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.150
 I wanted to connect to avoid bans like that 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 what I gave him in the campaign 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.769
 with two difficulties but I could not 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.540
 read since they came in Japanese I did not know 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.310
 what to do since they could be easy and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.530
 normal or normal and veteran and me 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.909
 I always liked to choose normal so 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.920
 that I just squeezed in two options 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.930
 hoping it was normal in that it 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.879
 He heard a tiny laugh like a 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.829
 girl but it was too low so 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.569
 I thought it had been imagination already 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.489
 starting we got to choose the 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.470
 characters it was weird they came out 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.720
 characters from various game sagas 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.730
 but I did not take it for granted because for 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.980
 my friend found it fascinating so 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.930
 I also saw it so I chose the lion and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.940
 my friend to jill valentine how weird was 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.920
 that the characters were not seen 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.019
 faces but for his body and name was 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.329
 obvious who were already starting to play 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.430
 the game put us immediately in the 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.260
 raccoon city streets without video 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.389
 introduction or anything was done to us 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.310
 weird but we still keep playing 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.200
 in that we put the characters to 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.420
 walk through those classic streets of 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.459
 night with burning cars and others but 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.230
 the weird thing is that we did not see anything did not come out 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.269
 people or zombies so just 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.220
 we walked together since we only had 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.349
 our knives we walk about 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.569
 minutes then my friend gets into a 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.159
 alley to see if he found any weapon 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.079
 or something and you meet a girl who 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.389
 he was on his back with black hair and a 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.219
 white suit the character of my friend 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.590
 He starts talking but the bad thing is that he does not 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.389
 we understood nothing while it happened that my 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.639
 character stayed still on the street 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.799
 open still but how I thought they were going 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.510
 to talk nothing would happen in that as not 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.040
 we knew what the girl said 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.560
 we press next until 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.510
 the dialogue ended the girl after we 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.950
 the modality of choosing as if 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.169
 he would have asked us something 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.180
 apparently they were three answers or 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.400
 options we did not know what to do if that 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.989
 we only gave it to the first one just after 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.909
 If she did, the girl throws herself 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.889
 soil begins to cry and gets into a 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.689
 hole that was there in that zombies 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.639
 they came out of nowhere and approached 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.919
 slowly to my character that still 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.870
 it is immobile I started to despair 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.790
 since I did not want to stay in that state 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.650
 and they will kill me just when they were going to 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.359
 surround we could move and ran 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.310
 towards the hole where the 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.290
 girl for this point we were already 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.540
 beginning to give some fear and we 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.729
 I was doing something similar to silent 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.859
 hill but we still play already 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.630
 inside the tunnel they only saw each other 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.310
 our characters crawled and 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.110
 they dragged until we saw a 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.330
 small light and we go out there arrives 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.250
 to a kind of church we 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.590
 we impressed since the graphics were 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.389
 brutal and very realistic we walk towards 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.340
 the center of the church to see if 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.229
 we saw something or we found some 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.389
 object in that we hear crying to the 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.729
 girl below the church we open 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.979
 a door and we begin to lower everything 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.169
 it was dark again you could only see 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.789
 where we were walking arriving at 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.800
 basement we see the girl running and 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.810
 hide behind a box we 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.460
 we approach there and my character moves the 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.620
 box and the girl is let go to my 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.599
 character the cai my friend kicks her in 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.819
 that the girl gets up and starts us 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.620
 speak English which we surprised us 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.509
 enough already with what we knew of 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.310
 English we already understood better what we 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.139
 she said she told us that we have 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.210
 got into a damn game made by 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.460
 some demented programmers and that 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.259
 who would play us crazy 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.300
 we were surprised that a character 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.310
 I said that kind of thing in that 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.139
 I got scared and I told my friend that 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.090
 I wanted to play in my friend he told me that 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.490
 it was the worst thing that a videogame could 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.560
 make me fill with intense fear but 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.479
 we keep playing at that the girl we 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.000
 question are sure they want 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.950
 continue I had to put that if in 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.600
 that from behind our characters 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.670
 in some monsters and throw us to the ground 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.350
 our characters take it from 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.840
 above but we see that there are small 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.880
 cut in our real arms in 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.980
 that moment I got scared and disconnected 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.050
 console but nothing happened I was surprised and 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.850
 the girl started to laugh I wanted to go 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.490
 of the place but the door was closed 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.140
 and I could not open it so I just put myself 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.330
 in a corner and cover my ears 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.220
 friend kept playing I saw him in moments 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.320
 and in moments I turned around I do not know how 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.300
 I could keep playing I watched as his clothes 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.490
 it was tearing I was having more and more 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.990
 cut in that my parents come back to 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.300
 home and at that time everything is 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.520
 reassures I see my arm and I had nothing 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.560
 the door opened I was glad of it what 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.270
 bad was when I came back was my friend 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.610
 it was without scratches but totally 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.680
 motionless with control in the hands and the 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.780
 console off I went up and saw that 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.490
 I had a frightened face without pupils I 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.050
 I called my parents and they went up to see what 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.520
 happened my parents called the 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.740
 relatives of my friend and the 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.110
 paramedics once there I told them what 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.060
 happened nobody believed me and what happened 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.370
 they sent to a madhouse and my friend now 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.290
 is in a permanent coma I receive 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.180
 this from here and always at night it 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.040
 He heard a girl laugh and I feel 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.910
 who are watching me, we just have to wait until 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.740
 come for me 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.450
 well that has been all forgiveness for the 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.520
 lack of originality of more defects 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.530
 but as I said, it's my first crepe and 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.810
 pasta so be patient that in 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.460
 the next will improve subscribe is for 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.920
 see the other crepe and pasta that 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.370
 I'll make goodbye and biz 17 until the 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.370
 next
