a<00:01:51.179> very<00:01:51.479> similar<00:01:51.840> effect<00:01:52.460> however<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:54.079> unit<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
a very similar effect however a unit of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.649 
a very similar effect however a unit of
the<00:01:56.070> vista<00:01:56.909> belt<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.539> not<00:01:57.600> equivalent

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
the vista belt is not equivalent

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.919 
the vista belt is not equivalent
the<00:01:58.780> unit<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.439> unit<00:01:59.469> of<00:02:00.039> handler<00:02:00.999> so<00:02:01.719> we

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
the unit the unit of handler so we

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.279 
the unit the unit of handler so we
generally<00:02:02.319> has<00:02:03.069> to<00:02:03.249> make<00:02:03.429> that<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:04.359> 50<00:02:05.319> units<00:02:05.710> of

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
generally has to make that a 50 units of

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.789 
generally has to make that a 50 units of
Vista<00:02:08.289> belt<00:02:08.500> have<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.220> same<00:02:09.489> effect<00:02:10.000> as<00:02:10.799> 125

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
Vista belt have the same effect as 125

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.070 
Vista belt have the same effect as 125
units<00:02:12.610> as<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.480> learn

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
units as you learn

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.910 
units as you learn
okay<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:14.769> conversion<00:02:15.670> ratio<00:02:16.239> is<00:02:16.840> 50<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:18.690> 125

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
okay so conversion ratio is 50 to 125

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.380 
okay so conversion ratio is 50 to 125
okay<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.310> they're<00:02:21.489> equivalent

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
okay so they're equivalent

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.630 
okay so they're equivalent
all<00:02:23.049> right<00:02:23.319> they<00:02:23.830> just<00:02:23.860> made<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.549> a

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
all right they just made it in a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.970 
all right they just made it in a
different<00:02:24.819> way<00:02:25.060> companies<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.080> measure<00:02:26.349> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
different way companies and measure the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.369 
different way companies and measure the
units<00:02:27.400> in<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.700> different<00:02:28.030> way<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:29.110> these

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
units in the different way so these

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.990 
units in the different way so these
