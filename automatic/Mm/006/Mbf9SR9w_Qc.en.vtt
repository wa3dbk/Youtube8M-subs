00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.713
 You read the title of this episode 

00:00:01.713 --> 00:00:02.831
 Know what this video is about. 

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:04.682
 So mature, my mom told me 

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.203
 You should try everything in your life, baby. 

00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:07.898
 If you don't like it, don't have to eat 

00:00:07.898 --> 00:00:09.274
 But you should try it 

00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:11.850
 Obviously my aging mother is a coquettish black lady. 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.708
 Anyway, this is a good suggestion because 

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:15.624
 Encourage me to try a lot of things that I won't do easily 

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:17.968
 Especially like sushi, eventually become 

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:19.240
 One of my favorite foods 

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:21.602
 Unfortunately, no amount of advice is not enough. 

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.261
 Let me try the following food, you will understand what I am talking about 

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:26.696
 Here is the world's weird top ten food 

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:28.554
 Fried brain sandwich 

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:31.316
 Maybe with Italian red wine and this dish 

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:34.478
 This dish made with the calf's brain is very popular. 

00:00:34.478 --> 00:00:37.748
 El Salvador and earlier United States in Mexico 

00:00:37.748 --> 00:00:39.664
 The brain has a soft texture 

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.222
 The taste is light, so it is highly recommended 

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:44.919
 Use a lot of sauce to increase the taste 

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.787
 I have a problem, the guy who invented this dish. 

00:00:46.787 --> 00:00:47.678
 How disgusting can I come up with this idea? 

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:48.677
 Think about it, really 

00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:50.430
 No matter who you are, you just have to think about it. 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.613
 Those zombie movies, because those are 

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:54.331
 It’s enough for you to be disgusting for a while. 

00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:55.319
 This is not very healthy. 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:56.841
 Raw stone mountain 

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:58.443
 Matt, why are nausea so sick? 

00:00:58.443 --> 00:00:59.858
 Ok, you can see from the photo 

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:01.808
 Raw rock mountain is not oyster 

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:03.701
 In fact, this is just a name 

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:05.745
 In fact, he is a fried testicle. 

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:08.367
 These testes come from bulls, yaks, wild boars. 

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.026
 They are very popular in parts of Canada and the United States. 

00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:12.721
 They are peeled, cooked, rolled into flour 

00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:13.882
 Then fried 

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:16.099
 Add mixed cocktail sauce when you eat 

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:17.865
 (swallowing water) cocktail 

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:19.501
 Seriously, finish this food 

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:21.820
 How much material is needed 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.843
 Can it be made? 

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:24.562
 You have to have enough courage 

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:25.898
 Get the testicles of the bull 

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.815
 Sorry, I still want to eat tonight. 

00:01:29.563 --> 00:01:30.747
 The next one is called a duck egg 

00:01:30.747 --> 00:01:33.568
 Oh, this stuff. 

00:01:33.568 --> 00:01:36.030
 Popular in the Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.223
 Hairy duck eggs are cooked eggs or duck eggs 

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.911
 Inside is the embryo that has been basically formed 

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:43.122
 Equivalent to their hot dogs 

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:44.569
 Concentrated sales in the city 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.670
 You know, I am a omnivorous animal. 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.726
 But this stuff makes me almost 

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:50.717
 a vegetarian 

00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:52.260
 Fried spider 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.170
 Oh God, no 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.389
 Give me this, I would rather die. 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.269
 We are finished, the video can't be done. 

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:59.243
 Let's hurry up this paragraph. 

00:01:59.243 --> 00:02:01.367
 Very popular in Cambodia, fried spider 

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:03.189
 But a delicious treat 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.966
 Can talk about selling or talking about heap selling 

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.487
 Eat up like french fries 

00:02:06.487 --> 00:02:07.532
 Ok, next 

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:08.428
 Raw frog 

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:11.060
 It’s not easy to be evergreen. 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.120
 This is a bad impression 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.948
 In Japan, raw, skinned frogs are popular foods. 

00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:16.329
 If this is not new to you, 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.708
 Some chefs directly open the live frog 

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.810
 Then put the heart of the heartbeat in front of you. 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.772
 For immediate consumption 

00:02:22.772 --> 00:02:24.745
 Believe it or not, this is 

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:25.669
 Popular in many areas 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.956
 After that, oh, appetizer 

00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:30.231
 The entire frog saved 

00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:32.414
 On a plate and served with raw seafood 

00:02:32.414 --> 00:02:33.303
 Delicious 

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:35.882
 Seriously, who doesn't want to come to a heart that is still beating? 

00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:39.237
 It’s better than the witch doctor in the Raiders. 

00:02:39.237 --> 00:02:43.265
 Karima Karima 

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:46.701
 Karima 

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:47.307
 Interesting? 

00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:48.081
 Rotten shark meat 

00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:50.136
 Very popular in Iceland, Haka Road is made up of 

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:51.843
 Take out the internal organs of the basking shark 

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:54.338
 Let him ferment for 2-4 months 

00:02:54.338 --> 00:02:56.277
 Until ammonia is produced 

00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:57.938
 This is delicious all year round. 

00:02:57.938 --> 00:02:59.737
 He is often placed in a tube of toothpaste 

00:02:59.737 --> 00:03:01.176
 Oh, really, just a little? 

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:02.441
 Really disappointing 

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:04.762
 I am also looking forward to a large piece of ammonia. 

00:03:04.762 --> 00:03:06.603
 Fermented shark meat 

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.360
 (hiccup) 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.839
 Puffer fish 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.389
 Puffer fish is explained in Japanese as a poisonous fat fish 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.687
 This fish carries a lot of toxins 

00:03:12.687 --> 00:03:15.264
 Only specially trained and experienced chefs 

00:03:15.264 --> 00:03:16.120
 Can make this dish 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.059
 The strange thing is that some chefs will 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.102
 a small amount of toxin left in the fish 

00:03:20.102 --> 00:03:23.074
 This causes lips and tongue 

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:23.980
 Have a feeling of being shackled 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.674
 It’s too strange for me, this fish is not 

00:03:25.674 --> 00:03:27.961
 It is said to be very dangerous, why take risks 

00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:30.120
 Go eat, know that you can die 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.558
 Or at least may be poisoned 

00:03:32.558 --> 00:03:36.303
 Hey, buddy, I think he has poisoned the fish too much. 

00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:37.631
 Casumasu cheese 

00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.123
 Matt, isn't this a bread pudding? 

00:03:39.123 --> 00:03:42.885
 No, this is a lot of activity in goat milk. 

00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:43.429
 good to eat 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.020
 Found in Sardinia, Italy 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.682
 Translucent aphids are added to the cheese 

00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:49.141
 Help with fermentation 

00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:50.220
 How can someone do this? 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.086
 This is really a disgusting thing. 

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:55.661
 Add a bunch of bugs before eating the cheese 

00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.227
 Yes, yes, some people like to join bugs. 

00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:00.130
 Not even 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.023
 Oh God, I don't eat bugs, let them go. 

00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:02.963
 Bullwhip 

00:04:02.963 --> 00:04:04.240
 This can speak for himself 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.283
 Very popular in Beijing, China, is considered 

00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:08.187
 Is a good medicine to stimulate sexual desire 

00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:10.602
 Or call it, big bullwhip 

00:04:10.602 --> 00:04:12.529
 Think of such a big bullwhip 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.280
 It should work for you, at least the locals think so. 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.184
 And worth a few hundred dollars 

00:04:17.184 --> 00:04:19.726
 This is not for food. 

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:22.386
 Many restaurants treat him as an animal genitalia. 

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:24.464
 Almost everyone can enjoy 

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:26.447
 There is still a problem here, who is coming out? 

00:04:26.447 --> 00:04:28.642
 Treat animal chickens as food? 

00:04:28.642 --> 00:04:31.266
 Someone went to the hotel to ask the owner 

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:33.867
 I want to eat a chicken, the owner said that this idea is good. 

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:34.945
 Thank you 

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:36.501
 Finally, tuna eyeballs 

00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:39.206
 A supermarket in Japan was found to be about $1 

00:04:39.206 --> 00:04:41.285
 This eyeball is muscled 

00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:43.838
 Surrounded by fish and eaten almost like octopus 

00:04:43.838 --> 00:04:45.626
 Very weird, I can’t help thinking 

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:46.765
 He tastes like tuna 

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:48.505
 Cooked after seasoning 

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:50.745
 It is a very common food for everyone. 

00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:52.412
 You know, except for the food I showed you. 

00:04:52.412 --> 00:04:53.771
 This didn't make me feel sick. 

00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.839
 In fact, I think it's not bad. 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.117
 I have a problem 

00:04:56.117 --> 00:04:58.878
 That kind of tuna has such a big eyeball 

00:04:58.878 --> 00:05:01.118
 Is there such a big tuna in Japan or elsewhere? 

00:05:01.118 --> 00:05:03.712
 This is like scooping up Godzilla’s eyeballs. 

00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:04.219
 Hell 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:05.681
 Ok, this is today's content, friends. 

00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:07.017
 I want to share with you. 

00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:08.561
 I hope that you are not affected. 

00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:10.361
 At least you have learned something, aren't you? 

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:11.776
 See you next Saturday. 

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:13.042
 Take my new video 

00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:15.872
 calm 

00:05:15.872 --> 00:05:17.334

 If you have already done this 

00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:29.940
 Then go out and find something to eat. 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.214
 I believe that your appetite must be good now. 

00:05:32.214 --> 00:05:34.373
 You know, I probably don't want to eat seafood. 

00:05:34.373 --> 00:05:37.555
 You know, yeah, 

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:40.358
 This will make everything vomit
