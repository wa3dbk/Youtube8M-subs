00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.800 
and kind of a kind of flex are more
creative<00:01:21.280> juices<00:01:21.790> in<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:22.270> different<00:01:22.600> way<00:01:22.690> and

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
creative juices in a different way and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.180 
creative juices in a different way and
everybody's<00:01:23.200> been<00:01:23.380> really<00:01:23.560> really<00:01:23.800> into<00:01:24.160> it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
everybody's been really really into it

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.010 
everybody's been really really into it
when<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.760> talk<00:01:24.970> about<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.450> like<00:01:25.660> with<00:01:25.840> like

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
when you talk about that like with like

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.990 
when you talk about that like with like
for<00:01:26.290> example<00:01:26.350> with<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:26.920> control<00:01:27.310> scheme<00:01:27.460> yeah

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
for example with the control scheme yeah

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.030 
for example with the control scheme yeah
so<00:01:28.240> overall<00:01:28.750> like<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.080> biggest<00:01:29.350> departure<00:01:29.950> I

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
so overall like the biggest departure I

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.130 
so overall like the biggest departure I
think<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.400> from<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.000> Mars<00:01:31.210> fundamentalist

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
think that from the Mars fundamentalist

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.140 
think that from the Mars fundamentalist
like<00:01:32.290> MK<00:01:32.650> players<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.520> they'll<00:01:33.700> notice<00:01:34.030> is

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
like MK players that they'll notice is

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.640 
like MK players that they'll notice is
that<00:01:34.180> we<00:01:34.360> don't<00:01:34.480> have<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:34.720> blockbuster<00:01:35.290> anymore

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
that we don't have a blockbuster anymore

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.860 
that we don't have a blockbuster anymore
now<00:01:36.100> it's<00:01:36.340> kind<00:01:36.580> of<00:01:36.640> flat<00:01:36.880> back<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.660> box

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
now it's kind of flat back to box

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.930 
now it's kind of flat back to box
another<00:01:38.800> thing<00:01:39.010> too<00:01:39.190> is<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.400> we<00:01:39.550> don't<00:01:39.700> have

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
another thing too is that we don't have

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.640 
another thing too is that we don't have
