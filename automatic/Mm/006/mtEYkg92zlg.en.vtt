if you want it to stay on go right into

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.609 
if you want it to stay on go right into
your<00:01:06.009> inner<00:01:06.280> rim<00:01:06.580> there<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:08.049> work<00:01:08.290> in<00:01:08.470> small

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
your inner rim there just work in small

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.780 
your inner rim there just work in small
sections<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:11.920> can<00:01:12.040> get<00:01:12.159> like<00:01:12.310> faction

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
sections so you can get like faction

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.300 
sections so you can get like faction
that's<00:01:12.939> a<00:01:13.000> smoky<00:01:13.329> effect<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.070> then<00:01:18.159> just

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
that's a smoky effect and then just

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.050 
that's a smoky effect and then just
smudge<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.790> excess<00:01:19.150> into<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.479> lash<00:01:19.659> line

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
smudge the excess into the lash line

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.249 
smudge the excess into the lash line
so<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> stand<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.350> more<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.890> think<00:01:24.259> contouring

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so I stand out more I think contouring

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.360 
so I stand out more I think contouring
was<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> lost<00:01:25.740> art

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
was a lost art

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.280 
was a lost art
it's<00:01:27.880> kind<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.090> like<00:01:28.150> rediscovered<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.110> I

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
it's kind of like rediscovered it I

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.140 
it's kind of like rediscovered it I
guess<00:01:29.590> I<00:01:29.740> think<00:01:29.980> it's<00:01:30.130> old-fashioned<00:01:30.880> cuz

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
guess I think it's old-fashioned cuz

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.030 
guess I think it's old-fashioned cuz
people<00:01:31.510> kind<00:01:31.720> of<00:01:31.780> went<00:01:32.110> away<00:01:32.230> with<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.590> cheek

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
people kind of went away with the cheek

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.820 
people kind of went away with the cheek
emphasis<00:01:33.810> right<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.200> i<00:01:35.230> think<00:01:35.440> it's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
emphasis right and i think it's

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.560 
emphasis right and i think it's
old-fashioned<00:01:36.550> because<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.300> know<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.450> was

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
old-fashioned because you know it was

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.260 
old-fashioned because you know it was
like<00:01:37.660> an<00:01:37.810> 80s<00:01:38.200> or<00:01:38.530> 90s<00:01:38.590> thing<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.790> has<00:01:40.090> like

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
like an 80s or 90s thing and it has like

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.050 
like an 80s or 90s thing and it has like
kind<00:01:40.540> of<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.720> knock<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.890> a<00:01:41.920> triangular<00:01:42.400> and

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
kind of a knock on a triangular and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.110 
kind of a knock on a triangular and
harsh<00:01:43.570> yeah<00:01:44.230> i<00:01:44.620> think<00:01:45.550> what<00:01:45.790> they<00:01:45.910> were<00:01:46.000> doing

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120
