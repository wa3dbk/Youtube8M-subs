and when you get to the answer for the
eyes<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.980> don't<00:03:16.160> want<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.550> come<00:03:16.760> up<00:03:17.270> -<00:03:17.630> you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
eyes you don't want to come up - you

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.420 
eyes you don't want to come up - you
don't<00:03:18.080> want<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.410> do<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:18.709> I'm<00:03:18.920> going<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.130> do<00:03:19.280> it

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
don't want to do this I'm going to do it

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.350 
don't want to do this I'm going to do it
wrong<00:03:19.610> person<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.209> fix<00:03:20.450> it

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
wrong person and fix it

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.150 
wrong person and fix it
see<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:24.220> that's<00:03:25.220> no<00:03:26.140> that's<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:27.530> has<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.920> red

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
see that that's no that's this has a red

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.740 
see that that's no that's this has a red
circle<00:03:28.340> around<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.819> little<00:03:28.940> line<00:03:29.209> across<00:03:29.360> it

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:04:02.190 

fill<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.110> make<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.380> heavy

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:11.960 

see

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:26.659 

now<00:04:12.540> close<00:04:12.990> your<00:04:13.170> eye

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.189 

so<00:04:27.669> this<00:04:27.820> is<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.030> smooth<00:04:28.360> line<00:04:28.630> going<00:04:29.050> across

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
so this is a smooth line going across

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.379 
so this is a smooth line going across
the<00:04:29.590> top<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.100> joining<00:04:30.460> with<00:04:30.759> the<00:04:30.970> spoon<00:04:31.270> on

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
the top and joining with the spoon on

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:37.710 
the top and joining with the spoon on
the<00:04:31.509> side<00:04:32.639> look<00:04:33.639> at<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:37.150> have<00:04:37.300> an<00:04:37.479> eyebrow

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
the side look at it and have an eyebrow

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:55.610 
the side look at it and have an eyebrow
so<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:39.520> don't<00:04:39.729> have<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.150> do<00:04:40.300> much<00:04:40.509> normally

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:09.480 

feather<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:57.039> little<00:04:57.250> bit<00:04:57.460> so<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.180> doesn't

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:21.970
