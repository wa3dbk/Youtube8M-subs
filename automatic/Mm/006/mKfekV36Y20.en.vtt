especially to see all these new guys
coming<00:00:45.019> in<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:45.649> I<00:00:46.399> think<00:00:46.460> we've<00:00:46.730> bonded

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
coming in and I think we've bonded

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.939 
coming in and I think we've bonded
pretty<00:00:47.420> quickly<00:00:47.660> with<00:00:47.870> them<00:00:47.989> I<00:00:48.170> like<00:00:48.800> it

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
pretty quickly with them I like it

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.439 
pretty quickly with them I like it
because<00:00:49.039> a<00:00:49.280> lot<00:00:49.699> of<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.850> guys<00:00:50.000> on<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.300> team

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
because a lot of the guys on the team

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.759 
because a lot of the guys on the team
are<00:00:50.510> new<00:00:50.719> here<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.019> we're<00:00:51.379> all<00:00:51.440> learning<00:00:51.559> a

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
are new here and we're all learning a

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.560 
are new here and we're all learning a
brand-new<00:00:51.890> system<00:00:52.489> so<00:00:52.730> we're<00:00:53.300> all<00:00:53.359> in<00:00:53.480> the

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
brand-new system so we're all in the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.779 
brand-new system so we're all in the
same<00:00:53.600> boat<00:00:53.780> together<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:54.590> it<00:00:54.980> kind<00:00:55.340> of<00:00:55.429> brings

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
same boat together so it kind of brings

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.459 
same boat together so it kind of brings
it<00:00:55.969> closest<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:56.660> team<00:00:56.839> because<00:00:57.109> we're<00:00:57.350> all

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
it closest to the team because we're all

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.130 
it closest to the team because we're all
in<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.250> same<00:00:58.280> situation<00:00:59.059> so<00:00:59.329> it<00:00:59.780> hasn't<00:00:59.960> been

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
in the same situation so it hasn't been

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.750 
in the same situation so it hasn't been
too<00:01:00.320> hard<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.559> transition<00:01:00.920> for<00:01:01.219> me<00:01:01.370> the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
too hard to transition for me the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.509 
too hard to transition for me the
transition<00:01:02.420> into<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.899> NCAA<00:01:03.289> game<00:01:03.980> will

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
transition into the NCAA game will

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.400 
transition into the NCAA game will
present<00:01:04.970> challenges<00:01:05.480> for<00:01:05.690> some<00:01:05.990> on<00:01:06.200> the

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
present challenges for some on the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.260 
present challenges for some on the
smaller<00:01:06.680> field<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.580> game<00:01:07.820> gets<00:01:08.060> more

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
smaller field the game gets more

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.840 
smaller field the game gets more
physical<00:01:08.689> out<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:08.960> feel<00:01:09.259> that<00:01:10.189> fuel<00:01:10.400> is<00:01:10.549> smaller

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
physical out I feel that fuel is smaller

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.569 
physical out I feel that fuel is smaller
it<00:01:11.150> gets<00:01:11.380> everything<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:12.680> just<00:01:12.770> sway<00:01:13.250> closer

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
it gets everything it's just sway closer

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.480 
it gets everything it's just sway closer
together<00:01:14.030> right<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.380> i<00:01:15.409> guess<00:01:15.890> like<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.310> just

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
together right so i guess like you just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.039 
together right so i guess like you just
have<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.790> make<00:01:16.970> adjustments<00:01:17.180> way<00:01:17.750> quicker

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
have to make adjustments way quicker

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.069 
have to make adjustments way quicker
than<00:01:18.259> a<00:01:18.320> canadian<00:01:19.009> game<00:01:19.220> like<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:20.659> not--

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
than a canadian game like it's not--

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.440 
than a canadian game like it's not--
there's<00:01:21.649> no<00:01:21.829> time<00:01:22.070> for<00:01:22.100> mistakes<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.000> game<00:01:23.270> is

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
there's no time for mistakes the game is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.700 
there's no time for mistakes the game is
a<00:01:23.479> little<00:01:23.750> bit<00:01:23.869> different<00:01:24.290> because<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.560> can

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
a little bit different because you can

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.469 
a little bit different because you can
control<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.250> ball<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.460> little<00:01:25.700> bit<00:01:25.909> longer<00:01:26.119> and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
control the ball a little bit longer and

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.899 
control the ball a little bit longer and
that's<00:01:27.290> where<00:01:27.649> turnovers<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.640> mental

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
that's where turnovers and mental

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.520 
that's where turnovers and mental
mistakes<00:01:29.270> can<00:01:29.479> really<00:01:29.869> hurt<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.229> because<00:01:30.409> if

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
mistakes can really hurt you because if

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.719 
mistakes can really hurt you because if
you<00:01:30.649> give<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:30.920> team<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.159> other<00:01:31.460> team<00:01:31.700> the

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
you give the team the other team the

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.940 
you give the team the other team the
ball<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.270> couple<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.960> times<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.409> game<00:01:33.590> for<00:01:33.920> all

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
ball a couple of times the game for all

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.060 
ball a couple of times the game for all
intents<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.490> purposes<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.180> over<00:01:35.450> but<00:01:36.070> you
