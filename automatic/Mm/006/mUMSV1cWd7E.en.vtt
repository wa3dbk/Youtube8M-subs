00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.529
 but guys who pass here I'm going 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.750
 miserable one and this time I bring you the 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.939
 location of a secret car that 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.400
 supposedly should not come out in the 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.829
 map but if it comes out in this case it's the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.020
 true faith ader that is the version of the 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.689
 bugatti veyron as you see is in this part 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.509
 of the map going down directly on the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.329
 Michael's house is parked 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.590
 in one of the stores out there in what 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.860
 would be the part of the area of 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.530
 riquillos of what the saints would be 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.170
 worry if you do not find the car in 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.270
 the personal when they look for the first 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.640
 time it came out but many say me 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.980
 there that does not come out and others told me 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.649
 not because it does not come out but if you give yourself a 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.329
 couple of laps more there if this car comes out 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.120
 effectively and should not 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.520
 worrying about that is hard to steal 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.469
 it is not very easy this one if there is not much 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.290
 people can do it this way 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.420
 stealthy this as I see the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.119
 character nothing else got off this is going to 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.070
 break the video it goes up it goes and ready and 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.360
 many people and it will be slow as the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.610
 people are going to start calling the police 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.020
 and that is a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.299
 in case you do not want to touch it and all that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.180
 but personally it goes very well and I tried 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.090
 this car is one of the fastest and 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.549
 this and apart from that this if you look at 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.190
 the list of prices costs one million 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.500
 of dollars so to find this 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.420
 author goes super well if they want a car 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.340
 fast not to play races with 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.590
 franklin in this case I gave it to 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.420
 michael no and as we can see in the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.430
 website they are selling it on 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.780
 the legendary motor sports as you see there 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.399
 says to see and costs a million dollars 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.560
 one of the good things about stealing it is 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.570
 that apart from that it 's free has the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.690
 painted racing lines so what 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.310
 can modify in the fair jumps and 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.780
 you can do all the prosecutors that 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.580
 want apart from it being faster 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.830
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.810
 as you can see it is very easy to get 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.880
 look for it and I'll see if I can bring them 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.580
 other cars more that are faster than 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.479
 this one you know 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.479
 or not
