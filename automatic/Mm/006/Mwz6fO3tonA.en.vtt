00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
free for all but I do believe that most

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
for this challenge at some point simply

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.239 
for this challenge at some point simply
because<00:00:59.629> black<00:00:59.929> ops<00:01:00.199> 2<00:01:00.469> tends<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:00.889> get<00:01:01.039> boring

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
because black ops 2 tends to get boring

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.520 
because black ops 2 tends to get boring
at<00:01:01.429> times<00:01:01.459> now<00:01:02.209> I<00:01:02.479> really<00:01:02.839> like<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.170> game<00:01:03.350> at

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
at times now I really like the game at

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.590 
at times now I really like the game at
all<00:01:03.649> but<00:01:03.859> a<00:01:03.889> mano<00:01:04.129> 43<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:04.879> seemed<00:01:05.180> that<00:01:05.329> there

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
all but a mano 43 it seemed that there

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.179 
all but a mano 43 it seemed that there
was<00:01:05.750> more<00:01:05.960> variety<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.920> know<00:01:07.009> obviously

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
was more variety you know obviously

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.800 
was more variety you know obviously
having<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.789> three<00:01:08.000> different<00:01:08.299> packages

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
having the three different packages

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.990 
having the three different packages
support<00:01:09.289> assault<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:09.950> specialist<00:01:10.610> was<00:01:10.789> good

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
support assault and specialist was good

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.149 
support assault and specialist was good
and<00:01:11.149> just<00:01:11.869> simply<00:01:12.229> having<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.680> Mobe<00:01:12.890> in<00:01:13.039> the

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
and just simply having the Mobe in the

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.800 
and just simply having the Mobe in the
game<00:01:13.430> was<00:01:13.909> enough<00:01:14.149> to<00:01:14.270> keep<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.570> interesting

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
game was enough to keep it interesting

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.929 
game was enough to keep it interesting
but<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.619> black<00:01:15.799> ops<00:01:16.009> 2<00:01:16.130> even<00:01:16.549> though<00:01:16.640> we<00:01:16.759> have

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
but in black ops 2 even though we have

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.609 
but in black ops 2 even though we have
zombies<00:01:17.450> there<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:17.810> play<00:01:18.020> when<00:01:18.200> we<00:01:18.289> get<00:01:18.439> bored

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
zombies there to play when we get bored

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.560 
zombies there to play when we get bored
of<00:01:18.740> multiplayer<00:01:19.219> it<00:01:19.460> just<00:01:20.030> seems<00:01:20.299> a<00:01:20.450> bit

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
of multiplayer it just seems a bit

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.840 
of multiplayer it just seems a bit
repetitive<00:01:20.930> at<00:01:21.350> times<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.219> one<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.549> best

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
repetitive at times so one of the best

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.880 
repetitive at times so one of the best
things<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:23.270> can<00:01:23.329> do<00:01:23.630> besides<00:01:24.079> prestiging<00:01:24.770> is

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
things you can do besides prestiging is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.649 
things you can do besides prestiging is
just<00:01:25.310> going<00:01:25.579> for<00:01:25.789> different<00:01:26.240> types<00:01:26.420> of

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
just going for different types of

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.959 
just going for different types of
challenges<00:01:26.960> as<00:01:27.439> you<00:01:27.680> play<00:01:27.950> now<00:01:28.579> something

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
challenges as you play now something

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.429 
challenges as you play now something
that<00:01:29.119> I<00:01:29.149> found<00:01:29.479> really<00:01:29.600> interesting<00:01:29.869> about

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
that I found really interesting about

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.929 
that I found really interesting about
this<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.039> fact<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.700> strategy

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
this is the fact that the strategy

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.669 
this is the fact that the strategy
involved<00:01:32.719> and<00:01:32.899> going<00:01:33.140> for<00:01:33.320> this<00:01:33.439> challenge

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
involved and going for this challenge

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.800 
involved and going for this challenge
really<00:01:34.429> seems<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:35.030> be<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.299> best<00:01:35.570> overall

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
really seems to be the best overall

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.830 
really seems to be the best overall
strategy<00:01:36.619> for<00:01:36.829> free<00:01:37.039> for<00:01:37.250> all<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.600> really<00:01:38.600> you

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
strategy for free for all and really you

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.450 
strategy for free for all and really you
would<00:01:38.990> think<00:01:39.259> that<00:01:39.380> lethal<00:01:39.829> kill<00:01:40.039> streaks<00:01:40.310> are

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
would think that lethal kill streaks are

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.130 
would think that lethal kill streaks are
the<00:01:40.549> best<00:01:40.789> way<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.060> go<00:01:41.299> because<00:01:41.509> I'm<00:01:41.750> free<00:01:41.960> for

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
the best way to go because I'm free for

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.319 
the best way to go because I'm free for
all<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.380> only<00:01:42.679> goal<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:43.280> get<00:01:43.369> 30<00:01:43.759> kills<00:01:44.119> as

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
all the only goal is to get 30 kills as

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.630 
all the only goal is to get 30 kills as
fast<00:01:44.539> as<00:01:44.749> possible<00:01:44.859> however<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.070> unfortunate

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
fast as possible however the unfortunate

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.069 
fast as possible however the unfortunate
fact<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.119> matter<00:01:47.149> is<00:01:47.390> that<00:01:47.509> I'm<00:01:47.689> free<00:01:47.899> for

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
fact of the matter is that I'm free for

all it can be quite hard to attain your
score<00:01:50.090> streaks<00:01:50.329> obviously<00:01:51.320> in<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.799> game<00:01:51.829> of

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
score streaks obviously in the game of

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.249 
score streaks obviously in the game of
like<00:01:52.310> domination<00:01:52.939> or<00:01:52.999> capture<00:01:53.359> the<00:01:53.479> flag<00:01:53.719> you

like domination or capture the flag you

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.109 
like domination or capture the flag you
can<00:01:54.469> get<00:01:54.619> capture<00:01:55.100> kills<00:01:55.369> not<00:01:55.579> really<00:01:55.939> gets

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
can get capture kills not really gets

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.399 
can get capture kills not really gets
you<00:01:56.210> up<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.390> your<00:01:56.450> streaks<00:01:56.780> quickly<00:01:57.200> if<00:01:57.289> you

because<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.590> will<00:02:26.920> oftentimes<00:02:27.250> get

because you will oftentimes get

double-teamed and really you it's hard

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.590

know obviously if you get double teams

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.130 
know obviously if you get double teams
that<00:02:33.580> puts<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.820> in<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> bad<00:02:34.090> situation<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:35.080> to
