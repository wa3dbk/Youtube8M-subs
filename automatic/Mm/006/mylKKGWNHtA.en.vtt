00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
average one so I'm going to use a little

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:05.130

I<00:05:20.760> would<00:05:21.330> definitely<00:05:21.900> suggest<00:05:22.140> just<00:05:22.590> going

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
I would definitely suggest just going

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.040 
I would definitely suggest just going
for<00:05:23.160> a<00:05:23.220> store-bought<00:05:23.610> mix<00:05:24.210> if<00:05:24.600> you<00:05:24.780> have<00:05:25.020> a

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
for a store-bought mix if you have a

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.350 
for a store-bought mix if you have a
bigger<00:05:25.350> family<00:05:25.680> because<00:05:26.340> it<00:05:26.790> doesn't<00:05:27.210> take

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
bigger family because it doesn't take

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.380 
bigger family because it doesn't take
taste<00:05:28.290> much<00:05:28.710> different<00:05:29.280> than<00:05:29.850> the

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
taste much different than the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.130 
taste much different than the
store-bought<00:05:31.100> very<00:05:32.100> little<00:05:32.490> difference<00:05:33.360> so

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
store-bought very little difference so

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.240 
store-bought very little difference so
is<00:05:34.320> a<00:05:34.350> $14<00:05:35.250> worth<00:05:35.520> it<00:05:35.820> it's<00:05:36.570> good<00:05:36.990> but<00:05:37.650> like<00:05:38.070> I

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
is a $14 worth it it's good but like I

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.160 
is a $14 worth it it's good but like I
said<00:05:38.310> if<00:05:38.670> it's<00:05:38.820> if<00:05:39.060> you<00:05:39.240> have<00:05:39.360> a<00:05:39.390> bigger<00:05:39.630> family

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
said if it's if you have a bigger family

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.510 
said if it's if you have a bigger family
I<00:05:40.200> would<00:05:40.440> suggest<00:05:40.620> going<00:05:40.980> with<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:41.340> more

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
I would suggest going with the more

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.460 
I would suggest going with the more
reasonable<00:05:41.880> route<00:05:42.210> or<00:05:42.450> making<00:05:43.170> them<00:05:43.320> by

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
reasonable route or making them by

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.820 
reasonable route or making them by
