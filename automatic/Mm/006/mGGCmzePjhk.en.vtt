00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that so the idea is mainly gonna be

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.289 
that so the idea is mainly gonna be
picking<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> cymbals<00:01:11.060> what<00:01:12.060> makes<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
picking up the cymbals what makes you

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.580 
picking up the cymbals what makes you
strum<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.659> cool<00:01:12.869> obviously<00:01:13.229> they're<00:01:13.439> made<00:01:13.560> out

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
strum so cool obviously they're made out

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.760 
strum so cool obviously they're made out
of<00:01:13.740> metal<00:01:13.890> they're<00:01:14.189> very<00:01:14.520> very<00:01:14.700> unusual<00:01:15.770> they
