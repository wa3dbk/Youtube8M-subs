because of that incident Roy it may be
all<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.379> hastened<00:02:16.890> people's<00:02:17.190> thinking

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
all that hastened people's thinking

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.259 
all that hastened people's thinking
about<00:02:17.730> whether<00:02:18.060> video<00:02:18.750> technology<00:02:20.150> we've<00:02:21.150> had

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
about whether video technology we've had

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.670 
about whether video technology we've had
this<00:02:21.390> discussion<00:02:21.599> before<00:02:21.900> yeah<00:02:22.230> we<00:02:22.319> all<00:02:22.440> agree

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
this discussion before yeah we all agree

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.240 
this discussion before yeah we all agree
with<00:02:22.830> that

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
with that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.830 
with that
there's<00:02:23.849> no<00:02:23.940> getting<00:02:24.180> away<00:02:24.239> from<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:24.720> this

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
there's no getting away from it but this

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.410 
there's no getting away from it but this
idea<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.319> our<00:02:25.530> early<00:02:25.769> me<00:02:26.220> robbed<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.849> they

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
idea that our early me robbed and they

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.570 
idea that our early me robbed and they
deserve<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.810> replay<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.860> we've<00:02:29.190> been<00:02:29.370> saying

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
deserve a replay but we've been saying

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.520 
deserve a replay but we've been saying
it<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:29.700> less<00:02:29.940> every<00:02:30.780> few<00:02:30.930> months<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.230> got<00:02:31.319> asked

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it for less every few months I got asked

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.410 
it for less every few months I got asked
about<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.040> say<00:02:32.190> yeah<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.970> has<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.150> come

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
about it and we say yeah it has to come

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.550 
about it and we say yeah it has to come
into<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.690> game<00:02:33.810> course<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.379> money

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
into the game course with the money

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.020 
into the game course with the money
involved<00:02:34.830> what's<00:02:35.250> at<00:02:35.430> stake

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
involved what's at stake

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.150 
involved what's at stake
I<00:02:36.060> think<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.230> Irish<00:02:37.470> supporters<00:02:37.590> probably

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
I think the Irish supporters probably

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.350 
I think the Irish supporters probably
deserve<00:02:38.370> better<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.700> think<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> manager

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
deserve better I think the manager

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.030 
deserve better I think the manager
probably<00:02:40.019> most<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.560> players<00:02:40.709> deserve

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
probably most of the players deserve

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.009 
probably most of the players deserve
better<00:02:41.220> but<00:02:41.519> I'm<00:02:42.209> not<00:02:42.269> sure<00:02:42.450> if<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.690> ideas<00:02:42.900> are

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
better but I'm not sure if the ideas are

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.460 
better but I'm not sure if the ideas are
better<00:02:43.400> what<00:02:44.400> goes<00:02:44.549> around<00:02:44.700> comes<00:02:44.849> around

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
better what goes around comes around

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.000 
better what goes around comes around
what<00:02:46.470> do<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> think<00:02:46.890> about<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.610> captain<00:02:48.030> from

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
what do you think about the captain from

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.160 
what do you think about the captain from
handling<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.269> think<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.329> was<00:02:51.420> his<00:02:51.510> instinct<00:02:51.959> I

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
handling I think it was his instinct I

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.630 
handling I think it was his instinct I
think<00:02:52.500> sometimes<00:02:52.799> you<00:02:52.860> do<00:02:52.980> go<00:02:53.280> for<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.489> ball

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
think sometimes you do go for the ball

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.009 
think sometimes you do go for the ball
you<00:02:53.849> see<00:02:54.000> your<00:02:54.120> Lego<00:02:54.299> your<00:02:54.540> hand<00:02:54.690> or<00:02:54.870> whatever

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
you see your Lego your hand or whatever

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.380 
you see your Lego your hand or whatever
it<00:02:55.200> might<00:02:55.319> be<00:02:55.380> what<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> call<00:02:56.640> him<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.849> cheap<00:02:57.060> no<00:02:57.360> I

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
it might be what I call him a cheap no I

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.490 
it might be what I call him a cheap no I
wouldn't<00:02:57.930> think<00:02:58.049> so

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
wouldn't think so

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.059 
wouldn't think so
I<00:02:58.530> think<00:03:00.380> did<00:03:01.380> he<00:03:01.440> bend<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.739> rules<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:02.040> little

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
I think did he bend the rules a little

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.380 
I think did he bend the rules a little
bit<00:03:02.280> yeah<00:03:02.459> but<00:03:02.640> we<00:03:02.700> see<00:03:02.849> cheat<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.180> good<00:03:03.299> on

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
bit yeah but we see cheat and good on

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.330 
bit yeah but we see cheat and good on

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
all the time in games players dive in

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.490 
all the time in games players dive in
