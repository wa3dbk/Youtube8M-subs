 safety but tools first at the cabinet i 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.260
 will never talk about diet it's about 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.779
 from them as I hear treatment 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.910
 which allows them to have vouchers

 minerals preserving what is 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.329
 interesting in the food we will support 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.030
 in food preference and there are plenty of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.160

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.660
 metric 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.129
 we will learn to manage the house 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.960
 they are not familiar with the outdoor meal 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.059
 we will learn after I will have a meal 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.719
 external or a wedding an invitation a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.219

 acupuncture mesotherapy and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.489
 locally what matters is the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.750
 well-being at home at the table while doing 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.880
 shopping by being invited

 you when you're very motivated through 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.240
 pnl and coaching I help you 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.830
 physical activity should be a pleasure 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.400
 it's an important lever that you do not need 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.700
 neglect 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.580
 there are also all these foods that a

 parent andric and train your health 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.170
 vitality and your misfortune because the thinness 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.720
 must rhyme with health is the form 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.150
 effortlessly weary 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.340
 it's not the weight it's greece 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.860
 have to lose fat and keep this 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.270
 muscular appearance when we take 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.970
 fast calories that you do often 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.899
 and have trouble avoiding doing so by the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.149
 false advertising 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.079
 too many calories comes from 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.820
 your faith and for the purposes 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.439
 insulin plays its prolific role and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.759
 love the calories in the cellar 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.350
 in fact it's like filling in 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.490
 your house after races you 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.560
 fill the pack from vienna and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.360
 when it's full costa ti excess 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.100
 the she has only but as the gallery 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.810
 goes too fast in the local times 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.200
 muscles and well some of your 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.610
 calories 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.530
 even if there are few 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.380
 will do live and will provoke 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.410
 unfortunately after the late morning 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.000
 so that we eat national show the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160
 blood sugar goes up the insulin did it 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.350
 go down so we're going to play cat between 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.230
 place I am arm and I have his bad 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.590
 idea alexandre the wand looks at his 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.330
 22 pieces of java sugar you take the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.010
 mag and recent or a piece of bread 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.520
 you have three four parts the sugar 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.050
 in the mouth 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.030
 why because it's no longer 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.620
 normal flour the industrial flour and 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.630
 it is no longer the May 20 of the journal 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.180
 here are some pictures that will help you 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.740
 highlight the pitfalls of 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.660
 daily consumption of products 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.220
 in each of the shutters 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.910
 look at the numbers of sugar that at 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.140
 the interior is amazing if you do not 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.989
 do not come to look like the picture he 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.730
 is where we will have to react and quickly 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.100
 react by taking normal calories 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.290
 these galleries that after ingestion to 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.959
 smart and moderate amount going on 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.680
 in the body but slowly so 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.670
 natural 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.980
 they will therefore fill two 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.900
 compartments once elected our closet on 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.360
 will say and so as they are going to be 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.030
 released slowly and slowly use 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.280
 and have a real exchange ever 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.350
 of excess never insulin ever from 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.780
 pathology at age 50 and never taken 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.519
 of weight a monstrous energy of this 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.250
 did admit hyper hypoglycemia 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.590
 all is well begin to appear from 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.450
 lotions of schedules to each food this 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.850
 laureate for example slow sugars years 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.500
 eat in the morning eventually evening 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.269
 overnight and the fast sugars get 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.459
 will take to taste we will have a small 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.620
 breakfast al English much more 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.820
 interesting anyway bend m departure 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.190
 at the beginning but days ensures that you 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.200
 do not let go when you get it 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.700
 a little nation having fun with what 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.459
 serves fable of sorting is that of 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.989
 mines and that is very very fragile and 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.269
 which is used to make serotonin 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.880
 she made in the body but for 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.549
 to enter the brain requires sugar 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.190
 and what good is it serves to have 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.350
 a zenitude at the end of the day so he 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.750
 must have thin skin and a taste 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.250
 little bit of this knot as much as that 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.110
 allows to manufacture melatonin which 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.940
 the neuromediators of the night it's 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.620
 neuromediators serotonin and but 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.560
 nathalie allows you to have 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.669
 a good day and taxes or if he 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.480
 ate absolute bad about the infection is 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.340
 to you 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.960
 you do not put the right proteins in 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.570
 the good time you have a fall of 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.120
 serotonin so happens the island of the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.240
 temptation of sweet bulimia compulsions 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.580
 tobacco is not all illustrated langoat 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.560
 and david sugar are due to the lack of 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.390
 serotonin sure and afterwards obviously 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.760
 sleeps bad bad idea 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.450
 to avoid that for example consume 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.920
 every day at 5am a square of chocolate 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.220
 that you let melt under the 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.170
 language 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.180
 the shock will have ceased the forerunner of the 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.670
 product it's the carrier and it's 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.930
 the finished product paralyzes them 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.910
 so when an internal report at the bottom 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.520
 products that in addition to tryptophan 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.990
 has 15 g of very protein 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.650
 interesting and easy to take at 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.480
 to taste then I come back on what we 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.420
 eat you eat sugars often 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.100
 fast to of course transform and 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.950
 avoid others fast to the benefit of 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.470
 slow sugars you eat the strikes and 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.720
 too much it's twice more 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.730
 caloric that sugars we are going of course 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.200
 with respect to the masters of the good fat at the 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.990
 early in the morning it's fat 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.350
 animal morning noon included afternoon 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.970
 two nights it is rather the vegetable fat 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.470
 you're eating protein they're 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.570
 present in animals they are 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.300
 currently plants the protein 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.370
 did not have calories it's a brick 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.980
 who builds at the tablecloth fabric at the beginning 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.910
 the hair and so that the brick can 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.650
 hold on the neighbor 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.650
 it takes physical activity in some 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.940
 so that's your sport they like and 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.950
 then we have some interesting products 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.900
 who can be associated at the level of 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.510
 breakfast snacks in the 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.220
 vegetable what is protein and dry 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.660
 eg peas do not know who 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.100
 is not protein and the potty broken 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.990
 dry and protein 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.180
 unfortunately in these elements ti 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.870
 vegetable proteins there are also some 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.730
 carbohydrates 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.100
 while there when we raise fat but 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.840
 almost exclusively in protein perceived 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.330
 put back on rails of three elements for 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.670
 advance properly and have a 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.020
 diet which especially does not do this 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.020
 that you see there on the screen 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.890
 what time to eat what's there 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.140
 where we go together in the morning and the 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.690
 noon it will be the hour of animal fat 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.600
 when their cheese gaps during the 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.120
 sausages avoid ham small 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.889
 cellophane surfaces take good 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.870
 Serrano cold cuts 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.759
 kind of things we like in the evening 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.919
 it is rather those who swim or those who 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:40.229
 actually steal what we eat in the evening 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.610
 can be eaten from midday but not the 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.259
 drop I may have the evening is 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.999
 those who swim what they want or 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.349
 those who grow and the morning of noon 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:48.110
 that's what on all fours and 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.340
 derived products such as cheese 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.469
 of course we will have vegetables at both 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.120
 meal and watch out the slow sugar does not get 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.860
 eat little in the morning and in the evening 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.180
 not from the south meanwhile tell me you 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.099
 go eat something very 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.479
 rich as a common sore 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.639
 sauerkraut truck costerousse anyway 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.150
 dish with rice or pasta 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.159
 potatoes 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.779
 you are going badly digested and where to have a 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:08.879
 Sufficiently enough raid aboard after 

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:11.460
 lunchtime if you eat meat 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:12.810
 Acute red or chicken vegetables with 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.610
 vegetable fish you will have a 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.860
 Afternoon powerful but rest assured you 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.590
 you 're not a case in the morning your 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.719
 slow sugars will provide the day but 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.490
 calories of course every time no there 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:26.370
 will rather have a little fruit to tap certainly 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.589
 basic and then we'll have a big fruit 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.759
 at 5 am with mostly my little square 

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:30.539
 of chocolate that is not bad to bring 

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:32.550
 serotonin 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.680
 so here's a day that's going on with 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.779
 animal fat in the morning of vegetable fat 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.159
 so be it and the fish and especially 

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.750
 replay gifts like buy 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:42.360
 how to cook to keep vitamins 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.189
 minerals and then energy in for 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.050
 not to have said perrin of hypoglycemia 

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:48.120
 in this day there is not too much 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.210
 background we have of course a meal 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.469
 pleasure one a week that will not interfere 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.539
 not at all wrong no weight and that is 

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:57.629
 necessary even in the initial phase for 

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:59.819
 able to allow the end of the month I 

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:01.680
 look after you in consultation 

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:03.409
 there are similarly movies and 

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.310
 slide shows and records that I would 

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:08.509
