 and today one of my subscribers for debt 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.540

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.590
 administrative responsibility for 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.879

 and the rules for using external 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.800

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.360
 but for the fact that he wants to help distant 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.009
 headlamp warning 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.420
 other road users about 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.430
 that on the road nearby 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.150
 settled the traffic police 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.290
 at the same time sales when employees traffic police 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.870
 stopped our transport 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.130
 facilities 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.060
 in my subscriber 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.199
 they became with lazio monk article 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.390
 un 13 point 20 of the administrative code 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:53.679

 oao envisioning 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:56.809
 I look also as a responsibility 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.749
 told the violation of the terms of use 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:01.390
 external lighting devices 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 and this article for such a violation 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.660
 envisaged 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.850
 responsibility as four 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.950
 warnings or overlays 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.240
 administrative fine 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.010
 in the amount of one hundred rubles 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.380
 the driver of the given situation 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.520
 so did not find that the third movie 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.600
 bringing on the traffic police table 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.150
 announced a warning 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.970
 oh by the way here's another proof 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.160
 the fact that he 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.390
 administrative code 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.830

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.729

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.759
 immediately what is called along the way means 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.410

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.930

 rules of the road and hiking 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.630
 compatible 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.009
 offense now she is listed 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.180
 let's figure out whether the traffic cop was right and 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.550
 in fact, that is, it means indicating that 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.550
 right are those who left violated requirements 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.530
 among 12 point is essentially code

 the start of the lower digits leads on 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.399
 car ta 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:16.659
 purely formal 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.339
 yes hello and seemingly suitable 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.319
 there is a strong 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.230

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:28.400
 they 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.900
 unreasonably

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.099
 except that he referred to the articles 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.609
 rub 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.269
 but tax is administrative 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.389
 offenses he also has to prove 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.759
 specific rental 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.769
 violations that is 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.510
 it should be either 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.799
 violations of any regulatory legal 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:03:59.540
 act either

 traffic rules like 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.769
 in this case 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:05.580
 yesterday 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.029
 which means ten more to say 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.379
 after you believe it 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.879

 nineteenth rules of the road 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.510
 which regulates early 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.229
 order of use 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.059
 in current light fixtures on 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:27.449
 car and what's most interesting in 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.219
 this paragraph nineteenth in general 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.490
 no prohibition is on 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.639
 winking high beam headlights 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.599
 so no truth 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.020
 responsibility for 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.050
 the fact that you will blink them far 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.099
 no headlights 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.509
 All claims are foreseen 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.679
 traffic police officer in this case 

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:48.659
 is absolutely illegal 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.670
 inside the most certainly interesting 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.020
 in the end, until the most fun to you 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.170
 need she 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.330
 we will answer the sinner over his advancement 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.120
 cognition code of administrative 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.029
 offenses the same 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:04.469
 you need to write a statement in 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:06.949
 the prosecutor's office illegal actions 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.810
 inspector traffic police and what's the trick 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:13.729
 the inspector illegally essentially stopped your 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.159
 car and this equates 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.099
 open law restrictions 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.689
 transport management rights 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.199
 means poet statement 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.389
 make reference to the article 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.030
 12.35 of the administrative code 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.409
 offenses i'm sure of punishment 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.509
 traffic cop puppeteer for such a statement 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.270
 your vehicle 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.810
 not small that is, it will not seem well 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.990
 Well on this I have all the luck to you 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.840
 the roads are waiting for their comments on 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.129
