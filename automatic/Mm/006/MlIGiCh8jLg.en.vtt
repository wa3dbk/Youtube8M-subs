confused but I only use this if I don't

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.359 
confused but I only use this if I don't
have<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.410> kinky<00:02:08.799> curly<00:02:08.950> leave-in

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
have the kinky curly leave-in

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.430 
have the kinky curly leave-in
conditioner<00:02:09.940> but<00:02:10.479> yeah<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:10.929> works<00:02:11.140> pretty

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
conditioner but yeah this works pretty

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.750 
conditioner but yeah this works pretty
much<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.799> same<00:02:12.010> as<00:02:12.310> that<00:02:12.549> leave-in

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
much the same as that leave-in

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.759 
much the same as that leave-in
conditioner<00:02:13.299> and<00:02:13.450> it's<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.350> cheaper

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
conditioner and it's a cheaper

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.319 
conditioner and it's a cheaper
alternative<00:02:14.799> I<00:02:15.310> think<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.760> like<00:02:15.910> six

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
alternative I think this is like six

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.050 
alternative I think this is like six
dollars<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.019> kinky<00:02:17.560> curly<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:18.070> like<00:02:18.280> $12

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
dollars and the kinky curly is like $12

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.430 
dollars and the kinky curly is like $12
or<00:02:19.209> something<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.630> don't<00:02:19.690> know<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.320> yeah<00:02:20.410> I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
or something I don't know but yeah I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.070 
or something I don't know but yeah I
would<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.859> use<00:02:21.100> this<00:02:21.280> because<00:02:21.549> I<00:02:21.609> don't<00:02:21.669> have

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
would I use this because I don't have

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.250 
would I use this because I don't have
any<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.650> leave-in<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.360> put<00:02:24.960> the
