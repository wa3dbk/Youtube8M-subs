00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.089
 the army students 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.799
 former Dutch East Indies the wicks out that leads to an increase in this 

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:27.799

 sbs public eric hulshof bosnier from popstars 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.150
 strange though the over sometimes a cyclist 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.130
 he is far from used to his status as a cabinet 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 if I am here at the first room the viewer should not be involved 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.320
 that's more than if i got it here i should really be right by the state 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.110
 not just on time 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.370
 to pay a lot of attention to, but I try so much 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 possible to pay attention to it but i think this is real 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.500
 but this is certainly one of the nicest things I have experienced in my life 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.730
 life because yes i am i like i have i am almost speechless now is speechless 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.200
 some questions for young say that is for example the craziest thing you have 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.280
 experienced 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.280
 after the point of view, want to cuddle with the twelve steps 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.150
 and 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.780
 Really really works with loans this has not been experienced yet 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.800
 I think that's true 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.890
 but this time a year I have a year earlier than he called to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.040
 listen 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.190
 but of course saw its not just fun things with it 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.660
 called daily by people who died 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.880
 call cloud fields and then just want to hear sas with his grasp held 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.140
 That is a whole truth we have achieved 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.380
 it seems that Alkmaar of course 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.670
 unfortunately for everything to be precise 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.750
 the same 6 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.830
 he will make 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.160
 driven the first year and a year 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.590
 it is not that we remain valid for a year 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.260
 but I have 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
 Well I have a problem he said 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.380

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.490
 how do you like the first performance for such a large audience it is my work 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 first time I immediately shoot so many people 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.449
 they set all day 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.999
 this one back 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:13.989
 the darfur region 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.669
 it seems to train so many people live 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.669
 after he was saved 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.930
