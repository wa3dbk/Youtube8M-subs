00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:18.150
 So today I wanted to make a green smoothie with the JTC OmniBlend V. So take it 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.239
 I have the 1.5 liter container. I now have the 1.5-liter version here, there is also one 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:31.820
 2-liter version. That's the blender, that's the lid and that's the stir bar. To 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.800
 later more. So then I just put the container on. Half a glass of water. It 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.010
 There are people who like the smoothie creamier, there are people who like it a bit 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.739
 aqueous. I like it half past half. Then I take another handful of spinach. Preferably 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.789
 Organic spinach. Then I have half a red apple, half a green apple. A 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.989
 Half orange, you can also take a banana, you can take what is there. One should 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:11.700
 What sweet things to do so it does not taste so green. So then the stir bar is there 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.650
 to feed the mix. But he can not get to the knife. It is important 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:53.510
 to work it only with the appropriate stirring rod. Well, then I just switch to the highest level. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.000
 So that was maybe 20 to 25 seconds now. And I have a wonderful smoothie. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.939
 The special thing about the mixer and the material used is really that 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:23.270
 easy to rinse. If the mix is ​​still fresh, simply rinse with water.
