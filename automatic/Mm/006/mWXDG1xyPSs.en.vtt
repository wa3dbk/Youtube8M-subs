 friends, hello, are you watching the 20th edition 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.360
 digest news avatar technology all 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.070
 the most important and interesting in the field 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.230
 artificial cyber body technology 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.090
 medicine robotics we collected for 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.800
 you in one video subscribe to our 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.300
 channel come on social networks 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.960
 leave your informative 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.480
 comment 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.070
 so let's get started scientists have designed 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.419
 nano-robots capable of wading 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.520
 through body fluids with 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.200
 relative ease but on robots 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.210
 have great potential in the field 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.950
 medicine in the future their use 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.809
 will reduce the dose of medication from 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.530
 deliver precision medicine to 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.329
 body you need 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.059
 a team of scientists from the Swiss higher 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.960
 Technical School of Zurich and 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.820
 Israel Institute of Technology 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.710
 created a device by stringing 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.210
 piece of polymer into two magnetic 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.280
 metal nanowires 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.510
 formed from three parts on on robots 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.820
 so far very wide 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.649
 the size of silk fiber but they 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.600
 can pass not only through the blood but 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.150
 and through mucus bile and other liquids 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.560
 our body for movement team 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.930
 scientists use alternating magnetic 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.580
 field which allows on on the robot 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.670
 move in a given direction as 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.590
 tadpoles using flagella scientists 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.480
 Stanford University created a new 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.040
 type of computer processor using 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.110
 developments in the field of fer magnetic 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.610
 fluid hydrodynamics like 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.250
 device can be used in 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.600
 different areas of biology to chemistry for 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.830
 data transfer to devices 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.590
 used water drops with the addition of 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.320
 magnetic nanoparticles which are located 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.520
 in a rotating magnetic field 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.340
 moving metal elements in 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.110
 shaped letters oh go affect the shape of the field 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 setting the direction that will be 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.500
 move liquid device 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.390
 able to perform computational 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.610
 operations are available and normal computer 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.440
 but at a lesser rate researchers 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.180
 view your invention as new 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.260
 class a number machines which can 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.840
 high precision control 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.180
 material substance and produce with 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.750
 them various manipulations that opens 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.790
 new ones 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.100
 capacities for medicine of new generation 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.630
 and technology called organ on a chip 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.490
 which allows you to check 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.810
 medication in a small part of the body 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.270
 University research team 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.560
 Iowa has developed miniature 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.020
 robotic tentacle for 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.000
 microsurgery of its report sante fixe 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.220
 parts team demonstrates capabilities 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.120
 devices that hold tiny 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.130
 my blade 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.110
 and ant to create a robotic 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.940
 tentacles are used easily 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.400
 deformable and micro tube 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.959
 elastomer moves are soft robot due 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.180
 air which is forced into 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.830
 special pneumatic communication channels 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.510
 with extremely small sizes of it 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.820
 mechanism scientists had to thoroughly 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.590
 work liquid rubber to 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.750
 ensure proper operation of the device 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.610
 as a result, a miniature pneumatic roba 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.230
 tentacles can capture and delicately 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.680
 hold an object with a minimum radius 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.810
 about 185 micrometers by wrapping his 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.910
 spirals just like a trunk does 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.830
 elephant tentacle octopus or bite 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.690
 pea thickness comparison 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.790
 human hair is about 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.840
 100 micrometers 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.640
 the researcher believes that their micro 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.230
 tentacles will be useful in any area 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.090
 where demanded delicate 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.769
 manipulation with tiny objects 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.380
 for example microsurgery 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.209
 using the slow motion techniques 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.980
 scientists were able to film the process 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.049
 leukocyte deaths that protect 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.670
 the body from infections it allowed 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.769
 study the features of the immune system 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.930
 make some interesting discoveries or 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.700
 A cohocite is the main white blood cells. 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.410
 whose function is to protect against 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.290
 internal and external pathogenic agents 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.329
 in the process of dying whether kats is that 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.010
 captured on video in it are formed 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.410
 big clumps that seem 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.329
 tearing the cell and inside the leukocyte 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.730
 splits into many small beads 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.500
 and cells that are around can 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.180
 easy to swallow these little beads 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.459
 Melbourne research team 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.310
 University lad rob together with scientists 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.260
 from university of virginia usa from the sides 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.829
 have not studied the video and suggested that these 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.570
 beads 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.890
 contains molecules that when ingested 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.480
 to another cell 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.040
 may give a warning signal 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.530
 other blood calves 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.530
 leukocytes by their death as it were reported 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.480
 infection is carefully approaching and in 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.459
 conclusion watch video biped 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.620
 robot du russe moves 30 times 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.470
 more efficient than the famous atlas robot 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.209
 developed by boston dinamix 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.280
 the robot is developed by companies with an era 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.500
 international and sandia national labs 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.690

 kilograms during testing on 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.729
 a distance of 2 kilometers the robot spent 2 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.190
 hours and 350 watts of energy used when 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.990
 This is only 16 percent of the battery now 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.160
 the team is engaged in the completion of the robot 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.860
 I try to achieve more efficient 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.010
