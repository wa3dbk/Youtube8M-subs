solo<00:05:25.729> and<00:05:26.029> just<00:05:26.750> played<00:05:26.990> a<00:05:27.020> little<00:05:27.139> harsher

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.230 

and<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:36.770> tried<00:05:37.039> kind<00:05:37.340> of<00:05:37.430> fiddling<00:05:37.849> around<00:05:37.939> with

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
and I tried kind of fiddling around with

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.610 
and I tried kind of fiddling around with
the<00:05:42.009> harmonics<00:05:43.009> but<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:45.020> artificial

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
the harmonics but the artificial

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.260 
the harmonics but the artificial
harmonics<00:05:46.099> but<00:05:46.189> it<00:05:46.310> doesn't<00:05:46.580> work<00:05:46.699> out<00:05:46.939> too

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
harmonics but it doesn't work out too

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.510 
harmonics but it doesn't work out too
well<00:05:47.300> unless<00:05:48.080> here<00:05:48.289> unless<00:05:48.740> you<00:05:48.919> practice<00:05:49.370> it

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
well unless here unless you practice it

00:05:49.520 --> 00:06:04.779 
well unless here unless you practice it
for<00:05:49.699> a<00:05:49.729> while<00:05:57.909> it's<00:05:58.909> just<00:05:59.180> kind<00:06:00.110> of<00:06:00.199> weird<00:06:03.789> that

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
for a while it's just kind of weird that

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.450 
for a while it's just kind of weird that
always<00:06:05.089> makes<00:06:05.330> a<00:06:05.449> really<00:06:05.659> good<00:06:06.620> and<00:06:06.860> hard

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
always makes a really good and hard

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:14.969 
always makes a really good and hard
sound<00:06:07.879> and<00:06:08.180> then<00:06:09.129> the

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.640
