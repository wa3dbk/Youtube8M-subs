00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
bcaas so I just kind of want to do a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:22.160 
bcaas so I just kind of want to do a
little<00:00:11.070> product<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:12.290> showing<00:00:13.290> here<00:00:21.080> so<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
little product of showing here so you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.790 
little product of showing here so you
can<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:22.949> jacked<00:00:23.310> with<00:00:24.029> its<00:00:24.240> new<00:00:24.800> flavor

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
can see here jacked with its new flavor

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.450 
can see here jacked with its new flavor
and<00:00:26.900> University<00:00:27.900> studied<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.740> little<00:00:29.250> bit

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
and University studied a little bit

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.880 
and University studied a little bit
different<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.910> bottle<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.349> key<00:00:31.560> thing<00:00:31.859> is

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
different a bottle then the key thing is

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.639 
different a bottle then the key thing is
modern<00:00:32.369> bc<00:00:32.730> double<00:00:33.059> a's<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:34.410> major

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
modern bc double a's the major

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.340 
modern bc double a's the major
difference<00:00:34.890> would<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:36.059> they're<00:00:36.780> using<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
difference would be that they're using a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.470 
difference would be that they're using a
micronized<00:00:37.860> leucine<00:00:38.460> micronized<00:00:38.969> isoleucine

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
micronized leucine micronized isoleucine

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.250 
micronized leucine micronized isoleucine
micronized<00:00:40.170> valine<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.989> fact

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
micronized valine or more so the fact

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.520 
micronized valine or more so the fact
that<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.860> 10<00:00:44.309> grams<00:00:44.840> all<00:00:45.840> together<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.469> then

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that it's 10 grams all together and then

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.950 
that it's 10 grams all together and then
susta<00:00:47.039> mean<00:00:47.420> not<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> lot<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.660> people<00:00:48.930> know

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
susta mean not a lot of people know

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.389 
susta mean not a lot of people know
about<00:00:49.050> susta<00:00:49.500> me<00:00:49.590> would<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:50.100> met<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
about susta me would actually met the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.760 
about susta me would actually met the
owners<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> i<00:00:51.600> went<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.930> their<00:00:52.079> lectures<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
owners and i went to their lectures and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.920 
owners and i went to their lectures and
even<00:00:53.730> though<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.000> not<00:00:54.180> meant<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
even though it's not meant to be a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.010 
even though it's not meant to be a
glutamine<00:00:55.559> type<00:00:55.800> product<00:00:56.399> i<00:00:56.660> think<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.870> can

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
glutamine type product i think it can

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.590 
glutamine type product i think it can
only<00:00:58.050> help<00:00:58.489> in<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.670> case<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.180> fact<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
only help in this case the fact that

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.500 
only help in this case the fact that
susta<00:01:01.199> mean<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> dipeptide<00:01:02.510> alanine

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
susta mean is a dipeptide alanine

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.980 
susta mean is a dipeptide alanine
l-glutamine<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:06.090> more<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.630> for

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
l-glutamine and more more more so for

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.310 
l-glutamine and more more more so for
rehydration<00:01:07.970> replenishing<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.150> recovery<00:01:10.140> but

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
rehydration replenishing in recovery but

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.179 
rehydration replenishing in recovery but
i'm<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:12.140> promoting<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> susta

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
i'm really not promoting it as a susta

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.499 
i'm really not promoting it as a susta
mean<00:01:14.340> type<00:01:14.490> product<00:01:14.939> although<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.330> nice

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
mean type product although it's nice

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.399 
mean type product although it's nice
it's<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.900> addition<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.460> new<00:01:17.700> stack

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
it's in addition to that so my new stack

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.999 
it's in addition to that so my new stack
what<00:01:19.409> i'm<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:19.799> doing<00:01:19.979> pre<00:01:20.909> workout

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
will be a half a serving of power shock

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.280 
will be a half a serving of power shock
which<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.320> up<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:29.780> pre-workout<00:01:30.780> about<00:01:31.200> an

the<00:01:34.619> beta<00:01:34.860> alanine<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.479> will<00:01:36.689> take

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the beta alanine and then I will take

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
the beta alanine and then I will take
like<00:01:37.560> I've<00:01:37.770> been<00:01:38.040> doing<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.970> phenomenal

anarchy then mid workout because i still
need<00:01:50.250> extra<00:01:50.670> beta<00:01:50.850> alanine<00:01:51.329> because<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
need extra beta alanine because of the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.429 
need extra beta alanine because of the
benefits<00:01:52.259> mid<00:01:52.920> workout<00:01:53.579> I'll<00:01:53.820> shift<00:01:54.600> over<00:01:55.200> to
