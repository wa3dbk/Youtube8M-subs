00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
this is crazy but I'm a little crazy too

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.650 
this is crazy but I'm a little crazy too
so<00:00:04.259> I'm<00:00:04.380> gonna<00:00:04.500> try<00:00:04.770> it<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.240> was<00:00:06.240> looking<00:00:06.540> at

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
so I'm gonna try it I was looking at

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.299 
so I'm gonna try it I was looking at
various<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.259> sundry<00:00:07.589> different<00:00:07.919> ways<00:00:08.040> that

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
various and sundry different ways that

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.030 
various and sundry different ways that
people<00:00:08.429> do<00:00:08.730> baffles<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.990> internet<00:00:10.380> and

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
people do baffles on the internet and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.280 
people do baffles on the internet and
one<00:00:11.190> place<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:11.730> recommending<00:00:12.389> wrapping

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
one place was recommending wrapping

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.880 
one place was recommending wrapping
their<00:00:13.469> baffle<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.389> like<00:00:15.389> steel<00:00:15.750> wool<00:00:15.780> pad

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
their baffle in like steel wool pad

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.170 
their baffle in like steel wool pad
I<00:00:17.240> thought<00:00:18.240> steel<00:00:18.660> wool<00:00:18.930> pad<00:00:19.789> that<00:00:20.789> would<00:00:21.000> be

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
I thought steel wool pad that would be

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.750 
I thought steel wool pad that would be
like<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> steel<00:00:22.380> wool<00:00:22.650> pad<00:00:22.680> right<00:00:23.189> there<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
like a steel wool pad right there the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.609 
like a steel wool pad right there the
lasso<00:00:24.150> asked<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.840> would<00:00:24.930> happened<00:00:25.350> what

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
lasso asked what would happened what

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.550 
lasso asked what would happened what
would<00:00:25.740> happen<00:00:26.480> if<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.630> shoved<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.349> in

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
would happen if I shoved that up in

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.859 
would happen if I shoved that up in
there<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:29.760> shoved<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.210> baffle<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.750> in

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
there and then shoved just baffle up in

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.830 
there and then shoved just baffle up in
there<00:00:31.019> box<00:00:31.260> beside<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:33.540> put<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> right

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
there box beside it and put it right

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.740 
there box beside it and put it right
back<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.260> place<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.570> all<00:00:36.570> the

back in place and all of it all the
stuff<00:00:37.110> had<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> blow<00:00:37.710> through<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.450> SOS<00:00:39.450> pad

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
stuff had to blow through that SOS pad

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.330 
stuff had to blow through that SOS pad
it<00:00:40.559> would<00:00:41.870> he<00:00:42.870> would<00:00:43.050> yeah<00:00:43.469> would<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.190> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
shoved a brillo pad up inside each one

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.470 
shoved a brillo pad up inside each one
of<00:01:11.010> those<00:01:11.070> things<00:01:11.340> stuff

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:51.630 

[Applause]

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:01.590 

I<00:01:59.430> don't<00:02:00.430> know<00:02:00.490> if<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.729> can<00:02:00.909> tell<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:01.330> or<00:02:01.450> not

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
I don't know if you can tell it or not

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.770 
I don't know if you can tell it or not
but<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.170> boatload<00:02:02.440> better

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
but that is a boatload better

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.600 
but that is a boatload better
okay<00:02:04.780> Here<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.020> am<00:02:05.140> again<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.830> figured<00:02:06.310> if<00:02:06.430> one

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
okay Here I am again I figured if one

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.340 
okay Here I am again I figured if one
worked<00:02:06.970> pretty<00:02:07.180> well<00:02:07.420> two<00:02:07.750> would<00:02:07.900> work<00:02:08.080> better

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
worked pretty well two would work better

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.699 
worked pretty well two would work better
so<00:02:08.830> I'm<00:02:09.130> gonna<00:02:09.959> pull<00:02:10.959> him<00:02:11.050> battles<00:02:11.440> out<00:02:11.560> and

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
so I'm gonna pull him battles out and

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.440 
so I'm gonna pull him battles out and
put<00:02:11.800> an<00:02:11.890> elephant<00:02:12.070> up<00:02:12.220> in<00:02:12.400> there<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.120> very

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
put an elephant up in there this is very

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.060 
put an elephant up in there this is very
much<00:02:13.690> similar<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.410> theory<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.920> what<00:02:15.040> a

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
much similar to the theory of what a

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.400 
much similar to the theory of what a
muffler<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.490> all<00:02:15.670> about<00:02:15.959> basically<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.050> muffler

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
muffler is all about basically a muffler

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.710 
muffler is all about basically a muffler
easier<00:02:17.830> packed<00:02:18.250> with<00:02:18.550> fiberglass<00:02:19.209> since

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
easier packed with fiberglass since

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.410 
easier packed with fiberglass since
we're<00:02:19.840> glass<00:02:20.080> packs<00:02:20.410> come<00:02:20.709> from<00:02:20.980> or<00:02:21.730> with

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
we're glass packs come from or with

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.100 
we're glass packs come from or with
little<00:02:22.750> chambers<00:02:23.290> where<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:24.340> exhaust<00:02:24.870> has<00:02:25.870> to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
little chambers where the exhaust has to

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.870 
little chambers where the exhaust has to
hit<00:02:26.290> things<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.950> bounce<00:02:27.160> around<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.700> change

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
hit things and bounce around and change

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.560 
hit things and bounce around and change
directions<00:02:28.320> what<00:02:29.320> happens<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.920> gas

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
directions what happens is the gas

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.690 
directions what happens is the gas
exhaust<00:02:31.709> can<00:02:32.709> change<00:02:32.950> directions<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
exhaust can change directions but the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.850 
exhaust can change directions but the
sound<00:02:33.970> tends<00:02:34.360> not<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.630> after<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.260> ricochets

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
sound tends not to after it ricochets

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.920 
sound tends not to after it ricochets
and<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.160> goes<00:02:36.340> off<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.760> things<00:02:36.970> what<00:02:37.750> this

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
and that goes off of things what this

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.780 
and that goes off of things what this
does<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:38.470> causing<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.220> sound<00:02:39.519> to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
does it's causing like that sound to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.550 
does it's causing like that sound to
that<00:02:40.540> go<00:02:40.750> around<00:02:40.959> inside<00:02:41.350> these<00:02:41.500> little

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
that go around inside these little

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.550 
that go around inside these little
fibers<00:02:42.130> not<00:02:42.519> come<00:02:42.790> out<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:44.080> still<00:02:44.290> let<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
fibers not come out but still let the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.830 
fibers not come out but still let the
gases<00:02:44.920> pass<00:02:45.130> through<00:02:45.519> it's<00:02:46.239> not<00:02:46.420> as<00:02:46.570> good<00:02:46.720> as

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
gases pass through it's not as good as

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.960 
gases pass through it's not as good as
open<00:02:47.140> pipes<00:02:47.380> if<00:02:47.590> you're<00:02:47.709> drag<00:02:47.950> racing<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:48.820> if<00:02:48.910> I

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
open pipes if you're drag racing so if I

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.310 
open pipes if you're drag racing so if I
go<00:02:49.090> drag<00:02:49.330> racing<00:02:49.360> I'll<00:02:49.780> take<00:02:49.989> all<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:50.260> crap

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
go drag racing I'll take all this crap

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.430 
go drag racing I'll take all this crap
out<00:02:50.769> but<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:51.940> cranking<00:02:52.750> around<00:02:52.870> here<00:02:53.260> where<00:02:53.410> I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
out but for cranking around here where I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.750 
out but for cranking around here where I
don't<00:02:53.500> scare<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.950> neighbors<00:02:54.070> twice<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.640> then

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
don't scare the neighbors twice and then

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:40.729 
don't scare the neighbors twice and then
it's<00:02:55.209> probably<00:02:55.570> not<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.720> bad<00:02:55.840> thing<00:02:57.000> okay

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.570 

decent<00:03:41.739> though<00:03:41.890> I<00:03:41.920> think<00:03:42.099> that's<00:03:42.430> quite

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
decent though I think that's quite

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.150 
decent though I think that's quite
workable<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.330> think<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.630> could<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.200> don't<00:03:44.980> know

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
workable I think I could I don't know

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.710 
workable I think I could I don't know
how<00:03:45.280> long<00:03:45.430> can<00:03:45.610> play<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:46.000> last<00:03:46.180> four<00:03:46.569> that

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
how long can play the last four that

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:57.900 
how long can play the last four that
he's<00:03:46.870> blown<00:03:47.080> out<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.349> there<00:03:47.590> but

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.920 

I<00:03:58.530> could<00:03:59.530> live<00:03:59.710> with<00:03:59.890> that
