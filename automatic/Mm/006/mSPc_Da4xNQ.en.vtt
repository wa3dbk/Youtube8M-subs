00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.509
 not really very good guys 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.960
 predisposed they got the message from 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:21.500
 obviously the same teacher 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.509
 a whole and the reality is that you 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.270
 brand that are being offered a way 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.810
 extraordinary 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.120
 and good wanting to achieve things 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.100
 important the establishment at the human level 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.350
 we have met guys 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.350
 fabulous in reality 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.670
 boys predisposed to work 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.329
 to know the humor agreement and the fee 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.940
 when there is what 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.059
 to be serious because football is 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.059
 A) Yes 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.550
 and really the group stars created with a 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.739
 goal that if I want 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 and forwards and good and I go back to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.540
 reiterate this to achieve things 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.089
 important comes to the history of what 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.689
 what central 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.000
 we are happy because the reinforcements 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.819
 that arrive are from hierarchy are from the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.510
 house excite people and even the 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:19.630
 moment more than happy with 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.310
 what they are providing so much 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.899
 the delivery to the leader is not true 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.440
 what are you doing the effort and 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.270
 good 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.740
 of rumbling in the ears continuously 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.920
 to the order obviously what you want 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.560
 the coach and they are paying off 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.480
 then we are more than excited and 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.540
 we are finishing what is the stage 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.480
 mature even though we are 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.200
 which is to be understood normal the 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.070
 run and with ball at the same time 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.510
 and missing 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.760
 the Finnish final touch with respect to 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.370
 the completion of the stage of 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.740
 preparation that is where the footballer 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.990
 already feels totally light and good 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.570
 before the control of the ball is much more 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.550
 sure is true so 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.650
 we are doing it in a lot almost 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.009
 practically two weeks he finds out almost 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.099
 3 double shift 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.599
 and well this stage already this week 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.540
 start working be a little different 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.790
 but the trainings when they are a 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.909
 tour are not only those that are equivalent to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.909
 two 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.280
 more more time is important because 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.460
 we are going to accumulate much more load of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.080
 I work with much more volume 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.390
 the fact that although it seems to you 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.130
 lie we are new with the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.070
 anxiety and the desire that we come with 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.410
 all the same from the campus and dump it and 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.060
 move with the player and have 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.700
 this feedback with the player stops 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.340
 knowledge and understanding made us 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.220
 to coexist and be the day to day we 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.490
 I have served much more but 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.470
 we have had weeks of work where 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.320
 It can instill all obviously 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.990
 of football ideas and work in 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.450
 all the planes so that it's like what 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.720
 which is the ball stopped in favor with 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.890
 then it leaves you more to work for that 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.680
 the teams that currently play 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.530
 tournaments is every two or three days and plays 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.400
 inside and well well you can not 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.250
 translate the work 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.700
 the truth the club does not make a sheet 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.350
 of great clubs let's say the clubs 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.970
 at the height of 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.220
 the greatest of Buenos Aires in the 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.070
 radio 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.930
 If any reality as people 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.819
 they come here they do not go there with that 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.530
 with no monitoring activity 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.950
 after something that may come to pass 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.950
 there 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.260
 explodes t-shirt everywhere 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.810
 where to get out we give the bathroom then 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.239
 what what marks you that you people 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.610
 illusion and what moved and what 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.040
 generalizes that of the boy before 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.810
 reinforcements god may you can crown 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.890
 to give a joy to the people of 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.050
 true 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.170
 and that people feel identified 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.380
 with the team or with the campus 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.380
 idea 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.270
 obviously I support it or talk because 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.490
 they do the good in the bad but hopefully 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.890
 that we can give him that contagion 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.720
 for people to believe again we 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.400
 Look, I'm telling you the truth, we're here in the 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.590
 Big brother house we give here 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.660
 in the house great weapon can not leave nor 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.690
 with crazy rosary have come in the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.920
 true but I do not know the touch 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.470
 nothing so people do not even me 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.360
 knows the reality but here 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.420
 who drive here in the country here and 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.750
 in the pool is impressive dresses is 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.460
 awesome the love of loyalty to 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.540
 all that obviously has the 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.420
 Argentine fan seasoning what 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.310
 who loves calling this I have been invited 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.220
 roast with friends 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.380
 of chacho and good is to finish the dinners 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.870
 with the tablecloths when people can be 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.660
 ticket singing central songs in 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.430
 love an inexplicable passion the 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.440
 expectation as I told you about the pig 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.570
 they enter bullet and the pig goes by all 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.640
 and we are the ones who are behind 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.160
 of him and well that's what we 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.440
 we try to inculcate people to the 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.870
 people forgive the campus that people 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.910
 know then unfortunately the reality 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.340
 this soccer 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.770
 if the ball enters or does not enter and you 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.990
 it really determines what are you for 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.150
 it's a sport that's why it's the most 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.700
 cute of the world I think and what but good 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.920
 you have xavi if you sometimes do not 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.140
 You can share but we 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.900
 we try to narrow the margin it gets 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.230
 with constant and based on jobs 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.940
 very much fans really put us the order 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.000
 of player and being in all the details 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.250
 that does not fit the fan and 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.740
 that we are stuck in here for 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.280
 work double shifts all week with 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.170
 those who need 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.720
 the players that are available for 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.720
 to work for the party not
