20<00:00:52.320> pretty<00:00:53.219> straightforward<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.750> if

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
20 pretty straightforward if but if

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.330 
20 pretty straightforward if but if
you're<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.170> already<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.680> level<00:00:55.710> 20<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
you're not already at level 20 the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
quickest way to do that is to get a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.430 
quickest way to do that is to get a
friend<00:00:58.800> who's<00:00:59.070> pretty<00:00:59.460> high<00:00:59.640> level<00:00:59.670> 30<00:01:00.270> or<00:01:00.840> 34

you<00:03:32.670> should<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.120> fine<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:34.260> should<00:03:34.560> be<00:03:34.829> all

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
you should be fine you should be all

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.349 
you should be fine you should be all
right<00:03:35.510> next<00:03:36.510> up<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:37.350> have<00:03:37.380> bane<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.820> Theon

defeat a Theon on hard difficulty this
one<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:44.180> probably<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.750> my<00:03:46.140> opinion<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:47.400> a

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
one is probably in my opinion for a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.699 
one is probably in my opinion for a
first-time<00:03:47.970> player<00:03:48.150> anyway<00:03:48.690> it's<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.380> hoarder

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
first-time player anyway it's a hoarder

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
next one crow air is easier than a Theon

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.630 
next one crow air is easier than a Theon
and<00:03:54.480> Scola<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.410> where<00:03:55.769> you'd<00:03:55.950> even<00:03:56.130> both<00:03:56.459> of

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
the hard ones so this one's not that

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.120 
the hard ones so this one's not that
difficult<00:04:24.500> either<00:04:25.500> so<00:04:26.070> scoffs<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.760> they

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
difficult either so scoffs and they

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.120 
difficult either so scoffs and they
he<00:04:27.190> on<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.550> believe<00:04:28.150> probably<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:29.050> peons<00:04:29.560> about<00:04:29.800> a

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
he on I believe probably a peons about a

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.640 
he on I believe probably a peons about a
Theon's<00:04:30.700> harder<00:04:31.030> but<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.840> think<00:04:32.290> this<00:04:32.380> girl<00:04:32.530> ass

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
Theon's harder but I think this girl ass

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.380 
Theon's harder but I think this girl ass
is<00:04:32.800> about<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.130> same<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.640> same<00:04:33.820> level<00:04:34.030> as<00:04:34.210> crow

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
is about the same the same level as crow

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.530 
is about the same the same level as crow
but<00:04:35.110> we<00:04:35.200> had<00:04:35.290> Croteau<00:04:35.620> himself<00:04:36.040> once<00:04:37.030> again<00:04:37.180> I

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
but we had Croteau himself once again I

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.360 
but we had Croteau himself once again I
can<00:04:37.720> just<00:04:37.870> say<00:04:37.990> this<00:04:38.230> it<00:04:38.650> was<00:04:38.770> bringing<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.130> semi

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
can just say this it was bringing a semi

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.990 
can just say this it was bringing a semi
capable<00:04:39.880> team<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.680> if<00:04:41.680> one<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.250> a<00:04:42.610> level

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
capable team and if one of you a level

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.160 
capable team and if one of you a level
33<00:04:43.390> or<00:04:44.100> 34<00:04:45.100> then<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:46.420> faxed<00:04:46.720> us<00:04:46.780> all<00:04:46.960> better

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
33 or 34 then it faxed us all better

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.500 
33 or 34 then it faxed us all better
anyway<00:04:47.560> then<00:04:47.830> it'll<00:04:48.100> be<00:04:48.130> easy<00:04:48.370> seriously<00:04:49.330> as

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
anyway then it'll be easy seriously as

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.850 
anyway then it'll be easy seriously as
long<00:04:49.750> as<00:04:49.840> you've<00:04:49.960> got<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.110> team<00:04:50.320> who<00:04:50.500> not<00:04:50.710> we're

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
a team of one was we can solo this once

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.110 
a team of one was we can solo this once
you<00:04:56.380> know<00:04:56.620> how<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.860> do<00:04:57.130> it<00:04:57.280> now<00:04:57.790> we<00:04:57.850> get<00:04:58.090> into

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
you know how to do it now we get into

the three last ones and these are the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.140 
the three last ones and these are the
ones<00:04:59.980> that<00:05:00.100> some<00:05:00.370> people<00:05:00.640> might<00:05:00.790> not<00:05:01.000> actually

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
ones that some people might not actually

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.330 
ones that some people might not actually

have you might have all of the recipes
and<00:05:03.850> still<00:05:04.150> need<00:05:04.360> these<00:05:04.630> three<00:05:05.200> or<00:05:05.470> one<00:05:06.040> of

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
and still need these three or one of

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.880 
and still need these three or one of
these<00:05:06.340> three<00:05:06.670> so<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.450> next<00:05:07.510> one<00:05:07.750> is<00:05:08.080> complete
