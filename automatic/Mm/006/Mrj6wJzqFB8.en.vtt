00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 pamela sued in 2014 I refresh the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.790
 Dominican television with his talent the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 young communicator serving 10 years of 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.200
 career showed that when you want you 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.509
 can 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.210
 pamela Dominican television has 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.890
 I've seen you grow up as a figure 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.320
 as a professional as a woman as a wife 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.800
 now as a mother 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.750
 and definitely a year 2014 of many 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.910
 satisfactions for you not only as 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.070
 woman but also as a professional 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.670
 good 2014 started as normal year 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 as I have been doing it for several years 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.090
 working every day at night 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.390
 normal the program but mid-year 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.129
 took a complete turn with the change of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.320
 schedule of the program a change of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.900
 schedule that was not requested by 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.259
 us that we were not expecting that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.790
 we were not prepared to assume it and 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.619
 however it arrived and we had two 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.420
 options or face it and assume it and 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.149
 give everything for the whole or simple and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.310
 just abandon me I think this 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.420
 It has been like the highlight of my year 2014 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.930
 that change that he gave me 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.520
 in the month of June July and the truth is 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.590
 that I appreciate it very much because it gave me 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.200
 the opportunity to prove myself 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.479
 that I am capable of anything and that I can 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.939
 face whatever and even though I 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.979
 think I'm not ready if I 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.780
 I am but this is our first time 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.430
 here our first time of many 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.890
 nights that we are going to spend together 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.140
 having fun having fun with the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.880
 Content follows the night goes bad in 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.729
 an opportunity I think that in 2007 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.250
 we saw movies and you did very well 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.490
 I think you did it very well 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.170
 I think you have discarded a bit the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.540
 field of cinema in your home and drag is 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.580
 focused more on television in 2015 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.150
 it may be the year for us to see a 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.650
 family that decides to explore the sheet the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.750
 I look at it, I 've never discarded it 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.420
 however after that first 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.700
 experience that I had first and only 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.230
 the hand of roberto angel salcedo and I had 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.990
 the opportunity to make movies with paty 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.300
 manterola that was frank perozo in that 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.520
 moment luis josÃ© germÃ¡n was a 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.520
 experience I saw it for very well 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.500
 oil very well I stayed with that gustito 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.660
 and I went to new york a little while be 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.150
 a super short time but we already 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.049
 we find now 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.000
 Then I wanted to do something different 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:48.290
 dissipate the mind a little give it a 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.329
 tasting and more professional in the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.769
 preparation studies of how like 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:57.200
 actress techniques and others and yet the 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.060
 film industry has grown and not because 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.340
 bad and I do not criticize it much less 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.189
 the same figure are those that are kept 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.359
 now in the cinema I think that the one that 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:11.239
 hit in 2012 has remained stuck 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.190
 until now then what do I know I 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.220
 he played my series in the first chamber 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.230
 nuanced movies and I do not know that I'm 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.170
 willing or I love the cinema 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.209
 I would love to have another experience and 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.800
 I had other projects that in a moment 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.819
 determined were spoken several 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.770
 years ago they joined but open the 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.630
 possibility I would love to do again 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.520
 cinema but regularly when the year 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.100
 end one sits down and says good I'm going 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.010
 to pass a balance 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.290
 I'm going to keep doing this, not what 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.510
 I do more this I would love to go back to 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.080
 repeating this hopefully not happen ever again 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.870
 that this summary would you have look 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.849
 and what 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.470
 I do not want that I would return to me 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.190
 I would go back to the experience of 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.659
 2014 much ingratitude much ingratitude 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.629
 many people who in a moment 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:05.019
 determined were very special to 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.239
 me for my life for my projects and in 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.290
 a specific moment when when 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.290
 no more 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.700
 things happened and comments that did not 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.940
 that did not come to the case so I think 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.470
 that the very fact of facing a 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.750
 new credit gave me the opportunity to 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.010
 see the other side of the coin that does not 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.110
 always people will be happy 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.100
 because it worked for me or because I 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.350
 I had found something that I liked 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.640
 so I think that that's been like 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.620
 that the bad experience but that has 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.060
 made stronger so he has his 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.830
 it has its reward 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.600
 the good thing about 2014 as I was saying is to that 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.710
 hit front to realize that I am 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.450
 capable of anything in record time 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.580
 change my program what was called 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.070
 know how to change a program 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.960
 format that people are to maintain a 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.630
 same name and that people would perceive 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.580
 a different program is difficult is 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.350
 extremely difficult and we achieved it thanks 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.080
 back to me but to a whole team 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.960
 behind follows the night of truth I 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.200
 I think the good is much more than what 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.940
 negative plans for 2015 for the 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.919
 2015 that they want things 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.350
 continue as they go that the projects that 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.139
 arrive are projects that add me that 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.400
 give me joy not necessarily that 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.590
 be what pay me the most 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.389
 economically but give me peace that 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.620
 They give me fullness to give me joy that 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.370
 It's the only thing I want health 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.710
 obviously for me for my family and be 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.850
 happy I think that if one is happy when 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.850
 a lot with what little life is worth 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.850
 live it
