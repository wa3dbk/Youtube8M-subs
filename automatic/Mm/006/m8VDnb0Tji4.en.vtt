00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.400

doesn't have one

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.530 
doesn't have one
I<00:01:24.010> think<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.700> Leafs<00:01:24.850> man<00:01:25.090> helps<00:01:25.360> a<00:01:25.420> lot

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
I think the Leafs man helps a lot

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.270 
I think the Leafs man helps a lot
because<00:01:25.720> not<00:01:26.260> only<00:01:26.290> can<00:01:26.620> I<00:01:26.650> go<00:01:26.800> straight<00:01:27.010> up

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
because not only can I go straight up

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.370 
because not only can I go straight up
but<00:01:27.790> I<00:01:27.850> can<00:01:28.000> adjust<00:01:28.300> my<00:01:28.360> arms<00:01:28.690> at<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.930> if<00:01:29.080> I<00:01:29.170> see
