make<00:01:07.690> sure<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.290> dough<00:01:08.470> is<00:01:08.650> slightly<00:01:09.190> on

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
make sure that the dough is slightly on

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.550 
make sure that the dough is slightly on
the<00:01:09.430> harder<00:01:09.820> side<00:01:10.000> eventually<00:01:10.780> by<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.320> time

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
the harder side eventually by the time

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.289 
the harder side eventually by the time
you<00:01:11.710> are<00:01:11.770> ready<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.159> roll<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.610> roti<00:01:12.790> you'll

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
you are ready to roll the roti you'll

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.060 
you are ready to roll the roti you'll
find<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:13.990> dough<00:01:14.170> will<00:01:14.350> go<00:01:14.530> absolutely

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
find that the dough will go absolutely

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.790 
find that the dough will go absolutely
soft<00:01:15.460> because<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:16.180> for<00:01:17.110> cabbage<00:01:17.530> and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
soft because of for cabbage and

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.160 
soft because of for cabbage and
fenugreek<00:01:18.370> leaves<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:19.570> after<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.140> have

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
fenugreek leaves so after you have

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.590 
fenugreek leaves so after you have
combined<00:01:20.800> all<00:01:20.980> of<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.250> into<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.550> dough<00:01:21.850> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
combined all of this into a dough the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.140 
combined all of this into a dough the
dough<00:01:22.630> would<00:01:22.990> look<00:01:23.200> something<00:01:23.410> like<00:01:23.650> this<00:01:24.150> see

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
dough would look something like this see

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.140 
dough would look something like this see
it's<00:01:25.330> quite<00:01:25.540> soft<00:01:26.050> but<00:01:26.500> we<00:01:27.460> can<00:01:27.640> handle<00:01:28.000> it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
it's quite soft but we can handle it

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.670 
it's quite soft but we can handle it
it's<00:01:28.300> not<00:01:28.420> all<00:01:28.660> that<00:01:28.690> soft<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.440> need<00:01:29.590> to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
it's not all that soft that you need to

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.830 
it's not all that soft that you need to
add<00:01:29.830> more<00:01:30.070> flour<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.490> this<00:01:30.610> but<00:01:31.300> we<00:01:31.570> need<00:01:31.750> to

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
add more flour to this but we need to

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.780 
add more flour to this but we need to
roll<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.140> right<00:01:32.380> away<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.130> start<00:01:33.520> with

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
roll it right away so to start with

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.270 
roll it right away so to start with
we'll<00:01:34.030> have<00:01:34.150> to<00:01:34.270> first<00:01:34.540> portion<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.230> dough<00:01:35.440> in

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
we'll have to first portion the dough in

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.090 
we'll have to first portion the dough in
two<00:01:36.610> equal<00:01:36.940> parts<00:01:37.420> so<00:01:38.080> just<00:01:38.320> make<00:01:38.770> sure<00:01:38.800> you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
two equal parts so just make sure you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.910 
two equal parts so just make sure you
equal<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.790> out<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.270> one<00:01:41.200> portion<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:41.770> the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
equal it out and one portion of the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.220 
equal it out and one portion of the
dough<00:01:42.100> roll<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:42.790> into<00:01:42.940> some<00:01:43.240> dry<00:01:43.600> we'll<00:01:43.960> beat

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
dough roll it into some dry we'll beat

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.290 
dough roll it into some dry we'll beat
flour<00:01:44.620> and<00:01:45.010> now<00:01:45.370> we<00:01:45.430> need<00:01:45.730> to<00:01:45.850> roll<00:01:46.060> this

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
flour and now we need to roll this

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.690 
flour and now we need to roll this
evenly<00:01:47.020> but<00:01:47.470> before<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:47.860> start<00:01:48.160> rolling<00:01:48.370> this

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
evenly but before you start rolling this

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.120 
evenly but before you start rolling this
your<00:01:48.940> tava<00:01:49.240> has<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.570> be<00:01:49.690> hot<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.230> Mattawa<00:01:50.980> is

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
your tava has to be hot so Mattawa is

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.860 
your tava has to be hot so Mattawa is
getting<00:01:51.400> heated<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.030> same<00:01:52.240> time<00:01:52.510> also

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
getting heated and the same time also

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.320 
getting heated and the same time also
rolling<00:01:53.080> this<00:01:53.290> roti<00:01:53.650> don't<00:01:54.250> roll<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.700> too<00:01:55.060> thin

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
rolling this roti don't roll it too thin

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.480 
rolling this roti don't roll it too thin
or<00:01:55.510> this<00:01:55.660> it<00:01:55.810> will<00:01:55.900> go<00:01:56.110> quite<00:01:56.500> hard<00:01:56.950> because

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
or this it will go quite hard because

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.520 
or this it will go quite hard because
we're<00:01:57.850> not<00:01:57.940> going<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.240> add<00:01:58.420> any<00:01:58.780> oil<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.290> this

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
we're not going to add any oil to this

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.400 
we're not going to add any oil to this
the<00:02:00.370> moisture<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.060> all<00:02:01.210> because<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.200> the

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
the moisture is all because of the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.920 
the moisture is all because of the
cabbage<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.040> fenugreek<00:02:03.790> leaves<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.810> I'm

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
cabbage and the fenugreek leaves so I'm

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.699 
cabbage and the fenugreek leaves so I'm
leaving<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.440> slightly<00:02:05.770> thick<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:08.110> we<00:02:08.500> need<00:02:08.619> to

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
leaving it slightly thick and we need to

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.759 
leaving it slightly thick and we need to
cook<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.099> on<00:02:09.280> low<00:02:09.489> heat<00:02:09.940> okay<00:02:10.629> so<00:02:10.959> let's<00:02:11.170> flip

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
cook this on low heat okay so let's flip

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.589 
cook this on low heat okay so let's flip
this<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.159> let<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.640> cook<00:02:12.909> on<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.209> other<00:02:13.239> side

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
this and let it cook on the other side

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.570 
this and let it cook on the other side
as<00:02:13.750> well<00:02:13.780> since<00:02:14.590> this<00:02:14.739> is<00:02:14.890> quite<00:02:15.190> thickly

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
as well since this is quite thickly

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.360 
as well since this is quite thickly
rolled<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.209> will<00:02:16.360> take<00:02:16.569> some<00:02:16.870> time<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.069> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
rolled it will take some time for it to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.270
