00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
a quick tip about using a loop now let

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.189 
a quick tip about using a loop now let
me<00:00:14.610> tell<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.880> about<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.150> loop<00:00:15.450> i<00:00:15.630> used<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.020> use

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
me tell you about a loop i used to use

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.410 
me tell you about a loop i used to use
them<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> darkroom<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.310> wherever<00:00:18.210> i

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
them in the darkroom or in wherever i

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.240 
them in the darkroom or in wherever i
was<00:00:18.630> reviewing<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.170> negatives<00:00:19.650> or<00:00:19.830> slides

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
was reviewing my negatives or slides

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.220 
was reviewing my negatives or slides
back<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> day<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> slide<00:00:21.750> table

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
back in the day on a slide table

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.019 
back in the day on a slide table
basically<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.010> was<00:00:23.100> light<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.640> popped<00:00:23.850> out

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
basically that was light that popped out

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.730 
basically that was light that popped out
underneath<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.689> thing<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.230> put<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> loop

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
underneath this thing we put the loop

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.200 
underneath this thing we put the loop
down<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.130> could<00:00:26.250> check<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.640> focus<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.180> can

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
down we could check for focus we can

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.419 
down we could check for focus we can
check<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.599> quality<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> image<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
check for quality of the image now the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.950 
check for quality of the image now the
same<00:00:29.670> thing<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.939> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> hold<00:00:30.269> true<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
same thing is going to hold true with a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.220 
same thing is going to hold true with a
loop<00:00:31.349> out<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:32.099> location<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:33.090> stills<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.719> for

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
loop out on location for stills and for

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.080 
loop out on location for stills and for
video<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.920> important<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> carry<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.880> loop

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
video it's important to carry a loop

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.330 
video it's important to carry a loop
around<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.510> think<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.320> check<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> day<00:00:38.129> like

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
around I think to check on a day like

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.369 
around I think to check on a day like
this<00:00:38.399> where<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:38.910> ultra<00:00:39.329> bright<00:00:39.629> you're<00:00:40.140> not

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
this where it's ultra bright you're not

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.720 
this where it's ultra bright you're not
going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.739> able<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> see<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> LCD<00:00:41.370> screen

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
going to be able to see the LCD screen

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.910 
going to be able to see the LCD screen
unless<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.450> start<00:00:42.719> trying<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> cup<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.680> hand

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
unless you start trying to cup your hand

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.830 
unless you start trying to cup your hand
on<00:00:44.040> top<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.610> which<00:00:44.940> never<00:00:45.270> really<00:00:45.660> gives

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
on top of it which never really gives

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.869 
on top of it which never really gives
you<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> good<00:00:46.200> look<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.920> LCD<00:00:47.250> screen<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
you a good look at the LCD screen and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.400 
you a good look at the LCD screen and
it's<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.629> chipping<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.260> about

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it's not just about chipping it's about

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.500 
it's not just about chipping it's about
checking<00:00:49.710> focus<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.789> checking<00:00:51.329> everything

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
checking focus and checking everything

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
checking focus and checking everything
else<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.289> looking<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.160> where

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
else that you're looking at so where

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
else that you're looking at so where
loops<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> come<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.239> handy<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.809> still

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
loops going to come in handy for still

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
loops going to come in handy for still
images<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.760> time<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.540 
images is a time like this you want to
review<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> image<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:59.039> put<00:00:59.280> your<00:00:59.460> eye<00:00:59.489> up

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
review the image you put your eye up

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.760 
review the image you put your eye up
against<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.329> blocking<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.989> external

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
against it it's blocking all external

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you see the LCD in its full brightness

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.240 
you see the LCD in its full brightness
to<00:01:05.970> give<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> good<00:01:06.750> look<00:01:07.140> at<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> image<00:01:07.950> now

what<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.549> looking<00:01:08.580> for<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> loop<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.869> on

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
what I'm looking for in the loop and on

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.950 
what I'm looking for in the loop and on
the<00:01:10.530> screen<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.220> tight<00:01:11.580> focus<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.659> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the screen is for tight focus that is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.450 
the screen is for tight focus that is
what<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.320> helps<00:01:13.590> me<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> magnifies<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
what this helps me do it magnifies the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.520 
what this helps me do it magnifies the
screen<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.060> allows<00:01:15.299> me<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.930> my<00:01:16.290> shot

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
screen and allows me to see if my shot

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.320 
screen and allows me to see if my shot
is<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.860> focus<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.430> where<00:01:17.820> does<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> come<00:01:18.210> in

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
is in focus so where does it come in

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330 
is in focus so where does it come in
handy<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.780> video<00:01:19.110> well<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.770> you're<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.040> set
