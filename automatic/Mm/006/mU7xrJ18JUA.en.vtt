your mouth or pet alright so we're take

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.950 
your mouth or pet alright so we're take
on<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.949> Triceratops<00:00:23.730> first<00:00:24.180> now<00:00:24.510> there's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
on that Triceratops first now there's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.509 
on that Triceratops first now there's
all<00:00:25.199> sorts<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.560> colors<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.980> these<00:00:26.099> around<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
all sorts of colors of these around the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.130 
all sorts of colors of these around the
island<00:00:26.880> most<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.689> don't<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:27.990> make<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
island most of the don't really make a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.359 
island most of the don't really make a
difference<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.650> only<00:00:28.859> thing<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.160> makes<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
difference the only thing that makes the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.560 
difference the only thing that makes the
difference<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.730> these<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.390> they're

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
difference with these is if they're

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.120 
difference with these is if they're
bigger<00:00:30.779> they'll<00:00:31.050> drop<00:00:31.320> more<00:00:31.500> bone<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.980> they're

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
bigger they'll drop more bone so they're

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.880 
bigger they'll drop more bone so they're
smaller<00:00:32.430> they'll<00:00:32.640> draw<00:00:32.880> +<00:00:33.530> Triceratops<00:00:34.530> these

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
smaller they'll draw + Triceratops these

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
smaller they'll draw + Triceratops these
guys<00:00:35.070> jump<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.550> seven<00:00:35.969> buttons<00:00:36.270> each<00:00:36.420> so

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
guys jump about seven buttons each so

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.959 
guys jump about seven buttons each so
pretty<00:00:37.500> good<00:00:37.680> they're<00:00:37.980> not<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.219> hard<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.610> like

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
pretty good they're not as hard as like

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.310 
pretty good they're not as hard as like
double<00:00:39.300> sores<00:00:39.480> or<00:00:39.600> whatever<00:00:39.809> else<00:00:40.020> but

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
double sores or whatever else but

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.400 
double sores or whatever else but
they're<00:00:41.010> fairly<00:00:41.820> easy<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.270> solo<00:00:42.719> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.989> pop<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
they're fairly easy a solo if you pop a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.529 
they're fairly easy a solo if you pop a
few<00:00:43.710> cooldowns<00:00:44.129> ad<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.760> drop<00:00:45.000> about<00:00:45.239> around

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
few cooldowns ad they drop about around

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.139 
few cooldowns ad they drop about around
seven<00:00:45.660> bones<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.289> that's<00:00:46.440> pretty<00:00:46.649> damn<00:00:46.860> good

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
seven bones so that's pretty damn good

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.940 
seven bones so that's pretty damn good
and<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> Triceratops<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.649> make<00:00:49.800> sure

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and with the Triceratops just make sure

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.229 
and with the Triceratops just make sure
you<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.160> stone<00:00:50.430> board<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
you have stone board you don't have to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
you have stone board you don't have to
pop<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.629> many<00:00:51.870> cooldowns<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.440> did<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
pop that many cooldowns I did just to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.100 
pop that many cooldowns I did just to
show<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> off<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:54.180> these<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.480> probably<00:00:54.930> take

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
show it off but these will probably take

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.650 
show it off but these will probably take
you<00:00:55.289> about<00:00:55.530> two<00:00:55.829> minutes<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.250> solo<00:00:56.460> maybe<00:00:56.820> two

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
you about two minutes to solo maybe two

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
these are pretty easy ok so one of the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.340 
these are pretty easy ok so one of the
Dino<00:01:08.850> manswers<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.540> Donald<00:01:09.930> answers<00:01:10.200> are

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
Dino manswers now the Donald answers are

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.719 
Dino manswers now the Donald answers are
kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.560> interesting<00:01:10.740> considering<00:01:11.490> they

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
kind of interesting considering they

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.600 
kind of interesting considering they
actually<00:01:12.060> heal<00:01:12.330> each<00:01:12.479> other<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.220> they<00:01:14.220> also

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
actually heal each other and they also

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.670 
actually heal each other and they also
hit<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.720> damage<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.470> keep

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
hit for a little bit of damage but keep

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.380 
hit for a little bit of damage but keep
in<00:01:16.799> mind<00:01:16.830> these<00:01:17.220> only<00:01:17.400> dropped<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:17.909> bone<00:01:18.150> each

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
in mind these only dropped one bone each

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.810 
in mind these only dropped one bone each
but<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> higher<00:01:19.770> chance<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.460> draw

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
but they have a higher chance to draw

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.550 
but they have a higher chance to draw
feed<00:01:21.150> little<00:01:21.420> dinosaur<00:01:21.869> pets<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> something

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
feed little dinosaur pets that something

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.249 
feed little dinosaur pets that something
you<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.909> these<00:01:24.689> generally<00:01:25.080> comes

but there there's like giant packs of
them<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.920> make<00:01:29.250> sure<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.579> only<00:01:29.790> aggro<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.450> or

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
them so make sure you only aggro one or

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.800 
them so make sure you only aggro one or
two<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.960> pull<00:01:31.170> these<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:33.420> make<00:01:33.659> sure

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
two and you pull these and you make sure

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.300 
two and you pull these and you make sure
you<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.079> inner<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.799> well<00:01:34.979> but

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you have your inner up there as well but

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
you have your inner up there as well but
you<00:01:35.460> can't<00:01:35.729> interrupt<00:01:35.939> them<00:01:36.329> both<00:01:36.509> within<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you can't interrupt them both within the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
you can't interrupt them both within the
set<00:01:37.259> time<00:01:37.439> your<00:01:37.759> interrupt<00:01:40.610> process<00:01:41.610> also

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
set time your interrupt process also

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
set time your interrupt process also
just<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.869> i<00:01:43.079> recommend<00:01:43.860> hobbing

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
just do what you can i recommend hobbing

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.819 
just do what you can i recommend hobbing
ascendance<00:01:45.170> when<00:01:46.170> they're<00:01:46.320> actually<00:01:46.619> healing

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
ascendance when they're actually healing

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.649 
ascendance when they're actually healing
and<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.549> burning<00:01:47.880> them<00:01:48.030> down<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and just burning them down because you

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.090 
and just burning them down because you
won't<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.930> able<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.229> interrupt<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.770> second

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
won't be able to interrupt that second

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.469 
won't be able to interrupt that second
heal<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.939> able<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.180> enter<00:01:51.360> up

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
heal but you will be able to enter up

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.389 
heal but you will be able to enter up
one<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.500> yeah<00:01:52.740> these<00:01:52.950> guys<00:01:53.009> are

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
one of them so yeah these guys are

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.700 
one of them so yeah these guys are
pretty<00:01:53.549> easy<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.540> pop<00:01:54.780> some<00:01:54.930> cooldowns<00:01:55.409> make

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
pretty easy just pop some cooldowns make

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
pretty easy just pop some cooldowns make
sure<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> enter<00:01:56.009> up<00:01:56.250> when<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
sure you enter up when you can and it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.190 
sure you enter up when you can and it
should<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> breeze<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.439> you

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.419 

alright<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> double<00:02:08.039> stars<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
alright so all of the double stars the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.370 
alright so all of the double stars the
double<00:02:08.670> source<00:02:08.850> do<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> lot<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.630> damage<00:02:09.990> so<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
double source do a lot of damage so you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.600 
double source do a lot of damage so you
need<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> keep<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.039> mind<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.459> main

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
need to keep that in mind in the main

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400 
need to keep that in mind in the main
reason<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.240> because<00:02:12.660> they<00:02:12.840> reduce<00:02:13.230> your

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
reason that is because they reduce your

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.559 
reason that is because they reduce your
armor<00:02:13.709> by<00:02:13.860> quite<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> bit<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> faster<00:02:15.480> you

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
armor by quite a bit so the faster you

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.970 
armor by quite a bit so the faster you
actually<00:02:15.930> burn<00:02:16.050> them<00:02:16.290> down<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.650> less<00:02:16.830> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
actually burn them down the less of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.070 
actually burn them down the less of
these<00:02:17.100> stocks<00:02:17.280> they'll<00:02:17.580> put<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.209> that

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
these stocks they'll put on you and that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.170 
these stocks they'll put on you and that
means<00:02:19.260> less<00:02:19.470> damage<00:02:19.800> they<00:02:19.950> do<00:02:20.100> overall<00:02:20.400> so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
means less damage they do overall so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.640 
means less damage they do overall so
what<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.630> actually<00:02:21.810> need<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.410> save

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
what you actually need to do is save

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.960 
what you actually need to do is save
your<00:02:22.830> defensive<00:02:23.220> cooldowns<00:02:23.340> for<00:02:23.730> when<00:02:23.850> you're

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
your defensive cooldowns for when you're

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.580 
your defensive cooldowns for when you're
taking<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.300> lot<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.510> damage<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.440> would

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
taking a lot of damage and I would

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.080 
taking a lot of damage and I would
recommend<00:02:25.830> pulping<00:02:26.310> all<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.580> your<00:02:26.700> offensive

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
recommend pulping all of your offensive

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.190 
recommend pulping all of your offensive
cooldowns<00:02:27.420> at<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.600> beginning<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.989> fight

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
cooldowns at the beginning of the fight

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.630 
cooldowns at the beginning of the fight
so<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.410> can<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.680> burn<00:02:28.860> them<00:02:28.980> down<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.400> fast

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
so you can just burn them down as fast

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.360 
so you can just burn them down as fast
as<00:02:29.880> possible<00:02:30.230> but<00:02:31.230> these<00:02:31.530> ones<00:02:31.739> as<00:02:32.100> I've<00:02:32.250> said

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
as possible but these ones as I've said

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.180 
as possible but these ones as I've said
before<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.850> lot<00:02:33.209> like<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> lot<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:34.110> damage<00:02:34.530> so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
before do a lot like a lot of damage so

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.250 
before do a lot like a lot of damage so
stone<00:02:35.489> board<00:02:35.850> as<00:02:36.090> always<00:02:36.420> your<00:02:36.720> best<00:02:36.840> friend

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
stone board as always your best friend

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.710 
stone board as always your best friend
use<00:02:37.860> your<00:02:38.040> totem<00:02:38.700> reset<00:02:39.030> ability<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.660> allows

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
use your totem reset ability that allows

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.280 
use your totem reset ability that allows
you<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.310> get<00:02:41.310> your<00:02:41.670> stone<00:02:42.330> borges<00:02:42.660> back<00:02:42.840> up<00:02:43.050> and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
you to get your stone borges back up and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.140 
you to get your stone borges back up and
use<00:02:43.500> your<00:02:43.530> healing<00:02:44.010> tide<00:02:44.250> totem<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:44.790> much<00:02:45.000> as

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
use your healing tide totem as much as

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.210 
use your healing tide totem as much as
you<00:02:45.239> can<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.350> yeah<00:02:46.500> these<00:02:46.709> will<00:02:46.860> probably<00:02:47.130> take

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
you can so yeah these will probably take

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.100 
you can so yeah these will probably take
you<00:02:47.370> around<00:02:47.519> 30<00:02:47.910> seconds<00:02:48.390> maybe<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> minute

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
you around 30 seconds maybe to a minute

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.530 
you around 30 seconds maybe to a minute
if<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.739> goes<00:02:49.890> any<00:02:49.950> further<00:02:50.310> than<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:51.000> you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
if it goes any further than that you you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.150 
if it goes any further than that you you
might<00:02:51.690> get<00:02:51.900> more<00:02:52.110> armor<00:02:52.470> stacks<00:02:52.769> which<00:02:53.010> would

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
might get more armor stacks which would

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.770 
might get more armor stacks which would
be<00:02:53.280> very<00:02:53.459> unfortunate<00:02:54.120> considering<00:02:54.450> does<00:02:54.750> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
be very unfortunate considering does a

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
lot of damage but just use what you can
