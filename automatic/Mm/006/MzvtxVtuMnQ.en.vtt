00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 and we can start with these for 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.820
 example two plants the first is a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.859
 antipasto is a Sicilian lobster tail 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.910

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.189
 there is fish and heaven escape the escape 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.680
 restaurants that make fish because of us 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.390

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.770
 giants that fresh angel frizzy that in 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.990
 few we get to have in Italy it is decoction 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.000
 particularity in butter not in oil 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.009
 because we have this Nordic influence 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.049
 of the countries I do n't know see the Germany of 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.920
 the Swiss aid where the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.420
 butter we have therefore done this 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.299
 sizzle this butter for inter use 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.500
 hazel and continuously spraying it 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.780
 Norway lobster tail 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.340

 it must be cooked completely but remains 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.119
 so soft, they lay it on the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.869
 pomegranate after which we prepared a 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.469
 his great hard king and with the help of 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.740
 a rasp a grater we do this 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.030
 granita that we put on the scampi 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.860

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.100
 chopped shredded on which there 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.550
 we support a pumpkin and zen sorbet 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.550
 some maldon salt and serve it 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.910

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.210
 we have in paper and we can't 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.100
 take it off like so many others there is always 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.860

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.850
 degrees left to rest for about 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.520
 half an hour forty minutes and is created on 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.860
 surface of that this film 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.010

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.770
 with mascarpone and raspberry crunch 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.600
 we close it and when it comes 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.510
 gently closed to the shape of a 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.870
 mozzarella looks just like mozzarella 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.959
 we then serve it with red wines 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.280
 mint and still very fresh effect 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.280
