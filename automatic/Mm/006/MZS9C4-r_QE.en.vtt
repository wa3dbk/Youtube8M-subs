00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
without a question this is probably one

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.890 
without a question this is probably one
of<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> most<00:01:14.150> interesting<00:01:15.150> attacks<00:01:15.720> I've

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
of the most interesting attacks I've

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.670 
of the most interesting attacks I've

seen especially at Crystal one but he

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:37.780 
seen especially at Crystal one but he
literally<00:01:23.220> runs<00:01:23.640> through<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.270> base

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790

which<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.360> pretty<00:01:56.810> interesting<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.440> it

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
which is pretty interesting that it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:06.180
