00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:11.549
 We changed our lives with caustic or bright words. 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:18.130
 with canvases We got out of the pack 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.710
 And hardly ever become others 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:36.560
 And you saw the emptiness But you did not see its causes 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.520
 And before you say anything 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 Better just keep silent. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.350
 The world speaks to me in a whisper Small pixels, sound 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.630
 in waves I haven't seen the light for so long 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.079
 Wirelessly with peace of mind 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.130
 Society tells me to talk with you on you 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.809
 But I do not see the point in this and there is no my guilt 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.920
 The fact that I once was the same as you 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.359
 But right now, we share with you gigabytes 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.859
 Share my hard drive memory 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.140
 On the disk, the most important thing is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.770
 And I will mentally sink to where 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.240
 No place for pathos and city bustle 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:48.969
 We changed our lives with caustic or bright words. 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.270
 with canvases We got out of the pack 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.819
 And hardly ever become others 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:55.819
 And you saw the emptiness But you did not see its causes 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:56.819
 And before you say anything 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:57.819
 Better just keep silent. 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:58.819
 We are the anomaly of the world And even my dear did not see 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:59.819
 me We do not measure distance for a long time 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.569
 in miles in my blood 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:02.579
 reach zero 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.959
 We have not seen the sky, we are at the time chalked around 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.360
 As if the shadow had become a long time and nobody cares 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.880
 Days and weeks go by, but we do not divide the world for a while 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.920
 I guess my soul left my body a long time ago. 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.490
 Share my hard drive memory 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.700
 On the disk, the most important thing is 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.350
 And I will mentally sink to where 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.670
 No place for pathos and city bustle
