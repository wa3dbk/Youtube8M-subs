down the trunk here the amount of

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.890 
down the trunk here the amount of
weeping<00:00:27.160> that's<00:00:27.610> going<00:00:27.970> on<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.480> tree<00:00:28.750> is

going to apply one of the few things
that<00:01:25.240> we<00:01:25.359> know<00:01:25.570> will<00:01:25.810> stop<00:01:26.079> this<00:01:26.429> this

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
that we know will stop this this

sprayed into the air I think in many

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.349 
sprayed into the air I think in many

cases these kinds of insecticides are

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.539 
cases these kinds of insecticides are
much<00:01:37.509> safer<00:01:37.840> than<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.350> airborne<00:01:38.799> types<00:01:39.100> this

inches<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:30.050> circumference<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:31.460> if<00:04:31.850> we're<00:04:32.150> to

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
inches in circumference so if we're to

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.780 
inches in circumference so if we're to
apply<00:04:32.600> ace<00:04:32.960> caps<00:04:33.380> every<00:04:33.620> four<00:04:33.980> inches<00:04:34.340> that's

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
apply ace caps every four inches that's

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.530 
apply ace caps every four inches that's
going<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.030> be<00:04:35.150> about<00:04:35.330> 16<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:35.900> them<00:04:36.140> or<00:04:36.260> so<00:04:37.540> for

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
going to be about 16 of them or so for

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.900 
going to be about 16 of them or so for
purposes<00:04:38.720> of<00:04:39.200> monitoring<00:04:40.010> we're<00:04:40.700> going<00:04:40.850> to

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
purposes of monitoring we're going to

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.460 
purposes of monitoring we're going to
remove<00:04:41.150> all<00:04:41.510> of<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.750> dead<00:04:41.930> limbs<00:04:42.140> from<00:04:42.380> the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
remove all of the dead limbs from the

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.409 
remove all of the dead limbs from the
tree<00:04:42.650> anything<00:04:43.130> that's<00:04:43.310> dead<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.669> then<00:04:44.210> see

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
tree anything that's dead and then see

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.150 
tree anything that's dead and then see
if<00:04:44.600> there's<00:04:44.810> any<00:04:44.990> more<00:04:45.169> retreat<00:04:45.590> this<00:04:45.860> will<00:04:46.040> be

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
if there's any more retreat this will be

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.920 
if there's any more retreat this will be
our<00:04:46.280> way<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.460> monitoring<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.240> trees<00:04:47.480> response

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
our way of monitoring the trees response

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.590 
our way of monitoring the trees response
if<00:04:48.230> there<00:04:49.040> is<00:04:49.190> more<00:04:49.490> die<00:04:49.700> back<00:04:49.940> we'll<00:04:50.240> be<00:04:50.270> able

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
if there is more die back we'll be able

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.750 
if there is more die back we'll be able
to<00:04:50.690> differentiate<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:51.650> if<00:04:52.400> there<00:04:52.580> isn't

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
to differentiate it and if there isn't

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.430 
to differentiate it and if there isn't
we'll<00:04:53.120> be<00:04:53.240> able<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.450> differentiate<00:04:53.810> that<00:04:54.229> as

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
we'll be able to differentiate that as

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.820 
we'll be able to differentiate that as
well

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
well

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.920 
well
so<00:04:55.010> if<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.729> tree<00:04:55.910> continues<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.570> live<00:04:56.720> and

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
so if the tree continues to live and

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.300 
so if the tree continues to live and
stay<00:04:57.080> green<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.380> think<00:04:57.710> we<00:04:57.770> could<00:04:57.919> say<00:04:58.100> we've

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
stay green I think we could say we've

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.940 
stay green I think we could say we've
won<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:58.700> battle
