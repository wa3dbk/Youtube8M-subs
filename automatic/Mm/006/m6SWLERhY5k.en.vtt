00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.230
 very good to all and welcome to me 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.820
 channel is still alive I paint and I bring you the 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.800
 episode 1 of worth opening 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.980
 envelopes you already know this series which each 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.509
 Wednesday I will open 5 envelopes 37 thousand 500 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.160
 I will spend coins and at the end of each 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.660
 video I'll put you how much I spend 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.460
 how much recovered in that video in 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.739
 concrete and how much I've spent and how much 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.110
 I've been recovered in all the episodes 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.149
 of this series so nothing this is the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.480
 team the week of this week with 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.010
 griezmann m nor what danilo good some 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.660
 player out there interesting there's no 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.789
 No player who can be worth much 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.129
 but if it's your turn for good it's a player 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.780
 quite interesting the 5 is just like 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.760
 I say so let's go there 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.339
 with the first one with howard on the cover 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.350
 and the play that comes out is the betsy 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.940
 well it's not bad to be the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.289
 first only the truth is that I 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.359
 It surprised me a bit because I was waiting for 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.920
 pretty bad players take out like 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.449
 four thousand coins for the anchor that 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.000
 I also took out a few coins and the 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.190
 Visit from Manchester that surprised me 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.950
 but I sold it for 1500 coins or things 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.780
 so second about with random on the cover 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.460
 we get samba player that I think that 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.049
 is in the top 10 or in the top 5 of 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.850
 players who play the most in the envelopes 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.170
 because the amount of 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.880
 times he plays 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.020
 but good for the rest in this envelope 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.360
 the networks that we get few coins 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.460
 third envelope with endorsement the cover and the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.710
 onion that comes out is the onion 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.530
 rodrÃ­guez see how good five players 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.670
 from the shiny oven that we're not going to take out 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.649
 a lot but good at least we already 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.659
 We ensure minimum 300 coins per each 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.759
 One and better that than not to be touched 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.799
 national balloons or equipment no no 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.210
 pulls out a lot of room with howard 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.810
 also on the cover and the game that we 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.000
 out is barkley player who is quite 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.380
 well he has five in bad store but it's 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.569
 that is worth very little I think I sold it for 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.369
 700 coins and there you see also 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.050
 catalyst that I do not understand many 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.670
 chemistry styles but I think it's from 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.560
 the best sellers or those that are best 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.420
 sell I think I sold it for 2,500 or 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.310
 3,000 coins and in the last envelope 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.250
 concrete on the cover we get brown 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.959
 besides hutchinson I was born and then 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.330
 good contracts and a change of position 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.860
 of mc or ms that I can not remember right now 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.840
 for how much I sold it but I do not think 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.640
 take out a lot too, maybe a thousand 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.049
 coins or things like that and well here 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.239
 you have what I told you in this 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.860
 episode since he has spent me 37 thousand 500 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.310
 coins that are five envelopes I have 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.790
 recovered selling all 25 thousand 612 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.250
 and the total balance is 11888 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.569
 lost coins for that the least and 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.099
 well you see that both in the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.599
 left as on the right as there 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.300
 exactly the same thing because being the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.340
 first episode well I can not put 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.780
 nothing more from the second then because the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.170
 left I will put what I have spent 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.910
 and I recovered in that episode and in the 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.010
 Right, I'll put what I'm wearing 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.840
 spent recovered and the total balance of 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.739
 all episodes of this series as well 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.870
