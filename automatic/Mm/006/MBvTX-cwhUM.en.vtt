00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.690
 our new resident somewhere in age 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.720
 a month and a half may be a little less and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.590
 I am a specialist for days, of course I was bedding 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.840
 old kit because the kitten was 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.090
 dirty he was hiding children in the car and 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.759
 painfully soiled by the way i'm long 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.460
 wanted a kitten was not very sad 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.700
 without it because it seems to me the code is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 soul 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.299
 show you our mess house soul is two of us 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.490
 boxes the first box is for 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.299
 the manâ€™s toilet had a tray 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.220
 we love to wallow there from at least you burst 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.460
 we like to build a niche there and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.300
 durkovat and we also bought such a wash 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.940
 because when he 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.200
 doing his business very much 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.360
 raking this sand and on the floor of the apartment 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.420
 that is why when he dives in a basin he 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.450
 okay there is rowing a box i'm not yet 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.380
 I managed to remove the kitten from my second 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.180
 the day is why well there 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.010
 that's how you see the usual one 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.400
 little kitty is playful that's very 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.770
 it was a pity when such a kid was sitting and 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.470
 crying seems to me should not be on 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.810
 the light so that children would be lost in that 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.800
 this is a cat I understood by his craving for sneakers 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.380
 here somehow cats to sneakers are indifferent to 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.140
 the code of course really likes to gnaw 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.930
 Tass this miracle choose it and I think 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.030
 that everything will be fine I think that with 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.510
 all the difficulties we can handle just 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.210
 the child was healthy and not ill 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.940
 beautiful not purebred can of course 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.910
 buy for a thousand hryvnia there is a super duper 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.820
 awesome cat I do not know when you 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.500
 lying on the stove and he mutters in my opinion 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.290
 what kind of appearance does he have to the drum? 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.190
 what else do you need to check the ears 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.500
 and maybe get to the vet so he 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.600
 looked generally not know much 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.239
 Scare to draw, too, do not want to 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.120

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.120
