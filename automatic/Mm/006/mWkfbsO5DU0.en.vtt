00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.200
 let's talk about one thing to me my note 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.200
 which are the floors proposed by the minister 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.460
 I live in a house so small that you can only enter with your stomach 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.149
 empty 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.149
 in that state to Spain going hungry to enter a flat 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.339
 I propose the following 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.720
 live in tents 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.960
 I wanted to know the good things you have to go to the English court because in that place 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.749
 wonderful on the third floor 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.409
 for the young woman 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.409
 suddenly there is a little camping 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.440
 brave among the blackmails of sports catheters 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.450
 and among the baseballs a campsite is like the Gallic village 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.760
 as the village of asterix a lot of tents 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.269
 a wooden fence your artificial lawn barbecue garden 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.269
 and a mannequin dressed as scouts and watching 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.760
 the opera of the moth 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 ramalho look at the store do not go to say something to the malikí 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.920
 you get sold the tent produced it 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.650
 that a country is here 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.750
 fantastic this is set smooth ground nice temperature 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 and the musical while the English cut 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.990
 then that you ride turin in a meadow and it's not the same 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.610
 we are going to start 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.150
 the pegs do not stick 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.570
 Bend 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.000
 no questions about how they have recorded this the English court forum 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.450
 that much more pain 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.320
 the appointment is in the meadow trying to prove the houses 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.220
 and next there are some girls 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.200
 that they have taken a hammer 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.710
 Pepe is very embarrassed to ask him 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.990
 because it's like saying 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.040
 nerja is the hammer that is that I am silly 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.040
 that deliver the homes will be to scratch 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.479
 you're in a campsite and you have to keep it in Milan too 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.890
 first is to look for a train track 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.000
 to record the houses 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.800
 and it seems a lie but you do not find a single stone and in the whole mountain 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.070
 Manuel Calderón recalled the festival of Benicassim and looking for a stone 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.489
 wide of the truth and here's a 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.489
 it's not worth leaving 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.709
 you do not find a stone because 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.709
 because the only stone of all the field 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.459
 it's just under the skin 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.689
 nothing else at night 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.510
 peace - ap 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.519
 finish assembling the store 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.889
 the look that will be mounted 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.649
 and the ambiguous data you say 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.749
 there we are not going to cavenez 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.479
 puts capacity five people 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.859
 then you have to touch them 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.729
 because that label 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:56.579
 what it says is how you have to put five people to look like a store 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.669
 campaign how they have to be expensive at bedtime 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.159
 you have to go there when it's time to sleep in a camping tent 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.069
 One thing happens that people have not stopped to think 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.099
 and is that in the relationship 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.889
 rest hours sleep 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.209
 it is upside down 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.749
 The more hours you sleep 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.749
 more tired of getting up 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.449
 one hour in a tent now equals the harvest room 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.299
 death in four hours and you wake up as if you had harvested 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.349
 6 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.349
 also currently 12 hours 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.209
 already manifest to see 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:53.489
 tents make them from that material that does not sweat 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.639
 barac 19 months until more than 12 in the morning 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.859
 the sun alain greenhouse effect 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:01.739
 the whole school 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.500
 Yesterday you entered into your own sweat so you have running dessalines 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.769
 knowing shotgun because if there are not that people who have become less 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.529
 but it is what we have and we have to take care of it as if it were a treasure 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.419
 there are people who padlock the tent 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:23.309
 the lock that you do not decide 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:25.620
 polished a padlock 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.640
 that there will be in that impenetrable fortress to overcome it 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.740
 iguaran chandelier made change gold and diamonds 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.499
 on the other side of the marble altar and 2010 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:41.149
 a padlock and quintana holes for a thief who had a moral check 

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:43.719
 very concrete 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.599
 bad enough to lift a zipper and enter to steal 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.290
 but honest enough not to take a nail scissors and cut the 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.290
 cloth 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:01.669
 arriaga 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.509
 because those metal frames with fabric on top 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.339
 how things continue as they are 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.539
 they are going to be the only housing 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.539
 and gymnastic said - they hold 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.599
 now
