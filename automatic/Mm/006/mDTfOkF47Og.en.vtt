00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.709 
went back to Xin anima so I went from a
map<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.640> had<00:00:50.789> packed<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.180> bunch<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.570> these

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
map I had packed a bunch and all these

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
map I had packed a bunch and all these

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
things and I went back down to a map

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.520 
things and I went back down to a map
that<00:00:54.420> didn't<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.070> definitely

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
that didn't so it was definitely

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.200 
that didn't so it was definitely
interesting<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:58.649> first<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.550> grew<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
interesting at first but I grew to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660 
interesting at first but I grew to
absolutely<00:01:01.199> love<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.829> map<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
absolutely love this map and I think I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
absolutely love this map and I think I
ended<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.090> playing<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:04.290> much<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
ended up playing it just as much as I

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.120 
ended up playing it just as much as I
played<00:01:05.159> Therese<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.720> more<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:08.010> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
played Therese if not more and this is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.910 
played Therese if not more and this is
one<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.340> those<00:01:08.430> maps<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.869> determined<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
one of those maps I was determined to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.070 
one of those maps I was determined to
get<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> higher<00:01:11.760> round<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.330> kept<00:01:12.630> playing<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
get to a higher round I kept playing it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.830 
get to a higher round I kept playing it
so<00:01:13.409> much<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.979> played<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.610> map<00:01:14.850> every<00:01:15.360> single

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
so much I played this map every single

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.749 
so much I played this map every single
day<00:01:16.049> trying<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> high<00:01:17.610> around

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
day trying to get to a high around

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.060 
day trying to get to a high around
training<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.630> high<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.110> leaderboards

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
training as high as I can leaderboards

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.929 
training as high as I can leaderboards
and<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:22.650> not<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.950> 303<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.790> this

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and I think it's not like 303 in this

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.730 
and I think it's not like 303 in this
map<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.450> that's<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.930> how<00:01:25.049> much<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.380> tried

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
map so that's that's how much I tried

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.830 
map so that's that's how much I tried
but<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.430> again<00:01:26.670> aren't<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.299> really

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
but then again aren't you do much really

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.410 
but then again aren't you do much really
easy<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.939> 300<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.210> map

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
easy to get you like 300 on this map

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
easy to get you like 300 on this map
because<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.960> after<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.650> certain<00:01:31.860> round<00:01:32.159> only<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
because I'm after a certain round only a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.670 
because I'm after a certain round only a
certain<00:01:32.790> amount<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.090> zombies<00:01:33.270> spawn<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.930> um

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
certain amount of zombies spawn in um

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.649 
certain amount of zombies spawn in um
but<00:01:35.220> yeah<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.640> from<00:01:35.820> personal<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.540> for

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
but yeah just from personal just for

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.390 
but yeah just from personal just for
memories<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.170> stuff<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
memories and stuff like that this is a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
memories and stuff like that this is a
great<00:01:38.820> map<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.270> played<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.020> much<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590

had so much fun on it so let's talk
about<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.649> map<00:01:44.070> itself<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.850> layout<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
about the map itself the layout of the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.499 
about the map itself the layout of the
map<00:01:45.570> ok<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.140> first<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.829> know<00:01:46.920> Numa<00:01:47.250> um<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.299> map

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
map ok so first you know Numa um the map

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.719 
map ok so first you know Numa um the map
size<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.170> think<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.560> map<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> perfect

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
size I think the map is just the perfect

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.420 
size I think the map is just the perfect
size<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> don't<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:51.990> too<00:01:52.320> big<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.009> could

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
size I don't think it's too big it could

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.700 
size I don't think it's too big it could
be<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:54.090> bit<00:01:54.329> smaller<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
be a little bit smaller but I think the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.030 
be a little bit smaller but I think the
map<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.630> perfect<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:57.780> ideal<00:01:57.960> size<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.950> not

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
map is a perfect or ideal size it's not

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.609 
map is a perfect or ideal size it's not
too<00:01:59.490> far<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.090> run<00:02:00.210> from<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.630> point<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.259> another

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
too far to run from one point to another

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.670 
too far to run from one point to another
and<00:02:02.340> unlike<00:02:03.119> some<00:02:03.659> other<00:02:03.930> zombie<00:02:04.290> maps<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and unlike some other zombie maps I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.830 
and unlike some other zombie maps I
think<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.040> map<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.880> absolute

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
think this map is just the absolute

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.770 
think this map is just the absolute
perfect<00:02:07.320> size<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> perk<00:02:09.060> system<00:02:09.479> if

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
perfect size then for the perk system if

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.740 
perfect size then for the perk system if
perk<00:02:09.959> systems<00:02:10.349> also

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
perk systems also

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.750 
perk systems also
interesting<00:02:11.200> when<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.800> open<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.220> door<00:02:12.460> it's

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
interesting when you open the door it's

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.370 
interesting when you open the door it's
never<00:02:13.270> going<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.600> be<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.870> same<00:02:14.110> person

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
never going to be the same person

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.440 
never going to be the same person
sometimes<00:02:15.040> looking<00:02:15.370> like<00:02:15.550> yogurt<00:02:16.060> or<00:02:16.300> not

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
sometimes looking like yogurt or not

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.450 
sometimes looking like yogurt or not
three<00:02:16.960> times<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.530> row<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.890> call<00:02:18.160> room<00:02:18.190> or

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
three times in a row in the call room or

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.150 
three times in a row in the call room or
something<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:19.020> but<00:02:20.020> usually<00:02:20.800> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
something like that but usually the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.610 
something like that but usually the
perks<00:02:21.460> flip-flop<00:02:22.060> around<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> map<00:02:22.660> each<00:02:22.960> game

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
perks flip-flop around the map each game

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.530 
perks flip-flop around the map each game
so<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:24.700> different<00:02:25.000> there's<00:02:25.480> different

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
so it's different there's different

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.870 
so it's different there's different
gameplay<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.920> find<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.520> be<00:02:27.550> really

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
gameplay and I find that to be really

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.390 
gameplay and I find that to be really
interesting<00:02:28.450> also<00:02:29.110> what<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.040> about<00:02:30.130> this

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
interesting also what I like about this

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.130 
interesting also what I like about this
is<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.760> think<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.180> first<00:02:31.390> map<00:02:31.750> to

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
is that I think this is the first map to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.120 
is that I think this is the first map to
bring<00:02:32.530> back<00:02:32.770> ah<00:02:33.570> box<00:02:34.570> moving<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.830> was<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
bring back ah box moving this was the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.710 
bring back ah box moving this was the
first<00:02:36.400> map<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.730> actually<00:02:37.120> had<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.480> teddy

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
first map that actually had the teddy

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.420 
first map that actually had the teddy
bear<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.230> once<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> bulk<00:02:39.310> of

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
bear so once you have the bulk of

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.980 
bear so once you have the bulk of
certain<00:02:39.700> on<00:02:39.790> times<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.570> bomb<00:02:40.780> should

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
certain on times the bomb should

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.050 
certain on times the bomb should
actually<00:02:41.230> move<00:02:41.680> around<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.070> map<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.580> when

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
actually move around the map and when

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.270 
actually move around the map and when
you<00:02:43.180> compare<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:43.989> map<00:02:44.260> from<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.830> verruckt

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
you compare this map from like verruckt

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.720 
you compare this map from like verruckt
and<00:02:45.520> nostril<00:02:45.970> tone<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:47.320> kind<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:48.010> paved<00:02:48.489> the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
and nostril tone it kind of paved the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.770 
and nostril tone it kind of paved the
way<00:02:48.850> for<00:02:49.620> derice<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.920> big<00:02:51.610> time<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.120> have<00:02:52.330> the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
way for derice a big time you have the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.470 
way for derice a big time you have the
blocks<00:02:53.020> start<00:02:54.010> moving<00:02:54.400> around<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:55.209> have<00:02:55.330> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
blocks start moving around you have the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.270 
blocks start moving around you have the
wonder<00:02:55.810> weapon<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.410> first<00:02:56.770> map<00:02:57.040> that

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
wonder weapon this is a first map that

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.640 
wonder weapon this is a first map that
actually<00:02:57.310> had<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.120> Wonder<00:02:58.570> waffle<00:02:59.020> which<00:02:59.500> a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
actually had the Wonder waffle which a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.990 
actually had the Wonder waffle which a
lot<00:02:59.800> of<00:02:59.890> people<00:03:00.130> don't<00:03:00.250> know<00:03:00.489> about<00:03:00.640> right

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
lot of people don't know about right

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.970 
lot of people don't know about right
without<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.780> mask<00:03:02.020> result<00:03:02.500> they<00:03:02.680> might<00:03:02.860> have

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
without this mask result they might have

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.470 
without this mask result they might have
not<00:03:03.130> had<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.370> Wonder<00:03:03.670> waffle<00:03:04.060> we<00:03:04.150> might<00:03:04.360> have

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
not had the Wonder waffle we might have

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.260 
not had the Wonder waffle we might have
not<00:03:05.080> had<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.560> lot<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:05.980> things<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.550> zombies<00:03:07.030> I

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
not had a lot of things in zombies I

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.540 
not had a lot of things in zombies I
would<00:03:07.690> probably<00:03:07.810> put<00:03:08.020> up<00:03:08.140> eventually<00:03:08.800> but<00:03:09.489> I

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
would probably put up eventually but I

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.729 
would probably put up eventually but I
find<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:09.970> she<00:03:10.150> didn't<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:10.480> definitely<00:03:11.350> paved

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
find that she didn't I definitely paved

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.940 
find that she didn't I definitely paved
the<00:03:12.100> way<00:03:12.130> for<00:03:12.640> juries<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.930> he<00:03:14.500> had<00:03:14.680> all<00:03:14.860> those

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
the way for juries and he had all those

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.830 
the way for juries and he had all those
little<00:03:15.100> Easter<00:03:15.549> eggs<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.000> map<00:03:16.180> also<00:03:16.480> that

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
little Easter eggs in this map also that

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.940 
little Easter eggs in this map also that
was<00:03:16.989> really<00:03:17.290> fun<00:03:17.500> that's<00:03:17.650> what<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.860> remember

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
was really fun that's what I remember

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.670 
was really fun that's what I remember
most<00:03:18.370> about<00:03:19.030> shi<00:03:19.360> no<00:03:19.450> numa<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:20.049> doing<00:03:20.500> all

most about shi no numa is doing all

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.289 
most about shi no numa is doing all
these<00:03:20.860> little<00:03:20.980> Easter<00:03:21.459> eggs<00:03:21.640> knocking<00:03:22.120> down

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
these little Easter eggs knocking down

some of you knew that but I did that a

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.729 
some of you knew that but I did that a

lot for just for fun in in role of war I

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.020 
lot for just for fun in in role of war I

during<00:03:46.209> World<00:03:46.390> War<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.900> did<00:03:47.350> that<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.500> lot<00:03:47.739> but

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
during World War I did that a lot but

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.060 
during World War I did that a lot but
overall<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.420> think<00:03:49.780> she<00:03:50.170> didn't<00:03:50.380> was<00:03:50.500> an

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
overall I think she didn't was an

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.270 
overall I think she didn't was an
amazing<00:03:51.579> map<00:03:51.880> um<00:03:52.350> there<00:03:53.350> could<00:03:53.709> be<00:03:53.739> some

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
amazing map um there could be some

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.650 
amazing map um there could be some
things<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.820> they<00:03:54.910> could<00:03:55.150> have<00:03:55.239> done<00:03:55.299> better

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
things that they could have done better

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.390 
things that they could have done better
I<00:03:55.840> think<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.470> pack-a-punch<00:03:56.950> would<00:03:57.310> have

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
I think the pack-a-punch would have

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.910 
I think the pack-a-punch would have
worked<00:03:57.519> mazing<00:03:58.180> on<00:03:58.570> shi<00:03:58.989> no<00:03:59.079> numa<00:03:59.380> just

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
worked mazing on shi no numa just

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.890 
worked mazing on shi no numa just
because<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.730> sheer<00:04:00.970> size<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.690> map

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
because of the sheer size of the map

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.990 
because of the sheer size of the map
like<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.260> said<00:04:02.410> it's<00:04:02.530> not<00:04:02.620> too<00:04:02.890> big<00:04:03.100> but<00:04:03.940> just

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
like I said it's not too big but just

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.310 
like I said it's not too big but just
for<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.269> size<00:04:04.540> of<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.750> map<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.110> how<00:04:05.200> they

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
for the size of the map of how they

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.810 
for the size of the map of how they
could<00:04:05.650> have<00:04:05.739> put<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:05.980> pack<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> bunch<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.549> machine

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
could have put a pack a bunch of machine

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.360 
could have put a pack a bunch of machine
in<00:04:06.970> there<00:04:07.180> but<00:04:08.079> of<00:04:08.380> course<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.799> pack<00:04:08.980> punches

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
in there but of course the pack punches

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.229 
in there but of course the pack punches
didn't<00:04:09.610> come<00:04:09.790> until

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
didn't come until

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.600 
didn't come until
derice<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.350> was<00:04:11.500> later<00:04:11.709> into<00:04:12.010> zombies

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
derice and that was later into zombies

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.110 
derice and that was later into zombies

personally I think the world of war is a

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.290 
personally I think the world of war is a
better<00:04:39.009> experience<00:04:39.490> or<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:39.909> sheen<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.090> new<00:04:40.210> my
