works<00:01:00.480> curl<00:01:00.899> defining<00:01:01.289> cream<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.949> i<00:01:02.640> apply<00:01:03.000> on

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
works curl defining cream and i apply on

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.169 
works curl defining cream and i apply on
as<00:01:04.110> much<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.800> that<00:01:04.830> will<00:01:05.250> give<00:01:05.399> me<00:01:05.550> some<00:01:05.789> slip

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:06.179 
as much on that will give me some slip

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.300 
as much on that will give me some slip
so<00:01:06.660> that<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.020> i<00:01:07.050> put<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> hook<00:01:07.679> through<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
so that when i put the hook through it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
so that when i put the hook through it
doesn't<00:01:08.700> tangle<00:01:08.940> into<00:01:09.420> my<00:01:09.539> hair<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> get

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
doesn't tangle into my hair and get

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.889 
doesn't tangle into my hair and get
stuck<00:01:10.590> i<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> twist<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.149> root<00:01:12.539> first

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
stuck i like to twist the root first

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.230 
stuck i like to twist the root first
just<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.800> bit<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> when<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> hook<00:01:15.000> on

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
just a little bit so that when a hook on

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.889 
just a little bit so that when a hook on
the<00:01:15.600> rod<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.880> hair<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.450> into<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
the rod all the hair can get into the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.650 
the rod all the hair can get into the
hook<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.550> after<00:01:20.550> that<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.210> pull<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.539> on

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
hook and after that I just pull it on

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.440 
hook and after that I just pull it on
through<00:01:21.690> and<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> curl<00:01:23.460> former<00:01:23.970> gets<00:01:24.240> all

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
through and if the curl former gets all

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.289 
through and if the curl former gets all
funky<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.409> twisted<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> wrong<00:01:26.340> way<00:01:26.610> just

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
funky and twisted up the wrong way just

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.740 
funky and twisted up the wrong way just
straighten<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.990> out<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.670> it'll<00:01:30.450> fix

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
straighten it out like so and it'll fix

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.590 
straighten it out like so and it'll fix
itself<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.150> throughout

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
itself and so I just do that throughout

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.420 
itself and so I just do that throughout
the<00:01:33.780> rest<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.079> my<00:01:34.259> hair<00:01:34.530> making<00:01:34.829> sure<00:01:35.159> not<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the rest of my hair making sure not to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.030 
the rest of my hair making sure not to
get<00:01:35.759> um<00:01:36.030> too<00:01:36.990> big<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.409> piece<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.649> hair

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
get um too big of a piece of hair

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.429 
get um too big of a piece of hair
because<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.759> too<00:01:39.119> big<00:01:39.390> then<00:01:39.780> it'll<00:01:40.290> get

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
because if it's too big then it'll get

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.039 
because if it's too big then it'll get
stuck<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.009> won't<00:01:41.189> go<00:01:41.310> through<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> key

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
stuck and it won't go through so the key

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
stuck and it won't go through so the key
is<00:01:43.189> smaller<00:01:44.189> sections<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.590> lots<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.829> slip<00:01:47.159> so

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
is smaller sections and lots of slip so

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.840 
is smaller sections and lots of slip so
I<00:01:48.119> used<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.659> 40<00:01:49.229> curlformers<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.640> came

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
I used all 40 curlformers that it came

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.149 
I used all 40 curlformers that it came
with<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:52.020> slept<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:52.469> it<00:01:52.649> overnight<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
with and I slept with it overnight and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.639 
with and I slept with it overnight and
it<00:01:53.729> was<00:01:53.969> really<00:01:54.450> horrible<00:01:54.659> sleeping<00:01:55.500> with

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
it was really horrible sleeping with

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.289 
it was really horrible sleeping with
them<00:01:55.939> but<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.240> made<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.570> through<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:59.180> once<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
them but I made it through and once you

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.740 
them but I made it through and once you
take<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.659> out<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.399> pull<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.549> off<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.149> hold

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
take it out just pull it off and hold

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.160 
take it out just pull it off and hold
your<00:02:04.229> hair<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.700> pull<00:02:06.000> off<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.539> curl

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
your hair and just pull off the curl

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:19.260 
your hair and just pull off the curl
former

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.200 

so<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.800> what<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.070> looks<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:21.460> after<00:02:21.730> I've

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
so this is what it looks like after I've

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.050 
so this is what it looks like after I've
taken<00:02:22.450> all<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.140> curlformers<00:02:23.380> out<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.340> I'm

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
taken all the curlformers out and I'm

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.170 
taken all the curlformers out and I'm
going<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.510> proceed<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.580> separating<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.790> curls

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
going to proceed to separating the curls

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.080 
going to proceed to separating the curls
and<00:02:28.450> styling<00:02:29.290> my<00:02:29.440> hair<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:30.280> can<00:02:30.460> separate<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
and styling my hair you can separate the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.750 
and styling my hair you can separate the
curls<00:02:31.330> as<00:02:31.600> many<00:02:31.900> times<00:02:32.200> as<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.680> want<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.100> the
