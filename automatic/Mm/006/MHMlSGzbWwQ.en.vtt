00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.290
 hey people what is it from the pile of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.420
 bionade I have the first video to the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 in bonn games update for you and now 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.990
 I show you all vehicles the new ones 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
 the game have been added 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.320
 I will divide these videos in three 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.539
 So once the vehicles then once 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.949
 clothes and once weapons and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.779
 then again a personal statement 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.020
 Everything in the update will be in three 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.520
 Videos today com at every hour 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.840
 You can come to about 1 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.700
 If so, look forward to it 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.620
 But now it's time for the cars 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.079
 and let's say we start 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.719
 with the first vehicle and that's the one 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.039
 pegasus of her you see here too 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.870
 just in any case a right 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.980
 horny vehicle you can not do it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.829
 now should be special in things 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.140
 but really change a lot 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.000
 things that you also otherwise on the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.469
 hungary and the vehicle is too 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.300
 really extremely cool I have that too 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.920
 times the vehicle tested briefly 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.019
 it goes in any case really well 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.700
 and in my opinion it even has 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.979
 a better traction of this vehicle 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.890
 That's why it's on everyone 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.860
 case one of my new favorites resp 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.570
 one of my favorite vehicles the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.640
 in the new update have been added 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.640
 but we do it directly with the second 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.439
 Car on and that's the eos winemaker 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.450
 You really can with this vehicle 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.950
 very cool stuff on the boys 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.470
 or many different ones 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.740
 attach stickers on this vehicle it 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.930
 for example, a lion pattern or a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.600
 cheetah pattern a peter had to enter 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.030
 monogram or just such 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.220
 geometric shapes and then stop 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.960
 such different stickers to 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.549
 example , then there are just everything ticker 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.649
 that's how crazy he is 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.479
 halt of all that it is important 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.189
 who likes it so I like that up 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.800
 every case very well with these 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.440
 geometric shapes resp 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.600
 I definitely think that monogram 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.600
 is correct that you are something and you 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.930
 Of course, this sticker or stop 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.040
 then that behind the background that 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 of course, also ticker with the color 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.140
 to change 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.660
 that could easily be normal 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.160
 paint and of course you can 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.020
 you then change the stickers as well 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.850
 means one is not just one 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.740
 sticker tied if you can hold that 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.240
 vehicle runs but you can of course 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.040
 be that thick choice already 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.570
 meet on the internet and if it stops 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.310
 you do not like one then stop 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.500
 the sticker selection of when you're in 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.700
 lausanne tauss customs change and me 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.980
 Let's say we go directly with 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.350
 the third vehicle continues the third 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.760
 vehicle is the gt around at this 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.380
 vehicle he already has me 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.900
 little bit because of his old porsche 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.970
 These were always so round then 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.620
 and also this vehicle is behind so 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.440
 Of course, it's also extremely rounded 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.210
 hinged doors and in this vehicle can 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.410
 as a spoiler a spare tire 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.700
 do it on the back 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.860
 I think there would have been rockstar 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.510
 maybe something else can come up 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.770
 but maybe you like it yes 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.870
 Write me in any case, in the 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.400
 comments are of interest to everyone 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.930
 fall and will be a pity 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.060
 find that this vehicle as extreme 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.550
 Expensive this vehicle costs almost 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.080
 as much as the aida and for that 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.810
 it's not a vehicle right now 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.180
 I find what you drive every day in gta 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.290
 already a bit overpriced but would have 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.970
 of course you can also think 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.770
 that semi-dry prices are very high 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.989
 attaches as we continue directly with 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.450
 the next vehicle and that is the one 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.010
 albani how krusell this vehicle can 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.900
 you do not say that much now 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.440
 it stops a vehicle after 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.930
 postwar era or stop what then 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.940
 The war was frequently built so 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.220
 at least describes the rockstar games 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.950
 on the legendary website 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.930
 motorsport this website of legendary 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.700
 motorsport was also complete again 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.530
 revised the cd synonymous right now 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.510
 again in the background all have 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.940
 this page layout really nice 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.340
 made or kept redone on each 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.380
 I really like the case of everyone 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.720
 I do not want the vehicle now 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.130
 so one of my favorites it is indeed a 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.420
 You could get muscle car though 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.980
 but not so possible now 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.570
 a vehicle which I probably think 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.550
 get or 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.230
 whatever I'll keep I got it 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.600
 I did get it with me 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.670
 show but can be 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.100
 no vehicle which I necessarily keep 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.080
 I'll have a short drive 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.790
 That's not like I say yes 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.130
 The muscle car can be a tutor 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.540
 so definitely it is 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.730
 now next a vehicle what I have you 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.340
 would recommend to buy it especially 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.420
 costs here also 200,000 gta 5000 for 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.210
 The people do not think so much money 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.160
 definitely not worth this 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.300
 you have to buy a vehicle yourself 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.950
 maybe you would like to see then 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.570
 the vehicle and you can see it now too 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.940
 again all vehicles in the overview 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.490
 So once the pegasus of your ben 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.130
 factor sterling gt and albani micro 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.320
 and, of course, vintners with the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.750
 extremely hot stick all vehicles 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.790
 do not cost about the same amount 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.410
 but the ground like big it as a 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.780
 outsider I'd say de Costedt yet 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.150
 200,000 is still ok but if 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.310
 you look at the prices of the pkv 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.680
 Osiris is the most expensive with two million 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.690
 vehicle what is currently in gta then 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.490
 in benz actros dÃ¶ring with almost one 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.330
 million gta 5 dollars also really expensive 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.830
 and your winemaker with 850,000 too 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.930
 really already at the leadership 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.000
 what you pay for the vehicles 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.770
 definitely has rockstar this 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.750
 I really priced very high 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.430
 did not think that it was so high 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.680
 I think now rather to 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.960
 example of cars so 858003 came today 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.360
 by rockstar it's really surprising 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.220
 In any case, I'm interested in you 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.810
 which finds the rock hall the price high 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.770
 definitely write me down 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.420
 in the comments 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.330
 what about the first video to the 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.100
 new update in golden gate park number 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.700
 1 I hope this video has you 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.320
 like 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.910
 if that's the case let me on everyone 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.180
 times a positive rating of 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.570
 anna broda we are going to the next part 1 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.570
 and 2
