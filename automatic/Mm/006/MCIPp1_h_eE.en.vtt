motion<00:00:41.850> which<00:00:42.059> allows<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> move

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
motion which allows it to move

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
motion which allows it to move
automatically<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.239> don't<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
automatically so you don't have to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.810 
automatically so you don't have to
program<00:00:46.170> any<00:00:47.030> movement<00:00:48.030> stuff<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:49.550> it<00:00:50.550> does

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
program any movement stuff but it does

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.150 
program any movement stuff but it does
come<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.690> downside<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.800> can't

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
come with a downside because you can't

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.920 
come with a downside because you can't
move<00:00:53.660> any<00:00:54.660> part<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> mob<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:57.000> example<00:00:57.510> his

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
move any part of a mob for example his

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.770 
move any part of a mob for example his
hand<00:00:58.289> because<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.460> linked<00:00:59.820> with<00:00:59.879> C<00:01:00.210> motion

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
hand because it's linked with C motion

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.500 
hand because it's linked with C motion
so<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> can't<00:01:01.440> make<00:01:01.680> them<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.190> high-five<00:01:03.120> for

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
so you can't make them go high-five for

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.620 
so you can't make them go high-five for
example<00:01:04.019> they<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.830> move<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:05.970> prefer<00:01:06.299> using

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
example they just move so I prefer using

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.149 
example they just move so I prefer using
my<00:01:07.020> own<00:01:07.290> C<00:01:07.680> motions<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.390> download<00:01:09.570> this

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
my own C motions so you download this

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.630 
my own C motions so you download this
then<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.729> save<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.380> into<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.560> folder<00:01:14.070> then

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
then you save it into a folder then

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.620 
then you save it into a folder then
