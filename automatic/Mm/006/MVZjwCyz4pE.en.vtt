00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.190
 all is the new review 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.349
 under the bikes we will go to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.829
 explain to you to show you to illustrate a 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.249
 branded product the knox lumen ok like 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:17.560
 you can see is this product is a lot 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.230
 particular and I think it has not 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.750
 very original market imitations 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.060
 it has a very low cost 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.970
 here you can see the article exactly 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.920
 ssl 326 that is called the luminary xmano 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.309
 that we're going to apply it in this 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.789
 case is on my bike my bike from 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.070
 race 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.739
 I think it can also be installed 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.500
 by mountain bike as long as it does not have in the 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.760
 brake disk now I go to see the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.730
 easy installation must be installed above 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.949
 the brakes on top of the brake group now 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.219
 I'll show you how I do it 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.530
 brakes that rotate in carbon but is not 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.870
 what brings the problem 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.229
 as you can see these are normal 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.979
 brakes that once you press excuse 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.560
 but I'm going here is this being pressed 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.020
 ok let's go see the easy 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.060
 product installation we pull it 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.310
 out 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.170
 let us assume that turning it is one 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.909
 very simple packaging a lot 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.490
 coarse but contains all the 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.680
 necessary to provide on the left 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.740
 how to assemble the battery but it will come to you 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.720
 already with battery mounted on the right vi 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.710
 show that you have to put it in the thread 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.470
 of the brake 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.930
 ok put it enough to make him 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.829
 pass the brake wire in between with 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.290
 the screw you see here inhabit in 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.310
 so that it is a bit already compressed 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.869
 now showing veil I'll show you 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.850
 few words you putting the thread e 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.750
 half when freney network will happen 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.530
 this few words you will have a stop 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.070
 a bicycle in the article 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.020
 as banal as ever thought because me 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.149
 at least I haven't yet in commerce 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.100
 seen 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.250
 let's go see the easy again 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.560
 installation 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.560
 as you can see it is put ok comes 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.020
 put on one side and on the other 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:27.180
 inside the thread then it goes to 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.459
 tighten trying already to keep it a 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.400
 a little 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.940
 sorry because if I try to use 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.270
 the other hand I'm not left-handed here 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.250
 can be tightened 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.120
 now I just have to understand from what the ato yes 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.790
 squeezes I apologize that I repeat with two 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.489
 hands gets much simpler 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.110
 now it's too screwed I owe it before 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:59.870
 unscrew that c enters inside 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.870
 ok once inside it is screwed 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.190
 holding it is I apologize but it 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.800
 support a phone according to the phone 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.830
 and I'll show you that with two hands it's 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.720
 a second one thing you want 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:22.110
 say ok already done as I told you with two 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.269
 hands is much simpler than what you do 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.540
 the immediate seal in a nutshell is 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.750
 been applied on the brake site as 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.489
 you can see here the life that is 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.820
 we went screwing up what it does 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.420
 it simply keeps you associated 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.700
 trying to focus 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.050
 here it keeps in tension at the clothespin 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.690
 so that not 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.290
 you don't arrive at the end of the race and what happens 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:54.610
 when one held back time of soul 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.070
 save fool when you brake yourself 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.420
 you will go to the stop because the thread goes to 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.810
 crush goes to press the pad like 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.680
 you can see and it's something I have 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.380
 found on the internet has a cost of 10 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.470
 euro plus shipping you when alone 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.660
 when you brake now you screw it up badly 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.859
 for that it remains a little lit. 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.650
 you should give it a little more play 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:28.330
 ok however its purpose is when you 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.300
 braking tac lights up and pretty like 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.310
 idea again I don't look at what remains 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.830
 turned on because it was mounted in a manner 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.020
 very coarse fast I do not have a 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.050
 support at the moment behind with me for 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.640
 fix the phone anyway I will 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.740
 advice to go fast rwc areas a 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.560
 very nice product is for the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.650
 safety and beyond if the original yes 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.510
 call the hand knox lamp I hope there is 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.650
 liked if you have any ideas 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.960
 tips 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.960
 I'm here bye and see you next time
