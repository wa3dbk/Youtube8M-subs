00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the jewelry Channel and all the sudden

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.450 
the jewelry Channel and all the sudden
people<00:00:38.130> are<00:00:38.340> seeing<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.420> lovely

people are seeing with this lovely
faceted<00:00:41.460> Jemmy<00:00:41.940> crystal<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.230> jewelry<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:43.920> so

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
faceted Jemmy crystal in jewelry and so

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.700 
faceted Jemmy crystal in jewelry and so
I<00:00:44.640> found<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.330> loads<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.900> people<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.380> it<00:00:46.560> now

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
I found that loads of people know it now

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.190 
I found that loads of people know it now
just<00:00:47.010> from<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:48.420> normally<00:00:48.870> forms

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
just from that it normally forms

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.920 
just from that it normally forms
massively<00:00:49.800> which<00:00:50.220> is<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:51.210> say<00:00:51.450> it<00:00:51.660> doesn't

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
massively which is to say it doesn't

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.980 
massively which is to say it doesn't
have<00:00:52.350> large<00:00:52.950> defined<00:00:53.760> crystals<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.750> can

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
have large defined crystals that you can

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.020 
have large defined crystals that you can
see<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> naked<00:00:55.470> eye<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.550> when<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.820> does

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
see with the naked eye but when it does

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.660 
see with the naked eye but when it does
form<00:00:57.330> crystals<00:00:57.870> they<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.170> exquisite<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.580> I'm

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
form crystals they are exquisite and I'm

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
form crystals they are exquisite and I'm
going<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.060> be<00:01:00.180> showing<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.630> a<00:01:00.660> few<00:01:00.900> of<00:01:00.960> those

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
going to be showing you a few of those

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.030 
going to be showing you a few of those
in<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.530> moment

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
in a moment

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.860 
in a moment
the<00:01:02.820> first<00:01:03.000> piece<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.360> going<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.630> show<00:01:03.810> you

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the first piece I'm going to show you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.929 
the first piece I'm going to show you
how<00:01:04.140> ever<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.559> massive<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> fairly

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
how ever is massive and this is fairly

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.680 
how ever is massive and this is fairly
typical<00:01:06.830> this<00:01:07.830> one's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.190> rather<00:01:08.370> pale<00:01:08.730> one<00:01:09.090> but

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
typical this one's a rather pale one but

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.100 
typical this one's a rather pale one but
you<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.500> idea<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.880> depth<00:01:12.150> at<00:01:12.690> that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you do get the idea of the depth at that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.680 
you do get the idea of the depth at that
lovely<00:01:13.740> sort<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.220> bluey<00:01:14.520> purpley<00:01:15.120> color<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
lovely sort of bluey purpley color it

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.969 
lovely sort of bluey purpley color it
gets<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.610> if<00:01:17.610> you're<00:01:18.480> desperate<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.800> hold

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
gets and if you're desperate to get hold

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.640 
gets and if you're desperate to get hold
of<00:01:20.100> tanzanite<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.180> isn't<00:01:21.390> dates<00:01:21.810> it's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
of tanzanite and this isn't dates it's

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.130 
of tanzanite and this isn't dates it's
like<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.100> find<00:01:23.370> it<00:01:23.490> too<00:01:23.610> expensive<00:01:23.900> this<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
like you find it too expensive this is

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.080 
like you find it too expensive this is
probably<00:01:25.800> you<00:01:26.370> can<00:01:26.550> probably<00:01:26.790> afford

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
probably you can probably afford

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.640 
probably you can probably afford
something<00:01:27.690> at<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.930> end<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.350> spectrum

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
something at this end of the spectrum

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.920 
something at this end of the spectrum
and<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.760> still<00:01:30.060> does<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.510> says<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and it still does what it says on the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.670 
and it still does what it says on the
tin<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.620> a<00:01:31.950> lovely<00:01:32.520> crystal<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.690> I<00:01:34.110> adore<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
tin it's a lovely crystal and I adore it

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.610 
tin it's a lovely crystal and I adore it
I<00:01:35.360> am<00:01:36.360> wearing<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.810> at<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> moment<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
I am wearing it at the moment this

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.830 
I am wearing it at the moment this
little<00:01:38.010> necklace<00:01:38.580> is<00:01:38.790> tanzanite<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.690> also

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
little necklace is tanzanite and I also

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.520

have<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.530> ring<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.930> find<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.260> most

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
have it in my ring I find it the most

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.860 
have it in my ring I find it the most
cheering<00:01:44.370> crystal<00:01:44.850> I've<00:01:44.970> ever<00:01:45.150> come<00:01:45.450> across

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
cheering crystal I've ever come across

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.450 
cheering crystal I've ever come across
now<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.799> mean<00:01:47.400> like<00:01:47.760> let's<00:01:48.119> treat<00:01:49.460> let's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
now I don't mean like let's treat let's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.370 
now I don't mean like let's treat let's
work<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.119> sort<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.510> deep<00:01:51.780> dark<00:01:52.170> depression

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
work on sort of deep dark depression

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.469 
work on sort of deep dark depression
because<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.400> are<00:01:53.520> crystals<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.270> much

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
because there are crystals that are much

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.109 
because there are crystals that are much
better<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.159> but<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.520> very<00:01:56.820> good<00:01:57.000> if

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
better for that but it's very good if

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.600 
better for that but it's very good if
you're<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.420> having<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> bad<00:01:57.869> day<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.460> of

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
you're just having a bad day and kind of

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.670 
you're just having a bad day and kind of
want<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.270> do<00:02:00.720> something<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.140> lift<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.650> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
want to just do something to lift you a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.609 
want to just do something to lift you a
little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:03.119> also<00:02:03.390> aligns<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.409> three

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
little bit it also aligns with three

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.580 
little bit it also aligns with three

third eye and the crown and it will

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.370 
third eye and the crown and it will
cleanse<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.610> open<00:02:12.060> these<00:02:12.180> chakras<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.110> then

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
cleanse and open these chakras and then

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.920 
cleanse and open these chakras and then
align<00:02:13.800> them<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.280> anchor

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
align them and anchor

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.470 
align them and anchor

going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.379> show<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.620> another<00:02:33.799> one<00:02:34.189> now<00:02:34.340> this

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
going to show you another one now this

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.550 
going to show you another one now this
one<00:02:34.790> has<00:02:35.030> actually<00:02:35.329> formed<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.930> crystal<00:02:36.409> it's

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
one has actually formed a crystal it's

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.349 
one has actually formed a crystal it's
not<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.069> greatest<00:02:37.400> quality<00:02:37.969> but<00:02:38.209> it's

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
not of the greatest quality but it's

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.740 
not of the greatest quality but it's
still<00:02:38.540> very<00:02:38.599> pretty<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.299> look<00:02:41.480> at<00:02:41.629> it

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
still very pretty and if you look at it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.559 
still very pretty and if you look at it
you<00:02:41.840> can<00:02:41.989> see<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.349> has<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> very<00:02:42.829> distinctive

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
you can see it has a very distinctive

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.470 
you can see it has a very distinctive
chisel<00:02:44.569> shape<00:02:44.900> this<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.439> typical<00:02:46.159> of<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:47.359> you

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
chisel shape this is typical of when you

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.259 
chisel shape this is typical of when you
get<00:02:47.689> tanzanite<00:02:48.349> crystals<00:02:48.939> when<00:02:49.939> you<00:02:50.060> have<00:02:50.239> a

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
get tanzanite crystals when you have a

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.569 
get tanzanite crystals when you have a
crystal<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.109> energy<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.680> very<00:02:51.829> directional

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
crystal the energy is very directional

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.000 
crystal the energy is very directional
and<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.849> can<00:02:53.030> be<00:02:53.150> quite<00:02:53.299> useful<00:02:53.389> in<00:02:53.989> one<00:02:54.230> area

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
and this can be quite useful in one area

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.059 
and this can be quite useful in one area
of<00:02:55.340> physical<00:02:55.879> crystal<00:02:56.359> healing<00:02:57.069> tanzanite

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
of physical crystal healing tanzanite

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.940 
of physical crystal healing tanzanite
works<00:02:58.400> really<00:02:58.669> well<00:02:59.000> with<00:02:59.269> healing

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
works really well with healing

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.349 
works really well with healing
connective<00:03:00.950> tissue<00:03:01.219> so<00:03:01.669> when<00:03:01.969> you<00:03:02.150> have

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
connective tissue so when you have

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.990 
connective tissue so when you have
damage<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.349> tendons<00:03:03.769> or<00:03:03.919> ligaments<00:03:04.370> it

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
damage to the tendons or ligaments it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.789 
damage to the tendons or ligaments it
can<00:03:05.180> really<00:03:05.419> stimulate<00:03:05.689> the<00:03:06.139> healing<00:03:06.349> in<00:03:06.650> this

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
can really stimulate the healing in this

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.679 
can really stimulate the healing in this
area<00:03:07.189> and<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.639> don't<00:03:07.700> know<00:03:07.939> if<00:03:08.060> any<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:08.510> have

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
area and I don't know if any of you have

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.199 
area and I don't know if any of you have
had<00:03:08.900> damaged<00:03:09.409> ligaments<00:03:09.889> but<00:03:10.219> they<00:03:10.760> take<00:03:11.030> a

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
had damaged ligaments but they take a

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.750 
had damaged ligaments but they take a
very<00:03:11.689> long<00:03:11.930> time<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.439> heal<00:03:12.680> it's<00:03:12.919> probably<00:03:13.459> far

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
very long time to heal it's probably far

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.640 
very long time to heal it's probably far
more<00:03:13.819> but<00:03:14.389> that<00:03:14.629> causes<00:03:15.049> far<00:03:15.260> more<00:03:15.409> of<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
more but that causes far more of the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.740 
more but that causes far more of the
pain<00:03:15.889> when<00:03:16.069> you<00:03:16.159> have<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.340> broken<00:03:16.639> bone<00:03:16.819> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
pain when you have a broken bone the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.159 
pain when you have a broken bone the
Related<00:03:18.459> tendon<00:03:19.459> tears<00:03:19.849> than<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:20.780> actual

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
Related tendon tears than the actual

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.879 
Related tendon tears than the actual
healing<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.799> bone<00:03:22.900> if<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.199> aim<00:03:24.590> the

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
healing of the bone if you aim the

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.399 
healing of the bone if you aim the
crystal<00:03:25.340> directly<00:03:25.940> at<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.479> area<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.169> can

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
crystal directly at the area this can

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.080 
crystal directly at the area this can
really<00:03:27.620> stimulate<00:03:27.979> the<00:03:28.459> healing<00:03:28.669> you<00:03:28.909> don't

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
really stimulate the healing you don't

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.759 
really stimulate the healing you don't
have<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.419> keep<00:03:29.599> doing<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:29.989> over<00:03:30.139> and<00:03:30.349> over<00:03:30.530> it

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
have to keep doing it over and over it

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.439 
have to keep doing it over and over it
just<00:03:30.829> started<00:03:31.430> off<00:03:31.579> that<00:03:31.849> way<00:03:31.909> and<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.359> will

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
just started off that way and it will

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.839 
just started off that way and it will
stimulate<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:33.049> healing<00:03:33.319> process<00:03:33.979> so<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.310> will

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
stimulate the healing process so it will

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.189 
stimulate the healing process so it will
be<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.239> little<00:03:35.569> speedier<00:03:36.109> than<00:03:36.229> normal<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.959> also

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
be a little speedier than normal it also

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.399 
be a little speedier than normal it also
helps<00:03:40.129> to<00:03:40.370> go<00:03:41.209> into<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.569> deep<00:03:41.959> state<00:03:42.349> of

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
helps to go into a deep state of

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.610 
helps to go into a deep state of
meditation<00:03:42.699> and<00:03:43.720> if<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.870> have<00:03:45.109> something

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
meditation and if you have something

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.439 
meditation and if you have something
like<00:03:45.829> this<00:03:46.099> sometimes<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.790> can<00:03:47.030> get<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.209> hold

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
like this sometimes you can get a hold

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.360 
like this sometimes you can get a hold
of<00:03:47.569> these<00:03:47.689> really<00:03:48.169> pretty<00:03:48.500> little<00:03:48.919> crystals

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
of these really pretty little crystals

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.969 
of these really pretty little crystals
in<00:03:49.879> a<00:03:49.970> group<00:03:50.359> so<00:03:50.629> you<00:03:50.750> buy<00:03:51.229> them<00:03:51.470> as<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.620> bunch

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:51.979 
in a group so you buy them as a bunch

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:56.259 
in a group so you buy them as a bunch
and<00:03:52.599> you<00:03:53.599> can<00:03:54.199> sit<00:03:55.040> in<00:03:55.069> a<00:03:55.280> stone<00:03:55.549> circle<00:03:55.849> with

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
and you can sit in a stone circle with

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.559 
and you can sit in a stone circle with
these<00:03:56.509> and<00:03:57.159> meditate<00:03:58.159> and<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.939> can<00:03:59.120> take<00:03:59.329> you

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
these and meditate and it can take you

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.309 
these and meditate and it can take you
other<00:03:59.750> places<00:04:00.109> it<00:04:00.590> can<00:04:00.909> it<00:04:01.909> actually<00:04:02.120> can<00:04:03.019> take

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
other places it can it actually can take

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.349 
other places it can it actually can take
you<00:04:03.439> to<00:04:03.590> other<00:04:03.709> dimensions<00:04:04.359> etcetera

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
you to other dimensions etcetera

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
you work with tanzanite you work with a

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.140 
you work with tanzanite you work with a
grounding<00:04:12.949> crystal<00:04:13.370> as<00:04:13.489> well<00:04:13.729> you<00:04:13.879> don't<00:04:14.000> have

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
grounding crystal as well you don't have

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.879 
grounding crystal as well you don't have
to<00:04:14.299> work<00:04:14.479> with<00:04:14.659> them<00:04:14.810> at<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.019> same<00:04:15.229> time<00:04:15.620> but

tanzanite at the tip and very often if
these<00:04:49.449> are<00:04:49.659> being<00:04:49.840> used<00:04:49.870> in<00:04:50.229> jewelry<00:04:50.680> they'll

these are being used in jewelry they'll
be<00:04:51.009> heat<00:04:51.250> treated<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:51.789> that<00:04:51.909> will<00:04:52.150> bring<00:04:52.360> all

nights usually that we usually think of
tanzanite<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:01.300> has<00:05:01.509> a<00:05:01.539> different<00:05:01.930> energy

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
tanzanite this has a different energy

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.649 
tanzanite this has a different energy
when<00:05:02.530> it<00:05:02.650> has<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:03.039> yellow<00:05:03.400> color<00:05:03.669> it<00:05:04.000> brings

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
when it has the yellow color it brings

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.350 
when it has the yellow color it brings
the<00:05:04.840> energy<00:05:05.169> down<00:05:05.319> to<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.620> solar<00:05:05.949> plexus<00:05:06.360> so

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
the energy down to the solar plexus so

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.439 
the energy down to the solar plexus so
it<00:05:07.690> still<00:05:08.169> has<00:05:08.470> this<00:05:08.740> really<00:05:09.190> lovely<00:05:09.490> cheerful

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
it still has this really lovely cheerful

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.969 
it still has this really lovely cheerful
vibrancy<00:05:11.349> but<00:05:12.250> it's<00:05:12.610> also<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:14.590> brings<00:05:14.710> you

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
vibrancy but it's also it brings you

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.710 
vibrancy but it's also it brings you
more<00:05:15.159> into<00:05:15.400> your<00:05:15.520> body<00:05:15.759> into<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.270> physical

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
more into your body into the physical

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.279 
more into your body into the physical
body<00:05:16.960> when<00:05:17.259> you're<00:05:17.380> working<00:05:17.770> with<00:05:17.979> it<00:05:18.220> and

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
body when you're working with it and

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.740 
body when you're working with it and
this<00:05:20.289> leads<00:05:20.650> into<00:05:21.009> another<00:05:21.370> way<00:05:22.300> of<00:05:22.479> working

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
this leads into another way of working

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.959 
this leads into another way of working
but<00:05:23.080> this<00:05:23.380> is<00:05:23.590> something<00:05:23.889> that<00:05:24.159> I'm<00:05:24.580> going<00:05:24.849> to

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
but this is something that I'm going to

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.330 
but this is something that I'm going to
suggest<00:05:25.379> only<00:05:26.379> do<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.650> if<00:05:26.740> you're<00:05:26.860> used<00:05:27.190> to

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
suggest only do it if you're used to

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.580 
suggest only do it if you're used to
working<00:05:27.580> with<00:05:28.030> crystals<00:05:28.539> and<00:05:28.840> you're<00:05:29.169> used<00:05:29.440> to

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
working with crystals and you're used to

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.680 
working with crystals and you're used to
working<00:05:29.860> on<00:05:30.400> your<00:05:30.729> personal<00:05:31.270> development

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
working on your personal development

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.170 
working on your personal development
because<00:05:32.469> this<00:05:33.039> can<00:05:33.250> throw<00:05:33.460> things<00:05:33.729> up<00:05:33.969> that

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
because this can throw things up that

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.999 
because this can throw things up that
maybe<00:05:34.360> you<00:05:34.599> don't<00:05:34.810> want<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:34.990> look<00:05:35.229> at<00:05:35.380> just<00:05:35.680> yet

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
going to be used in jewelry they would

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.510 
going to be used in jewelry they would
have<00:06:01.960> heat<00:06:02.169> treated<00:06:02.650> it<00:06:02.800> so<00:06:03.039> it<00:06:03.130> all<00:06:03.279> looked

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.140 
have heat treated it so it all looked
the<00:06:03.669> same<00:06:03.699> but<00:06:04.590> in<00:06:05.590> healing<00:06:06.250> we<00:06:06.430> can<00:06:06.610> use<00:06:06.909> this

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
the same but in healing we can use this

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.439 
the same but in healing we can use this
in<00:06:07.389> a<00:06:07.479> very<00:06:07.690> specific<00:06:08.469> way<00:06:09.060> first<00:06:10.060> of<00:06:10.300> all

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
in a very specific way first of all

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.269 
in a very specific way first of all
you've<00:06:10.659> got<00:06:10.690> the<00:06:10.870> balance<00:06:11.229> of<00:06:11.710> heaven<00:06:12.159> and

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:12.279 
you've got the balance of heaven and

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.769 
you've got the balance of heaven and
earth<00:06:12.490> and<00:06:12.789> you've<00:06:12.909> got<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.240> balance<00:06:13.449> of

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
earth and you've got the balance of

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.930 
earth and you've got the balance of
masculine<00:06:14.409> and<00:06:14.560> feminine<00:06:14.819> similar<00:06:15.819> to

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
masculine and feminine similar to

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.170 
masculine and feminine similar to
ametrine<00:06:16.539> but<00:06:17.469> in<00:06:17.740> addition<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.520> that<00:06:18.699> it

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
ametrine but in addition to that it

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.370 
ametrine but in addition to that it
seems<00:06:19.719> to<00:06:20.130> really<00:06:21.130> cleanse<00:06:21.880> away<00:06:22.210> any<00:06:23.020> of<00:06:23.199> the

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
seems to really cleanse away any of the

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.649 
seems to really cleanse away any of the
crap<00:06:23.740> that<00:06:23.770> you<00:06:24.099> don't<00:06:24.520> want<00:06:24.819> you<00:06:25.240> know<00:06:25.330> if<00:06:25.509> you

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:25.659 
crap that you don't want you know if you
