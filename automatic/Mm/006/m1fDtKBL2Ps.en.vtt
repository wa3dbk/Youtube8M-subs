00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
make snow globes by myself on my own
it's<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.850> cool<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.600> actually<00:01:00.750> really

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
it's so cool so it's actually really

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.170 
it's so cool so it's actually really
simple<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.859> also<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.280> inexpensive

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
simple and it's also very inexpensive

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.820 
simple and it's also very inexpensive
and<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.420> make<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.049> ton<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> snow

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.020 
globes with just like a little bit of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
supplies so obviously snow globes are

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.219 
supplies so obviously snow globes are
something<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.869> go<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

put a little bit of glitter in there and

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.719 
put a little bit of glitter in there and
I'm<00:04:44.690> also<00:04:44.870> just<00:04:45.229> going<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.620> sprinkle<00:04:45.979> a<00:04:46.310> few<00:04:46.340> of

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
I'm also just going to sprinkle a few of

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.580 
I'm also just going to sprinkle a few of
the<00:04:46.880> glittery<00:04:47.270> snowflakes<00:04:47.900> also<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:50.560> this<00:04:51.560> is

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
the glittery snowflakes also and this is

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.110 
the glittery snowflakes also and this is
probably<00:04:51.830> my<00:04:52.130> favorite<00:04:52.490> part<00:04:52.639> of<00:04:52.789> the<00:04:52.910> process

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
probably my favorite part of the process

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.610 
probably my favorite part of the process
because<00:04:53.660> then<00:04:53.840> it<00:04:53.930> looks<00:04:54.110> like<00:04:54.259> it's<00:04:54.440> snowing

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
because then it looks like it's snowing

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.589 
because then it looks like it's snowing
