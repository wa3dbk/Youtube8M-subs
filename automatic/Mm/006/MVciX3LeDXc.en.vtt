00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.999 
different ways of doing it a lot of
people<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:12.960> an<00:00:13.019> all-in-one<00:00:13.349> method<00:00:13.889> which

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
people have an all-in-one method which

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.400 
people have an all-in-one method which
is<00:00:14.160> fine<00:00:14.490> but<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.269> cream<00:00:15.509> my<00:00:15.690> sugar<00:00:16.379> and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
is fine but I like to cream my sugar and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.840 
is fine but I like to cream my sugar and
my<00:00:16.590> butter<00:00:16.619> together<00:00:17.160> first<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.640> then<00:00:17.730> add

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
my butter together first and then add

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.070 
my butter together first and then add
the<00:00:17.880> ingredients<00:00:18.180> after<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> think<00:00:19.020> it

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
the ingredients after that I think it

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.840 
the ingredients after that I think it
makes<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.289> lighter<00:00:19.500> sponge<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> first

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
makes a lighter sponge but the first

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.800 
makes a lighter sponge but the first
thing<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.210> need<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.660> any

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
thing that you need to do for any

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.960 
thing that you need to do for any
victory<00:00:22.109> sponge<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.619> weigh<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.369> eggs<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
victory sponge is weigh your eggs and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.029 
victory sponge is weigh your eggs and
I've<00:00:24.090> got<00:00:24.300> three<00:00:24.600> large<00:00:24.900> free-range<00:00:25.560> eggs<00:00:25.769> and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
I've got three large free-range eggs and

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.450 
I've got three large free-range eggs and
I've<00:00:26.160> weighed<00:00:26.460> them<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.970> their<00:00:27.330> shells<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
I've weighed them in their shells and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.370 
I've weighed them in their shells and
they<00:00:29.460> weigh<00:00:29.609> 194<00:00:30.570> grams<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.109> I've

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
they weigh 194 grams and so I've

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.720 
they weigh 194 grams and so I've
measured<00:00:32.160> my<00:00:32.520> sugar<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.480> flour<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.260> my<00:00:34.440> butter

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
measured my sugar my flour and my butter

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.549 
measured my sugar my flour and my butter
exactly<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> same<00:00:36.030> way<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:37.230> that's<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
exactly the same way and that's going to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.470 
exactly the same way and that's going to
make<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:38.160> delicious<00:00:38.190> Lee<00:00:38.790> light<00:00:39.030> sponge

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
make a really delicious Lee light sponge

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.619 
make a really delicious Lee light sponge
so<00:00:39.980> first<00:00:40.980> thing<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.250> need<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.000> put<00:00:42.600> my

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so first thing I need to do is put my

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.529 
so first thing I need to do is put my
butter<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.350> sugar<00:00:43.379> into<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.250> mixer<00:00:44.610> so

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
butter and my sugar into my mixer so

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.970 
butter and my sugar into my mixer so
then<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> same<00:00:46.020> weight<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.530> caster<00:00:46.950> sugar

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
then the same weight of caster sugar

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.410 
then the same weight of caster sugar
just<00:00:47.700> pop<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.480> well<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
just pop that in there as well and you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
just pop that in there as well and you
want<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> beat<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.350> quite<00:00:52.770> vigorously<00:00:53.460> until

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
want to beat this quite vigorously until

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.220 
want to beat this quite vigorously until
it's<00:00:54.059> light<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.629> fluffy<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:57.989> we'll<00:00:58.109> add

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
it's light and fluffy and then we'll add

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.130 
it's light and fluffy and then we'll add
the<00:00:58.260> eggs<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.550> while<00:00:59.760> that's<00:00:59.879> beating<00:01:00.210> crack

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the eggs so while that's beating crack

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
the eggs so while that's beating crack
your<00:01:01.320> eggs<00:01:01.469> open<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.340> give<00:01:02.789> them<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> little

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
your eggs open and give them a little

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.670 
your eggs open and give them a little
beating<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.619> them<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.159> smooth<00:01:06.680> turn

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
beating get them to be all smooth turn

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100 
beating get them to be all smooth turn
the<00:01:07.860> mixer<00:01:08.130> down<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> little<00:01:08.610> bit<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.240> then

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the mixer down a little bit and then

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.380 
the mixer down a little bit and then
just<00:01:10.140> add<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:11.070> eggs<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
just add the eggs just a little at a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
just add the eggs just a little at a
time<00:01:12.420> sort<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> maybe<00:01:13.200> three<00:01:13.530> stages<00:01:14.360> beating

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
time sort of maybe three stages beating

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.469 
time sort of maybe three stages beating
in<00:01:15.450> between

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
in between

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.730 
in between
just<00:01:18.479> make<00:01:18.630> sure<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> turn<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.320> down<00:01:19.439> every

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
just make sure you turn it down every

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.140 
just make sure you turn it down every
time<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> add<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.340> gotta<00:01:20.520> Logitech's<00:01:20.939> gonna

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
time you add it I gotta Logitech's gonna

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.030 
time you add it I gotta Logitech's gonna
fly<00:01:21.600> all<00:01:21.750> over<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> place<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.950> last

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
fly all over the place at the last

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.960 
fly all over the place at the last
little<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> egg<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.580> we<00:01:26.580> need<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> add

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
little bit of egg and now we need to add

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
little bit of egg and now we need to add
a<00:01:27.000> few<00:01:27.360> more<00:01:27.390> bits<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.049> pieces<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:29.040> going

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
a few more bits and pieces so I'm going

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.510 
a few more bits and pieces so I'm going
to<00:01:29.490> sieve<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.810> same<00:01:31.110> weight<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.740> self-raising

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to sieve the same weight of self-raising

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.279 
to sieve the same weight of self-raising
flour<00:01:32.580> as<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> eggs<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> sugar<00:01:34.049> and

the<00:01:34.409> butter<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> stuff<00:01:35.060> I'm<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> put<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the butter and stuff I'm going to put it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.520 
the butter and stuff I'm going to put it
through<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> sieve<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.289> bit<00:01:37.440> of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
through a sieve just to get a bit of

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.330 
through a sieve just to get a bit of
light<00:01:37.920> air<00:01:38.190> into<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.680> I'm<00:01:40.680> also<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
light air into it and I'm also going to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.969 
light air into it and I'm also going to
add<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.909> teaspoon<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:43.430> baking<00:01:44.430> powder<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.979> a
