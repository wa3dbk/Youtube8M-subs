last 11 years now and today we're gonna
discuss<00:00:09.710> some<00:00:10.710> techniques<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.429> add<00:00:11.550> texture

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
discuss some techniques to add texture

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.160 
discuss some techniques to add texture
to<00:00:12.120> painted<00:00:12.929> surface<00:00:14.839> there<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> lot<00:00:16.139> of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to painted surface there are a lot of

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.470 
to painted surface there are a lot of
reasons<00:00:16.619> why<00:00:16.650> somebody<00:00:17.070> might<00:00:17.130> add<00:00:17.520> texture

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
reasons why somebody might add texture

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210 
reasons why somebody might add texture
to<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.660> painted<00:00:19.020> wall<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.680> most<00:00:19.859> obvious

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
to a painted wall the most obvious

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.429 
to a painted wall the most obvious
reason<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.699> they're<00:00:21.029> sick<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.439> pouring

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
reason is that they're sick of pouring

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.929 
reason is that they're sick of pouring
Plain<00:00:22.830> Jane<00:00:22.859> white<00:00:23.760> flat<00:00:24.180> walls<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.699> first

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
Plain Jane white flat walls so the first

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
Plain Jane white flat walls so the first
technique<00:00:30.150> I'm<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.960> demonstrate<00:00:31.170> is

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
technique I'm going to demonstrate is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.790 
technique I'm going to demonstrate is
called<00:00:31.890> combing<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:34.050> way<00:00:34.140> combing<00:00:34.590> works

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
called combing and the way combing works

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.060 
called combing and the way combing works
is<00:00:35.809> you're<00:00:36.809> gonna<00:00:36.899> start<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.800> paint

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
is you're gonna start out with the paint

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.060 
is you're gonna start out with the paint
and<00:00:38.450> you<00:00:39.450> notice<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.870> put<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.110> nice<00:00:40.440> base<00:00:40.770> coat

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you add quite a bit of paint because you

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
you add quite a bit of paint because you
don't<00:01:16.439> want<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.950> too<00:01:17.130> thin<00:01:17.549> because

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
don't want it to be too thin because

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
don't want it to be too thin because
what<00:01:18.810> we're<00:01:18.990> doing<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.860> creating

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
what we're doing here is creating

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.690 
what we're doing here is creating
texture<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> after<00:01:22.860> you've<00:01:22.979> covered<00:01:23.340> your

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
texture so after you've covered your

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.300 
texture so after you've covered your
area<00:01:26.090> you're<00:01:27.090> gonna<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:29.130> you're<00:01:29.250> gonna

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
area you're gonna do is you're gonna

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.560 
area you're gonna do is you're gonna
take<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.180> simple<00:01:30.570> household<00:01:31.320> comb

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
take up just a simple household comb

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.850 
take up just a simple household comb
fine-toothed<00:01:33.570> wide<00:01:33.869> tooth<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.380> four<00:01:34.680> wide

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
fine-toothed wide tooth I'm four wide

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.140 
fine-toothed wide tooth I'm four wide
two<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.600> you're<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.750> gonna<00:01:37.310> scrape<00:01:38.310> across

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.700 

the<00:01:43.150> paint<00:01:44.370> real<00:01:45.370> quick<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:47.200> sort<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.560> a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
the paint real quick it's sort of a

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.800 
the paint real quick it's sort of a
crosshatch<00:01:48.340> pattern<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:52.570> going<00:01:52.720> to

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
crosshatch pattern and it's going to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.200 
crosshatch pattern and it's going to
create<00:01:52.990> this<00:01:54.210> textured<00:01:55.210> appearance<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:57.210> bumps

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
create this textured appearance of bumps

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.560 
create this textured appearance of bumps
and<00:01:58.300> lines<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.020> it's<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.770> really<00:02:00.040> simple<00:02:00.570> cheap

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
and lines and it's a really simple cheap

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.210 
and lines and it's a really simple cheap
way<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.840> add<00:02:02.020> texture<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.620> wall<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.860> final

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
way to add texture to a wall the final

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.590 
way to add texture to a wall the final
technique<00:02:06.400> we're<00:02:06.729> gonna<00:02:06.820> discuss<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.479> add

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
technique we're gonna discuss to add

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.660 
technique we're gonna discuss to add
some<00:02:07.960> texture<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.500> wall<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.459> actually

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
some texture to a wall is to actually

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.630 
some texture to a wall is to actually
add<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.540> an<00:02:11.230> element<00:02:11.620> off<00:02:11.770> texture<00:02:12.280> into<00:02:12.459> the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
add a an element off texture into the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.900 
add a an element off texture into the
paint<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.270> I'm<00:02:13.810> gonna<00:02:13.930> use<00:02:14.200> some<00:02:14.500> sand<00:02:15.459> this

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
paint and I'm gonna use some sand this

paint and I'm gonna use some sand this
is<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.810> very<00:02:17.050> fine<00:02:18.150> sand<00:02:19.150> you're<00:02:19.330> not

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
is just a very fine sand you're not

little<00:02:40.000> bit<00:02:40.120> more<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.510> an<00:02:40.600> even<00:02:40.870> coat<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.380> it

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
little bit more of an even coat and it
