00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
that and the rest of the magic happens

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.560 
that and the rest of the magic happens
on<00:03:00.350> your<00:03:00.530> device<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:01.040> should<00:03:01.070> boot<00:03:01.550> up<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:02.090> a

on your device it should boot up in a

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.850 
on your device it should boot up in a
tethered<00:03:04.120> jailbroken<00:03:05.120> state<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:09.530> you'll<00:03:09.740> be

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
tethered jailbroken state so you'll be

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.280 
tethered jailbroken state so you'll be
able<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.220> use<00:03:10.820> your<00:03:10.970> device<00:03:11.270> again<00:03:11.690> as<00:03:11.840> normal

able to use your device again as normal

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.010 
able to use your device again as normal
this<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.130> one<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.490> pitfalls<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.450> being<00:03:14.510> on

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
this is one of the pitfalls of being on

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.970 
this is one of the pitfalls of being on
the<00:03:15.290> latest<00:03:16.540> software<00:03:17.540> version<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.620> happens

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the latest software version this happens

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.870 
the latest software version this happens
quite<00:03:19.430> often<00:03:19.780> when<00:03:20.780> Apple<00:03:21.110> releases<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.590> new

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
quite often when Apple releases a new

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.300 
quite often when Apple releases a new
software<00:03:22.880> version<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.709> first<00:03:24.860> thing<00:03:25.100> usually

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
software version the first thing usually

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.370 
software version the first thing usually
to<00:03:25.580> come<00:03:25.730> out<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.350> tethered<00:03:27.350> jailbreak

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
to come out is a tethered jailbreak

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.890 
to come out is a tethered jailbreak
where<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.160> have<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.520> do<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.300> process<00:03:29.750> every

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
where you have to do this process every

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.560 
where you have to do this process every
time<00:03:30.110> you<00:03:30.230> boot<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.650> after<00:03:31.580> that<00:03:31.610> usually

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
time you boot it and after that usually

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.910 
time you boot it and after that usually
the<00:03:33.050> developers<00:03:33.920> are<00:03:34.720> able<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.750> find<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.680> way<00:03:36.890> to

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
the developers are able to find a way to

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.720 
the developers are able to find a way to
do<00:03:37.580> an<00:03:37.730> untethered<00:03:38.360> jailbreak<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.610> can

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
do an untethered jailbreak so you can

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.640 
do an untethered jailbreak so you can
