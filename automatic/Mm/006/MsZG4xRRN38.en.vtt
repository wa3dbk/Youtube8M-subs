awesome<00:00:49.290> performance<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:51.270> bike<00:00:51.510> should

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
awesome performance this bike should

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.680 
awesome performance this bike should
have<00:00:51.870> been<00:00:52.020> made<00:00:52.470> with<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.980> engine<00:00:53.690> because

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
have been made with this engine because

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.119 
have been made with this engine because
it's<00:00:55.080> just<00:00:55.910> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.059> could<00:00:57.180> only<00:00:57.450> see<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.860> go

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it's just if you could only see this go

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's just if you could only see this go
I'll<00:01:00.059> try<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.360> get<00:01:00.450> some<00:01:00.660> more<00:01:00.840> footage<00:01:01.670> I'm

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
I'll try and get some more footage I'm

00:01:02.670 --> 00:02:59.459 
I'll try and get some more footage I'm
gonna<00:01:02.850> start<00:01:03.150> it<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.360> now<00:01:06.650> bear<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.680> me

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:07.720 

so<00:03:00.469> I<00:03:00.530> guess<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.919> all<00:03:01.069> footage<00:03:06.430> really<00:03:07.430> throw

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
so I guess of all footage really throw

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.239 
so I guess of all footage really throw
see<00:03:07.790> sound
