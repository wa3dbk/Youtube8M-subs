00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
think that you know we've really kind of

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.519 
think that you know we've really kind of
hit<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.250> niche<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:05.940> now<00:00:06.150> we<00:00:06.899> found<00:00:07.290> where

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
hit that niche and now we found where

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.350 
hit that niche and now we found where
we're<00:00:08.130> going<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.340> go<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:08.880> just<00:00:09.059> took<00:00:09.179> off

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
we're going to go and it just took off

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.950 
we're going to go and it just took off
from<00:00:09.389> there<00:00:11.360> we<00:00:12.360> haven't<00:00:12.570> really<00:00:12.750> thought

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
from there we haven't really thought

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.110 
from there we haven't really thought
about<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:14.250> know<00:00:14.280> there's<00:00:14.730> not<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.880> lot<00:00:15.089> of

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
about it you know there's not a lot of

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.470 
about it you know there's not a lot of
times<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.660> reflect<00:00:16.170> because<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.740> such<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
times that reflect because it's such a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.929 
times that reflect because it's such a
it's<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.470> train<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.430> faster<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
it's like a train just going faster and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.150 
it's like a train just going faster and
faster<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.449> we're<00:00:21.570> still<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.810> any<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.380> still

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
faster and we're still on any we still

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.849 
faster and we're still on any we still
don't<00:00:23.430> think<00:00:23.490> we'd<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.910> with<00:00:24.779> musically<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
don't think we'd be with musically and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.130 
don't think we'd be with musically and

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
now just I think we just get a better

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.789 
now just I think we just get a better
system<00:01:34.659> every<00:01:34.899> time<00:01:35.079> we<00:01:35.200> do<00:01:35.319> it<00:01:35.349> so<00:01:37.170> yeah<00:01:38.170> and

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.419 
we thought well what could we do after
some<00:01:53.289> of<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.409> first<00:01:53.619> albums<00:01:54.009> that<00:01:54.129> we've<00:01:54.280> had

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
some of the first albums that we've had

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.580 
some of the first albums that we've had
when<00:01:54.969> we<00:01:55.090> got<00:01:55.209> engaged<00:01:55.420> this<00:01:55.959> was<00:01:56.170> different

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
when we got engaged this was different

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.410 
when we got engaged this was different
than<00:01:56.739> the<00:01:56.799> last<00:01:56.829> album<00:01:57.459> it<00:01:57.849> became<00:01:58.209> more

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
than the last album it became more

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.969 
than the last album it became more
important<00:01:58.929> and<00:01:59.079> now<00:01:59.349> you're<00:01:59.619> saying<00:01:59.799> we're
