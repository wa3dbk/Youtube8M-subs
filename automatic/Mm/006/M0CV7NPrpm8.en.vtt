00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
writing in steam problem this usually

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.200 
writing in steam problem this usually
happens<00:00:30.380> when<00:00:30.560> people<00:00:31.220> are<00:00:31.580> trying<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.090> use

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
happens when people are trying to use

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.439 
happens when people are trying to use
steam<00:00:32.509> but<00:00:33.500> in<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:33.650> wineskin

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
steam but in a wineskin

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.030 
steam but in a wineskin
so<00:00:35.449> the<00:00:35.540> problem<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:35.930> when<00:00:36.170> when<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.680> create

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
so the problem is when when you create

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.610 
so the problem is when when you create
the<00:00:37.160> wineskin<00:00:37.670> install<00:00:38.210> steam<00:00:38.540> when<00:00:39.500> the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
the wineskin install steam when the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.320 
the wineskin install steam when the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
steam program actually comes up itself

steam program actually comes up itself
there's<00:00:41.900> no<00:00:42.140> writing<00:00:42.470> so<00:00:42.769> you<00:00:42.800> can't<00:00:43.010> actually

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
there's no writing so you can't actually

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.130 
there's no writing so you can't actually

today and show you guys how to fix a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.970 
today and show you guys how to fix a
problem<00:00:56.030> it's<00:00:56.809> quite<00:00:57.050> easy<00:00:57.260> but<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.710> can<00:00:57.739> be

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
problem it's quite easy but it can be

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.440 
problem it's quite easy but it can be
quite<00:00:58.100> tricky<00:00:58.190> because<00:00:58.850> obviously<00:00:59.000> you<00:00:59.210> can't

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
quite tricky because obviously you can't

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.750 
quite tricky because obviously you can't
see<00:00:59.690> anything<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.340> sometimes<00:01:01.340> it<00:01:01.489> takes<00:01:01.670> a

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
see anything so sometimes it takes a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.840 
see anything so sometimes it takes a
couple<00:01:01.940> of<00:01:02.090> go<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:02.570> just<00:01:02.719> bear<00:01:03.379> with<00:01:03.410> me<00:01:03.850> so

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
couple of go so you just bear with me so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.609 
couple of go so you just bear with me so
for<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.479> purpose<00:01:05.720> of<00:01:05.810> this<00:01:05.899> tutorial<00:01:06.050> I've

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
for the purpose of this tutorial I've

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.499 
for the purpose of this tutorial I've
created<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.220> wineskin<00:01:07.460> here<00:01:08.030> I've<00:01:08.240> already

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
created a wineskin here I've already

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.480 
created a wineskin here I've already
installed<00:01:08.780> steam<00:01:09.110> into<00:01:09.350> it

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
installed steam into it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.029 
installed steam into it
the<00:01:10.820> wineskin<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:11.509> using<00:01:11.899> the<00:01:11.960> engine<00:01:12.320> one

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
the wineskin is using the engine one

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.740 
the wineskin is using the engine one
point<00:01:13.310> seven<00:01:13.640> point<00:01:13.759> three<00:01:13.910> five<00:01:14.330> as<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:14.690> know

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
point seven point three five as I know

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.279 
point seven point three five as I know
steamer<00:01:15.200> she<00:01:15.530> launches<00:01:15.920> in<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:16.190> engine<00:01:17.289> but

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
steamer she launches in this engine but

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.719 
steamer she launches in this engine but
I<00:01:18.320> get<00:01:18.560> my<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:18.800> get<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.070> problem<00:01:19.369> with<00:01:19.460> most

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
I get my I get the problem with most

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.700 
I get my I get the problem with most
actual<00:01:20.450> wineskins<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:21.170> steam<00:01:21.530> actually

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
actual wineskins that steam actually

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.089 
actual wineskins that steam actually
launches<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.780> usually<00:01:24.140> usually<00:01:24.679> happens

00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:25.099 
launches in so usually usually happens

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:27.130 
launches in so usually usually happens

been authorized it's actually on the
same<00:03:10.410> computer<00:03:10.680> as<00:03:11.250> all<00:03:11.579> mine<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.880> for

same computer as all mine I for

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.940 
same computer as all mine I for
wineskins<00:03:12.600> but<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:12.930> can<00:03:13.140> see<00:03:13.290> why<00:03:13.500> thinks<00:03:13.829> it's

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
wineskins but I can see why thinks it's

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.319 
wineskins but I can see why thinks it's
a<00:03:14.010> new<00:03:14.130> computer<00:03:14.579> because<00:03:14.820> obviously<00:03:14.970> when

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
a new computer because obviously when

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.220 
a new computer because obviously when
you<00:03:15.450> run<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.630> wineskin

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
you run a wineskin

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.350 
you run a wineskin
it<00:03:16.680> runs<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.280> PC<00:03:17.640> environment<00:03:18.180> so

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
it runs it in a PC environment so

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.729 
it runs it in a PC environment so
obviously<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.900> will<00:03:18.989> probably<00:03:19.200> think<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.650> a

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
obviously it will probably think it's a

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.370 
obviously it will probably think it's a
different<00:03:20.040> PC<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:21.750> what<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.959> have<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.110> do<00:03:22.320> is

here<00:04:29.450> so<00:04:29.630> as<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:29.810> can<00:04:29.930> see<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.230> can't<00:04:30.440> really

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
here so as you can see you can't really

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.040 
here so as you can see you can't really
see<00:04:30.800> but<00:04:31.010> these<00:04:31.100> are<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.340> menus<00:04:31.870> but<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.930> want

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
see but these are the menus but you want

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.090 
see but these are the menus but you want
to<00:04:33.110> click<00:04:33.230> on<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.410> second<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.710> last<00:04:33.740> one

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
to click on the second to last one

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.590 
to click on the second to last one
because<00:04:34.280> that's<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.700> actual<00:04:35.120> settings

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
because that's the actual settings

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:46.350 
because that's the actual settings
itself<00:04:36.700> so<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:37.820> can<00:04:37.940> be<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.060> bit<00:04:39.640> temperamental

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.870 

as<00:04:47.360> an<00:04:47.510> open<00:04:47.780> house<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:49.250> here<00:04:49.370> goes<00:04:49.520> I<00:04:49.640> opened

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
as an open house so here goes I opened

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.990 
as an open house so here goes I opened
up<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.060> settings<00:04:50.450> menu<00:04:51.640> subscribed<00:04:52.640> up<00:04:52.790> there

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
up the settings menu subscribed up there

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.790 
up the settings menu subscribed up there
so<00:04:53.120> we<00:04:53.210> can<00:04:53.360> see<00:04:53.540> now<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:54.050> found<00:04:54.320> this<00:04:54.530> is<00:04:54.770> the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
so we can see now I found this is the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.650 
so we can see now I found this is the
foot<00:04:55.070> this<00:04:55.130> is<00:04:55.190> this<00:04:55.550> is<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.730> first<00:04:55.880> menu

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
foot this is this is the first menu

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.440 
foot this is this is the first menu
option<00:04:57.050> here<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:57.470> I<00:04:57.890> found<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.490> if<00:04:58.730> you<00:04:58.790> use

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
option here and I found that if you use

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.600 
option here and I found that if you use
the<00:04:59.810> arrow<00:04:59.960> keys<00:05:00.350> up<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:00.800> down<00:05:01.010> it's<00:05:01.220> easier

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
the arrow keys up and down it's easier

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.090 
the arrow keys up and down it's easier
to<00:05:01.730> actually<00:05:01.910> go<00:05:02.750> through<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.169> menus<00:05:03.560> so<00:05:04.040> you

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
to actually go through the menus so you

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.130 
to actually go through the menus so you
want<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.370> make<00:05:04.490> sure<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:04.910> can<00:05:05.060> go<00:05:05.270> down<00:05:05.660> five

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
times to get to the actual setting that

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.740 
times to get to the actual setting that
we<00:05:08.870> need<00:05:09.080> so<00:05:09.919> go<00:05:10.190> start<00:05:10.729> one<00:05:11.050> two<00:05:12.370> three<00:05:13.750> four
