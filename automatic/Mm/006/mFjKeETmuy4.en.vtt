that we have to start with a bit of
background<00:00:15.670> info<00:00:16.359> and<00:00:16.570> that<00:00:17.050> is<00:00:17.350> about<00:00:17.980> how

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
background info and that is about how

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.350

losing and gaining weight works if for

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.410 
losing and gaining weight works if for
example<00:00:22.390> you<00:00:23.140> need<00:00:23.670> 2200<00:00:24.670> calories<00:00:24.850> per<00:00:25.390> day

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
example you need 2200 calories per day

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.230 
example you need 2200 calories per day
to<00:00:25.930> keep<00:00:26.500> your<00:00:26.740> body<00:00:26.920> weight<00:00:27.250> steady<00:00:27.699> and<00:00:27.940> you

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
eat around those 2200 then your weight

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.470 
eat around those 2200 then your weight
will<00:00:31.720> stay<00:00:32.559> steady<00:00:33.250> if<00:00:33.489> you<00:00:33.910> eat<00:00:34.090> more<00:00:34.449> than

or fewer than those 2200 calories then
your<00:00:42.100> weight<00:00:42.339> will<00:00:42.989> decrease

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
at that point something else important

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.220 
at that point something else important
comes<00:00:52.340> in<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:52.760> that<00:00:53.000> is<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.300> caloric<00:00:53.870> density

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
comes in and that is the caloric density

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.280 
comes in and that is the caloric density

filled a cup like this year with fat and
ate<00:01:13.729> all<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.270> fat<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.170> would<00:01:15.380> eat<00:01:15.619> double

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
ate all that fat you would eat double

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.130 
ate all that fat you would eat double
the<00:01:16.490> amount<00:01:16.729> or<00:01:17.210> more<00:01:17.600> than<00:01:17.780> double<00:01:18.050> the

then<00:01:20.660> if<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:20.990> filled<00:01:21.290> this<00:01:21.800> cup<00:01:22.220> with<00:01:22.700> sugar

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
then if you filled this cup with sugar

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.230 
then if you filled this cup with sugar
and<00:01:23.210> ate<00:01:23.750> all<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.770> sugar<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.729> practical

and ate all that sugar and the practical

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.960 
and ate all that sugar and the practical
application<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:27.500> means<00:01:27.770> if<00:01:28.009> you<00:01:28.520> eat<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.940> lot

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
that take up little space and it takes

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.740 
that take up little space and it takes
longer<00:01:35.930> time<00:01:36.200> until<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:36.920> feel<00:01:37.460> full<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.119> then

longer time until you feel full and then

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.050 
longer time until you feel full and then
you<00:01:38.899> will<00:01:39.080> have<00:01:39.259> eaten<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:39.830> lot<00:01:40.039> more<00:01:40.580> calories
