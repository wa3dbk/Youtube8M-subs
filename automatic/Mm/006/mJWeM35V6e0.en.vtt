00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.700 

pass<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.000> through<00:03:40.030> these<00:03:40.810> two<00:03:41.080> parallel<00:03:41.500> holes

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
pass it through these two parallel holes

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:49.260 
pass it through these two parallel holes
at<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:41.980> bottom<00:03:45.840> reverse<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:47.020> again<00:03:48.150> then<00:03:49.150> you

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
at the bottom reverse it again then you

00:03:49.270 --> 00:04:02.290 
at the bottom reverse it again then you
want<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.510> double<00:03:49.780> back<00:03:49.930> through<00:03:50.170> these<00:03:50.320> holes

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.090 

and<00:04:03.250> that's<00:04:04.250> formed<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:05.360> two<00:04:05.540> horizontal<00:04:06.170> and

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
and that's formed the two horizontal and

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.940 
and that's formed the two horizontal and
the<00:04:07.130> two<00:04:07.670> vertical<00:04:08.510> belt<00:04:08.690> loops<00:04:08.900> then<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.800> can

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
the two vertical belt loops then you can

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.850 
the two vertical belt loops then you can
either<00:04:10.070> tie<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:10.400> off<00:04:10.790> or<00:04:11.720> secure<00:04:12.140> it<00:04:12.230> with<00:04:12.440> a

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
either tie this off or secure it with a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.750 
either tie this off or secure it with a
cord<00:04:13.130> lock<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:15.340> that's<00:04:16.340> all<00:04:16.489> there<00:04:16.610> is<00:04:16.670> to

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
cord lock and that's all there is to

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.910 
cord lock and that's all there is to
it's<00:04:17.060> as<00:04:17.180> easy<00:04:17.330> as<00:04:17.480> that<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.930> hope<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:18.890> found
