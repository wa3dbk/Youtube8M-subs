00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.150

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.750
 relatively good, which is why I already on 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.020
 have installed my laptop and now 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.500
 on my pc will also catch up 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.739
 and as many probably go with it 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.930
 a new operating system again and again 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.239
 Changes just a little older 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.750
 People always have problems with it and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.210
 so that the whole thing works naturally 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.530
 has jörg push who knows him it is one 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.820

 known to the television and has hot chip 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.979
 a book brought out everything about 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.350
 Windows 10 succeeds in the change and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.170
 Of course we got the book 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.630
 on request one of our readers of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 said hey i dare the whole 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.079
 Things with windows are not there 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.110
 currently so much talked about so much 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.890
 windows ce free download rip-off 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.520
 that windows wants humanity 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.090
 control and any 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.070
 conspiracy theories and yes but that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.600
 whole is not so if that is ten like 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.360
 always an operating system which 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.790
 is launched and in the lounge phase 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.820
 the whole operating systems are already 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.149
 always been free that never had 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.220
 Something tasted and windows 10 will too 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.550
 In the near future I am definitely 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.470
 certainly something to taste 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.030
 that once the whole 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.520
 Conspiracy theorists, however, who 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.250
 windows 10 is not used apple user 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.140
 who wants to stay true to Windows 7 or 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.580
 Windows 8 wants to stay true to the can 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.980
 Of course, like to do 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.980
 Personally, I'll be up soon too 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.470
 change windows 10 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.390
 and yes, the book actually comes to me 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.580
 just because I actually 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.270
 does not need but windows 10 has like 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.980
 said many new extensions and 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.170
 many new things 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.100
 the old desktop is back and the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.570
 apps were down here in the start menu 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.220
 has housed the windows explorer 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.500
 one has windows 10 and the cloud and yes 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.140
 as said data backup apps 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.860
 In turn , it is very integrated 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.590
 new in there you have the language assistant 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.120
 cortado but I do not think much of that 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.000
 I have an iphone myself and now 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.350
 not even you and that's the point 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.050
 neither is it as I said about that 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.180
 book and I want you directly 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.180
 show you a really right again 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.810
 insight into the book show the book 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.700
 is delivered in over 390 pages 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.370
 in my opinion is very very very 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.230
 very much the whole animal wants to be here 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.590
 in the index we see here 390 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.320
 Of course I can not do that 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.800
 Whole content I abandon 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.300
 of course because the content is natural 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.680
 but copyrighted is hers 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.970
 See that with beautiful graphics 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.270
 It really puts everyone down 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.250
 every help that you buy steps up 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.430
 now problem that you have with windows 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.280
 gets solved and as I said the book 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.450
 is a pure textbook of rheine facts 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.209
 about windows 10 about the transition as the 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.459
 change succeeds and my opinion one 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.220
 Great book we come directly once 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.530
 again to the evaluation what is positive 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.040
 of course high quality content like 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:24.030
 said by expert jörg push that 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.430
 whole book is very very detailed one 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.650
 has over 390 pages 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.690
 and if you imagine that as a book 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.110
 which is quite nice but Klopper 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.990
 it will be delivered as an ebook and there 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.990
 you have to say so 390 pages and 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.000
 the topics are definitely all covered 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.479
 from data backups to windows 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.729
 ads to no idea what you are 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.190
 everything is really needed 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.130
 graphics explained with pictures explains so 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.919
 that it really gets any layman 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.229
 and of course, by the way, by the way 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.300
 of course, whoever finds the book positive is positive 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.419
 Of course, Jörg Schieb has written 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.030
 you can google it top man 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.970
 is really an expert in the field 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.430
 internet internet marketing computers 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.710
 So really , he really has it 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.630
 if you buy a book you buy it 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.880
 always quite and an expert because you know 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.620
 where it is the book is also 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.460
 very clearly structured I like that 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.919
 very very good and also the graphics 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:30.210
 facilitate the handling of this whole 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:32.550
 things and what comes with some topics 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.560
 I would personally have videos 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.510
 we wish we are in one today 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.220
 Time in the video courses more and more popular 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:43.010
 are and why then no video at 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.870
 isolated topics where you then 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.880
 integrates into the pdf file and then 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.409
 no idea about weimar or youtube 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:57.360
 is passed on and then passed 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:59.159
 you can just look what the whole 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.070
 is that so small tutorials 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:05.460
 I would have liked to install that 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:08.099
 so many lesson and that 's it 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.250
 as far as the book we find it 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:14.190
 Great book very much content very 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.630
 in detail who that would be with windows 10 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.440
 not yet get along and there 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.599
 really would like to have a counselor 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.419
 he really should be on his side 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.099
 definitely get the book the link finds 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.960
 See the description below 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:31.349
 of course you will find a detailed review 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.139
 back on our side and I have 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:36.360
 again several people asked there 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.070
 the videos come online and the article 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.300
 not yet at the same time 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.280
 light is that's the way we're in 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.990
 team yes from two people my 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.220
 business partner denic always only you 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:52.440
 and I always publish the video 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.600
 first and 12 weeks later 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.920
 of course the article the antique 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.290
 writing articles takes course 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.600
 much longer and of course a lot 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.220
 more time consuming than a little video in 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.770
 which we give an insight on that 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.760
 The article definitely comes in 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:11.210
 work and look over and have fun 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.210
 withstand
