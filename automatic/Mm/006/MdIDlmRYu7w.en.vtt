00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.039 
much of a chance to compete during the
week<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.350> thought<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:05.360> Morgan<00:01:06.360> Newton<00:01:06.869> did

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.750 
week I thought that Morgan Newton did
some<00:01:07.229> really<00:01:07.439> good<00:01:07.619> things<00:01:07.680> early<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
some really good things early on and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.890 
some really good things early on and
then<00:01:08.909> he<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.299> got<00:01:09.450> into<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:11.869> didn't<00:01:12.869> look

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
then he kind of got into a didn't look

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
then he kind of got into a didn't look
like<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.290> guy<00:01:13.439> was<00:01:13.650> open<00:01:13.979> he'd<00:01:14.310> pull<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.670> down

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
like the guy was open he'd pull it down

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.520 
like the guy was open he'd pull it down
and<00:01:15.030> run<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.689> gave<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.080> what<00:01:16.320> two<00:01:16.500> or

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and run I think we gave up what two or

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.980 
and run I think we gave up what two or
three<00:01:16.860> sacks<00:01:17.189> tonight<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.909> that's<00:01:18.600> more<00:01:18.840> than
