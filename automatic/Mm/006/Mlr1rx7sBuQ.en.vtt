00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:10.793
 When we reach a certain point in our life, 

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:13.038
 there are people, 

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:14.917
 who are just waiting to see you fall ... 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.125
 But then only gravity will be able to pull us down. 

00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:23.381
 Sometimes you just have to take matters into your own hands ... 

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:26.568
 And fly. 

00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:37.087
 He went from a youtube kid to a veteran of world scenes. 

00:00:41.097 --> 00:00:41.693
 This song is for you 

00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:43.685
 Behind the headers 

00:00:44.113 --> 00:00:45.151
 You can not have a normal life if you are a superstar. 

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:53.492
 He is forced to grow up before the world. 

00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:54.836
 When you fall in love ... 

00:00:55.664 --> 00:00:56.293
 When you break ... 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.700
 Behind the spotlights. 

00:00:59.043 --> 00:01:00.484
 You saw it again and again .. 

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:03.423
 The young pop star reaches the top just to get out of it. 

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:06.542
 You know that you can be a wreck next, right? 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.889
 Paparazzi: Return to America. Justin: What did you say ?! 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.779
 I really wanted to hit him. And that's what they wanted. 

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:15.224
 I learned lessons from this. 

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.815
 There is more of its history. 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.607
 You always have to have a smile on your face. 

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.061
 It's about being positive. 

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:26.123
 It's completely safe, right? 

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:34.318
 At the end of the day, he becomes a young man in a room writing a song. 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.241
 It all started there. 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.779
 On this holiday. 

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.200
 This mustache is to make me feel a bit older. 

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:45.170
 But this is an illusion. 

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:45.760
 Dreams. 

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:50.760
 My favorite part is just moments with fans. They are the ones for whom I'm doing this. 

00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:51.420
 They inspire. 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.610
 No matter how hard it can be, everything will be fine. 

00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:01.150
 Believe in yourself. You can do anything if it's your decision. 

00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:08.740
 Sometimes I walk in the way I walk. I walk like a duck (I stumble) because I wear low pants. 

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:11.240
 Do not let this pants wear you. You wear them. 

00:02:15.382 --> 00:02:17.640
 I'm still your mother and I still want you to pull up your pants.
