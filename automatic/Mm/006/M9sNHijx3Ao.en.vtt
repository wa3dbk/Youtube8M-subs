00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.430 
weird little troglodyte four eyed people
but<00:02:02.080> as<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.350> can<00:02:02.440> see<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.330> Sith<00:02:04.330> Warrior<00:02:04.510> does

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
but as you can see the Sith Warrior does

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.710 
but as you can see the Sith Warrior does
pretty<00:02:05.680> good<00:02:05.770> at<00:02:06.040> killing<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:07.240> mobs<00:02:07.450> and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
pretty good at killing the mobs and

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.440 
pretty good at killing the mobs and
taking<00:02:08.050> very<00:02:08.229> little<00:02:08.470> damage<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.270> these<00:02:10.270> are

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
taking very little damage and these are

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.510 
taking very little damage and these are
some<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> hardest<00:02:11.350> monsters<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.370> game

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
some of the hardest monsters in the game

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.170 
some of the hardest monsters in the game
because<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.540> level<00:02:13.780> 50<00:02:14.080> area<00:02:16.200> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
because this is the level 50 area and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.200 
because this is the level 50 area and
that's<00:02:19.180> about<00:02:19.330> all<00:02:19.480> there<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:21.210> look

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
that's about all there is to it look

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.380 
that's about all there is to it look
forward<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.630> seeing<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.930> at<00:02:23.080> 50
