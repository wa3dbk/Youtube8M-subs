00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 If we do something that seems so complicated 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.120
 In fact, if you are talking about math, you may have some discomfort 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.710
 Oh it does not sound so awful 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.164
 And then we'll see how it looks, okay 

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:22.270
 Music 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.030
 Yeah 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.090
 We have finished his solution 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.730
 Perhaps this is one of the most useless equations at all 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.690
 We completed solving it in Numberphile 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.080
 But what does that mean? 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 Well, let's try this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.510
 We'll paint it, right? 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.630
 We will draw a diagram on my computer here 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.410
 Now, I will execute the chart 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.440
 It must be - let me make it bigger for you - it is 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 It's the equation that Batman deserves, but no one needs it now 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.650
 Again, this is the Batman curve 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.620
 This curve was designed by a high school teacher, so this equation 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.810
 You will draw the Batman logo 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.280
 Cleverly designed from different curves 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.700
 And straight lines 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.760
 Can I show you how he did it? 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.490
 So here we have some things that you may be familiar with 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.750
 Easy to draw straight lines 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.260
 What he did, though, is that we do not want to 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.100
 Department of Batman 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.630
 We want ellipse - Elliptical pieces 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.210
 He has a slightly different equation, so 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.650
 It's like him 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.220
 Now, about this to Batman Wings 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.570
 Obviously we do not want everything 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.610
 This is not what the curve looked like 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.640
 Indeed, use these two points on both sides 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.210
 He also found a way to multiply his equation, the effect was 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.720
 Hides some curves 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.880
 Which happens here in this lost spot, becomes 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.140
 This is a complex figure, an imaginary number, which means 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.740
 You can not draw it 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.760
 That's what he did 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.720
 He was just carrying on doing this 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.450
 He used curves and straight lines 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.840
 Let me show you what makes him like Batman 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.760
 Now, he used six curves 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.590
 Let's look at them 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.290
 So use the ellipse 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.580
 And, oh, that's very intelligent 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.650
 This is the bottom of the Batman code 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.380
 These straight lines will include these 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.670
 His ears are very pointed there 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.255
 And then implement more curves 

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:16.620
 This terminates the image 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.540
 You put it all together, and that's what you get 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 This is Batman 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.800
 So hide some parts using imaginary numbers, yes 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.380
 Using square roots, which will convert some numbers into that 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.520
 He does not want to find them in fictional numbers. 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.950
 It was a very smart way 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.160
 Use the same curves, but now you can see that it is hidden 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.860
 Some parts of it 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.890
 They all put together and gathered them through 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.470
 beating 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.740
 So put it together 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.510
 He multiplied these equations together 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.260
 whats the result ? 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.160
 Batman curve 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.370
 I wanted to do that because I am 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.380
 I am very much looking forward to the Dark Knight exit 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.630
 The Dark Knight rises 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.840
