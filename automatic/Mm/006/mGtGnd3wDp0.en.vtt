00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.860
 lemons 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 Well now we're going to throw everything 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.110
 of the oranges we are going to cut the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.660
 oranges we are going to take out the juice and 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.660
 let's throw him the orange juice 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.610
 we have 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.280
 one and a half one damn and a half 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.309
 now we are going to put 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.820
 we are going to put the yeast 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.190
 you have to take the complete one on a 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.190
 packet of yeast 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.400
 but we're going to put the cinnamon 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.400
 ground cinnamon 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.400
 they already have their cinnamon now we are going to 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.400
 put the sugar 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.490
 a glass of sugar a glass 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.420
 now we'll let lay eggs 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.720
 to put 4 eggs 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.720
 and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.859
 Now we're going to put the butter 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.859
 250 grams 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.690
 Well, all the ingredients are there 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.690
 now we are going to beat it 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.280
 but to you 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.050
 but that has already been the pieces of 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.060
 little tulip are already very 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.310
 little ones and you're about to start 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.530
 add the flour 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.360
 the pastry flour half kilo and 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.360
 other means of batter flour 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.270
 beating so that it is introduced 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.640
 the flour already with everything 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.600
 control or ingredient so that the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.310
 margarine is falling apart 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.310
 now we continue to put flour 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.269
 in this arena 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.370
 it's too heavy, you do not have to do it 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.370
 with hand 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.750
 because if I do it like this they do not introduce 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.560
 all right 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.110
 the whole mass if it moves and that's how it is made 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.110
 the crime that is done by moves and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.000
 it is happening what we are going to do is 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.850
 that we are going to put oil we are going to make 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.850
 of the burner we are going to put oil and 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.330
 let it warm up by when 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.330
 let's finish 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:09.550
 and we have to take a cascarita of 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.550
 lemon oil to take away the taste 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.840
 but 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.280
 Well, the most 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.280
 now let's start I know 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.550
 folding it in half and on the other hand 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:40.300
 this is left the two parties here and 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.750
 now it bends if it does not stick it stretches 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.820
 until it finishes and an enlarged 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.800
 showy and a spark has already been made 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.280
 it's that cold because I'm going 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.280
 others 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.490
 and dry now bends 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.250
 double for each and on the contrary 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.130
 and now it stretches 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.130
 and little 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.060
 and now we 're going to go through honey what 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.040
 we see in Milan 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.040
 you put a little water 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.020
 but we're going to let it serve for 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.530
 remove the foam the honey that we are going to 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.530
 drink 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:08.880
 without by the little bank the 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:13.980
 foam 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.980
 he falls , he gives himself a little spin 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.380
 whether the last procedure is already 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.640
 they were already finished 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.640
 or not 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.870
 two
