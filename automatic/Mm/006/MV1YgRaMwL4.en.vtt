00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
nerve growth factor in it which can

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.870 
nerve growth factor in it which can
actually<00:01:28.799> pass<00:01:29.189> through<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> blood-brain

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
actually pass through the blood-brain

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.499 
actually pass through the blood-brain
barrier<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> was<00:01:32.189> actually<00:01:32.610> found<00:01:33.090> by<00:01:33.329> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
barrier so that was actually found by a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.569 
barrier so that was actually found by a
Nobel<00:01:34.079> laureate<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.829> think<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.659> 1970s<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
Nobel laureate I think in the 1970s and

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.590 
Nobel laureate I think in the 1970s and
from<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> stories<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.060> I've<00:01:39.240> heard<00:01:39.390> he's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
from the stories that I've heard he's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.429

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
been taking it ever since then and so

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.679
