00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 base cybergun foot accessories with 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.880
 here are all models as usual 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.020
 wow it's to the notice their rights to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.100
 the man and then explain what the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.140
 fronts falls on replicas where one 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.930
 see nothing there it's really explained ren 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.170
 nothing to say that besides really we 're going 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.090
 good tech 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.290
 good then we have polystyrene 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.770
 their protégés at the spades 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.939
 Here again though they would 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.390
 could put there new materials 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.250
 black polystyrene condate that avoids 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.930
 do crumble and put a 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.939
 everywhere but here we go 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.090
 nothing so when we are thirsty good goal 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.770
 premises for the time it makes it so 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.649
 go back or take it out 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.450
 tech so between the arch is like 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.810
 that's the pigeon stick of course that's it 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.799
 them 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.750
 what about ambidextrous semi-automatic 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:07.869
 burst security here we have it so there in 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.940
 view to extract from both sides one to the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.519
 folding stick temple and dormouse there for 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.620
 press it small buttons we press and 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.269
 value on the other side there are two 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.489
 nipples that will say without clicking in 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.480
 tac and the press is good at taking the 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.110
 same limits from gun 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.799
 gunner settings god people like 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.200
 on the real gg the blog has here we draw 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:34.750
 and we get up when we do that it opens 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.950
 this hatch there we can see that ah yes 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.090
 also something that I really 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.450
 appreciated on this replica 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.160
 it's a monobloc I explain on 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.579
 for example the mk all the achievements 47 of 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.290
 base we have the body and we will add a 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.120
 handle we were redeemed a crooked 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.150
 each case for example with two screws 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.500
 at m 4 it's a vi so that's 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.609
 there is a one-piece is integrally 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.840
 there is no game in this replica 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.170
 so that's really something that 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.139
 I want to emphasize is appreciated here is 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.970
 So what if it is so that one 522 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.769
 so I did not take the sd 6 pascal s 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.910
 of the six is ​​the one that a personal silencer 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.130
 I did not have too much I would prefer to have 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.069
 rails on the sides I found that 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.819
 a little more stylish anyway even the emir to 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.680
 basic materials 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.989
 the three points so it went back to 2nd 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.069
 cat so here it's the same in a small 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.480
 point to let go to hold there 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.160
 so here they are I find it rather not 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.060
 badly than no other so come with a 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.269
 small cardboard box so a charger 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.400
 Tactical Drums Recharge Their Classes 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.510
 good after a pure he wants we take a 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.569
 fast charger in this would be for 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:43.989
 change a charger for a long time 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:46.680
 250 of cgg that here it is then from 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.180
 salads suqi hatch of the base 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.870
 the engagement always so simple 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.629
 but that's how it is and we click to remove 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.780
 to load much simpler we have a 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:00.920
 target on it and keep it on 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.090
 to charge nothing more simple a battery 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.319
 who will beat me so he is provided with 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:13.079
 that's it for my cubs 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:14.430
 supplied battery so that's it 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.320
 six years it's me who will add a 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.979
 from swiss arms normally it's a 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.320
 1200 operates at 8.4 volts that's 1609 4 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.460
 to push on stage eight reiten must 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.780
 to know how to respect oneself so we have that 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.180
 now I force you that I have 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.740
 added on the replica and so that's it 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.360
 so we end up with the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.520
 accessories so so I put that 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.599
 I had personally so 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.560
 can see so I added a handful 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.070
 to yours because it's like a 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.710
 submachine gun 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.240
 I redeemed others charge also 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.130
 knows of the 250 public it's a big 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.150
 cadence submachine gun so we do not 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.160
 clears up anyway huh it's 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.410
 do not forget that so yesterday godon 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.020
 practice for those wounded 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.580
 practice otherwise I come to the point of 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.720
 this replica the overall because 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.280
 necessarily this replica this neighborhood 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.900
 rest and gyan and the blu bac there is a 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.110
 recoil it's still pretty stylish 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.479
 will find very clear so there 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.570
 So that's the fact that so already tray 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.570
 it 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:15.380
 that's the burst here after the follow-up 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.590
 so automatic 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:23.690
 here are his ambidextrous readers so here is 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.690
 replica that's pretty good 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.800
 if I had to give him a rating out of 10 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.410
 sincerely I would put him 8 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.490
 why because the black dot that I 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.560
 feel this replica is the battery 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.150
 the battery is lodged in the gard tomorrow 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.150
 and it's really not practical
