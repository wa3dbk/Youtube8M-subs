00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.600 
it's just a nice little tactic that I
realized<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.929> use<00:00:31.170> quite<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> bit<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.130> really

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.590 
helps me get my scorestreaks faster
which<00:00:34.860> leads<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.489> higher<00:00:35.760> scoring<00:00:36.120> gameplays

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
which leads to higher scoring gameplays

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780 
which leads to higher scoring gameplays
more<00:00:36.870> action-packed<00:00:37.380> gameplays<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.579> all

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
more action-packed gameplays for you all

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.369 
more action-packed gameplays for you all
and<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.360> figured<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.719> lot<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.110> guys<00:00:40.230> would

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and I figured a lot of you guys would

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.020 
and I figured a lot of you guys would
probably<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.770> interested<00:00:41.250> because<00:00:41.520> who

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
probably be interested because who

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.400 
probably be interested because who
doesn't<00:00:42.239> want<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.629> those<00:00:42.840> high<00:00:43.079> score

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
doesn't want to get those high score

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.560 
doesn't want to get those high score
streaks<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.100> doing<00:00:44.460> right<00:00:44.700> now<00:00:44.760> but

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
streaks like I'm doing right now but

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
streaks like I'm doing right now but
anyways<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.410> got<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> lot<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> great<00:00:47.070> support<00:00:47.520> on

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
anyways I got a lot of great support on

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
anyways I got a lot of great support on
a<00:00:47.730> video<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> did<00:00:48.510> two<00:00:48.809> weeks<00:00:48.989> ago<00:00:49.260> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
a video that I did two weeks ago that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.900 
a video that I did two weeks ago that
was<00:00:49.620> kind<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.920> similar<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
was kind of similar to this one just to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790 
was kind of similar to this one just to
sweet<00:00:51.239> little<00:00:51.270> tactics<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.410> thought<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
sweet little tactics so I thought I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.950 
sweet little tactics so I thought I
would<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.100> another<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.239> today

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
would do another one for you all today

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.200 
would do another one for you all today

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
a theoretical private match

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.510 
a theoretical private match
demonstration<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.280> see

I'm just in the enemies spawn

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.050 
I'm just in the enemies spawn
theoretically<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.159> course<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.700> take<00:01:05.909> out

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
get 125 score but call me crazy what if

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
get 125 score but call me crazy what if
I<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.520> screwed<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.880> over<00:01:12.150> onto<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> flag<00:01:12.990> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
I just screwed it over onto the flag and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.030 
I just screwed it over onto the flag and
then<00:01:13.860> took<00:01:14.130> him<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.700> got<00:01:15.090> an<00:01:15.210> extra<00:01:15.570> 75

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
then took him out and got an extra 75

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
then took him out and got an extra 75
points<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.729> doing<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.270> small<00:01:18.750> little

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
points for just doing that small little

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
points for just doing that small little
thing<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.799> right<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
thing and you can see right here in the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.550 
thing and you can see right here in the
screenshot<00:01:21.509> I'm<00:01:21.869> proving<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.409> also

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
screenshot I'm proving that it also

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.100 
screenshot I'm proving that it also
works<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.880> equipment<00:01:24.509> as<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
works with your equipment as well so you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.679 
works with your equipment as well so you
identify<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.740> enemy<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
identify this enemy right and you have a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.420 
identify this enemy right and you have a
bouncing<00:01:28.110> betty<00:01:28.200> placed<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> ground<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
bouncing betty placed on the ground and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.429 
bouncing betty placed on the ground and
he's<00:01:29.970> gonna<00:01:30.119> walk<00:01:30.390> into<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.200> long<00:01:31.409> as

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
he's gonna walk into it and as long as

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.020 
he's gonna walk into it and as long as
you're<00:01:31.710> standing<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> flag<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.880> you're

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you're standing on the flag when you're

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.429 
you're standing on the flag when you're
bouncing<00:01:33.450> betty<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:33.900> other<00:01:34.170> piece<00:01:34.409> of

bouncing betty or other piece of

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
bouncing betty or other piece of
equipment<00:01:34.680> gets<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.610> kill<00:01:35.970> you're<00:01:36.509> gonna
