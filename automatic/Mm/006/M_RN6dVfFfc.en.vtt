00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.410
 welcome to androidworld.it friends today 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.900
 Friday 8 August 2014 and as you well know 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.080
 these are the two minutes with android 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.080
 world 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.420
 then continuing a little on the wave of 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.490
 last week that had been good or 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.480
 bad with the sign of motorola with the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.940
 possible nexus 6 and with motorola moto 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.680
 max this registered name that does not 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.360
 we know if it will lead to anything 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.660
 this week was the week of 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.120
 moto 360 the motorola smartwatch as much 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.640
 awaited that we could see thanks 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.300
 to the photos of luca viscardi aka mister 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.190
 gadgets 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.500
 so what did we find out about 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.670
 interesting of this smartwatch so many 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.560
 many little things 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.470
 we confirmed inductive charging 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.780
 which is certainly a very welcome point 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.210
 because the bases of charging dg watch of 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.560
 gear live didn't like much 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.470
 and they seem to have given different 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.690
 problems we confirmed 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.239
 the waterproofing we have confirmed 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.880
 better discovered that there is a sensor 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.340
 heartbeat under the body of the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.619
 smartphone shell that will be made of steel 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.630
 so in short, you are sure that indeed 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.250
 the materials will always be excellent a 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.290
 about strap materials in 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.579
 skin will most likely arrive too 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.439
 the metal one 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.149
 at this point it remains perhaps in a bit 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.219
 more in doubt the one in plastic but not 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.560
 we think nobody will complain e 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.869
 finally it is the most important thing 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.840
 autonomy of two and a half times 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.600
 that dg watch and of course they are 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.210
 estimates, however, in principle 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.670
 we establish that this lasts about one 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.479
 day seems almost legitimate to hope 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.780
 that with moto 360 we could reach 3 4 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.249
 days that are certainly an autonomy 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.469
 decidedly more consistent and for a 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:53.600
 device unveiled at least there is one 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.060
 other expected but still not 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.569
 arrived I'm talking about samsung galaxy 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.969
 alpha the hypothetical rival of iphone 6 o 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.520
 anyway, I do n't know maybe about himself 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.109
 in the end a metallic smartphone 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.149
 but don't take this definition 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:12.680
 too literally because of metallic 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:16.690
 it seems that he will have the right profile 4.7 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.120
 Specific 4.8 inches maybe not from 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.820
 I was top of the line a design that remembers 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.850
 a little bit actually s2 that 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.860
 personally i didn't mind and one 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.200
 availability that probably could 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.610
 also be short enough 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.370
 although it hasn't been yet 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.720
 announced what leaves a little bit more 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.760
 perplexing is the price that 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.150
 reasonably speaking it could be 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.730
 of 699 euros 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.440
 it is early to express the judgments but the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.630
 premises do not appear to be those that 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.110
 leave too much hope 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.780
 and after talking about hardware we come 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.610
 to the software google now launcher the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.530
 google launcher that from about one 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.750
 week is finally available for 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.750
 all or almost all android devices yes 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.120
 speaks of android 4.1 and later 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.460
 we have dedicated several items between 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.980
 which the seven things we say to know about 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.990
 google but lancer the most important a 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.060
 my opinion is the fact that it is not a 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.100
 customizable launcher is designed for 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.770
 be used as well as to put 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.390
 google ship google search inside 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.400
 of your android experience for 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.739
 have voice commands or google 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.110
 always available and to have google 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.970
 now as home screens 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.590
 substantially so it is meant for 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.840
 enhance google services 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.220
 if all this came to light and 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.640
 probably will do it with yours 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.160
 conception of lancer exposed gel setting 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.370
 that if it is updated just yesterday and that 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.980
 precisely that will allow to take advantage of the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.930
 better google lancer 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.150
 maybe personalizing it a bit even well 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.150
 beyond what google itself thought
