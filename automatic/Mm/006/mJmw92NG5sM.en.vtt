00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Let's do it . 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.560
 You can see what page you need on Facebook Instagram Twitter face 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.820
 There is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:16.109
 Hi warm finish to teach today is Samsung s Air Gear you.Excuse naonjineun 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 Although a little bit, but still in the state of the latest 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.740
 I did go to what comes out in the circular comb know what side 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.220
 Eunikka do not come out one that a friend of the throne Makeover device until 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.679
 I think it 's occupied. The first thing that comes into my eyes is that it's huge. 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.790
 It's really big. Even if you compare it to the enemy, it's a big deal. 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.260
 Here inde crusher what is in fact something like a large blame, but one slow 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.809
 Let's try it. 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.200
 What one is doing this Derbyshire.The do not feel bad if you have a rubber band rotting garage 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 Let's see. There's a display on the front of the computer. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.690
 The curves are also erratic and I feel a little less loud. 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.920
 It's amazing. 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:01.140
 Now gotta do what no apparent meaning, and here I do not know itneunjineun Samsung 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.920
 Itguyo always clones border into the gear rim and the screen then the rubber band 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.979
 So, yeah, 0 Clips section at the band did pyeonhajineun go to here what 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.340
 It's not bad for writing, but it's a lot better than shooting. 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.090
 Sonny says that if you do not fix your fans, you will not be using it again. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.200
 It was packed. 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.369
 But that's the problem together long Anyway very comfortable here less than a minute to adjust its length 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.360
 I think that the click part of the War Band view is important enough for praise. 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:29.280
 And I need to be able to subtract the requirement , 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.720
 Yesterday's eopgetjiman want rather than giving birth and the story behind the new Khan / 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.869
 I have it 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.110
 There are slim card slot, but it simply writes down to the fact that the SIM card 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.060
 This is a phone. Let's see this a little bit. And here's the heart. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.240
 I have a sense of beating and docking. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.890
 Because the battery is in the dock, there is no reason to charge anything. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.170
 And if you're carrying a dock , 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.780
 I'm sleeping with him once to the buffer'll write about something so 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.369
 Heojeonhae does it look to the right and reinstall 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:01.610
 Moss is not that easy. 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:05.300
 Well, it was. 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.200
 If the party if he can do a friend a first one is connected with each personality 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.759
 I'll have to. 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.810
 Hug and link with Android 4.3 4.4 normal and somehow the gear lens 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.290
 I have to go in. 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.910
 And after a long time Galaxy s4 pulled out again, but the gear manager connection 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.280
 Do you have itjyo hasineunge set some few go on doing something Toka Alert Settings 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.510
 I have a few, but I do not really have a lot of settings here. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.460
 This is almost an independent device next year, but it's actually a smart watch. 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.260
 You can not call this . It's a real phone. 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:36.500
 Yes this is the question that cure 3g phone enters that simply 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.470
 The series does not end with breathing times , but this guy alone 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.770
 The phone also can and can receive text and Can I just make it 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.830
 Almost everything is done except for a new install of the app. 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:50.209
 If you look up from the bottom up here 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.840
 App to get off yoreotge down itjyo into Tizen, and above all the time 5t 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.020
 Bird itjyo low as floating connected remotely connected wirelessly to 3g 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.850
 There are three ways to connect. Hogan is better at setting the drug. 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.060
 If you go to setup and connect it, there is Bluetooth 3g WiFi 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.380
 But the battle called the Bluetooth act is the least . When it is flute 0 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.610
 1 stand from above and peruse jjokkeum a mobile network or a Wi-Fi connection metallocene day 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.760
 More than a cumbersome level 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.900
 I think Petri nutrition itself is so low that I can not help it. 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.069
 3G mobile network is automatically turned on when Bluetooth is turned off 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:26.569
 I can make them call me and I can always turn them on or off. 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:30.560
 Now there are do look at them one app I gon tell me your favorite 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:35.120
 Of course it side to inform notifications to alert all the time tteujyo is rising all the time, press 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.599
 You can see it or open cf. 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.760
 I can see the widgets. 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:45.079
 So what's five 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:51.650
 No, no need to give ultraviolet g to eliminate so pressing with widgets 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:56.030
 I can add another Liz to the game. 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.269
 The best thing to do is to have a keyboard, but it's actually on your wrist. 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.060
 I thought it was very ridiculous to have a keyboard. 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.750
 Not bad than I thought. So I came back to Lee genius What day of QWERTY 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.810
 There could use the keypad has failed Tenchijin is now almost the president of one guy 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.819
 It's a small device like this, so why not give it a try? 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.690
 That's the way it works. 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:18.130
 Underwear 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.170
 2 But if you go this particular garage on the wrist if you do not adapt to other 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.180
 I have to write it by hand, but this is not easy. 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:31.510
 I do not think I should be satisfied with the QWERTY keyboard anymore. 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:33.850
 The reason I keep emphasizing this as the watch phone is that this friend 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:39.130
 It is also the biggest feature 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:43.840
 The fact is too large to view this as a Smart Watch, just watch the naenge 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.010
 The problem is that it is not convincing that it is big and I do not have a watch phone 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.700
 I can do it. 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.920
 This geolro is to convince the size is simply called the inde 3g smart watch 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.890
 It's a little difficult. Why three 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.860
 Designs can be a personal taste for friends who are not so pretty 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:01.870
 205 The band is pretty and I do not think anybody can see it. 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:05.530
 Its design but also has a curve display no matter what you later Yes 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:09.340
 Even if you put it on a shaft that does not have a large burden of size , 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.780
 This is almost an end-shield, and if I am, I will be able to eat more 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.250
 same 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:18.850
 To do that , it's a standalone device, a full 3g phone 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.660
 I think we should recognize that 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:26.410
 That is to say, if you approach this as the concept of smart value, 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.669
 I can not tolerate is this going to have this already stood beyond the acceptable size 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.270
 The keyboard runs 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:35.200
 Well, it can be a problem, and it can not be persuaded . 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.220
 If you take a ceremony called "Watchbone," it 's a little bit 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.169
 It happens. 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.760
 In fact, how? This is the rituals Watch Phone with Bluetooth phones and add-ons 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.000
 When you connect your phone, 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.330
 Kill this way and go to von 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.720
 Connected state is just smart and can write point 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.560
 I think it's up to you to recognize that such an app is under construction. 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.450
 So here we go into question two. 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.560
 The second floor is now I just have to keep what's your life 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.480
 There is no reason why I would wear a watch-phone like this on my wrist. 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.190
 I think it's different for each individual. 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:12.400
 However, no matter how much this is called a watch phone, 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:16.510
 I have a lot of things to come out, including porridge . 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:20.260
 But I have not found the convincing power to carry those things on my wrist. 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:24.820
 I mean , this is a smart watch , 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:29.500
 I can get a small size that I want, but I want to get a fairy wrist 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:33.820
 Even the garage just gonna think something like a large crowd eopgetda a Friend 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.870
 It is not yet possible to wear a friend who looks like this shield to the ponytail 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.830
 Not convincing 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:44.740
 But it called 3g into the bile duct and this is what yijeongdo flat phone technology 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:49.599
 In the next chapter, perhaps because it is important enough that the kids about haejyeotdaneun 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:53.289
 Whether you want to add more functionality to your phone or ultimately, 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:57.400
 This is a chance to be like a sash 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:07:00.460
 People are convinced or not, but they have a simple function 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.270
 Come with me as a band or a band. 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:08.710
 Wherever I would not want tha adoptive father ever really present rosseon 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:12.789
 I do not think it's wrong to call it a transitional product. 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:16.419
 There is nevertheless the same out of the recognition that it is currently difficult to 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:17.259
 Since this is the nearest thing to a friend watch phone which is available bonip Watch this 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.800
 Lime 45 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.550
 If you need a simple smart watch, you may still have to do a little restraint. 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.759
 want 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.849
 Over used by Samsung's companies 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.849
 That
