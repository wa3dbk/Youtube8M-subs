00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
listening even in the gym when you get

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.070 
listening even in the gym when you get
bit<00:00:23.279> sweaty<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:24.119> doesn't<00:00:24.449> affect<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> quality

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
bit sweaty it doesn't affect the quality

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.810 
bit sweaty it doesn't affect the quality
and<00:00:25.529> they've<00:00:26.250> got<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> slightly<00:00:26.670> different

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
and they've got a slightly different

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.990 
and they've got a slightly different
design<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.750> most<00:00:27.930> sports<00:00:28.230> headphones<00:00:29.000> they've

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
design to most sports headphones they've

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240 
design to most sports headphones they've
got<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.300> hook<00:00:30.840> which<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.380> connected<00:00:31.769> both<00:00:31.949> sides

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
got a hook which is connected both sides

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.240 
got a hook which is connected both sides
and<00:00:32.960> basically<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.410> tucks<00:00:34.680> under<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
and basically this bit tucks under the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.569 
and basically this bit tucks under the
back<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.700> your<00:00:35.850> lobe<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.399> speaker<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
back of your lobe and the speaker is

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.030 
back of your lobe and the speaker is
actually<00:00:38.700> pointing<00:00:39.210> towards<00:00:40.200> your<00:00:40.530> ear<00:00:40.680> canal

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
actually pointing towards your ear canal

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.410 
actually pointing towards your ear canal
instead<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> pointing<00:00:42.800> into<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:43.890> ear<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.420> so

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
instead of pointing into your ear and so

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.779 
instead of pointing into your ear and so
I<00:00:45.690> think<00:00:46.320> these<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.070> better<00:00:47.309> design<00:00:47.640> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
I think these are a better design of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.360 
I think these are a better design of
headphones<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.570> I've<00:00:49.440> not<00:00:49.739> had<00:00:49.860> them<00:00:50.070> slip

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
headphones really I've not had them slip

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.369 
headphones really I've not had them slip
so<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.120> I've<00:00:51.300> used<00:00:51.329> them<00:00:51.780> three<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.079> four<00:00:52.199> times

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so if I've used them three or four times

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.520 
so if I've used them three or four times
in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> gym<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:54.059> sweat<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> lot<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> gym

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
in the gym and I sweat a lot in the gym

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.080 
in the gym and I sweat a lot in the gym
so<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.129> tend<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> problem<00:00:56.969> with

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so I tend to have a problem with

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.729 
so I tend to have a problem with
headphones<00:00:57.360> slipping<00:00:57.989> out<00:00:58.109> every<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
headphones slipping out every now and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.889 
headphones slipping out every now and
then<00:00:58.910> these<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.210> slipped<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.809> me

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
then these are not slipped out for me

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.869 
then these are not slipped out for me
once<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.500> they're<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.550> good<00:01:02.760> they're

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
once and they're really good they're

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.340 
once and they're really good they're
water-resistant<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.719> well<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.080> I've<00:01:04.199> never

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
water-resistant as well which I've never

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.020 
water-resistant as well which I've never
had<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.860> headphone<00:01:05.220> before<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.760> guess<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
had in the headphone before I guess a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.310 
had in the headphone before I guess a
lot<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> headphones<00:01:06.570> probably<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
lot of headphones probably do have that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310 
lot of headphones probably do have that
nowadays<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.939> don't<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.720> any<00:01:09.780> muffled

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
nowadays but I don't get any muffled

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.140 
nowadays but I don't get any muffled
sound<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:10.950> sweats<00:01:11.250> got<00:01:11.520> into<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> ears

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
sound because sweats got into the ears

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870 
sound because sweats got into the ears
and<00:01:13.140> another<00:01:14.010> good<00:01:14.220> thing<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.460> these<00:01:14.820> is

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and another good thing about these is

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.690 
and another good thing about these is
you've<00:01:15.720> got<00:01:15.900> an<00:01:15.990> L<00:01:16.170> jack<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.650> them<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:17.400> angle

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you've got an L jack on them right angle

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.550 
you've got an L jack on them right angle
jack<00:01:17.939> which<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.659> Burke's<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.259> find<00:01:19.470> my

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
jack which are Burke's I find my

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.770 
jack which are Burke's I find my
headphones<00:01:19.950> last<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.369> lot<00:01:20.490> longer<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
headphones last a lot longer and the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.450 
headphones last a lot longer and the
headphone<00:01:22.200> cable<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.680> actually<00:01:22.890> quite<00:01:23.130> thin

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
headphone cable is actually quite thin

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
headphone cable is actually quite thin
which<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.140> doesn't<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.470> in

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
which I like because it doesn't get in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.030 
which I like because it doesn't get in
the<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.220> quite<00:01:26.549> flexible<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.040> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the way and it's quite flexible and you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.440 
the way and it's quite flexible and you
can<00:01:29.189> sort<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.850> sort<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> cable<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
can sort of with this sort of cable you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.940 
can sort of with this sort of cable you
can<00:01:30.570> sort<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.869> bend<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.650> will<00:01:31.710> stay

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
can sort of bend it and it will stay

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.890 
can sort of bend it and it will stay
where<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> under<00:01:33.150> your<00:01:33.180> t-shirt<00:01:33.659> it's

where you put it under your t-shirt it's

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.560 
where you put it under your t-shirt it's
not<00:01:34.110> thick<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:35.100> heavy<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:36.180> doesn't<00:01:36.210> move

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
not thick it's not heavy it doesn't move

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.539 
not thick it's not heavy it doesn't move
itself<00:01:36.869> back<00:01:37.049> down<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> doesn't<00:01:37.650> pull<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:38.130> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
itself back down it doesn't pull down so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
itself back down it doesn't pull down so
the<00:01:38.670> headphones<00:01:39.060> don't<00:01:39.299> pull<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.170> your
