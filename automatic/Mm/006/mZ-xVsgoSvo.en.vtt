00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.119 
this is walking into his own the world
best<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.929> prepare<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.500> once<00:02:10.770> again<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
best to prepare but once again the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.400 
best to prepare but once again the
timing<00:02:11.400> prepare<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:12.420> what<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
timing prepare for what the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.790 
timing prepare for what the
as<00:02:13.800> soon<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.280> flashes<00:02:14.880> three<00:02:15.180> times<00:02:15.800> boom

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
as soon as this flashes three times boom

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.830 
as soon as this flashes three times boom
the<00:02:17.190> explosion<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.000> whole<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.660> whole<00:02:18.810> thing

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the explosion and whole the whole thing

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680 
the explosion and whole the whole thing
kicks<00:02:19.320> off<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.370> also<00:02:20.760> pay<00:02:21.000> attention<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.480> it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
kicks off and also pay attention that it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.980 
kicks off and also pay attention that it
kicks<00:02:21.960> off<00:02:22.170> until<00:02:22.440> like<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> static<00:02:23.160> type<00:02:23.370> of

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
kicks off until like a static type of

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.780 
kicks off until like a static type of
look<00:02:24.990> back<00:02:25.320> here<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.070> transmissions

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
look back here like the transmissions

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.460 
look back here like the transmissions
been<00:02:27.030> lost<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.660> starts<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.050> form<00:02:28.320> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
been lost and it starts to form the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.790 
been lost and it starts to form the
pyramid<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:30.510> we<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.080> explosion<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
pyramid then we have the explosion that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.390 
pyramid then we have the explosion that
takes<00:02:32.010> place<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.710> see<00:02:34.860> how<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.040> flag

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
takes place you can see how the flag

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.210 
takes place you can see how the flag
goes<00:02:36.390> through<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> transmission<00:02:37.200> phase<00:02:37.920> like

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
goes through the transmission phase like

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.640 
goes through the transmission phase like
loss<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.700> signal<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.300> then<00:02:39.810> switches<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.410> all

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
loss of signal and then switches to all

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.210 
loss of signal and then switches to all
three<00:02:40.860> panels<00:02:41.340> saying<00:02:41.610> prepare<00:02:41.970> prepare<00:02:42.450> and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
three panels saying prepare prepare and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.340 
three panels saying prepare prepare and
I<00:02:45.080> guess<00:02:46.080> people<00:02:46.350> just<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.950> know<00:02:47.100> find<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.520> odd

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
I guess people just you know find it odd

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.130 
I guess people just you know find it odd
a<00:02:49.350> lot<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.130> people<00:02:50.370> pointing<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.820> out<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.330> it's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
a lot of people pointing it out and it's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.720 
a lot of people pointing it out and it's
you<00:02:52.470> know<00:02:52.620> some<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> subliminals<00:02:53.610> that

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
you know some of the subliminals that

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.880 
you know some of the subliminals that
they<00:02:53.820> throw<00:02:54.030> out<00:02:54.060> there<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.930> have<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.470> say<00:02:55.680> that

they throw out there I have to say that
this<00:02:56.040> one<00:02:56.250> doesn't<00:02:57.240> do<00:02:57.330> anything<00:02:57.720> doesn't

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
I myself the only time I had a chance to

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.600 
I myself the only time I had a chance to
do<00:03:19.020> anything<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:20.040> while<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.400> game<00:03:20.580> was

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
do anything was while the game was

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.040

playing<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:21.300> really<00:03:21.660> didn't<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.959> chance

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
playing so I really didn't get a chance

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.750 
playing so I really didn't get a chance
to<00:03:22.200> watch<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.680> game<00:03:22.860> itself<00:03:23.220> neither<00:03:23.490> because

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
to watch the game itself neither because

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.000 
to watch the game itself neither because
I<00:03:23.970> was<00:03:24.090> trying<00:03:24.300> to<00:03:25.170> watch<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.740> commercials

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010

and<00:03:26.280> all<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.580> other<00:03:26.760> stuff<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.180> between<00:03:27.570> to

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
and all the other stuff in between to

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.810 
and all the other stuff in between to
see<00:03:27.870> if<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.050> could<00:03:28.170> see<00:03:28.350> anything<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.890> sure

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
see if I could see anything and sure

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.240 
see if I could see anything and sure
enough<00:03:29.850> we<00:03:30.240> caught<00:03:30.690> those<00:03:30.959> there's<00:03:31.620> one<00:03:31.890> clips

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
enough we caught those there's one clips

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.060 
enough we caught those there's one clips
and<00:03:32.459> we<00:03:32.760> figured<00:03:33.060> out<00:03:33.180> exactly<00:03:33.920> what<00:03:34.920> those

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
and we figured out exactly what those

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
and we figured out exactly what those
were<00:03:35.370> from<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.640> movie<00:03:35.970> 24<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.920> I'll<00:03:38.820> leave

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
were from the movie 24 but I'll leave

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.570 
were from the movie 24 but I'll leave
links<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.480> all<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:39.840> stuff<00:03:40.220> but<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.250> just<00:03:41.400> want

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
links to all this stuff but I just want

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.680 
links to all this stuff but I just want
to<00:03:41.640> touch<00:03:41.760> one<00:03:41.970> except<00:03:42.209> everyone<00:03:42.360> was<00:03:42.510> talking

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
to touch one except everyone was talking

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.560 
to touch one except everyone was talking
about<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.140> out<00:03:43.230> there<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.970> yes<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.209> guess<00:03:45.390> it

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
about it out there and yes I guess it

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.150 
about it out there and yes I guess it
leaves<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.959> question<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.800> for<00:03:46.920> saying

leaves the question and for saying

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.949 
leaves the question and for saying
prepare<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.700> question<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.209> prepare<00:03:48.600> for<00:03:48.840> what
