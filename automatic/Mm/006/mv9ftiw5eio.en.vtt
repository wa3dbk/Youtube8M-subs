00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
they're in standing heat they come in a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.190 
they're in standing heat they come in a
heat<00:00:35.910> every<00:00:36.300> 21<00:00:36.690> days<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.700> that's<00:00:38.700> when<00:00:39.200> we

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
heat every 21 days and that's when we

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.630 
heat every 21 days and that's when we
try<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> figure<00:00:40.649> out<00:00:40.770> their<00:00:40.980> heat<00:00:41.160> cycle<00:00:41.520> so

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
try to figure out their heat cycle so

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.400 
try to figure out their heat cycle so
that<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:42.930> don't<00:00:43.079> come<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that we know if they don't come in the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.250 
that we know if they don't come in the
next<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.250> next<00:00:44.280> month<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.570> they're<00:00:46.110> not

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
next the next month then they're not

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.529 
next the next month then they're not
bred<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> re<00:00:47.370> breed<00:00:47.610> them<00:00:47.760> but
