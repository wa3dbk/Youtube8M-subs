00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello people hello youtube is here 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.760
 again europe unity punkt.de and point 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.830
 commitments Stefan I want you now 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.040
 Show the second season here 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.830
 the led courtship the four have built the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.810
 I own mama again on the front left 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:29.539
 this is the l the lamp with 450 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.989
 Lumen consumed 75 has about 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.950
 not equivalent to a 40 watt bulb 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.570
 too bright and has also unfortunately a bit 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.239
 Delay when turning on that would be me 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.550
 See you later 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:54.510
 then here in the middle I have here 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:01:07.350
 a philips core pro led has eight 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:09.890
 watt 95 watt 600 lumen exactly exactly 95 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 600 lumens 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.200
 yes, but not much brighter than 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.320
 the others 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.229
 we have the venia watt so now we have 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:30.500
 here on the right side a philips 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:35.670
 master led bib mv with 8 watts equivalent 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.400
 40 watt lamp with 470 lumens 2700 kelvin 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.490
 oh so yes the two philipps lamps the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.520
 here will have on 2700 kelvin the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.740
 actually all here so only in the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.590
 back row of the partially have 3000 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.200
 Kelvin here in the middle the core 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:02.850
 per the said had 95 watt equivalent 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:05.460
 58 watt bulb with 600 lumen numbers 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.099
 compare the two times here 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.290
 Well, you can see that this is the middle one 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:15.400
 a little bit lighter 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:19.989
 she says sorry for 4 600 lumens and the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:24.360
 right front here 4,170 lumens are okay 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:28.390
 now almost a good one shared 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.019
 kubicas last january 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:36.160
 time passes man who was 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.720
 pretty much in use here because 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.250
 the ones in my bulbs in here 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.430
 were in the living room so here now 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.590
 behind the right row the rear 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.980
 row on the far right is a samsung 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.810
 led classic lamp 810 by 10 8 watts 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.540
 Consumption equals a 60 watts 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.900
 light bulb which pleases me very much of 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.940
 the brightness and far away from the shade 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.950
 now we come to the middle there we have 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:15.549
 a btr lamp is the brand somehow 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.889
 a brand on the supermarket that should 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:22.389
 now 12 watts and have 1050 lumens 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.950
 yes, a bit lighter than that 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:32.290
 samsung with 810 has somehow 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:37.090
 but more so much brighter too 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.400
 not so 12 well and far right 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.510
 Here is somehow from the city ​​court 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.030
 müller light as well as from the supermarket so 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.919
 a cheap brand has 4 170 lumens 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.079
 you can see that they are a bit darker 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:54.930
 is as the others 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:57.489
 and she has 7 watts or so 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.200
 And here comes more kitchen lamp 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.280
 those in a kitchen but do so as 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.799
 wall light or socket in there in the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.400
 a wall is stuck 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:13.299
 this is such a led lamp from philips 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.889
 but I see a lamp from the master 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.269
 who had beautiful yellow hue 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.109
 I like it very much 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.640
 that you can see it here the wall 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.470
 goes up 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.020
 I always have them as permanently poor 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.260
 so to the kitchen always so long 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.540
 then really light the times 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.210
 Turning on lights needs a four 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.120
 So that's why it almost comes from here 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.340
 forgot and always has one 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.350
 ambient light so that's pretty nice 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.120
 that I always get there right away 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.070
 you have to switch lights in the kitchen 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:52.030
 Sun is still time for now 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.030
 turn off 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:59.900
 better is the front left attention 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.060
 on it the leg leg of lg so the led 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.740
 lamp unfortunately has a bit delays 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:10.490
 and look at it from the front 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:14.150
 left here the lg lamp actually 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:21.950
 normal first row here front left the 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:24.190
 headline delay yes so that has a few 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.480
 a hundred milliseconds delay from that 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.890
 not so nice because you think about it 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.330
 You do not see where you get it now 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:36.350
 it turns out then yes knows 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.360
 that's not why i find lamps better 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.510
 the immediately accepted one stops the the 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.310
 oblong notes okay that's it now 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.260
 times was the second part of the suitcase is 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.020
 you liked and you could get out of it 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:52.310
 some information will tell you what he is 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.930
 Buy now for LED or LED bulbs 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.430
 would like to 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.060
 These are the current ones at the moment 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.760
 market 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:03.440
 Soon there will be LED with it 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.190
 2200 kelvin color temperature so still 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.290
 yellow out then yes so for living spaces 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.760
 These cozy light are meant to be 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.800
 and not so bright light 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.180
 So should I find that 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.180
 personally somehow better 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.810
 then look at a few yellow ones 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.460
 Sea rows as grandfather glare bright one likes 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.340
 not besides , you have to deal with a bit 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.370
 beware these LED bulbs have unfortunately 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.430
 a very strong one 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:37.600
 lines spectrum so that you can for example 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:40.600
 the led lamps with 6000 or 7000 kelvin 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.460
 These extremely grilling are actually bright 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.940
 should not use because they can 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.120
 namely hurt the eyes because with so 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.930
 a bright light 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:56.949
 because you should not actually his 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:58.990
 Illuminate living areas because they are grilling 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:02.440
 lines spectrum have very strong 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:05.800
 individual power densities in individual 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.889
 Spectral lines and therefore can one 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.530
 because the chopsticks in the eye in the eye 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:13.780
 to be destroyed if you stay longer 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:16.060
 looking in or yes if you generally 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.789
 stop that is lit very strongly by 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.979
 so he looks at the bulbs 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:23.740
 or when he buy led lamps they stop 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.060
 have a yellowish light there that is 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.360
 not so dangerous then they have more 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:32.169
 such a format urban lines spectrum where 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.410
 then he goes on such a continuous 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:38.979
 spectrum and what lines spectrum that 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:41.349
 So should a color temperature moderately 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:43.599
 such a continuous spectrum 

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:45.910
 okay that's it now for the first time from me 

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:47.440
 for today I hope you liked it 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.240
