the<00:02:50.740> world<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:52.360> get<00:02:52.600> opinions<00:02:53.410> now<00:02:53.710> from<00:02:53.950> all

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
the world we get opinions now from all

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.280 
the world we get opinions now from all
over<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.550> world<00:02:54.580> including<00:02:54.940> Japan<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.810> other

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
over the world including Japan and other

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.820 
over the world including Japan and other
countries<00:02:57.390> so<00:03:01.020> listening<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.170> those<00:03:02.320> opinions

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
countries so listening to those opinions

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.270 
countries so listening to those opinions
one<00:03:03.430> thing<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.640> we've<00:03:03.880> done<00:03:04.090> first<00:03:04.630> off<00:03:04.810> is

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
one thing that we've done first off is

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.890 
one thing that we've done first off is
it<00:03:06.280> used<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.490> be<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.700> same<00:03:06.940> button<00:03:07.360> for<00:03:07.660> both

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
it used to be the same button for both

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.560 
it used to be the same button for both
guard<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.650> substitution<00:03:09.640> but<00:03:10.210> now<00:03:10.390> we've

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
guard and substitution but now we've

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.970 
guard and substitution but now we've
separated<00:03:10.870> those<00:03:11.290> buttons<00:03:11.590> we've<00:03:11.800> also

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
separated those buttons we've also

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.820 
separated those buttons we've also
separated<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.670> gauges<00:03:13.530> substitution<00:03:14.530> using

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
separated the gauges substitution using

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.160 
separated the gauges substitution using
a<00:03:15.040> substitution<00:03:15.550> used<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.910> use<00:03:16.030> up<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.450> chakra

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
a substitution used to use up the chakra

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.320 
a substitution used to use up the chakra
gauge<00:03:17.410> there's<00:03:17.980> now<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.220> substitution<00:03:19.090> gauge

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
gauge there's now a substitution gauge

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.080 
gauge there's now a substitution gauge
which<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.750> separate<00:03:20.050> from<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.320> jacker<00:03:20.530> gauge

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
which is separate from the jacker gauge

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.220 
which is separate from the jacker gauge
so<00:03:22.090> there's<00:03:22.570> all<00:03:22.690> kinds<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:22.960> things<00:03:23.020> that

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
so there's all kinds of things that

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.780 
so there's all kinds of things that
we're<00:03:23.440> thinking<00:03:23.800> about<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.310> hearing<00:03:24.640> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
we're thinking about and to hearing the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.960 
we're thinking about and to hearing the
opinions<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.900> our<00:03:26.170> audience<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.670> change

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
opinions of the our audience to change

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.140 
opinions of the our audience to change
in<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.240> game<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.570> make<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.870> better<00:03:29.520> so<00:03:30.520> what

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
in the game to make it better so what

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.630 
in the game to make it better so what
kind<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.510> sort<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:31.900> tactic<00:03:32.440> tactical<00:03:33.190> changes

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
kind of sort of tactic tactical changes

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.170 
kind of sort of tactic tactical changes
that's<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.200> switching<00:03:35.200> though<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.740> meters

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
that's that switching though the meters

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.200 
that's that switching though the meters
creates<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:38.290> basically<00:03:38.890> because<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.790> the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
creates so basically because the the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.840 
creates so basically because the the
chakra<00:03:40.630> gauge<00:03:41.040> there<00:03:42.040> was<00:03:42.160> no<00:03:42.310> separate<00:03:42.670> gauge

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
chakra gauge there was no separate gauge

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.940 
chakra gauge there was no separate gauge
for<00:03:43.180> for<00:03:43.660> substitutions<00:03:44.320> but<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.860> was

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
for for substitutions but that it was

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.300 
for for substitutions but that it was
just<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.280> chakra<00:03:45.910> gauge<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:47.620> was<00:03:48.010> very<00:03:48.070> easy

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
just the chakra gauge it was very easy

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.900 
just the chakra gauge it was very easy
for<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.380> become<00:03:50.530> like<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.190> sort<00:03:51.820> of

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
for it to become like a sort of

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.080 
for it to become like a sort of
substitution<00:03:52.900> match<00:03:53.230> where<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.880> first

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
substitution match where the first

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.650 
substitution match where the first
person<00:03:55.390> who<00:03:55.480> attacked<00:03:55.630> was<00:03:56.440> going<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.920> get<00:03:57.130> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
person who attacked was going to get the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.910 
person who attacked was going to get the
substitution<00:03:58.660> done<00:03:58.870> on<00:03:58.989> them<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.350> they<00:03:59.530> then

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
substitution done on them and they then

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.110 
substitution done on them and they then
the<00:04:00.130> other<00:04:00.250> character<00:04:00.580> would<00:04:00.670> be<00:04:00.730> behind<00:04:01.060> that

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
the other character would be behind that

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.970 
the other character would be behind that
and<00:04:01.450> then<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.840> would<00:04:01.959> lose<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.470> it<00:04:02.530> was<00:04:02.620> just<00:04:02.830> a

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
and then you would lose so it was just a

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.760 
and then you would lose so it was just a
match<00:04:03.370> about<00:04:03.640> like<00:04:04.410> dancing<00:04:05.410> around<00:04:05.500> each

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
match about like dancing around each

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.010 
match about like dancing around each
other<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.070> trying<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.580> find<00:04:06.880> an<00:04:07.300> opening<00:04:07.780> and

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
other and trying to find an opening and

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.740 
other and trying to find an opening and
although<00:04:08.800> that<00:04:09.400> in<00:04:09.550> and<00:04:09.940> of<00:04:09.970> itself<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.450> fun

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
although that in and of itself is fun

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.479 
although that in and of itself is fun
they<00:04:11.620> thought<00:04:11.800> that<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:12.010> would<00:04:12.070> be<00:04:12.130> more<00:04:12.310> fun

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
they thought that it would be more fun

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.250 
they thought that it would be more fun
is<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.790> make<00:04:12.970> those<00:04:13.180> separate<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:13.900> by<00:04:14.050> making

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
is to make those separate and by making

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.800 
is to make those separate and by making
them<00:04:14.470> separate<00:04:14.890> it's<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:16.180> whole<00:04:16.359> system<00:04:16.720> is

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
them separate it's the whole system is

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.020 
them separate it's the whole system is
just<00:04:17.019> easier<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.830> feel<00:04:18.220> like<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.609> have<00:04:18.640> the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
just easier to feel like you have the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.440 
just easier to feel like you have the
freedom<00:04:19.390> to<00:04:19.419> go<00:04:19.570> ahead<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.019> attack<00:04:21.450> so

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
freedom to go ahead and attack so

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.270 
freedom to go ahead and attack so
basically<00:04:24.540> by<00:04:25.540> making<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.280> substitution

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
basically by making the substitution

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.080 
basically by making the substitution
gauge<00:04:27.490> separate<00:04:29.070> we<00:04:30.070> were<00:04:30.250> also<00:04:30.400> able<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.880> make

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
gauge separate we were also able to make

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.300 
gauge separate we were also able to make
the<00:04:31.270> number<00:04:31.660> of<00:04:31.810> substitutions<00:04:32.770> that<00:04:32.830> players

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
the number of substitutions that players

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.390 
the number of substitutions that players
could<00:04:33.640> use<00:04:33.910> much<00:04:34.510> smaller<00:04:35.020> because<00:04:35.710> basically

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
could use much smaller because basically

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.920 
could use much smaller because basically
by<00:04:37.180> having<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.660> chakra<00:04:38.020> gauge<00:04:39.000> alone<00:04:40.000> look

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
by having the chakra gauge alone look

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.040 
by having the chakra gauge alone look
after<00:04:41.260> substitutions<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:43.360> has<00:04:43.570> to<00:04:43.720> be<00:04:43.750> there

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
after substitutions it has to be there

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.659 
after substitutions it has to be there
has<00:04:44.169> to<00:04:44.230> be<00:04:44.260> enough<00:04:44.530> chakra<00:04:44.800> for<00:04:45.220> players<00:04:45.580> to

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
has to be enough chakra for players to

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.659 
has to be enough chakra for players to
have<00:04:45.790> fun<00:04:46.090> with<00:04:46.270> jutsu<00:04:47.020> right<00:04:47.590> outside<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.400> the

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
have fun with jutsu right outside of the

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.520 
have fun with jutsu right outside of the
substitution<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:49.450> they<00:04:49.960> could<00:04:50.110> do<00:04:50.200> a<00:04:50.230> pretty

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
substitution so they could do a pretty

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.980 
substitution so they could do a pretty
good<00:04:50.620> number<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.460> substitutions<00:04:52.090> now<00:04:52.600> since

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
good number of substitutions now since

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.440 
good number of substitutions now since
that's<00:04:53.200> a<00:04:53.289> sip<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:53.740> separate<00:04:54.190> gauge<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:55.240> number

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
that's a sip a separate gauge the number

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.700 
that's a sip a separate gauge the number
of<00:04:55.539> substitutions<00:04:56.140> have<00:04:56.289> actually<00:04:56.590> been

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
of substitutions have actually been

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.450 
of substitutions have actually been
reduced

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
reduced

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.300 
reduced
lot<00:04:57.580> so<00:04:58.470> players<00:04:59.470> have<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.740> think<00:04:59.919> about<00:05:00.009> where

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
lot so players have to think about where

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.909 
lot so players have to think about where
they're<00:05:00.490> going<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.669> use<00:05:00.759> substitutions<00:05:01.509> and

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
they're going to use substitutions and

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.790 
they're going to use substitutions and
so<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:04.419> makes<00:05:04.960> it<00:05:05.199> a<00:05:05.410> lot<00:05:05.740> more

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
so it just makes it a lot more

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.339 
so it just makes it a lot more
complicated<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.849> think<00:05:07.539> about<00:05:07.750> you<00:05:07.900> know<00:05:07.930> okay

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
complicated to think about you know okay

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.020 
complicated to think about you know okay
well<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.560> have<00:05:08.979> this<00:05:09.130> number<00:05:09.340> of<00:05:09.460> substitutions

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
well I have this number of substitutions

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.980 
well I have this number of substitutions
that's<00:05:10.240> all<00:05:12.060> another<00:05:13.060> function<00:05:13.599> that's<00:05:13.810> been

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
that's all another function that's been

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.760 
that's all another function that's been
put<00:05:14.380> in<00:05:14.560> is<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:15.130> combination<00:05:15.550> cancel<00:05:16.360> button

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
put in is a combination cancel button

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.930 
put in is a combination cancel button
well<00:05:17.770> it's<00:05:17.919> not<00:05:18.009> a<00:05:18.069> button<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.400> says<00:05:18.430> it's<00:05:18.849> a

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
well it's not a button it says it's a

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.620 
well it's not a button it says it's a
system<00:05:19.330> really<00:05:21.060> which<00:05:22.060> means<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.389> players

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
system really which means that players

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.040 
system really which means that players
can<00:05:23.340> stop<00:05:24.340> their<00:05:24.819> combinations<00:05:25.690> at<00:05:25.870> any

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
can stop their combinations at any

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.439 
can stop their combinations at any
moment<00:05:26.490> whereas<00:05:27.490> before<00:05:27.639> there's<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.240> certain

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
moment whereas before there's a certain

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.589 
moment whereas before there's a certain
point<00:05:29.380> at<00:05:30.190> which<00:05:30.280> you<00:05:30.490> would<00:05:30.610> go<00:05:30.910> past<00:05:31.210> in<00:05:31.509> a

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
point at which you would go past in a

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.010 
point at which you would go past in a
subsidy<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.130> combination<00:05:33.130> that<00:05:33.690> there<00:05:34.690> was<00:05:34.840> no

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
subsidy a combination that there was no

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.200 
subsidy a combination that there was no
aunt<00:05:35.229> that<00:05:35.500> you<00:05:35.650> couldn't<00:05:35.949> stop<00:05:36.280> until<00:05:37.090> the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
aunt that you couldn't stop until the

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.810 
aunt that you couldn't stop until the
end<00:05:37.389> of<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.660> combination<00:05:38.229> now<00:05:38.770> you<00:05:39.430> can<00:05:39.550> stop

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
end of the combination now you can stop

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.980 
end of the combination now you can stop
a<00:05:39.849> combination<00:05:40.389> pretty<00:05:40.780> much<00:05:40.870> anywhere<00:05:41.229> so

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
a combination pretty much anywhere so

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.230 
a combination pretty much anywhere so
it's<00:05:43.990> made<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.830> whole<00:05:45.190> technical<00:05:45.789> side<00:05:46.000> of

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
it's made the whole technical side of

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.480 
it's made the whole technical side of
the<00:05:46.979> battle<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.190> lot<00:05:48.659> higher<00:05:49.659> level<00:05:50.110> as<00:05:50.310> well<00:05:51.310> as

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
the battle a lot higher level as well as

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.689 
the battle a lot higher level as well as
making<00:05:51.699> battles<00:05:52.300> a<00:05:52.630> lot<00:05:53.440> quicker<00:05:53.770> because<00:05:54.070> you

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
making battles a lot quicker because you

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.210 
making battles a lot quicker because you
have<00:05:54.880> less<00:05:55.389> you<00:05:56.139> know<00:05:56.229> pointless<00:05:56.710> combos

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
have less you know pointless combos

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.540 
have less you know pointless combos
going<00:05:57.250> on<00:05:57.610> so<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.900> final<00:05:59.080> question<00:05:59.740> what<00:06:00.460> do

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
going on so the final question what do

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.210 
going on so the final question what do
you<00:06:00.610> think<00:06:00.900> nota<00:06:01.900> makes<00:06:02.229> for<00:06:02.560> good<00:06:02.889> video

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
you think nota makes for good video

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.730 
you think nota makes for good video
games<00:06:03.430> what<00:06:03.639> it<00:06:03.729> is<00:06:03.849> about<00:06:03.970> that<00:06:04.560> license<00:06:05.560> that

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
games what it is about that license that

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.230 
games what it is about that license that
makes<00:06:05.949> for<00:06:06.130> good<00:06:06.220> video<00:06:06.550> games<00:06:06.759> it's<00:06:07.030> probably

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
makes for good video games it's probably

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.700 
makes for good video games it's probably
because<00:06:07.599> they<00:06:07.990> see<00:06:08.050> two<00:06:08.349> really

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
because they see two really

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.140 
because they see two really
cyberconnect2<00:06:09.340> really<00:06:09.909> loves<00:06:10.180> matters<00:06:10.599> don't

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
cyberconnect2 really loves matters don't

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.279 
cyberconnect2 really loves matters don't
thank<00:06:13.150> you<00:06:13.210> very<00:06:13.270> much<00:06:13.449> for<00:06:13.630> your<00:06:13.690> time<00:06:13.750> thank
