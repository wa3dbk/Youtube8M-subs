this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.680> probably<00:00:46.830> gonna<00:00:47.040> be<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> least

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
this is probably gonna be the least

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.540 
this is probably gonna be the least
successful<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.170> them<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:50.280> doubt

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
successful of all of them and I doubt

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.740 
successful of all of them and I doubt
it's<00:00:50.730> gonna<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:51.030> very<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.300> think<00:00:51.450> it's<00:00:51.630> just

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
it's gonna be very I think it's just

it's gonna be very I think it's just
gonna<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.990> lot<00:00:52.200> of<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.470> shooting<00:00:52.770> dying

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
