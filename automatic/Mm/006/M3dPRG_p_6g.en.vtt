really<00:00:58.180> it<00:00:58.269> all<00:00:58.360> by<00:00:58.629> hand<00:00:58.870> there's<00:00:59.559> not<00:00:59.769> enough

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
really it all by hand there's not enough

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.890 
really it all by hand there's not enough
air<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.400> it<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:01.059> this<00:01:01.150> is<00:01:01.210> definitely<00:01:01.449> too

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
air in it so this is definitely too

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.410 
air in it so this is definitely too
definitely<00:01:02.680> too<00:01:02.830> low<00:01:03.010> so<00:01:03.250> somewhere<00:01:04.000> on<00:01:04.360> your
