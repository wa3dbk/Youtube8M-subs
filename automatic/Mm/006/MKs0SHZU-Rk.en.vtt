00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
memory wire here and this bead as you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.010 
memory wire here and this bead as you
notice<00:01:19.710> isn't<00:01:20.670> sliding<00:01:21.330> around<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> turn

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
notice isn't sliding around as I turn

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.980 
notice isn't sliding around as I turn
this<00:01:25.020> bracelet<00:01:25.470> around<00:01:26.240> why<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
this bracelet around why that is is

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
this bracelet around why that is is
because<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.380> has<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.560> bead<00:01:28.860> bumpers<00:01:29.280> on

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
because it has the bead bumpers on

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.069 
because it has the bead bumpers on
either<00:01:29.790> side<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.630> that's<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
either side of it so that's going to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.160 
either side of it so that's going to
hold<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.500> place<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.960> again<00:01:33.960> these<00:01:34.110> are

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
hold it in place so again these are

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.179 
hold it in place so again these are
teeny<00:01:35.070> tiny<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:35.759> pieces<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:38.070> pick

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
teeny tiny little pieces so I can pick

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.050 
teeny tiny little pieces so I can pick
them<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.729> finger<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:40.380> actually

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
them up with my finger and I actually

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.520 
them up with my finger and I actually
can<00:01:42.060> feel<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:44.399> opening<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.229> thread

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
can feel the opening and I will thread

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.450 
can feel the opening and I will thread
thread<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:48.079> like<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.259> needle<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.310> can

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
thread that on like a needle and you can

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.249 
thread that on like a needle and you can
see<00:01:50.640> I've<00:01:50.790> slid<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.840> little<00:01:52.110> bit

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
see I've slid it on just a little bit

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.830 
see I've slid it on just a little bit
and<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.670> move<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> down

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and then I can actually move it down

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.780 
and then I can actually move it down
because<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.680> will<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:56.159> hug<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.610> wire

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
because it will really hug that wire

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.899 
because it will really hug that wire
very<00:01:57.090> tightly<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.189> put<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.340> anywhere<00:01:59.640> I

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
very tightly and put that anywhere I

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.260 
very tightly and put that anywhere I
like

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
like

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.800 
like
and<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.920> next<00:02:02.159> bead<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> add<00:02:02.759> won't<00:02:03.479> go
