00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
to videotape all this but anyways the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.179 
to videotape all this but anyways the
Mike<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.240> really<00:00:18.630> good<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.020> like<00:00:19.350> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
Mike is really good I like it

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.580 
Mike is really good I like it
the<00:00:20.369> closer<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.640> get<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.359> better<00:00:21.689> it

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the closer you get to it the better it

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.279 
the closer you get to it the better it
sounds<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.010> guess<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.289> best

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
sounds I guess this is like the best

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.170 
sounds I guess this is like the best
quality<00:00:25.830> distance<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.369> don't<00:00:26.460> know<00:00:26.609> best<00:00:26.939> sound

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
quality distance I don't know best sound

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.179 
quality distance I don't know best sound
quality<00:00:27.269> yeah<00:00:27.900> whatever<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.500> guess<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.890> works

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
quality yeah whatever I guess that works

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.600 
quality yeah whatever I guess that works
anyways<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> mic<00:00:31.170> itself<00:00:31.949> looks<00:00:32.189> really

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
anyways but the mic itself looks really

just about it unless there's something

just about it unless there's something
else<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.369> no<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.030> gonna<00:01:33.119> talk

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
else that was no they're gonna talk

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.319 
else that was no they're gonna talk
about<00:01:33.479> um<00:01:33.900> oh<00:01:34.320> yeah<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.060> gonna<00:01:36.150> show

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
about um oh yeah I was also gonna show

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.910 
about um oh yeah I was also gonna show
you<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.540> thing<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:38.130> black<00:01:38.460> button

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
you this one thing this black button

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.200 
you this one thing this black button
meets<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> headphones<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> stuff<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:42.150> I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
meets the headphones and stuff or I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.510 
meets the headphones and stuff or I
think<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> might<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.350> mic<00:01:43.500> do<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.890> don't

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
think it might be the mic do I don't

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.179 
think it might be the mic do I don't
know<00:01:44.659> but<00:01:45.659> anyway<00:01:46.579> also<00:01:47.579> has<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.850> audio<00:01:49.189> jack
