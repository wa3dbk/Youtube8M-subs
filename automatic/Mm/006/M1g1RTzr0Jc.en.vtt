00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:12.280
 hello here is the Christian I am 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.900
 me straight on the ces the here 2015 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.240
 for the first time ever 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.700
 takes place and we are here in 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.910
 Shanghai and I are standing at the moment 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.820
 Litti's stand like that is one 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.410
 Chinese company and the represents the rim 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.110
 smartphones and i have this here 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:35.590
 new medium like max that is in 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.410
 China is a really popular one 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.180
 smartphone and now we want to be whole 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.770
 just a bit more accurate 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.079
 So watch as you can see 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.450
 we have a year here relatively thin 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:54.790
 and chic unibody aluminum housing 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.239
 and a highlight is just as you see 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.710
 can you on the front that very much 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.620
 that's basically frameless 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.259
 design so the display goes so to speak 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.570
 almost all the way to the sides 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.479
 I can here all soon in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.090
 open white background then you see 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.490
 a little better 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:22.440
 and this is a 63 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:26.950
 inch qhd display with 2560 x 1440 pixels 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:30.340
 and powered by the lotti max of 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.890
 the quark around snapdragon 810 processor 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.590
 with a maximum of 2 gigahertz that an octet 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.640
 chip and we have four whole 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.350
 gigabytes of ram 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.720
 that is too 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.400
 yes relatively rare that there is 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.799
 only a few smartphones like for 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.420
 for example, the asus in half the same way 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.030
 to provide a large RAM 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:57.430
 then we have as internal memory 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:59.860
 once 64 and 128 gigabytes of memory on 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.930
 the back we have one up here 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.960
 21 megapixel camera from sony and indeed 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.239
 I'm not quite so head gmx 240 is 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.350
 I believe the picture sensor and we have 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.830
 of course a double led flash and how 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.620
 We can see it here, too 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.850
 similar to the huawei s7 one 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.959
 fingerprint scanner on the back 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.060
 the whole thing reminds me anyway 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.640
 little to the design of the 7 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.370
 and here on the front we have 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.720
 another 4 megapixel front camp for 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.420
 babys and of course video calling and 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.720
 now comes the highlight of the device 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.900
 we see down here on 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.079
 bottom side and that is a usb type 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.989
 c connection that means the smartphone is 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.079
 the first one is now the new usb 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:01.090
 standard uses and the advantage of 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:03.130
 whole thing is just that you the the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.180
 plug here to load so that 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.820
 Charger cable no matter in which orientation in 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.709
 So the port can be stuck 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.620
 now, so to speak, with the new usb type c 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.030
 No matter we plug in yours and 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.950
 That's why I have to say that I think so 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.230
 device is definitely an exciting one 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.939
 thing as I said it is unfortunately so far 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.239
 only available in china is here though 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:31.560
 very popular and the price is the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:37.439
 device with 64 gigabyte memory at 500 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:40.019
 dollar and the 128 gb version costs 580 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.849
 Dollar will not even be this year 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.250
 but as I said unfortunately you can 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.859
 Germany did not order yet 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.230
 but i hope maybe it will for 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.519
 still change manufacturer and what I still 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.019
 to say that 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.109
 in the background we still see there 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.329
 here are other models from the device 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.560
 with smaller displays we will 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.230
 maybe even look at us 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.019
 thank you so much for watching that was it 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.019
 now with the notimex from the csu
