 there are things you can do number one 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.530
 do not use a test killer 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.870
 please no matter what people give them 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.540
 say the 3 killers do not work 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.820
 it is simply that they are to be contracted with 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.640
 the android system and you're going to spend more 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.140
 battery and you're going to spend more ram and the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.090
 phone is going to be a little slower 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.700
 or those do not work 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 do not use anything android you are already trained 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.329
 to function as a test killer 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.700
 when you leave an application the 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.590
 application dies in so much time and already 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.270
 no longer if you do not have a back 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.859
 so long the application is going to 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.929
 sleep and it will get married at our ages 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:22.979
 it will no longer be lit do not use a 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.179
 cap 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.500
 this is I want what makes the 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.450
 marks on your like totally is of 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.250
 again, it's going to be willow and it's going to 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.340
 take longer to connect the number two 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.959
 is to install a launcher any 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340
 phone you have any launcher 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.590
 they come with the phone there is no 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.119
 problem if you do not like go to the market 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.069
 get off the law pixel nova the living launcher 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.780
 min there are enough boats that you can 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.030
 install and each one of them give you 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.009
 options to modify them so that I 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.329
 give more children than the original and that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.890
 will help make the phone a bit 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.979
 faster because it's not going to have all the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.200
 weight on top of the one that puts you already 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.149
 be this one if Swiss releases what you 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.939
 you do not want to put in a launcher that 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.789
 help and in the launcher like me here a 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.500
 example I have the ipex see you here 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.920
 in the settings of law fix we put it in 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.760
 advanced links 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.480
 here there are not lying here on this 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.920
 young sprinter its 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.920
 come as he says here 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.430
 minimum calling time I have it in 0 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.409
 because if you put more and more 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.860
 the more numbers the 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.390
 transaction then so at zero 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.040
 transitions fex none that does not have nor 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.870
 one so that I do not decide and the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.340
 phone is going to see more this is going to 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.470
 be faster new when you're 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.000
 changing like this is not going to have a not going to 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.690
 have a transaction will not have anything 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.430
 debate faster another yes issues around here 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.880
 for the level by actions in system 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.830
 series 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.650
 on any phone you have to have 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.220
 the option of the programming level if 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.290
 you are also there and then then what 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.830
 you turn on or one of above if paid 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.930
 you turn it on and go find 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.450
 some configurations that are here 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.860
 these here are three are very 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.560
 important 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.810
 the window animation skg and the transition 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.360
 animation skg inc and the administrator 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.220
 grace jones I think and they are all in one if 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.560
 can see that everything is in 1 that is 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.800
 the default you put them out 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.520
 in off 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.120
 and on off this will help you on the phone 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.430
 to make it faster if you understand me 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.280
 as if all in one in one application 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.530
 an example before this here and you 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.850
 if you see that the application opens like this 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.350
 as from the corner to the bottom as 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.390
 makes the ice and came the spring sandwich 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.720
 or whatever you want when you open a 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.760
 application of those 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.680
 as if you open it here facebook 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.590
 just opens with olympics I dance more 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.440
 saw or the camera integrate what 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.870
 be an application from now series living 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.330
 in situ the spades here opens from that 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.830
 corner as it has a cool effect that 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.420
 horita wanted removes all 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.940
 effects to the phone making it more 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.860
 fast and more responsible come I'm 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.020

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.860
 we are going to launch this this application of 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.900

 and there's the tag 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.020
 lets you change applications this very 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.389
 fast is the good thing about this this this 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.030
 rom here in the camera does not leave you because 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.949
 you're in the camera but it's back and 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.810
 flown out the applications come out 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.490

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.759
 if you buy it lets you put all and 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.930

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.639
 download cloudbox and download this one from the 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.949
 global application is installed the 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.169

 I made so that for the phone to be 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.520

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.700

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.410
 like how are you staying as is 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.420
 the problem is the most are tips for 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.820
 people that although I do not believe it there are people 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.320
 out there who want their phone 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.810
 is to have fast as fast as you 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.670
 can that be an option without having to 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.740
 have root on your phone you can 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.540
 do these steps that I did and the 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.730
 phone will be fast without having to 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.130
 have root and those who are so rich go and go 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.260
 without a role and being in a rum that gave you 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.400
 by key that is of this that you can not 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.830
 make something clear so that it is more 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.820
 fast more battery and all that but this 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.370
 is for people who do not have root 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.680
 then there is an option that they have 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.420
 not because they do not have run is not one that 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.280
 says they can not modify their phone 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.260
 you can modify the phone with 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.480
 ruth and without route this has been another video 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.480
