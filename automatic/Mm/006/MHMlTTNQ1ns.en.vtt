you can see Tim's in a very similar
position<00:00:52.280> even<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.460> his<00:00:53.610> left<00:00:53.820> leg<00:00:53.940> comes<00:00:54.149> down

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
position even as his left leg comes down

both very similar ok let's see what Tim
does<00:00:59.579> from<00:00:59.820> here<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.690> see<00:01:00.899> he<00:01:01.079> continues

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
does from here you can see he continues

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.340 
does from here you can see he continues
to<00:01:01.739> load<00:01:02.100> down<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.699> he<00:01:03.270> takes<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.690> ankle<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
to load down as he takes the ankle to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.429 
to load down as he takes the ankle to
knee<00:01:04.580> his<00:01:05.580> best<00:01:05.939> he<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.570> his<00:01:06.780> front<00:01:07.020> hip<00:01:07.200> or

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
knee his best he can to his front hip or

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.260 
knee his best he can to his front hip or
it<00:01:07.560> takes<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.220> force<00:01:08.520> vector<00:01:08.610> into<00:01:09.060> linear

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it takes that force vector into linear

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.660 
it takes that force vector into linear
position<00:01:09.799> now<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.070> tough<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.340> young

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
position now this is tough for young

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
position now this is tough for young
pitchers<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.869> build<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.170> much

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
pitchers to get down and build this much

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.340 
pitchers to get down and build this much
flexion<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> young<00:01:14.610> age<00:01:14.640> because<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:16.229> know

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
flexion at a young age because you know

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
flexion at a young age because you know
we<00:01:16.560> don't<00:01:16.740> our<00:01:16.890> leg<00:01:17.130> strength<00:01:17.400> doesn't<00:01:17.610> show

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
we don't our leg strength doesn't show

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.270 
we don't our leg strength doesn't show
up<00:01:18.030> until<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.450> get<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> high<00:01:18.780> school<00:01:18.810> college

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
up until we get to high school college

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
is doing this but this is the goal here

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
is doing this but this is the goal here
we<00:01:31.590> want<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.890> make<00:01:32.009> sure<00:01:32.040> we're<00:01:32.430> moving<00:01:32.640> down

we want to make sure we're moving down

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.830 
we want to make sure we're moving down
building<00:01:33.659> flexion<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.409> we're<00:01:35.400> lining<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
building flexion as we're lining up the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
building flexion as we're lining up the
force<00:01:37.110> vector<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> income<00:01:37.920> knee<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.280> staying

force vector the income knee and staying

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.399 
force vector the income knee and staying
closed<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.720> Tim's<00:01:39.960> doing<00:01:40.290> here

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
closed and this is what Tim's doing here

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.639 
closed and this is what Tim's doing here
even<00:01:41.360> not<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.570> well<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.140> he<00:01:43.229> does<00:01:43.380> today<00:01:43.560> but

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
and a lot of my analysis you can see
Casey<00:01:55.079> did<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.380> great<00:01:55.590> job<00:01:55.619> getting<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
Casey did a great job getting to this

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.670 
Casey did a great job getting to this
good<00:01:57.119> first<00:01:57.600> move<00:01:58.070> but<00:01:59.360> he<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:00.600> pretty<00:02:01.530> much

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
good first move but he then pretty much

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.580 
good first move but he then pretty much
you<00:02:03.580> know<00:02:03.700> let's<00:02:04.390> ik<00:02:04.570> or<00:02:04.780> doesn't<00:02:05.410> take

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
you know let's ik or doesn't take

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.749 
you know let's ik or doesn't take
advantage<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:07.530> all<00:02:08.530> what<00:02:09.130> he<00:02:09.250> allows<00:02:09.490> to

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
advantage of it in all what he allows to

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.310 
advantage of it in all what he allows to
happen<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:10.210> he<00:02:10.330> allows<00:02:10.509> his<00:02:10.720> front<00:02:10.960> leg<00:02:11.140> to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
happen is he allows his front leg to

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.710 
happen is he allows his front leg to
open<00:02:11.560> up<00:02:11.740> all<00:02:12.340> his<00:02:12.610> weight<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.970> go<00:02:13.090> forward<00:02:13.570> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
open up all his weight to go forward and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.920 
open up all his weight to go forward and
him<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.200> land<00:02:14.440> with<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> stiff<00:02:15.700> drive<00:02:16.000> leg<00:02:16.270> where

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
him to land with a stiff drive leg where

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.560 
him to land with a stiff drive leg where
he<00:02:17.050> never<00:02:17.290> used<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.060> drive<00:02:19.060> leg<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.420> build

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
he never used the drive leg to build

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.600 
he never used the drive leg to build
power<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.020> reason<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:21.550> lead<00:02:22.300> with<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.600> hip<00:02:23.610> we

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
power the reason we lead with the hip we

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.690 
power the reason we lead with the hip we
start<00:02:24.910> our<00:02:25.860> movement<00:02:26.860> early<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:28.709> we<00:02:29.709> take

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
start our movement early and we take

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.810 
start our movement early and we take
that<00:02:30.730> drive<00:02:31.330> leg<00:02:31.600> knee<00:02:32.160> with<00:02:33.160> our<00:02:33.310> front<00:02:33.610> hip

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
that drive leg knee with our front hip

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.920 
that drive leg knee with our front hip
is<00:02:34.170> because<00:02:35.170> we<00:02:35.380> want<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:36.360> put<00:02:37.360> ourselves<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.870> a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
is because we want to put ourselves in a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.850 
is because we want to put ourselves in a
position<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:40.320> start<00:02:41.320> building<00:02:41.709> speed

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
position to start building speed

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.080 
position to start building speed
preventing<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.010> lift<00:02:45.250> leg<00:02:45.430> from<00:02:45.670> opening

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
preventing the lift leg from opening

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.720 
preventing the lift leg from opening
early<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.470> we<00:02:47.500> can<00:02:47.830> get<00:02:48.070> into<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.520> position

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
early so we can get into this position

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.470 
early so we can get into this position
that<00:02:49.630> Tim<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:49.959> in<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:51.100> if<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.520> if<00:02:51.820> this<00:02:52.150> leg<00:02:52.330> of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
that Tim is in so if you if this leg of

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.970 
that Tim is in so if you if this leg of
lift<00:02:52.750> leg<00:02:52.959> would<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.200> flung<00:02:53.410> open<00:02:53.620> early

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
lift leg would have flung open early

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.560 
lift leg would have flung open early
early<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.760> did<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.940> lead<00:02:55.150> with<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.420> hip

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
early and you did a lead with the hip

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.540 
early and you did a lead with the hip
and<00:02:56.020> you<00:02:56.620> didn't<00:02:56.890> take<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.190> force<00:02:57.459> vector

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
and you didn't take that force vector

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.810 
and you didn't take that force vector
with<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:59.470> never<00:02:59.650> would<00:03:00.040> be<00:03:00.220> able<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.640> even

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
with it you never would be able to even

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.640 
with it you never would be able to even
have<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.120> potential<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.900> get<00:03:02.050> where<00:03:02.230> Tim<00:03:02.440> is

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
have the potential to get where Tim is

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.030 
have the potential to get where Tim is
so<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.010> goal<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.700> reason<00:03:04.120> for<00:03:04.330> this<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:05.800> to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
so the goal the reason for this is to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.509 
so the goal the reason for this is to
get<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:07.920> flexion<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.040> drive<00:03:09.310> leg

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
get to this flexion of the drive leg

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.750 
get to this flexion of the drive leg
knee<00:03:09.700> force<00:03:10.390> vector<00:03:10.840> as<00:03:11.560> linear<00:03:12.040> as<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.519> can

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
knee force vector as linear as you can

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.670 
knee force vector as linear as you can
you<00:03:13.420> need<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.720> knee<00:03:13.989> pointing<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.560> that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
you need this knee pointing to that

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.860 
you need this knee pointing to that
target<00:03:15.010> as<00:03:15.970> linear<00:03:16.390> as<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.840> can<00:03:18.540> let<00:03:19.540> me<00:03:19.630> let

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
target as linear as you can let me let

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.900 
target as linear as you can let me let
me<00:03:19.900> draw<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> line<00:03:20.410> since<00:03:20.799> I'm<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:21.070> draw<00:03:21.310> tool<00:03:21.580> or

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
me draw a line since I'm a draw tool or

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.940 
me draw a line since I'm a draw tool or
just<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.269> can<00:03:22.420> see<00:03:22.540> I'm<00:03:22.630> talking<00:03:22.780> about<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.799> we

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
just you can see I'm talking about so we

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.009 
just you can see I'm talking about so we
want<00:03:24.130> this<00:03:24.250> force<00:03:24.519> vector<00:03:24.610> right<00:03:25.570> there<00:03:25.600> so

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
want this force vector right there so

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.620 
want this force vector right there so
that<00:03:26.170> would<00:03:26.230> be<00:03:26.350> your<00:03:26.500> ankle<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:28.150> knee<00:03:28.180> and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
that would be your ankle the knee and

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.740 
that would be your ankle the knee and
then<00:03:29.620> your<00:03:29.769> front<00:03:30.070> hip<00:03:30.280> out<00:03:30.519> here<00:03:30.850> that's<00:03:31.540> what

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
then your front hip out here that's what

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.920 
then your front hip out here that's what
we<00:03:31.840> want<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.049> get<00:03:32.200> Tim<00:03:32.920> is<00:03:33.070> almost<00:03:33.400> there<00:03:33.930> this

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
we want to get Tim is almost there this

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.140 
we want to get Tim is almost there this
force<00:03:35.350> vector<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:35.920> just<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.400> little<00:03:36.730> too<00:03:36.910> little

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
force vector is just a little too little

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.729 
force vector is just a little too little
vertical<00:03:37.750> because<00:03:37.840> that's<00:03:38.110> his<00:03:38.260> front<00:03:38.500> hip

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
vertical because that's his front hip

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.580 
vertical because that's his front hip
here<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:40.330> we<00:03:40.540> want<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.840> get<00:03:40.989> all<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.320> way<00:03:41.380> down

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
here so we want to get all the way down

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.130 
here so we want to get all the way down
here<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.130> out<00:03:42.250> here<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:45.420> that's<00:03:46.420> why<00:03:46.780> we

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
here and out here and that's why we

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.530 
here and out here and that's why we
start<00:03:47.650> with<00:03:47.860> this<00:03:48.190> move<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> lot<00:03:49.390> of

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
start with this move so a lot of

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.620 
start with this move so a lot of
pitching<00:03:49.870> coaches<00:03:50.940> talk<00:03:51.940> about<00:03:52.209> this<00:03:52.390> move

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
pitching coaches talk about this move

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.949 
pitching coaches talk about this move
but<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.019> problem<00:03:53.590> with<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:53.920> move<00:03:54.190> is<00:03:54.489> if<00:03:55.480> you

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
but the problem with this move is if you

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.840 
but the problem with this move is if you
don't<00:03:56.200> know<00:03:56.350> how<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.739> get<00:03:57.070> into<00:03:57.280> this<00:03:57.640> position

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
don't know how to get into this position

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.300 
don't know how to get into this position
load<00:03:58.420> position<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.079> you<00:03:59.650> don't<00:03:59.920> know<00:04:00.100> how<00:04:00.250> to

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
load position and you don't know how to

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.850 
load position and you don't know how to
use<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.850> convert<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.329> or<00:04:01.750> build<00:04:01.959> power<00:04:02.500> out<00:04:02.829> of

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
use to convert it or build power out of

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.250 
use to convert it or build power out of
it<00:04:03.100> which<00:04:03.280> is<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.579> next<00:04:03.790> component<00:04:04.120> then<00:04:05.049> this

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
it which is the next component then this

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.699 
it which is the next component then this
position<00:04:05.880> serves<00:04:06.880> no<00:04:07.180> purpose<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.290> always

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
position serves no purpose so I always

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.289 
position serves no purpose so I always
say<00:04:09.070> this<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:09.400> like<00:04:09.519> putting<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.940> cart<00:04:10.239> before

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
say this is like putting the cart before

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.260 
say this is like putting the cart before
the<00:04:10.630> horse

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
the horse

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.490 
the horse
so<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.800> know<00:04:13.920> you're<00:04:14.340> not<00:04:15.350> focusing<00:04:16.350> on

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
so you you know you're not focusing on

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.600 
so you you know you're not focusing on
the<00:04:16.620> foundation<00:04:17.330> which<00:04:18.330> is<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:19.709> component

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
the foundation which is this component

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.390 
the foundation which is this component
into<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.209> power<00:04:21.420> component<00:04:21.980> which<00:04:22.980> is<00:04:23.190> three

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
into the power component which is three

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.950 
into the power component which is three
expansion<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:23.970> that's<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.450> approach<00:04:24.750> here

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
expansion that that's the approach here

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.140 
expansion that that's the approach here
so<00:04:25.950> our<00:04:26.900> goal<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.110> in<00:04:28.260> in<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:29.100> 3x<00:04:30.000> pitching

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
so our goal is in in the 3x pitching

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.280 
so our goal is in in the 3x pitching
velocity<00:04:30.360> program<00:04:30.780> where<00:04:31.970> kc<00:04:33.290> ultimately

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
velocity program where kc ultimately

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.840 
velocity program where kc ultimately
could<00:04:34.530> move<00:04:34.710> into<00:04:34.860> after<00:04:35.190> he<00:04:35.400> moves<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.730> the

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
could move into after he moves to the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.340 
could move into after he moves to the
beginners<00:04:36.180> guide<00:04:36.420> he<00:04:36.630> needs<00:04:36.840> he<00:04:36.990> could<00:04:37.200> move

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
beginners guide he needs he could move

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.200 
beginners guide he needs he could move
into<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:37.890> using<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.340> basketball<00:04:38.910> instead

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
into it and using a basketball instead

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.750 
into it and using a basketball instead
of<00:04:39.390> a<00:04:39.450> two<00:04:39.600> pound<00:04:39.750> medicine<00:04:39.990> ball<00:04:40.610> he<00:04:41.610> could

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
of a two pound medicine ball he could

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.440 
of a two pound medicine ball he could
then<00:04:41.940> start<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.540> master<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:43.200> develop<00:04:43.560> the

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
then start to master and develop the

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.840 
then start to master and develop the
power<00:04:45.450> component<00:04:46.080> into<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.850> torque

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
power component into the torque

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.810 
power component into the torque
component<00:04:48.570> or<00:04:48.690> how<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:48.840> convert<00:04:49.230> that<00:04:49.290> power

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
component or how we convert that power

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.620 
component or how we convert that power
so<00:04:50.990> because<00:04:51.990> we<00:04:52.140> can<00:04:52.290> see<00:04:52.560> at<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.040> point

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
so because we can see at this point

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.450 
so because we can see at this point
letting<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.750> lift<00:04:54.960> leg<00:04:55.200> go<00:04:55.500> in<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.070> head<00:04:56.250> go

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
letting the lift leg go in the head go

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.240 
letting the lift leg go in the head go
with<00:04:56.670> it<00:04:58.490> really<00:05:00.290> puts<00:05:01.290> us<00:05:01.440> in<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.650> position<00:05:01.800> to

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
with it really puts us in a position to

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.520 
with it really puts us in a position to
where<00:05:02.400> we're<00:05:02.760> just<00:05:02.790> we<00:05:03.450> could<00:05:03.660> case<00:05:04.260> he<00:05:04.410> could

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
where we're just we could case he could

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.230 
where we're just we could case he could
have<00:05:04.680> just<00:05:04.860> started<00:05:05.100> like<00:05:05.910> this<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.530> just

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
have just started like this and just

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.430 
have just started like this and just
swung<00:05:09.240> his<00:05:09.390> arm<00:05:09.570> back<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:09.990> threw<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.230> ball

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
swung his arm back and threw the ball

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.560 
swung his arm back and threw the ball
and<00:05:10.680> probably<00:05:11.010> thrown<00:05:11.220> harder<00:05:11.780> so<00:05:12.780> we<00:05:14.330> did<00:05:15.330> his

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
and probably thrown harder so we did his

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.940 
and probably thrown harder so we did his
age<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.530> best<00:05:16.800> advice<00:05:17.100> for<00:05:17.130> kc<00:05:17.550> would<00:05:17.820> be<00:05:18.000> to

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
age the best advice for kc would be to

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.050 
age the best advice for kc would be to
not<00:05:19.950> spend<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.310> lot<00:05:20.460> of<00:05:20.490> time<00:05:20.820> in<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.200> delivery

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
not spend a lot of time in the delivery

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.970 
not spend a lot of time in the delivery
until<00:05:24.060> he<00:05:24.210> can<00:05:24.390> learn<00:05:24.540> how<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.810> do<00:05:25.230> what<00:05:25.260> Tim<00:05:25.950> is

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
until he can learn how to do what Tim is

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.570 
until he can learn how to do what Tim is
about<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.400> do<00:05:26.520> here<00:05:26.760> so<00:05:26.910> we<00:05:27.630> can<00:05:27.750> see<00:05:28.050> Tim<00:05:28.800> even

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
about to do here so we can see Tim even

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.890 
about to do here so we can see Tim even
though<00:05:29.700> he's<00:05:29.910> extended<00:05:30.390> out<00:05:30.510> with<00:05:30.600> this<00:05:30.720> front

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
though he's extended out with this front

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.590 
though he's extended out with this front
leg<00:05:31.050> it's<00:05:31.320> still<00:05:31.650> closed<00:05:31.980> off<00:05:32.250> so<00:05:33.180> you<00:05:33.270> can<00:05:33.420> see

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
leg it's still closed off so you can see

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.000 
leg it's still closed off so you can see
it<00:05:33.720> starts<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.170> open<00:05:34.260> up<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.710> that's<00:05:34.830> that

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
it starts to open up and that's that

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.010 
it starts to open up and that's that
foot<00:05:35.310> sync<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.700> talked<00:05:35.940> about<00:05:35.970> in<00:05:36.420> my<00:05:36.570> articles

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
foot sync I talked about in my articles

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.560 
foot sync I talked about in my articles
as<00:05:37.230> he<00:05:37.890> drives<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.460> back<00:05:38.640> leg<00:05:38.850> through<00:05:39.180> you

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
as he drives the back leg through you

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.480 
as he drives the back leg through you
can<00:05:39.720> see<00:05:39.900> completely<00:05:40.470> driven<00:05:40.920> through<00:05:41.130> as<00:05:41.370> he

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
can see completely driven through as he

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.710 
can see completely driven through as he
lands<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:43.080> shoulder<00:05:43.500> completely<00:05:44.130> closed

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
lands and the shoulder completely closed

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.570 
lands and the shoulder completely closed
so<00:05:45.720> this<00:05:45.870> is<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.080> component<00:05:46.350> Casey<00:05:47.070> needs<00:05:47.430> to

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
so this is the component Casey needs to

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.890 
so this is the component Casey needs to
start<00:05:47.820> to<00:05:47.970> train<00:05:48.240> from<00:05:49.050> here<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:50.670> here<00:05:51.120> with

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
start to train from here to here with

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.780 
start to train from here to here with
that<00:05:52.050> hit<00:05:52.200> to<00:05:52.350> shoulder<00:05:52.620> separation<00:05:52.800> and<00:05:53.280> we

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
that hit to shoulder separation and we

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.920 
that hit to shoulder separation and we
work<00:05:54.060> on<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:55.040> the<00:05:56.040> whole<00:05:56.250> time<00:05:56.490> to<00:05:56.760> the<00:05:56.940> 3x

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
work on that the whole time to the 3x

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.050 
work on that the whole time to the 3x
pitching<00:05:58.140> velocity<00:05:58.320> program<00:05:58.820> and<00:05:59.820> they<00:05:59.940> use

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
pitching velocity program and they use

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.750 
pitching velocity program and they use
beat<00:06:00.210> your<00:06:00.360> handbook<00:06:00.630> and<00:06:00.840> then<00:06:01.590> we<00:06:02.280> also<00:06:02.460> work

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
beat your handbook and then we also work

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.570 
beat your handbook and then we also work

here look at that extra notation it is

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.510 
here look at that extra notation it is

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
that this age is just unbelievable it's

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.480 
that this age is just unbelievable it's
obvious<00:06:11.910> if<00:06:12.690> you<00:06:13.350> know<00:06:13.470> just<00:06:13.770> seeing<00:06:14.040> this<00:06:14.280> I

would<00:06:14.580> have<00:06:14.670> said<00:06:14.880> if<00:06:15.780> this<00:06:16.050> young<00:06:16.320> man<00:06:16.590> could

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
would have said if this young man could

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.520 
would have said if this young man could
keep<00:06:17.190> these<00:06:17.460> mechanics<00:06:18.060> as<00:06:18.210> he<00:06:18.540> gets<00:06:18.750> quicker

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
keep these mechanics as he gets quicker

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.920 
keep these mechanics as he gets quicker
or<00:06:19.860> bigger<00:06:20.460> stronger<00:06:20.760> faster

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
or bigger stronger faster

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.900 
or bigger stronger faster
we<00:06:22.440> are<00:06:22.560> definitely<00:06:22.740> going<00:06:23.040> to<00:06:23.070> see<00:06:23.220> you<00:06:23.759> know

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
we are definitely going to see you know

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.189 
we are definitely going to see you know
up<00:06:24.800> d1<00:06:25.800> or<00:06:26.070> finally<00:06:26.970> or<00:06:27.270> major-league<00:06:27.930> or

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
up d1 or finally or major-league or

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.960 
up d1 or finally or major-league or
maybe<00:06:29.009> one<00:06:29.160> of<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.310> greatest<00:06:29.460> pictures<00:06:29.850> I

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
maybe one of the greatest pictures I

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.300 
maybe one of the greatest pictures I
have<00:06:30.090> ever<00:06:30.330> which<00:06:30.720> which<00:06:31.440> is<00:06:31.650> a<00:06:31.680> pretty

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
have ever which which is a pretty

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.629 
have ever which which is a pretty
impressive<00:06:32.520> so<00:06:33.620> as<00:06:34.620> you<00:06:34.770> can<00:06:34.860> see<00:06:34.919> Casey<00:06:35.250> here

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
impressive so as you can see Casey here

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.170 
impressive so as you can see Casey here
you<00:06:36.389> know<00:06:36.509> does<00:06:37.259> this<00:06:37.440> right<00:06:37.789> but<00:06:38.789> from<00:06:39.000> there

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
you know does this right but from there

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.650 
you know does this right but from there
on<00:06:39.270> out<00:06:39.830> pretty<00:06:40.830> much<00:06:40.919> just<00:06:41.759> kind<00:06:42.150> of<00:06:42.240> falling

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
on out pretty much just kind of falling

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.740 
on out pretty much just kind of falling
in<00:06:43.580> whipping<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:44.669> arm<00:06:44.820> or<00:06:45.090> just<00:06:45.330> letting<00:06:45.570> the

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
in whipping the arm or just letting the

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.850 
in whipping the arm or just letting the
arm<00:06:45.900> go<00:06:46.110> so<00:06:47.090> he<00:06:48.090> needs<00:06:48.330> to<00:06:48.449> just<00:06:48.750> now<00:06:49.050> baby

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
arm go so he needs to just now baby

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.680 
arm go so he needs to just now baby
steps<00:06:50.220> and<00:06:50.690> work<00:06:51.690> on<00:06:51.900> the<00:06:52.860> load<00:06:53.419> to<00:06:54.419> triple

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
steps and work on the load to triple

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
the hip short separation into

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.040 
the hip short separation into
exhortation<00:06:59.360> and<00:07:00.360> to<00:07:00.449> release<00:07:00.690> and<00:07:00.930> that's

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
exhortation and to release and that's

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.719 
exhortation and to release and that's
where<00:07:01.199> we<00:07:01.320> spend<00:07:01.590> most<00:07:01.650> of<00:07:01.889> time<00:07:01.949> and<00:07:02.310> the<00:07:02.430> 3x

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
where we spend most of time and the 3x

where we spend most of time and the 3x
Picasa<00:07:03.150> program<00:07:03.539> so<00:07:04.010> Casey's<00:07:05.010> you<00:07:05.760> know<00:07:05.880> got<00:07:06.120> a

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
Picasa program so Casey's you know got a

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.779 
Picasa program so Casey's you know got a
great<00:07:07.080> start<00:07:07.440> here<00:07:07.500> most<00:07:08.130> young<00:07:08.610> guys<00:07:08.760> don't

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:08.789 
great start here most young guys don't

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.029 
great start here most young guys don't
work<00:07:09.270> on<00:07:09.449> these<00:07:09.570> kind<00:07:09.900> of<00:07:09.960> mechanics<00:07:10.410> at<00:07:10.800> this

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
work on these kind of mechanics at this

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.990 
work on these kind of mechanics at this
age<00:07:11.570> so<00:07:12.770> just<00:07:13.770> let's<00:07:14.340> allow<00:07:14.610> them<00:07:14.760> to<00:07:14.849> take

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
age so just let's allow them to take

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.310 
age so just let's allow them to take
this<00:07:15.180> time<00:07:15.479> to<00:07:15.510> learn<00:07:15.810> about<00:07:15.840> it

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320 
this time to learn about it

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.640 
this time to learn about it
educate<00:07:16.889> himself<00:07:17.070> on<00:07:17.430> it<00:07:18.320> move<00:07:19.320> through<00:07:19.530> these

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650 
educate himself on it move through these

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.990 
educate himself on it move through these
drills<00:07:19.979> and<00:07:20.190> start<00:07:20.400> to<00:07:20.520> feel<00:07:20.699> what<00:07:20.880> it's<00:07:20.970> like

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
drills and start to feel what it's like

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.810 
drills and start to feel what it's like
to<00:07:21.210> move<00:07:21.810> through<00:07:22.110> these<00:07:22.229> components<00:07:22.740> and<00:07:22.860> you

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820 
to move through these components and you

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.100 
to move through these components and you
know<00:07:23.910> in<00:07:24.000> a<00:07:24.060> couple<00:07:24.210> of<00:07:24.419> years<00:07:24.630> you<00:07:24.750> can<00:07:24.780> have<00:07:24.900> a

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
know in a couple of years you can have a

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.310 
know in a couple of years you can have a
kid<00:07:26.010> who<00:07:26.820> has<00:07:27.419> some<00:07:27.539> really<00:07:27.660> good<00:07:27.840> mechanics

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.320 
kid who has some really good mechanics

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.219 
kid who has some really good mechanics
so<00:07:28.530> until<00:07:29.039> then<00:07:29.419> you<00:07:30.419> know<00:07:30.570> keep<00:07:30.840> asking

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
so until then you know keep asking

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.290 
so until then you know keep asking
questions<00:07:31.349> and<00:07:31.800> keep<00:07:32.669> us<00:07:32.789> up<00:07:32.910> to<00:07:32.970> date<00:07:33.060> on<00:07:33.210> your

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 
questions and keep us up to date on your

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.539 
questions and keep us up to date on your
progress
