Celebration of a successful performance of our team at Euro 2012. Preparation and a festival. Two cakes on the occasion of two victories of Sergey Ryabko

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's enough

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Polyashov, you will teach me to cook. You are a master

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Here we'll make the same scramble

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
- Okay. But we are running of yellow sweets
- Let's replace it with black one's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Give me yellow sweets

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's a real big deal! And it turned out to be so cheap!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Follow me!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
