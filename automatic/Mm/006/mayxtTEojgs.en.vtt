it<00:00:44.000> twice<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.719> make<00:00:44.809> it<00:00:44.989> smaller<00:00:45.140> but<00:00:45.829> that's

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
it twice to make it smaller but that's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.400 
it twice to make it smaller but that's
exactly<00:00:46.640> how<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.120> is<00:00:47.239> I<00:00:47.420> do<00:00:47.570> believe<00:00:47.989> in<00:00:48.260> this

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
exactly how it is I do believe in this

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.549 
exactly how it is I do believe in this
current<00:00:48.649> version<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.510> 9364<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:51.289> a<00:00:51.350> little

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
current version the 9364 it's a little

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.869 
current version the 9364 it's a little
buggy<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:52.100> it's<00:00:52.219> not<00:00:52.340> going<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.579> line<00:00:52.699> up

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
buggy so it's not going to line up

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.150 
buggy so it's not going to line up
perfectly<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:53.780> you're<00:00:54.500> not<00:00:54.620> going<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:54.860> expect

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
perfectly so you're not going to expect

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.650 
perfectly so you're not going to expect
the<00:00:55.309> best<00:00:55.460> out<00:00:55.699> of<00:00:55.760> this<00:00:55.940> particular<00:00:56.510> version

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
the best out of this particular version

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.450 
the best out of this particular version
because<00:00:57.020> again<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:57.829> is<00:00:58.010> not<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.309> final

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
because again this is not the final

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.400 
because again this is not the final
version<00:00:58.789> so<00:00:59.600> like<00:00:59.780> I<00:00:59.870> had<00:00:59.989> mentioned<00:01:00.199> before

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
version so like I had mentioned before

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.779 
version so like I had mentioned before

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
select them you can also make them

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.580 
select them you can also make them
larger<00:01:04.160> you<00:01:04.580> can<00:01:04.729> even<00:01:05.030> make<00:01:05.210> them<00:01:05.420> small<00:01:06.140> it's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.060 
the same thing goes with the zooming out
and<00:01:50.149> right-clicking<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:51.380> then<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.040> go

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
and right-clicking and then you can go

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.429 
and right-clicking and then you can go
ahead<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.310> move<00:01:52.490> them<00:01:52.610> around<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.229> again<00:01:54.229> I

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
ahead and move them around and again I

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.600 
ahead and move them around and again I
do<00:01:54.500> believe<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.219> a<00:01:55.250> good<00:01:55.460> feature

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
do believe this is a good feature

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.120 
do believe this is a good feature
because<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.420> does<00:01:56.750> allow<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.590> not<00:01:57.890> make

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
because it does allow you to not make

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.130 
because it does allow you to not make
mistakes<00:01:58.430> if<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.119> accidentally<00:01:59.960> do

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
mistakes if you accidentally do

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.530 
mistakes if you accidentally do
something<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:01.460> this<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.909> considered<00:02:02.420> a

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
something and so this is considered a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.050 
something and so this is considered a
locking<00:02:02.930> feature<00:02:03.140> on<00:02:03.469> to<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.520> next<00:02:04.790> feature

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
locking feature on to the next feature

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.120 
locking feature on to the next feature
in<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.659> last<00:02:05.840> feature<00:02:06.079> of<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:06.320> video<00:02:06.619> is<00:02:06.829> the

that you had in the previous Windows 8

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.920 
that you had in the previous Windows 8
build<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.430> was<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.150> first<00:02:20.510> one<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.810> get

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
build and so was the first one you get

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.120 
build and so was the first one you get
to<00:02:21.079> go<00:02:21.169> ahead<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.380> choose<00:02:21.500> your<00:02:21.560> background

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.880 
called decor8 or décor eight and it's
rather<00:02:28.459> more<00:02:29.260> preferable<00:02:30.260> because<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.770> get

your accent color so i guess this X and
color<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.610> had<00:03:04.790> picked<00:03:05.060> is<00:03:05.239> more<00:03:05.540> girly<00:03:05.870> so

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
color that I had picked is more girly so

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.070
