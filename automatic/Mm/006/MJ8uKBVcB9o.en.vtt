on it the pricing is good

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.840 
on it the pricing is good
I<00:01:57.149> believe<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.960> mean<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.259> does<00:01:58.439> cost<00:01:58.710> more<00:01:59.040> than

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
I believe I mean it does cost more than

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.609 
I believe I mean it does cost more than
the<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> hair<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.079> still<00:02:01.290> affordable

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the for a hair but it's still affordable

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.560 
the for a hair but it's still affordable
it's<00:02:01.979> still<00:02:02.130> cheaper<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.299> hair<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's still cheaper but with this hair I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
it's still cheaper but with this hair I
think<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> 48<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.130> only<00:02:05.310> could

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
think with the 48 here you only could

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.730 
think with the 48 here you only could
die<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.909> like<00:02:06.000> maybe<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:06.570> 30<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.649> you

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
die it's like maybe at 30 so if you

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.229 
die it's like maybe at 30 so if you
watched<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.009> previous<00:02:08.190> videos<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.819> did<00:02:09.030> bleach

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
watched my previous videos I did bleach

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.630 
watched my previous videos I did bleach
the<00:02:09.450> hair<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.619> got<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> blonde<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:11.520> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the hair and I got a blonde but it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.830 
the hair and I got a blonde but it
wasn't<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.930> wasn't

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
the wait pattern is nice this is a

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.870 
the wait pattern is nice this is a
natural<00:02:47.230> wave<00:02:47.530> pattern<00:02:47.950> um<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:49.180> did<00:02:49.720> was<00:02:50.880> curl

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
natural wave pattern um I did was curl

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.430 
natural wave pattern um I did was curl
my<00:02:52.090> closure<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.750> match<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.140> because<00:02:53.319> my

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
my closure to match it because my

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.370 
my closure to match it because my
closure<00:02:53.739> is<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> curly<00:02:54.579> closure<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:55.959> just

find<00:02:56.829> it<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.930> curled<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.079> a<00:02:59.140> bit<00:02:59.319> just<00:02:59.560> to

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
find it and curled it a bit just to

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.979 
find it and curled it a bit just to
match<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:01.769> Brazilian<00:03:02.769> body<00:03:02.950> waves<00:03:03.750> but<00:03:04.750> so
