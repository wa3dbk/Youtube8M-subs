hello<00:00:00.329> I'm<00:00:00.599> making<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:01.020> tutorial<00:00:01.199> for

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hello I'm making a tutorial for

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.470 
hello I'm making a tutorial for
rendering<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> texture<00:00:03.030> in<00:00:03.120> blender

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
rendering to a texture in blender

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.090 
rendering to a texture in blender
because<00:00:03.810> someone<00:00:04.049> asked<00:00:04.259> me<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.470> don't<00:00:05.009> have

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
because someone asked me to don't have

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.650 
because someone asked me to don't have
screen<00:00:05.430> capture<00:00:05.790> software<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.420> have<00:00:06.569> to

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
screen capture software so you have to

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.980 
screen capture software so you have to
see<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.899> screen<00:00:07.170> from<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.440> camcorder<00:00:08.780> so<00:00:09.780> what

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
see the screen from a camcorder so what

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.330 
see the screen from a camcorder so what
I<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.170> here<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> simple<00:00:10.860> scene<00:00:11.040> there's<00:00:11.280> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
I have here is a simple scene there's a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.759 
I have here is a simple scene there's a
camera<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.759> here<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:13.230> pointing<00:00:13.559> at<00:00:13.650> this

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
camera in here and it's pointing at this

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.910 
camera in here and it's pointing at this
object<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.929> camera<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.379> going<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.710> render

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
object and the camera is going to render

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.870 
object and the camera is going to render
what<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.250> sees<00:00:17.480> onto<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.630> plane<00:00:18.960> down<00:00:19.260> here

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
what it sees onto this plane down here

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.509 
what it sees onto this plane down here
so<00:00:20.880> I'll<00:00:20.970> play<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.900> see<00:00:22.340> there<00:00:23.340> it

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
so I'll play it and you can see there it

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.700 
so I'll play it and you can see there it
is<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.910> move<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> object<00:00:24.900> around<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.470> tell

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
is I move the object around you can tell

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.050 
is I move the object around you can tell
that<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.070> camera<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.430> rendering<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.910> real

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that the camera is rendering in real

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.330 
that the camera is rendering in real
times<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.470> use<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> lot<00:00:29.310> of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
times so you can use this for a lot of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.970 
times so you can use this for a lot of
different<00:00:29.670> things<00:00:29.789> weapon<00:00:30.510> scopes<00:00:30.980> security

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
different things weapon scopes security

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.549 
different things weapon scopes security
cameras<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:33.059> sorts<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.020> cool<00:00:34.200> things<00:00:34.230> in

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
cameras all sorts of cool things in

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.180 
cameras all sorts of cool things in
games<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> let<00:00:36.149> me<00:00:36.210> show<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> make<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
games so let me show you how to make it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.190 
games so let me show you how to make it
alright<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.370> first<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.450> set

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
alright so first I'm going to set

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.490 
alright so first I'm going to set
everything<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:41.780> what<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.110> need<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
everything up what we really need is a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
everything up what we really need is a
camera<00:00:47.180> we<00:00:48.180> need<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.750> plane<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:51.000> have

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
camera we need a plane that will have

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.060 
camera we need a plane that will have
what<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> camera<00:00:51.899> sees<00:00:51.930> rendered<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
what the camera sees rendered on to it

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.240 
what the camera sees rendered on to it
it<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:54.690> anything<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> plane

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
it can be really anything just a plane

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490 
it can be really anything just a plane
is<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> easiest<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.809> render<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.140> onto

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
is the easiest you can render it onto

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
is the easiest you can render it onto
all<00:00:58.710> six<00:00:59.219> sides<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> cube<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.989> render

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
all six sides of a cube you can render

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.119 
all six sides of a cube you can render
however<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.250> want<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.320> I'm<00:01:04.320> gonna<00:01:04.470> add<00:01:04.710> an

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
however you want and I'm gonna add an

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.490 
however you want and I'm gonna add an
object<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.479> through<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> camera<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.439> we

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
object to see through the camera so we

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.750 
object to see through the camera so we
can<00:01:07.530> make<00:01:07.770> sure<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.040> working<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:10.049> light

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
can make sure it's working and the light

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.149 
can make sure it's working and the light
so<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.240> we're<00:01:12.330> doing<00:01:13.100> now<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so you can see what we're doing now you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.859 
so you can see what we're doing now you
also<00:01:14.520> need<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.220> render<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> texture<00:01:17.869> Python

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
also need the render to texture Python

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.649 
also need the render to texture Python
script<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:20.759> I'll<00:01:21.150> post<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
script which is here I'll post that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.399 
script which is here I'll post that
somewhere<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:24.420> gonna<00:01:24.540> go<00:01:24.780> ahead<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.229> put

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
somewhere and I'm gonna go ahead and put

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.760 
somewhere and I'm gonna go ahead and put
that<00:01:25.439> into<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:27.500> new<00:01:28.500> script<00:01:28.950> called<00:01:30.350> render<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
that into a new script called render to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.819 
that into a new script called render to
texture<00:01:33.200> dot<00:01:34.200> py<00:01:36.380> lastly<00:01:37.380> you're<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
texture dot py lastly you're going to

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.999 
texture dot py lastly you're going to
need<00:01:37.979> an<00:01:38.130> image<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:38.970> image<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
need an image this is the image that the

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.490 
need an image this is the image that the
camera<00:01:41.009> renders<00:01:41.369> onto<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.990> have<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> here<00:01:43.290> it's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
camera renders onto I have it here it's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.569 
camera renders onto I have it here it's
literally<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.520> blank<00:01:45.240> white<00:01:45.600> image<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
literally just a blank white image I

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.620 
literally just a blank white image I
mean<00:01:47.579> everything<00:01:48.000> that's<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> going

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
mean everything that's in there is going

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.179 
mean everything that's in there is going
to<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:48.750> overwritten<00:01:49.140> by<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> camera<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.070> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to be overwritten by the camera so it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.950 
to be overwritten by the camera so it
doesn't<00:01:50.430> matter<00:01:50.549> what's<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.000> okay<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
doesn't matter what's in it okay the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.050 
doesn't matter what's in it okay the
first<00:01:52.140> thing<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.560> gonna<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.189> set<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
first thing I'm gonna do is set up the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.249 
first thing I'm gonna do is set up the
plane<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.810> get<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> material<00:01:56.070> onto<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> I'm

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
plane to get the material onto it so I'm

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.910 
plane to get the material onto it so I'm
gonna<00:01:58.409> go<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.420> add<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> new<00:02:00.810> material<00:02:00.990> which

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
gonna go in and add a new material which

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.969 
gonna go in and add a new material which
I'm<00:02:02.040> gonna<00:02:02.189> call<00:02:02.399> screen<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.560> I'm<00:02:04.649> gonna<00:02:04.770> make

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
I'm gonna call screen and I'm gonna make

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.440 
I'm gonna call screen and I'm gonna make
it<00:02:05.070> shapeless<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.790> because<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.180> easier

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it shapeless just because it's easier

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.639 
it shapeless just because it's easier
see<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> don't<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.439> necessary

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
see I don't think that's necessary

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.770 
see I don't think that's necessary
and<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:11.220> needs<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.520> material<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> texture

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and then it needs a material a texture

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.680 
and then it needs a material a texture
on<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:12.989> material

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
on that material

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.640 
on that material
which<00:02:14.020> most<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.410> them<00:02:14.500> call<00:02:14.680> screen<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:16.650> this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
which most of them call screen and this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.530 
which most of them call screen and this
is<00:02:17.800> going<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.100> be<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.430> image<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.300> showed

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
is going to be the image that I showed

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.160 
is going to be the image that I showed
you<00:02:19.570> before<00:02:19.780> I'm<00:02:20.740> going<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.950> open<00:02:21.690> open<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:23.020> up

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
you before I'm going to open open it up

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.520 
you before I'm going to open open it up
and<00:02:23.520> I'm<00:02:24.520> going<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.820> set<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.530> UV

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
and I'm going to set it to UV

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.160 
and I'm going to set it to UV
coordinates<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.420> coordinates<00:02:28.840> don't<00:02:28.990> really

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
coordinates the coordinates don't really

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.660 
coordinates the coordinates don't really
matter<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.470> just<00:02:29.680> like<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:30.010> using<00:02:30.490> UV

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
matter I just like you using UV

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.130 
matter I just like you using UV
obviously<00:02:31.330> if<00:02:31.390> you're<00:02:31.510> trying<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.810> render<00:02:32.110> to

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
obviously if you're trying to render to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.920 
obviously if you're trying to render to
another<00:02:32.850> shape<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> cube<00:02:34.480> or<00:02:34.630> something

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
another shape like a cube or something

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.350 
another shape like a cube or something
you<00:02:35.020> might<00:02:35.140> need<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.410> use<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.710> and<00:02:36.330> I'm<00:02:37.330> just

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
you might need to use that and I'm just

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:50.250 
you might need to use that and I'm just
gonna<00:02:37.540> go<00:02:37.750> ahead<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.610> UV<00:02:39.610> unwrap<00:02:40.030> it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.309 

so<00:02:51.220> lastly<00:02:51.640> we<00:02:51.849> need<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:52.030> make<00:02:52.209> sure<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
so lastly we need to make sure that the

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.479 
so lastly we need to make sure that the
image<00:02:53.500> from<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.830> camera<00:02:53.920> is<00:02:54.310> actually

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
image from the camera is actually

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.690 
image from the camera is actually
rendered<00:02:55.000> onto<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.299> plane<00:02:55.799> so<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:57.310> way<00:02:57.459> that

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
rendered onto the plane so the way that

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.050 
rendered onto the plane so the way that
we're<00:02:57.819> going<00:02:57.849> to<00:02:58.000> do<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:59.760> we're<00:03:00.760> going<00:03:00.940> to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
we're going to do that is we're going to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.380 
we're going to do that is we're going to
call<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:03.090> render<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.239> texture<00:03:05.879> script<00:03:06.879> every

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
call the render to texture script every

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.020 
call the render to texture script every
single<00:03:07.750> frame<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:09.220> right<00:03:09.549> now<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:09.819> an

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
single frame so right now I have an

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.869 
single frame so right now I have an
always<00:03:10.299> sensor<00:03:11.200> with<00:03:11.680> true<00:03:12.099> level<00:03:12.400> triggering

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
always sensor with true level triggering

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.809 
always sensor with true level triggering
set<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.239> on<00:03:13.739> it's<00:03:14.739> going<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.069> be<00:03:15.160> called<00:03:15.400> every

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
set to on it's going to be called every

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.900 
set to on it's going to be called every
frame<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.599> now<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.769> plane<00:03:18.069> needs<00:03:18.519> two

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
frame and now the plane needs two

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.440 
frame and now the plane needs two
properties<00:03:20.400> they're<00:03:21.400> both<00:03:21.610> gonna<00:03:21.849> be<00:03:21.940> strings

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
properties they're both gonna be strings

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.259 
properties they're both gonna be strings
so<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.780> can<00:03:22.930> set<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.260> type<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.799> string<00:03:24.269> the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
so you can set the type to string the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.449 
so you can set the type to string the
first<00:03:25.540> property<00:03:26.049> name<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.829> material<00:03:27.810> and

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
first property name is material and

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.400 
first property name is material and
that's<00:03:30.459> whatever<00:03:30.819> material<00:03:31.480> we<00:03:31.870> gave<00:03:32.109> to<00:03:32.319> the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
that's whatever material we gave to the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.610 
that's whatever material we gave to the
plane<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.129> you<00:03:33.700> can<00:03:33.849> see<00:03:34.090> it's<00:03:34.810> called<00:03:35.170> screen

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
plane so you can see it's called screen

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.780 
plane so you can see it's called screen
so<00:03:35.980> I'm<00:03:36.040> gonna<00:03:36.220> right<00:03:36.430> screen<00:03:37.209> there<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
so I'm gonna right screen there the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.089 
so I'm gonna right screen there the
second<00:03:40.180> property<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:41.109> called<00:03:42.329> cam<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:44.099> this

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
second property is called cam and this

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.670 
second property is called cam and this
is<00:03:45.250> whatever<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.910> cameras<00:03:46.299> name<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:46.959> my

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
is whatever the cameras name is so my

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.479 
is whatever the cameras name is so my
camera's<00:03:48.099> name<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.430> security<00:03:48.849> cam<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:51.190> we'll

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
camera's name is security cam so we'll

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.930 
camera's name is security cam so we'll
type<00:03:52.349> security<00:03:53.349> cam<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.220> remember<00:03:54.609> it's<00:03:54.730> case

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
type security cam and remember it's case

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.280 
type security cam and remember it's case
sensitive<00:03:55.319> these<00:03:56.319> two<00:03:56.650> variable<00:03:57.220> names<00:03:57.430> are

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
sensitive these two variable names are

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.120 
sensitive these two variable names are
found<00:03:59.290> in<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.739> render<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.549> texture<00:04:01.049> script<00:04:02.130> so

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
found in the render to texture script so

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.589 
found in the render to texture script so
if<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.489> want<00:04:03.669> to<00:04:03.760> change<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.180> names<00:04:04.389> you'll

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
if you want to change the names you'll

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.789 
if you want to change the names you'll
have<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.840> change<00:04:05.079> them<00:04:05.230> in<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.380> script<00:04:05.680> as

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
have to change them in the script as

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.629 
have to change them in the script as
well<00:04:07.200> all<00:04:08.200> right<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:08.620> one<00:04:08.769> application<00:04:08.919> of

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
well all right so one application of

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.460 
well all right so one application of
this<00:04:09.819> whole<00:04:10.030> render<00:04:10.359> to<00:04:10.480> texture<00:04:10.810> business<00:04:11.290> is

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
this whole render to texture business is

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.250 
this whole render to texture business is
making<00:04:11.919> gun<00:04:12.310> scopes<00:04:12.669> so<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.810> way<00:04:13.930> you<00:04:13.989> would

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
making gun scopes so the way you would

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
making gun scopes so the way you would
do<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.440> is<00:04:15.209> you'd<00:04:16.209> have<00:04:16.239> your<00:04:16.450> gun<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.280> you

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
do that is you'd have your gun and you

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.610 
do that is you'd have your gun and you
would<00:04:18.400> stick<00:04:18.700> a<00:04:18.729> camera<00:04:19.090> right<00:04:19.570> where<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.870> the

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
would stick a camera right where the the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.370 
would stick a camera right where the the
end<00:04:21.579> of<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.060> scope<00:04:22.389> is<00:04:22.950> so<00:04:23.950> this<00:04:24.310> camera<00:04:24.849> here

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
end of the scope is so this camera here

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.260 
end of the scope is so this camera here
renders<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.620> little<00:04:26.860> plane<00:04:27.220> that<00:04:27.760> is<00:04:27.880> inside

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
renders to a little plane that is inside

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.900 
renders to a little plane that is inside
the<00:04:28.330> scope<00:04:28.810> there<00:04:29.320> it's<00:04:30.160> this<00:04:30.370> white<00:04:30.669> piece

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
the scope there it's this white piece

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.610 
the scope there it's this white piece
that<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.180> can<00:04:31.270> see<00:04:31.450> on<00:04:31.599> the<00:04:31.750> on<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:32.260> viewport

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
that you can see on the on the viewport

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.029

here
so<00:04:33.610> right<00:04:33.880> now<00:04:34.150> in<00:04:34.450> this<00:04:34.599> particular<00:04:34.810> scene

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
so right now in this particular scene

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.360 
so right now in this particular scene
the<00:04:36.910> player<00:04:37.479> sees<00:04:37.930> from<00:04:38.110> this<00:04:38.320> camera<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.919> you

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
the player sees from this camera and you

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.690 
the player sees from this camera and you
could<00:04:39.550> set<00:04:39.820> which<00:04:40.210> camera<00:04:40.599> the<00:04:40.720> player<00:04:40.930> sees

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
could set which camera the player sees

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.050 
could set which camera the player sees
to<00:04:42.700> go<00:04:42.820> into<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.150> scene<00:04:43.419> properties<00:04:44.080> up<00:04:44.470> here

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
to go into the scene properties up here

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.390 
to go into the scene properties up here
it's<00:04:46.060> right<00:04:46.449> here<00:04:46.780> this<00:04:47.020> little<00:04:47.229> camera<00:04:47.919> thing

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
it's right here this little camera thing

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.710 
it's right here this little camera thing
so<00:04:48.729> you<00:04:48.820> because<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.120> don't<00:04:49.270> want<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.510> player

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
so you because you don't want the player

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.810 
so you because you don't want the player
to<00:04:49.750> see<00:04:50.110> through<00:04:50.320> this<00:04:50.440> one<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.800> would<00:04:50.889> try

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
to see through this one that would try

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.060 
to see through this one that would try
to<00:04:51.880> defeat<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.240> purpose

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
to defeat the purpose

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.270 
to defeat the purpose
so<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:55.360> camera<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:56.169> one<00:04:56.440> that's<00:04:56.680> at<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.130> end

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
so this camera the one that's at the end

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.339 
so this camera the one that's at the end
of<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.460> scope<00:04:57.849> if<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.450> go<00:04:58.539> into<00:04:58.719> the<00:04:58.870> camera

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
of the scope if you go into the camera

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.390 
of the scope if you go into the camera
data<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:01.570> has<00:05:01.599> a<00:05:01.780> large<00:05:02.440> focal<00:05:02.950> length<00:05:03.130> and

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
data it has a large focal length and

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.700 
data it has a large focal length and
that

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
that

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.420 
that
be<00:05:04.490> narrower<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.120> appear<00:05:05.900> magnified<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:07.190> all

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
be narrower and appear magnified so all

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.100 
be narrower and appear magnified so all
it<00:05:07.610> is<00:05:07.730> is<00:05:08.030> this<00:05:08.480> camera<00:05:08.810> here<00:05:09.110> is<00:05:11.110> rendering

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
it is is this camera here is rendering

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.370 
it is is this camera here is rendering
onto<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.530> little<00:05:12.800> plane<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:15.110> finished

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
onto this little plane and the finished

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.550 
onto this little plane and the finished
product<00:05:15.830> looks<00:05:16.990> like<00:05:17.990> this<00:05:20.290> so<00:05:21.290> you<00:05:21.380> can<00:05:21.410> see

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
product looks like this so you can see

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.970 
product looks like this so you can see
it's<00:05:21.860> it's<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.460> very<00:05:22.960> natural-looking<00:05:23.980> scope

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
it's it's a very natural-looking scope

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.020 
it's it's a very natural-looking scope
in<00:05:25.630> that<00:05:26.630> only<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.290> part<00:05:27.650> inside<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:28.370> actual

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
in that only the part inside the actual

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.800 
in that only the part inside the actual
scope<00:05:29.270> is<00:05:29.480> magnified<00:05:31.420> other<00:05:32.420> things<00:05:32.690> you

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
scope is magnified other things you

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.360 
scope is magnified other things you
could<00:05:32.930> do<00:05:33.050> with<00:05:33.080> this<00:05:33.320> would<00:05:33.590> be<00:05:33.740> like<00:05:33.950> you

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
could do with this would be like you

know you you put a camera on one part of
a<00:05:38.990> hallway<00:05:39.200> but<00:05:40.100> the<00:05:40.220> plane<00:05:40.490> that<00:05:40.760> it<00:05:40.880> renders

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
a hallway but the plane that it renders

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.030 
a hallway but the plane that it renders
to<00:05:41.450> on<00:05:41.630> a<00:05:41.660> totally<00:05:42.260> different<00:05:42.560> part<00:05:42.740> of<00:05:42.890> the

to on a totally different part of the

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.610 
to on a totally different part of the
