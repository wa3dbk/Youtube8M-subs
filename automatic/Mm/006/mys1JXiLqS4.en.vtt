00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
all right now we're on to step number

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.460 
all right now we're on to step number
two<00:00:02.340> what<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.419> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.720> add<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:03.899> this<00:00:04.259> step

right click here and duplicate this
instead<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.950> basic<00:00:11.280> orb<00:00:11.490> or<00:00:11.700> even<00:00:11.880> call<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.059> a

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
instead of a basic orb or even call it a

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.519 
instead of a basic orb or even call it a
basic<00:00:12.599> glow<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:14.750> now<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.109> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.440> get

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
basic glow and now this is going to get

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.279 
basic glow and now this is going to get
a<00:00:16.590> little<00:00:16.859> confusing<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.520> try<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.910> keep<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.330> now

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
a little confusing so try to keep up now

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.519 
a little confusing so try to keep up now
inside<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.490> our<00:00:20.699> scene<00:00:21.119> 1<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:22.199> have<00:00:22.380> an

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
inside of our scene 1 we have an

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.839 
inside of our scene 1 we have an
instance<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:24.350> basic<00:00:25.350> orb<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.400> call<00:00:26.609> this

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
instance of a basic orb and we call this

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.030 
instance of a basic orb and we call this
my<00:00:27.330> orb<00:00:28.939> inside<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.480> basic<00:00:31.080> orb<00:00:31.289> we're<00:00:31.830> going

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
my orb inside of a basic orb we're going

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.910 
my orb inside of a basic orb we're going
to<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.309> an<00:00:32.430> instance<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.300> basic<00:00:33.719> glow<00:00:34.020> so

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
to have an instance of a basic glow so

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.360 
to have an instance of a basic glow so
we're<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.489> go<00:00:35.640> into<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:37.530> basic<00:00:37.890> orb<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
we're going to go into the basic orb and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.000 
we're going to go into the basic orb and
we're<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> drag<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:41.450> a<00:00:42.450> basic<00:00:43.320> glow

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.830 

we're<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> give<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.610> instance<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.390> name

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
we're going to give this instance a name

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
thing I want to do is line these objects

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.490 
thing I want to do is line these objects
up<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> glow<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.780> top<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.259> orb

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
up so that the glow is on top of the orb

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.490 
up so that the glow is on top of the orb
so<00:01:29.280> I'm<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.820> use<00:01:30.360> my<00:01:30.390> selection<00:01:31.020> tool<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so I'm going to use my selection tool to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.770 
so I'm going to use my selection tool to
select<00:01:31.530> these<00:01:31.979> two<00:01:32.040> objects<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:33.420> I'm<00:01:33.570> going

select these two objects then I'm going
to<00:01:33.900> go<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.200> line<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.329> then<00:01:36.329> align

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
to go to a line and then align

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.069 
to go to a line and then align
horizontally<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.250> align<00:01:38.610> vertically<00:01:39.150> now<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
horizontally and align vertically now it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.460 
horizontally and align vertically now it
looks<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.590> solid<00:01:40.979> object<00:01:41.630> now<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.960> still

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
looks like one solid object now I still

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.330 
looks like one solid object now I still
have<00:01:43.649> my<00:01:43.799> orb<00:01:44.009> selected<00:01:45.020> actually<00:01:46.020> no<00:01:46.310> now<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
have my orb selected actually no now I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.969 
have my orb selected actually no now I
just<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.700> my<00:01:47.939> glow<00:01:48.360> selected<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.290> i'm<00:01:49.799> going

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
just have my glow selected and i'm going

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.420 
just have my glow selected and i'm going
to<00:01:50.070> use<00:01:50.340> code<00:01:50.790> snippets<00:01:52.250> which<00:01:53.250> are

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
to use code snippets which are

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.940 
to use code snippets which are
pre-designed<00:01:55.159> action<00:01:56.159> scripts<00:01:56.509> to<00:01:57.680> fade<00:01:58.680> out

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
pre-designed action scripts to fade out

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.420 
pre-designed action scripts to fade out
the<00:01:59.520> glove<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.390> I've<00:02:00.509> no<00:02:00.659> need<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.899> go<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the glove so I've no need to go to

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.290 
the glove so I've no need to go to
animation<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:03.119> fade<00:02:03.540> out<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> movie<00:02:04.170> clip

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300
