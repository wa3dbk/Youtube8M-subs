want<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.649> do<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.979> before<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.369> actually<00:02:05.549> do

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
want to do this before you actually do

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.580 
want to do this before you actually do
it<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:07.259> might<00:02:07.560> need<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.920> honestly<00:02:09.349> I'm<00:02:10.349> not

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
it you might need that honestly I'm not

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.050 
it you might need that honestly I'm not
entirely<00:02:10.890> sure<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.489> I'm<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> go

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
entirely sure and I'm not going to go

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.520 
entirely sure and I'm not going to go
back<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.420> check<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.810> because

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
back and check it because

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.500 
back and check it because
I<00:02:13.560> downloaded<00:02:13.830> DirectX<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.940> then<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> couldn't

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
I downloaded DirectX and then I couldn't

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.790 
I downloaded DirectX and then I couldn't
figure<00:02:15.630> out<00:02:15.750> how<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.050> download<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.590> because<00:02:16.650> I

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
figure out how to download it because I

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.320 
figure out how to download it because I
heard<00:02:16.980> you're<00:02:17.100> supposed<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.430> go<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.640> DirectX

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
heard you're supposed to go to DirectX

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.580 
heard you're supposed to go to DirectX
and<00:02:18.569> then<00:02:18.720> from<00:02:19.020> there<00:02:19.170> you're<00:02:19.290> supposed<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
and then from there you're supposed to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.210 
and then from there you're supposed to
download<00:02:20.010> X<00:02:21.319> WMA<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.350> code<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.010> actually

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
download X WMA and code and I actually

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.070 
download X WMA and code and I actually
just<00:02:23.550> googled<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.150> downloaded<00:02:24.660> from<00:02:24.959> a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
just googled it and downloaded from a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.740 
just googled it and downloaded from a
direct<00:02:25.470> link<00:02:25.709> after<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.209> would<00:02:27.720> just

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
direct link after so I would just

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
direct link after so I would just
download<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.410> first<00:02:28.709> see<00:02:29.100> if<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.280> works<00:02:29.490> if

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
download this first see if it works if

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.880 
download this first see if it works if
it<00:02:29.790> doesn't<00:02:29.819> work<00:02:30.270> then<00:02:30.660> go<00:02:30.930> download<00:02:31.470> direct

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
it doesn't work then go download direct

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.650 
it doesn't work then go download direct
X<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.430> that's<00:02:32.489> probably<00:02:32.910> what<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.239> need<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
X and that's probably what you need to

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.690 
X and that's probably what you need to
actually<00:02:33.980> convert<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.160> or<00:02:35.310> something<00:02:35.580> this

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
actually convert it or something this

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.970 
actually convert it or something this
might<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:35.940> be<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.330> command<00:02:36.630> line<00:02:36.870> code<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
might just be the command line code to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.180 
might just be the command line code to
actually<00:02:38.280> run<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.900> am<00:02:40.080> not<00:02:40.380> entirely

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
actually run it so I am not entirely

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.910 
actually run it so I am not entirely
sure<00:02:41.520> if<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:42.959> what<00:02:43.110> any<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.650> fact<00:02:43.680> you

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
sure if this is what any in fact you

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.140 
sure if this is what any in fact you
know<00:02:44.010> what<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.220> probably<00:02:44.250> isn't<00:02:44.760> what<00:02:45.030> you

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
know what it probably isn't what you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.340 
know what it probably isn't what you
need<00:02:45.300> because<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:45.959> small<00:02:48.350> anyway

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
need because it's just so small anyway

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.979 
need because it's just so small anyway
anyway<00:02:49.739> let's<00:02:50.489> get<00:02:50.610> down<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.570> basically

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
anyway let's get down to it so basically

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.750 
anyway let's get down to it so basically
once<00:02:52.320> you've<00:02:52.470> got<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.830> up<00:02:53.040> open<00:02:53.550> up<00:02:53.670> a

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
once you've got this up open up a

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.610 
once you've got this up open up a
command<00:02:54.060> line<00:02:54.209> doesn't<00:02:54.660> need<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.959> be<00:02:55.080> run<00:02:55.350> by

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
command line doesn't need to be run by

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.830 
command line doesn't need to be run by
the<00:02:55.650> administrator<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.780> CMD<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:59.720> let's<00:03:00.720> see

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
the administrator so CMD and let's see

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.570 
the administrator so CMD and let's see
if<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.140> do<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.530> my<00:03:01.590> first<00:03:01.950> try<00:03:02.250> because

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
if I can do this on my first try because

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.420 
if I can do this on my first try because
a<00:03:02.760> little<00:03:03.330> bit<00:03:03.510> rusty<00:03:03.660> at<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:03.959> let's<00:03:04.890> see<00:03:05.130> all

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
a little bit rusty at this let's see all

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.900 
a little bit rusty at this let's see all
right<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:05.790> CD<00:03:06.920> desktop<00:03:10.220> then<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.340> will<00:03:11.519> see<00:03:11.760> D

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
right so CD desktop then you will see D

wherever you put this so just a ship
remind<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.900> should<00:03:19.110> be<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.500> W<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.959> V<00:03:21.959> not

remind you this should be in W a V not
entirely<00:03:23.220> sure<00:03:23.430> if<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.790> convert<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.269> from

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
entirely sure if and can convert it from

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.490 
entirely sure if and can convert it from
mp3<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.829> heard<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.250> can't<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:26.880> would<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:28.290> needs

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
mp3 I heard it can't so I would it needs

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.890 
mp3 I heard it can't so I would it needs
to<00:03:28.590> be<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.769> wav<00:03:29.489> format<00:03:30.090> before<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.750> convert

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
to be in wav format before you convert

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.759 
to be in wav format before you convert
it<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.829> CD<00:03:32.760> yourself<00:03:33.209> into<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:34.320> which<00:03:34.620> is

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
it so CD yourself into this which is

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.400 
it so CD yourself into this which is
called<00:03:35.010> X<00:03:36.440> WMA<00:03:38.600> okay<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:39.660> now<00:03:39.840> we're<00:03:39.989> inside<00:03:40.110> of

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
let you guys know when you download it

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.160 
let you guys know when you download it
it<00:04:01.650> has<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.190> be<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.640> same<00:04:03.120> file<00:04:03.780> as<00:04:04.109> the

it has to be in the same file as the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.979 
it has to be in the same file as the
song<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:05.190> this<00:04:05.489> needs<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.299> be<00:04:06.450> dragged<00:04:06.720> into
