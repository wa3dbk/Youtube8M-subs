very<00:01:56.930> inspiring<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:57.770> felt<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.159> the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
very inspiring and I felt that the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.860 
very inspiring and I felt that the
energy<00:01:58.880> because<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.330> space<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.659> very

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
energy because the space is very

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.050 
energy because the space is very
interesting<00:02:00.560> for<00:02:00.710> me<00:02:00.770> but<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.670> end<00:02:01.790> you

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
interesting for me but in the end you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.530 
interesting for me but in the end you
know<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.390> almost<00:02:02.570> built<00:02:02.960> over<00:02:03.650> everything<00:02:04.540> but

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
know we almost built over everything but

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.309 
know we almost built over everything but
I<00:02:05.750> mean<00:02:06.080> that's<00:02:06.260> how<00:02:06.440> it<00:02:06.590> works<00:02:06.799> I<00:02:07.040> guess

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
I mean that's how it works I guess

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.490 
I mean that's how it works I guess
area<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.599> if<00:02:10.599> we<00:02:10.810> go<00:02:10.959> up<00:02:11.140> here<00:02:14.010> there<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.099> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
area and if we go up here there is the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.679 
area and if we go up here there is the
