00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 welcome to this handy grass in the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.540
 that we will teach you how you can train 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.400
 your parrot to talk parrots 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 They are usually very sociable birds and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.240
 smart but you must also have 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.460
 in mind that the skills that can 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.949
 develop they differ a lot from an animal 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.550
 to another and depending on the parrot can 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.850
 speak more 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.910
 - or even never get to do it 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.230
 usually they usually take a few months 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.750
 pronounce words in a way 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.849
 intelligible but from the beginning you 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.849
 Parrot will try to imitate some sounds 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.230
 to start during the sessions of 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.690
 training the best is that the parrot 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.699
 stay inside your cage choose a 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.010
 quiet place and at a height that gives 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.989
 security and that allows us to treat you 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.360
 you to you for example at the height of 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.489
 our eyes make sure that the animal 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.149
 is comfortable with you and deals with 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.149
 affection and affection 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.339
 the best time for him to learn is the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.650
 early age since you bought it 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.020
 spends 10 to 15 minutes a day for 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.540
 work with him and train him 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.790
 try not to exceed this time of 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.740
 otherwise it is quite possible that the parrot will 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.290
 get bored and stop paying attention 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.540
 during training times 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.610
 you must be both alone turn off the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.460
 TV and try that nobody 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.560
 interrupt or bother you begin 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.780
 repeating it continuously and in a manner 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.840
 clear some simple word of one or 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.090
 two syllables like for example or that of a 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.130
 man you should know that the only sound 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.280
 that you do not have to use is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.560
 this sound reminds them of their enemies 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.619
 natural of the jungle and could do that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.229
 the bird grow scared 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.689
 mariah establishes a daily routine of 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.640
 time and repetition try not to change 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.549
 of word until he pronounces it well 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.710
 so as not to confuse him and especially not 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.200
 you despair of the learning process 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.759
 It differs a lot from one animal to another and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.670
 until your parrot begins to emit 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.429
 sounds can go from a month to 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.560
 a year or more as soon as you see the bird 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.360
 start making some breakthrough reward 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.720
 you with a prize that can be for 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.849
 example some peanuts take well the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.459
 animal will learn to associate and the 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.400
 teaching will become a game for 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.410
 he once the bird begins to repeat the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.040
 words that you are teaching him and be more 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.040
 expressive 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.129
 and it's time to go incorporating 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.049
 longer and specific phrases try 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.110
 include words that contain vowels 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:46.140
 strong and r sound so that it is capable 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.599
 to learn and better differentiate ones 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.170
 sounds of others in the sentence as per 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.890
 example currito the new pretty gold the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.930
 Donkey Maria Maria following these 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.660
 basic tips in a few months 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.760
 you should start talking and imitating 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.209
 the sounds that you repeat daily 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.180
 You already know, dedicate time and establish 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.230
 a routine of teaching and dedication 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.230
 patience and good luck
