00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
moving in out of the David's kind of it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.050 
moving in out of the David's kind of it
was<00:04:04.650> finished<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.280> there<00:04:05.430> will<00:04:05.550> be<00:04:05.670> kind<00:04:05.910> of

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
was finished and there will be kind of

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.270 
was finished and there will be kind of
thinking<00:04:06.630> we've<00:04:07.530> got<00:04:07.680> enough<00:04:07.860> time<00:04:08.069> we're

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
thinking we've got enough time we're

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.460 
thinking we've got enough time we're
gonna<00:04:08.400> try<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.269> maybe<00:04:09.569> look<00:04:09.930> at<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.110> mix<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.440> a

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
gonna try to maybe look at the mix it a

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.589 
gonna try to maybe look at the mix it a
bit<00:04:10.560> more<00:04:10.830> separately<00:04:11.370> BR<00:04:11.580> never<00:04:12.269> saw<00:04:12.420> nothing

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
bit more separately BR never saw nothing

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.009 
bit more separately BR never saw nothing
then<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.410> plan<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.060> is<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.420> do<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:15.720> round

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
then the plan is to is to do it round

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.780 
then the plan is to is to do it round
next<00:04:16.979> was<00:04:17.540> festivals

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.570 

Oh

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:37.010 

no<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:27.330> know<00:04:30.199> gymnastics

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.689 

I<00:04:37.110> start<00:04:37.800> with<00:04:37.889> innocent<00:04:38.250> of<00:04:38.340> mundane

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
I start with innocent of mundane

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.820 
I start with innocent of mundane
properly<00:04:39.419> with<00:04:39.569> the<00:04:39.660> foreground<00:04:40.020> I'm<00:04:40.259> not<00:04:40.440> of

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
properly with the foreground I'm not of

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.529 
properly with the foreground I'm not of
all<00:04:41.069> the<00:04:41.160> guys<00:04:41.340> in<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.639> band<00:04:41.789> I've<00:04:42.030> known<00:04:42.330> them

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
all the guys in the band I've known them

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.360 
all the guys in the band I've known them
for<00:04:42.720> years<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.940> German<00:04:45.270> Jeremy<00:04:46.220> played<00:04:47.220> on

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
for years the German Jeremy played on

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.219 
for years the German Jeremy played on
the<00:04:47.490> record<00:04:47.849> and<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.330> keyboard<00:04:48.780> Turnpike

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
the record and the keyboard Turnpike

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.350 
the record and the keyboard Turnpike
roll<00:04:49.500> has<00:04:49.830> played<00:04:50.099> on<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.520> racist<00:04:50.879> records<00:04:51.270> it

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
roll has played on a racist records it

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.420 
roll has played on a racist records it
because<00:04:51.599> he<00:04:51.750> played<00:04:51.930> on<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.139> record<00:04:52.259> I<00:04:52.710> still

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
because he played on the record I still

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.450 
because he played on the record I still
haven't<00:04:54.030> played<00:04:54.180> with<00:04:54.539> them<00:04:54.800> ever<00:04:55.800> anything

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
haven't played with them ever anything

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.180 
haven't played with them ever anything
so<00:04:56.909> I'm<00:04:57.810> assuming<00:04:58.080> that<00:04:58.319> the<00:04:58.590> first<00:04:58.800> time<00:04:59.069> it's

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
so I'm assuming that the first time it's

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.219 
so I'm assuming that the first time it's
going<00:04:59.220> to<00:04:59.400> be<00:04:59.460> quite<00:04:59.699> interesting

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
going to be quite interesting

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.300 
going to be quite interesting
everybody's<00:05:01.229> got<00:05:01.319> the<00:05:01.409> track<00:05:01.620> sort<00:05:02.069> of<00:05:02.129> learn

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
everybody's got the track sort of learn

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.820 
everybody's got the track sort of learn
by<00:05:02.610> now<00:05:02.639> but<00:05:03.000> I<00:05:03.090> don't<00:05:03.169> it's<00:05:04.169> gonna<00:05:04.289> it's<00:05:04.740> gonna

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
by now but I don't it's gonna it's gonna

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.010 
by now but I don't it's gonna it's gonna
take<00:05:05.099> me<00:05:05.190> a<00:05:05.250> while<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.430> get<00:05:05.639> used<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:06.000> it<00:05:06.120> you

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
take me a while to get used to it you

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.670 
take me a while to get used to it you
know<00:05:07.050> particularly<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.940> Oasis<00:05:09.449> songs<00:05:09.900> which

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
know particularly the Oasis songs which

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.129 
know particularly the Oasis songs which
I'm<00:05:10.800> not<00:05:10.949> really<00:05:11.159> doing<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:11.580> many<00:05:11.849> but<00:05:12.180> those

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
I'm not really doing that many but those

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.999 
I'm not really doing that many but those
songs<00:05:13.380> are<00:05:13.590> so<00:05:13.909> embedded<00:05:14.909> in<00:05:15.830> fabric<00:05:16.830> of<00:05:16.949> what

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
songs are so embedded in fabric of what

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.249 
songs are so embedded in fabric of what
I<00:05:17.159> do<00:05:17.280> that<00:05:17.759> I've<00:05:18.419> never<00:05:18.659> done<00:05:18.780> anybody<00:05:18.990> else

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
I do that I've never done anybody else

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.710 
I do that I've never done anybody else
playing<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:20.610> that's<00:05:20.729> going<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.030> be<00:05:21.090> quite<00:05:21.330> odd

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
playing so that's going to be quite odd

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:37.070 
playing so that's going to be quite odd
so<00:05:22.710> I'm<00:05:22.770> not<00:05:22.919> sure<00:05:22.979> how<00:05:23.190> it's<00:05:23.310> going<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.490> go<00:05:23.610> on

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.289 

I<00:05:37.699> can<00:05:38.699> say<00:05:38.879> I<00:05:39.150> mean<00:05:39.389> I'm<00:05:39.539> only<00:05:39.690> 44
