across people we Zen fully kill them I
don't<00:01:00.489> think<00:01:00.640> that's<00:01:00.730> possible<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.489> series

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
don't think that's possible as a series

don't think that's possible as a series

progresses i am looking to you for
suggestions<00:01:08.560> on<00:01:08.740> what<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.010> do<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.630> first

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
suggestions on what to do it first

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.190 
suggestions on what to do it first
started<00:01:11.320> out<00:01:11.470> obviously<00:01:12.040> is<00:01:12.630> no<00:01:13.630> sprinting

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
started out obviously is no sprinting

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.109 
started out obviously is no sprinting
simple<00:01:14.619> as<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:14.740> know<00:01:15.100> sprinting<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.910> was

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
simple as that know sprinting that was

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.969 
simple as that know sprinting that was
the<00:01:16.270> idea<00:01:16.390> just<00:01:16.630> run<00:01:17.110> around<00:01:17.229> but<00:01:17.590> i<00:01:17.710> think

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
the idea just run around but i think

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.219 
the idea just run around but i think
it's<00:01:18.100> slowly<00:01:18.550> changing<00:01:18.729> us<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.690> of<00:01:19.899> course<00:01:20.110> i

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
it's slowly changing us and of course i

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.420 
it's slowly changing us and of course i
was<00:01:20.320> just<00:01:20.530> doing<00:01:20.710> free<00:01:20.890> for<00:01:21.070> all<00:01:21.130> because

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
was just doing free for all because

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.190 
was just doing free for all because
that's<00:01:21.610> normally<00:01:22.479> what<00:01:22.630> i<00:01:22.690> play<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.140> that's

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
that's normally what i play and that's

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.469 
that's normally what i play and that's
normally<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.680> most<00:01:23.950> chaotic<00:01:24.190> one<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:24.970> playing

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
normally the most chaotic one so playing

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.170 
normally the most chaotic one so playing
zen<00:01:25.840> master<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.670> seems<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.790> little<00:01:27.820> bit

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
zen master and that seems a little bit

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.270 
zen master and that seems a little bit
more<00:01:28.330> drastic<00:01:28.960> than<00:01:28.990> playing<00:01:29.470> zen<00:01:29.800> in<00:01:29.979> search

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
more drastic than playing zen in search

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.010 
more drastic than playing zen in search
and<00:01:30.399> destroy<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.940> only<00:01:31.090> reason<00:01:31.420> why<00:01:31.540> i<00:01:31.570> didn't

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
and destroy the only reason why i didn't

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.440 
and destroy the only reason why i didn't
at<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.009> same<00:01:33.190> time<00:01:33.399> i<00:01:33.460> will<00:01:33.670> do<00:01:34.000> this<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.420> have

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
at the same time i will do this you have

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.020 
at the same time i will do this you have
to<00:01:34.690> be<00:01:35.020> cautious<00:01:35.920> when<00:01:36.250> you're<00:01:36.399> playing<00:01:36.670> zen

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
it is it necessary because it seems a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.420 
it is it necessary because it seems a
bit<00:02:50.019> more<00:02:50.200> Zen<00:02:50.500> when<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.829> quiet<00:02:51.040> but<00:02:51.400> i

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
bit more Zen when it's quiet but i

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.190 
bit more Zen when it's quiet but i
changed<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.970> back<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.150> like<00:02:52.480> red<00:02:52.780> dot<00:02:53.019> or

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
changed it back to like red dot or

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.440 
changed it back to like red dot or

on my ACR or whatever weapon I happen to
be<00:02:58.390> using<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.040> would<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.370> be<00:03:00.489> more<00:03:00.640> Zen<00:03:00.940> so

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
be using but it would it be more Zen so

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.699 
be using but it would it be more Zen so
non-lethal<00:03:02.140> killstreaks<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.629> when<00:03:04.709> silenced

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
non-lethal killstreaks and when silenced

weapons I find and I put a silencer on
my<00:03:07.930> USP<00:03:08.230> just<00:03:08.830> because<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.190> seems<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.120> bit

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
my USP just because it seems in a bit

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.390 
my USP just because it seems in a bit
quieter<00:03:10.959> something<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.680> little<00:03:11.830> more<00:03:11.950> reserved

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
quieter something a little more reserved

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.520 
quieter something a little more reserved
we<00:03:12.550> don't<00:03:12.700> need<00:03:12.849> to<00:03:12.940> make<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.120> lot<00:03:13.360> of<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.690> lot<00:03:14.410> of

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
we don't need to make a lot of a lot of

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.949 
we don't need to make a lot of a lot of
noise<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:15.160> know<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.310> mean<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:16.450> just<00:03:16.510> be<00:03:16.780> nice

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
noise you know I mean you just be nice

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.520 
noise you know I mean you just be nice
and<00:03:17.019> calm<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.880> is<00:03:19.090> there's<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.569> point<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.410> this

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and calm this is there's a point in this

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.259 
and calm this is there's a point in this
one<00:03:20.709> here<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.069> one's<00:03:21.310> fine<00:03:21.580> but<00:03:22.150> you'll

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
one here and this one's fine but you'll

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.930 
one here and this one's fine but you'll
see<00:03:22.599> you'll<00:03:23.470> see<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.709> get<00:03:23.950> incredibly<00:03:24.489> lucky

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
see you'll see I get incredibly lucky

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.850 
see you'll see I get incredibly lucky
and<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:25.690> why<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:25.840> never<00:03:25.989> go<00:03:26.410> chasing

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
and this is why I never go chasing

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.130 
and this is why I never go chasing
people<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.519> this<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.120> relatively<00:03:29.019> short

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
people so this is a relatively short

though to make sure that the the third
kill<00:04:06.670> streak<00:04:06.940> is<00:04:07.090> non-lethal<00:04:07.989> as<00:04:08.290> well<00:04:08.500> but

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
kill streak is non-lethal as well but

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.470 
kill streak is non-lethal as well but
