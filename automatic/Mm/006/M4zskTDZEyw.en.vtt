00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.870
 iris cards video point come name of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.809
 Masters comes to keep our theme 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.000
 our topic is not just behind me 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.620
 there stand and the beautiful bloom and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.980
 which is really a competition of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.150
 Boulez could be as beautiful as it is 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.080
 places we have a little here 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.359
 worry about testing 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.000
 the real topic today is ours 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.890
 table grapes and table grapes in 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.740
 the parson stickel education thus the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.750
 How to get on a square meter 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.610
 we can have a blackboard grape 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.989
 in her small variety test here 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.180
 you see a whole series of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.920
 table grapes now in the second and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.379
 third year so what has the first one 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.270
 yield and I stand here by the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.160
 variety 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.870
 that is a grape of Ticino to the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.079
 American just with this special 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.149
 taste politically correct stone im 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.160
 dialect says mattress is wrong 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.870
 a bit pejorative but many people 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.840
 have them like I do it because 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.579
 really is a special aroma though 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.730
 Of course it also needs sugar 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 so that the whole flavor package arrives well 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.090
 it is still too early for that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.830
 the fruits are not quite ripe yet 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.960
 We will be there in the middle of August 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.689
 in the middle of september empires will be there 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 you can already see the big chamber 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.009
 Also at this rose local level 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.619
 beautiful this great 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.740
 Grapes would be gigantic 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.259
 here the speculation works too 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.580
 when growing strongly said desinger wear 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.540
 because they say otherwise are should 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.400
 are suitable for as a trellis 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.170
 to be grown or as a parole 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.420
 to be grown one sees here the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.759
 stem and here in this zone from the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.860
 stem the shoots that arise up here 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.590
 have been fixed on the partially 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.090
 even to the poor temporarily for one 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.560
 Make a wall does not matter 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.899
 but you see that after so strong 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.689
 should grow easily on an individual basis 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.820
 can cultivate on a square meter 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.700
 and then such huge grapes and 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.990
 such giant fruits burley campell 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.460
 can reap 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.490
 we have them more try it 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490
 out
