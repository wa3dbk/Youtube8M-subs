00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.330
 how I survived masters 900 and here I bring you the second part of the 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.330
 history of the pharaohs very well we continue 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.359
 of that time they copied the designs of other consoles but with the games of 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.349
 london yassine original leaves 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.109
 the image is an advertisement where they promoted these singular 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.579
 relatives 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:26.069
 in the picture it shows other consoles such as the genesis the nintendo 64 the super 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:29.639
 and others to make the children's illusion that it was a 

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:33.440
 original console but then they took the reception of their lives to see that no 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.450
 was 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.640
 now I will tell you about a very familiar family 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.660
 another panel clones is polista time that invites to the first videoconsola of 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.440
 sony 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.970
 thanks to occupy the funny that is the name this console baptizes as bottom 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.010
 tiger be all the clones of the harness that copy the appearance of the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.500
 Play Station 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.420
 the components of these systems are very poor quality and the most curious 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.090
 these models is that the cartridge with the games is inserted vertically into their 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.209
 nonexistent 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:02.010
 Lords of venues 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.730
 after opening the lid 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.030
 the necklace and has sold more than 70 million euros 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 which also makes it 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.719
 It is a portable system many companies 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:13.750
 they camouflaged 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.750
 I hear singles from the first little machines in a similar system 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.490
 others like the face after 2000 were compatible with the cartridges that the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.530
 judge 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.270
 the guide includes the bank and neither was left behind so much people urinate 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.869
 admiral of the mystery company like the kettle since yesterday are songs 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.240
 while the guide indicates is a typical replica with games of 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.140
 little machines the crisis 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.790
 As you can see it has a very inspired design on the shoulder 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.960
 interestingly the next version of this console called green who second 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.860
 It is also very 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.860
 just like in the case of other laptops 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.870
 its design is imitated 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.110
 one more screen 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.030
 although this is not 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 It will be one of the typical batallitas exchange 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.450
 now we move on to things 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.230
 the last 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.410
 the House 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.169
 hi of video games released in 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.169

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.909
 the current Jesuit 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.119
 this is around 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:20.609
 for 170 US dollars 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.609
 119 euros an 83 pounds 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.129
 there is a cartridge called big 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.230
 the protest has tries to imitate the psp both in the box and in the design 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:38.219
 if you're interested in buying this Asian technological wonder why 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.469
 acquire it in the Chinese at a price of approximately 5 euros and thus be able to 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.469
 enjoy the game lowered soccer that includes 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.279
 that's all but before another story of a fanatic 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:53.479
 once upon a time a child who asked his parents for a nintendo wii for Christmas 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.479

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.519
 with the console and the child was excited today opened 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.559
 in it he began to cry and the fatal 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.729
 he said is that I am 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.189

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.359
