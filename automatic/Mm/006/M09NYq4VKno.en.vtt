00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
be a nuisance right now I will say the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310 
be a nuisance right now I will say the
models<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.759> pretty<00:02:06.299> sold<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.049> storm

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
models are pretty sold that this storm

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.630 
models are pretty sold that this storm
is<00:02:07.409> going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> nuisance<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.250> coming<00:02:08.520> out

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
is going to be a nuisance is coming out

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.550 
is going to be a nuisance is coming out
of<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.940> Gulf<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.929> Mexico<00:02:10.349> area

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
of the Gulf of Mexico area

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.990 
of the Gulf of Mexico area
there's<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:11.980> couple<00:02:12.130> different<00:02:12.340> issues<00:02:12.790> with

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
there's a couple different issues with

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.940 
there's a couple different issues with
this<00:02:13.180> system<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.630> why<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.900> can<00:02:14.230> still<00:02:14.530> go<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.770> a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
this system and why it can still go to a

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.640 
this system and why it can still go to a
bigger<00:02:15.220> storm<00:02:15.640> solution<00:02:16.510> here<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:17.349> go<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.530> a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
bigger storm solution here we go to a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.110 
bigger storm solution here we go to a
broader<00:02:17.950> view<00:02:18.069> here<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.819> give<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
broader view here and just give you a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.309 
broader view here and just give you a
you<00:02:19.450> know<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.660> broader<00:02:19.900> broader<00:02:20.080> picture

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
you know the broader broader picture

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.839 
you know the broader broader picture
just<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.800> eastern<00:02:21.099> half<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.459> United<00:02:21.730> States

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
just the eastern half the United States

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.670 
just the eastern half the United States
actually<00:02:22.239> actually<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.200> little<00:02:23.319> more<00:02:23.440> than

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
actually actually a little more than

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.470 
actually actually a little more than
eastern<00:02:23.920> half<00:02:24.099> here<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:24.520> this<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.849> worse<00:02:25.239> it

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
eastern half here but this is worse it

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.449 
eastern half here but this is worse it
up<00:02:25.599> here<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.620> our<00:02:26.709> storm<00:02:27.040> system

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
up here and this is our storm system

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.470 
up here and this is our storm system
here<00:02:27.640> that's<00:02:27.790> going<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.970> come<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.209> from

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
here that's going to come in from

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.809 
here that's going to come in from
basically<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.349> Western<00:02:29.980> Gulf<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.400> Mexico

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
basically the Western Gulf of Mexico

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.960 
basically the Western Gulf of Mexico
region<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> very<00:02:31.720> southern<00:02:32.530> jet<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.220> really

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
region is a very southern jet is really

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.140 
region is a very southern jet is really
screaming<00:02:34.480> at<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.690> point<00:02:35.670> coming<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.880> like

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
screaming at this point coming up like

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.030 
screaming at this point coming up like
this<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.690> your<00:02:37.840> southern<00:02:38.200> jet<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:38.890> know

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
this is your southern jet they know

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.199 
this is your southern jet they know
where<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.190> stream<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.519> trying<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> dig<00:02:40.030> in

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
where the stream is trying to dig in

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.540 
where the stream is trying to dig in
here<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:41.200> still<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.470> split<00:02:41.920> flow<00:02:42.160> pattern

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
here but it's still a split flow pattern

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.430 
here but it's still a split flow pattern
when<00:02:42.670> we<00:02:42.730> talk<00:02:42.880> about<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:43.090> split<00:02:43.420> flow<00:02:43.720> we're

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
when we talk about a split flow we're

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.690 
when we talk about a split flow we're
talking<00:02:44.799> about<00:02:44.920> two<00:02:45.190> different<00:02:45.370> Jess

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
talking about two different Jess

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.309 
talking about two different Jess
northern<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.269> southern<00:02:46.420> stream<00:02:46.810> remaining

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
northern and southern stream remaining

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.350 
northern and southern stream remaining
separate<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:47.980> when<00:02:48.549> you<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.790> split<00:02:49.180> flow

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
separate and when you have a split flow

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.880 
separate and when you have a split flow
pattern<00:02:49.780> sometimes<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> models<00:02:50.709> have

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
pattern sometimes the models have

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.970 
pattern sometimes the models have
difficulty<00:02:51.610> with<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:51.819> that<00:02:52.209> is<00:02:52.330> not<00:02:52.480> a

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
difficulty with that that is not a

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.470 
difficulty with that that is not a
that's<00:02:53.980> not<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.250> surprise<00:02:54.459> here<00:02:55.000> showing<00:02:55.299> a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
that's not a surprise here showing a

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.390 
that's not a surprise here showing a
different<00:02:55.720> vantage<00:02:55.989> point<00:02:56.410> here<00:02:56.620> here's<00:02:57.220> our

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
different vantage point here here's our

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.100 
different vantage point here here's our
southern<00:02:57.760> jet<00:02:58.030> when<00:02:58.239> here's<00:02:58.450> here's<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.750> system

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
southern jet when here's here's a system

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
southern jet when here's here's a system
down<00:02:59.230> here<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.560> was<00:02:59.650> just<00:02:59.799> showing<00:03:00.099> you

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
down here that was just showing you

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.120 
down here that was just showing you
southern<00:03:00.940> jet<00:03:01.120> still<00:03:01.390> up<00:03:01.510> here<00:03:01.660> like<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.130> you

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
southern jet still up here like this you

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.530 
southern jet still up here like this you
know<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.549> have<00:03:03.760> your<00:03:03.910> northern<00:03:04.150> stream

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
know and you have your northern stream

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.850 
know and you have your northern stream
coming<00:03:04.750> here<00:03:04.989> like<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.319> so<00:03:05.470> you're<00:03:05.620> still<00:03:05.830> at

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
coming here like this so you're still at

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.400 
coming here like this so you're still at
a<00:03:05.950> split<00:03:06.370> flow<00:03:06.670> you're<00:03:06.970> not<00:03:07.150> two<00:03:08.049> separate

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
a split flow you're not two separate

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.960 
a split flow you're not two separate
jets<00:03:08.680> are<00:03:08.799> not<00:03:08.920> interacting<00:03:09.220> with<00:03:09.670> one<00:03:09.700> other

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
jets are not interacting with one other

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.550 
jets are not interacting with one other
what<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.330> need<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.720> have<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> big<00:03:11.170> storm<00:03:11.500> here

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
what you need to have a big storm here

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.800 
what you need to have a big storm here
is<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.920> northern<00:03:12.370> jet<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.880> going<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.630> have<00:03:13.720> to

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
is the northern jet is going to have to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.810 
is the northern jet is going to have to
dive<00:03:14.019> down<00:03:14.290> into<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.799> southern<00:03:15.040> jet<00:03:15.400> here<00:03:15.670> and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
dive down into the southern jet here and

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.000 
dive down into the southern jet here and
interact<00:03:16.359> with<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:17.290> really<00:03:17.530> wrap<00:03:17.739> up<00:03:17.890> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
interact with it to really wrap up the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.380 
interact with it to really wrap up the
storm<00:03:18.250> bringing<00:03:18.519> up<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.730> coast<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> big

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
storm bringing up the coast is a big

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.420 
storm bringing up the coast is a big
storm<00:03:19.720> here<00:03:19.780> like<00:03:20.709> we're<00:03:20.890> showing<00:03:21.100> on<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
storm here like we're showing on the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.560 
storm here like we're showing on the
models<00:03:21.730> earlier<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.150> week<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.480> we're

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
models earlier in the week and we're

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.080 
models earlier in the week and we're
really<00:03:22.780> not<00:03:22.930> having<00:03:23.320> that<00:03:23.350> right<00:03:23.680> now<00:03:23.859> a<00:03:24.090> large

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
really not having that right now a large

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.630 
really not having that right now a large
part<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.780> ridging<00:03:26.140> out<00:03:26.260> west<00:03:26.560> not<00:03:27.280> being

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
part to the ridging out west not being

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.729 
part to the ridging out west not being
as<00:03:27.880> prominent<00:03:28.510> we<00:03:28.600> talked<00:03:28.810> about<00:03:28.959> we<00:03:29.709> just

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
as prominent we talked about we just

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.530 
as prominent we talked about we just
talk<00:03:29.950> about<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.190> jet<00:03:30.400> streams<00:03:30.670> here<00:03:30.970> you're

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
talk about the jet streams here you're

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.800 
talk about the jet streams here you're
talking<00:03:31.840> about<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:32.910> 250ml<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:33.940> our<00:03:34.209> Jedi<00:03:34.480> listen

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
talking about a 250ml of our Jedi listen

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.690 
talking about a 250ml of our Jedi listen
way<00:03:34.959> up<00:03:35.140> here<00:03:35.319> way<00:03:35.980> up<00:03:36.100> in<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.280> atmosphere<00:03:36.430> a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
way up here way up in the atmosphere a

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.410 
way up here way up in the atmosphere a
250ml<00:03:37.359> bar<00:03:37.540> jet<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.900> 175<00:03:38.890> knots<00:03:39.310> running<00:03:40.239> into

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
250ml bar jet of 175 knots running into

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.150 
250ml bar jet of 175 knots running into
that<00:03:40.540> Ridge<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.049> western<00:03:41.380> United<00:03:42.100> States

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
that Ridge in the western United States

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.479 
that Ridge in the western United States
so<00:03:42.639> if<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:44.049> correct<00:03:44.290> as<00:03:44.769> modeled

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
so if that is correct as modeled

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.400 
so if that is correct as modeled
obviously<00:03:46.180> there<00:03:46.329> wouldn't<00:03:46.540> be<00:03:46.600> enough<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.319> a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
obviously there wouldn't be enough of a

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.620 
obviously there wouldn't be enough of a
ridge<00:03:47.650> out<00:03:47.829> west<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.489> give<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.450> big

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
ridge out west to give you that big

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.150 
ridge out west to give you that big
amplification<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.440> would<00:03:50.530> be<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.709> what<00:03:51.010> in

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
amplification it would be the what in

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.370 
amplification it would be the what in
the<00:03:51.190> East<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.639> need<00:03:51.880> something<00:03:52.299> like<00:03:52.420> this<00:03:52.690> or

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
the East you need something like this or

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.229 
the East you need something like this or
the<00:03:53.500> big<00:03:53.769> deep<00:03:54.130> trough<00:03:54.430> in<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.790> East<00:03:54.970> here

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
the big deep trough in the East here

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.910 
the big deep trough in the East here
like<00:03:55.389> this<00:03:55.630> anyway<00:03:56.319> we're<00:03:56.470> going<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.680> get<00:03:56.799> that

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
like this anyway we're going to get that

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.890 
like this anyway we're going to get that
rich<00:03:57.190> out<00:03:57.400> there's<00:03:57.609> if<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.000> jet<00:03:58.359> slows<00:03:58.660> down

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
rich out there's if that jet slows down

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.690 
rich out there's if that jet slows down
a<00:03:58.959> little<00:03:59.049> bit<00:03:59.380> so<00:04:00.310> that's<00:04:00.459> what<00:04:00.639> the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
a little bit so that's what the

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.280 
a little bit so that's what the
excellent<00:04:01.000> forecast<00:04:01.329> challenges<00:04:02.170> we're

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
excellent forecast challenges we're

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.319 
excellent forecast challenges we're
having<00:04:02.590> right<00:04:02.739> now<00:04:02.950> with<00:04:03.670> how<00:04:03.850> they<00:04:04.030> handle

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
having right now with how they handle

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.470 
having right now with how they handle
the<00:04:04.450> system<00:04:04.870> here<00:04:05.170> on<00:04:05.609> over<00:04:06.609> the<00:04:06.850> weekend<00:04:07.239> here

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
the system here on over the weekend here

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.720 
the system here on over the weekend here
if<00:04:07.630> this<00:04:08.170> did<00:04:08.440> hit<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.739> storm<00:04:09.190> does<00:04:09.400> hit<00:04:09.609> I'll

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
if this did hit the storm does hit I'll

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.039 
if this did hit the storm does hit I'll
put<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.180> motion<00:04:10.299> too<00:04:10.630> so<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:10.870> can<00:04:10.900> see

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
put this in motion too so you can see

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.170 
put this in motion too so you can see
the<00:04:11.139> broad<00:04:11.350> picture<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:12.430> storm<00:04:12.670> did<00:04:12.880> hit<00:04:13.150> it

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
the broad picture the storm did hit it

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.599 
the broad picture the storm did hit it
does<00:04:13.630> look<00:04:13.900> right<00:04:14.139> now<00:04:14.380> as<00:04:14.620> biz<00:04:14.859> model<00:04:15.190> that<00:04:15.519> it

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
does look right now as biz model that it

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.370 
does look right now as biz model that it
would<00:04:15.730> stay<00:04:15.850> weak<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.690> branches<00:04:16.959> of<00:04:17.289> the

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
would stay weak and the branches of the

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.930 
would stay weak and the branches of the
jet<00:04:17.530> streams<00:04:17.859> would<00:04:18.039> say<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.609> northern

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
jet streams would say the northern

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.159 
jet streams would say the northern
southern<00:04:19.209> branch<00:04:19.389> will<00:04:19.570> stay<00:04:19.720> separate

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
southern branch will stay separate

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.350 
southern branch will stay separate
rendering<00:04:21.099> this<00:04:21.220> system<00:04:21.609> week<00:04:21.849> unless<00:04:22.090> the

rendering this system week unless the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.280 
rendering this system week unless the
amplification<00:04:22.659> in<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.169> east<00:04:23.349> as<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.590> result

amplification in the east as a result

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.140 
amplification in the east as a result
and<00:04:24.380> then<00:04:24.920> this<00:04:25.280> would<00:04:25.460> just<00:04:25.550> slide<00:04:25.910> out<00:04:26.120> of

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
and then this would just slide out of

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.280 
and then this would just slide out of
here<00:04:26.360> but<00:04:26.480> you<00:04:26.540> do<00:04:26.660> have<00:04:26.780> some<00:04:27.020> precipitation

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
here but you do have some precipitation

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.890 
here but you do have some precipitation
here<00:04:27.920> coming<00:04:28.730> into<00:04:28.910> our<00:04:29.030> area<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.600> this<00:04:29.720> would

here coming into our area and this would

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.120 
here coming into our area and this would
be<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.170> form<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.440> snow<00:04:30.500> when<00:04:30.860> will<00:04:30.980> this<00:04:31.070> a

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
be in the form of snow when will this a

be in the form of snow when will this a
little<00:04:31.280> bit<00:04:31.460> closer<00:04:31.730> here<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.630> models<00:04:32.960> are

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
little bit closer here the models are

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.050 
little bit closer here the models are
not<00:04:33.290> disagreeing<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.430> ones<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.730> are<00:04:34.850> having

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
not disagreeing the ones that are having

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.130 
not disagreeing the ones that are having
this<00:04:35.240> keeping<00:04:35.570> this<00:04:35.690> week<00:04:35.900> or<00:04:36.050> not

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
this keeping this week or not

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.600 
this keeping this week or not
disagreeing<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:36.740> is<00:04:36.950> going<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.190> bring<00:04:37.400> some

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
disagreeing that is going to bring some

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.970 
disagreeing that is going to bring some
snow<00:04:37.880> here<00:04:38.180> but<00:04:38.870> just<00:04:39.050> very<00:04:39.260> light<00:04:39.470> amount<00:04:39.800> so

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
snow here but just very light amount so

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.140 
snow here but just very light amount so
you<00:04:40.040> can<00:04:40.160> see<00:04:40.310> some<00:04:40.490> very<00:04:40.640> these<00:04:40.910> light<00:04:41.120> rays

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
you can see some very these light rays

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.000 
you can see some very these light rays
here<00:04:41.660> these<00:04:41.780> are<00:04:41.840> very<00:04:42.110> light<00:04:42.410> amounts<00:04:42.830> that

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
here these are very light amounts that

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.520 
here these are very light amounts that
you<00:04:43.220> know<00:04:43.310> generally<00:04:43.960> under<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.380> know<00:04:45.410> under

here which is our main system off the
Carolina<00:04:51.350> coast<00:04:51.500> here<00:04:51.980> instead<00:04:52.700> of<00:04:52.730> taking<00:04:53.330> a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
Carolina coast here instead of taking a

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.780 
Carolina coast here instead of taking a
turn<00:04:53.900> of<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.170> coast<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:54.560> bombing<00:04:55.010> out<00:04:55.190> and

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
turn of the coast and bombing out and

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.880 
turn of the coast and bombing out and
getting<00:04:56.060> very<00:04:56.240> strong<00:04:56.660> since<00:04:57.470> those<00:04:57.650> jet

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
getting very strong since those jet

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.880 
getting very strong since those jet
streams<00:04:58.190> are<00:04:58.310> not<00:04:58.490> phased<00:04:58.820> together<00:04:59.650> we<00:05:00.650> just

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
streams are not phased together we just

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.240 
streams are not phased together we just
slide<00:05:01.430> out<00:05:01.730> this<00:05:02.390> way<00:05:02.660> but<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.860> will<00:05:04.040> have

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
slide out this way but it will have

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.680 
slide out this way but it will have
enough<00:05:04.580> on<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:04.790> northern<00:05:05.060> fringe<00:05:05.330> we<00:05:05.480> think

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
enough on the northern fringe we think

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.170 
enough on the northern fringe we think
it<00:05:05.810> will<00:05:05.840> give<00:05:06.110> some<00:05:06.320> snow<00:05:06.620> but<00:05:07.430> just<00:05:07.940> minor

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
it will give some snow but just minor

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.670 
it will give some snow but just minor
amounts<00:05:08.660> I<00:05:08.750> mean<00:05:08.900> these<00:05:08.990> we're<00:05:09.320> talking<00:05:09.590> about

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
amounts I mean these we're talking about

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.010 
amounts I mean these we're talking about
less<00:05:09.890> than<00:05:09.920> two<00:05:10.190> inches<00:05:10.370> total<00:05:10.670> here<00:05:11.060> of<00:05:11.210> snow

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
less than two inches total here of snow

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.420 
less than two inches total here of snow
and<00:05:12.260> then<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:12.470> lifts<00:05:12.710> off<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.010> Northeast

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
and then it lifts off to the Northeast

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.100 
and then it lifts off to the Northeast
here<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:13.940> it's<00:05:14.210> pretty<00:05:14.450> much<00:05:14.570> out<00:05:14.840> of<00:05:14.870> here

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
here and it's pretty much out of here

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.480 
here and it's pretty much out of here
here's<00:05:15.320> your<00:05:15.440> storm<00:05:15.680> system<00:05:16.010> see<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.250> later

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
here's your storm system see you later

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.400 
here's your storm system see you later
it's<00:05:16.970> only<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.180> thousand<00:05:17.540> twelve<00:05:17.720> millibars

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
it's only a thousand twelve millibars

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.260 
it's only a thousand twelve millibars
and<00:05:18.650> moves<00:05:18.770> off<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.010> coast<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.940> other<00:05:20.120> day

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
and moves off the coast the other day

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.490 
and moves off the coast the other day
when<00:05:20.450> I<00:05:20.480> was<00:05:20.600> showing<00:05:20.750> this<00:05:20.930> big<00:05:21.140> storm<00:05:21.380> we're

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
when I was showing this big storm we're

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.260 
when I was showing this big storm we're
talking<00:05:21.770> about<00:05:22.150> 998<00:05:23.150> 996<00:05:23.960> 990<00:05:25.090> sitting<00:05:26.090> right

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
talking about 998 996 990 sitting right

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.550 
talking about 998 996 990 sitting right
out<00:05:26.390> here<00:05:26.420> I<00:05:26.840> mean<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.050> have<00:05:27.200> something<00:05:27.470> on

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
out here I mean you have something on

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.050 
out here I mean you have something on
that<00:05:27.680> you<00:05:27.860> have<00:05:27.980> some<00:05:28.130> tremendous<00:05:28.640> snowfall

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
that you have some tremendous snowfall

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.400 
that you have some tremendous snowfall
back<00:05:29.240> in<00:05:29.450> here<00:05:29.600> but<00:05:29.780> that's<00:05:29.990> really<00:05:30.260> not

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
back in here but that's really not

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.830 
back in here but that's really not
showing<00:05:30.830> that<00:05:30.860> right<00:05:31.160> now<00:05:31.340> it<00:05:31.910> is<00:05:32.060> way<00:05:32.450> east

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
showing that right now it is way east

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.560 
showing that right now it is way east
and<00:05:33.170> way<00:05:33.440> week<00:05:33.910> again<00:05:34.910> because<00:05:35.180> of<00:05:35.270> those<00:05:35.360> jet

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
and way week again because of those jet

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.450 
and way week again because of those jet
streams<00:05:35.870> not<00:05:35.990> coming<00:05:36.260> together<00:05:36.380> so<00:05:36.770> these<00:05:37.310> are

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
streams not coming together so these are

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.350 
streams not coming together so these are
some<00:05:37.490> of<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.670> things<00:05:37.730> we're<00:05:37.940> going<00:05:38.030> to<00:05:38.120> sort

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
some of the things we're going to sort

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.990 
some of the things we're going to sort
out<00:05:38.510> over<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:38.750> next<00:05:38.810> couple<00:05:39.110> days<00:05:39.380> here<00:05:39.620> and

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
out over the next couple days here and

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.600 
out over the next couple days here and
until<00:05:41.000> we<00:05:41.120> get<00:05:41.240> better<00:05:41.360> data<00:05:41.660> sampling<00:05:42.170> and

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
until we get better data sampling and

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.110 
until we get better data sampling and
the<00:05:43.610> energy<00:05:43.790> is<00:05:44.300> in<00:05:44.720> an<00:05:44.810> area<00:05:45.050> where

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
the energy is in an area where

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.250 
the energy is in an area where
observations<00:05:47.120> can<00:05:47.270> be<00:05:47.330> taken<00:05:47.780> from<00:05:48.020> that

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
observations can be taken from that

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.250 
observations can be taken from that
energy<00:05:48.680> it<00:05:49.250> can<00:05:49.430> be<00:05:49.580> sampled<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.510> properly

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
energy it can be sampled and properly

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.290 
energy it can be sampled and properly
integrated<00:05:51.740> in<00:05:51.920> the<00:05:51.950> models<00:05:52.340> which<00:05:53.000> are<00:05:53.120> not

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
integrated in the models which are not

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.660 
integrated in the models which are not
having<00:05:53.540> right<00:05:53.840> now<00:05:53.990> you<00:05:54.950> know<00:05:55.070> we<00:05:55.220> might<00:05:55.550> get

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
having right now you know we might get

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.820 
having right now you know we might get
some<00:05:55.850> better<00:05:56.060> better<00:05:56.900> information<00:05:57.140> once<00:05:57.650> that

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
some better better information once that

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.230 
some better better information once that
happens<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:58.400> that's<00:05:58.490> not<00:05:58.760> expected<00:05:59.060> to

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
happens and that's not expected to

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.810 
happens and that's not expected to
happen<00:05:59.360> until<00:05:59.570> later<00:05:59.930> today<00:06:00.550> tonight<00:06:01.550> and

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
happen until later today tonight and

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.150 
happen until later today tonight and
early<00:06:02.540> tomorrow<00:06:02.930> morning<00:06:03.560> so<00:06:03.710> once<00:06:03.920> we<00:06:04.040> get

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
early tomorrow morning so once we get

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.950 
early tomorrow morning so once we get
that<00:06:04.310> data<00:06:04.580> integrated<00:06:05.360> in<00:06:05.450> the<00:06:05.480> models<00:06:05.810> you

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960
