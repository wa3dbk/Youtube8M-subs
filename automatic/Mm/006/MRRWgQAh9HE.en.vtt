computer same speed there's the USB 2.0
so<00:05:40.240> when<00:05:40.540> you<00:05:40.600> take<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:40.840> somewhere<00:05:40.930> else<00:05:41.110> and

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
so when you take it somewhere else and

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.540 
so when you take it somewhere else and
they<00:05:41.380> don't<00:05:41.530> have<00:05:41.650> eSATA<00:05:41.920> you're<00:05:42.310> good<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.520> go

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
they don't have eSATA you're good to go

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.840 
they don't have eSATA you're good to go
there

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
there

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.640 
there
and<00:05:43.180> there's<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.570> power<00:05:43.720> cord<00:05:44.110> now<00:05:44.380> like<00:05:44.560> I

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
and there's the power cord now like I

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.380 
and there's the power cord now like I
said<00:05:44.710> this<00:05:44.980> also<00:05:45.190> comes<00:05:45.550> with<00:05:45.640> this<00:05:45.910> adapter

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
said this also comes with this adapter

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.850 
said this also comes with this adapter
as<00:05:46.600> you<00:05:46.840> can<00:05:46.960> see<00:05:47.110> this<00:05:47.230> will<00:05:47.380> fit<00:05:47.560> right<00:05:47.590> in

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
as you can see this will fit right in

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.080 
as you can see this will fit right in
you<00:05:48.040> just<00:05:48.190> unscrew<00:05:48.340> this<00:05:48.640> one<00:05:48.790> on<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:48.940> bottom

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
you just unscrew this one on the bottom

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.390 
you just unscrew this one on the bottom
right<00:05:49.330> there<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.770> then<00:05:50.770> this<00:05:50.890> one<00:05:51.070> goes<00:05:51.190> right

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
right there and then this one goes right

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.430 
right there and then this one goes right
inside<00:05:51.760> there<00:05:51.970> so<00:05:52.510> that<00:05:52.720> you<00:05:52.840> know<00:05:52.930> you<00:05:52.990> it'll

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
inside there so that you know you it'll

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.760 
inside there so that you know you it'll
transfer<00:05:53.830> it<00:05:53.950> into<00:05:54.150> firewire<00:05:55.150> 400<00:05:55.540> now<00:05:56.260> this

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
transfer it into firewire 400 now this

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.070 
transfer it into firewire 400 now this
is<00:05:56.950> good<00:05:57.130> you<00:05:57.280> have<00:05:57.400> two<00:05:57.700> firewire<00:05:58.390> 400<00:05:58.660> ports

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
is good you have two firewire 400 ports

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.780 
is good you have two firewire 400 ports
because<00:05:59.200> firewire<00:05:59.740> is<00:05:59.950> daisy<00:06:00.280> chain<00:06:00.580> able

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
because firewire is daisy chain able

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.520 
because firewire is daisy chain able
meaning<00:06:01.000> you<00:06:01.090> can<00:06:01.210> hook<00:06:01.330> up<00:06:01.450> multiple<00:06:02.290> drives

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
meaning you can hook up multiple drives

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.260 
meaning you can hook up multiple drives
so<00:06:02.740> if<00:06:02.800> you<00:06:02.920> want<00:06:03.100> to<00:06:03.220> create<00:06:03.520> an<00:06:03.670> entire<00:06:03.910> array

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
so if you want to create an entire array

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.030 
so if you want to create an entire array
of<00:06:04.420> devices<00:06:04.570> and<00:06:05.050> hook<00:06:05.470> up<00:06:05.590> several<00:06:05.830> other

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
of devices and hook up several other

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.190 
of devices and hook up several other
devices<00:06:06.370> and<00:06:06.730> and<00:06:06.820> even<00:06:07.540> if<00:06:07.630> it's<00:06:07.750> not<00:06:07.900> the

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
devices and and even if it's not the

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.450 
devices and and even if it's not the
exact<00:06:08.470> same<00:06:08.500> drive<00:06:08.950> you've<00:06:09.130> got<00:06:09.250> another

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
exact same drive you've got another

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.860 
exact same drive you've got another
drive<00:06:09.700> that<00:06:09.850> has<00:06:09.940> firewire<00:06:10.360> you<00:06:10.480> can<00:06:10.600> daisy

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
drive that has firewire you can daisy

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.810 
drive that has firewire you can daisy
chain<00:06:11.020> those<00:06:11.500> so<00:06:12.040> that's<00:06:12.220> a<00:06:12.340> very<00:06:12.520> handy

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
chain those so that's a very handy

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.130 
chain those so that's a very handy
feature<00:06:12.850> as<00:06:13.150> well<00:06:13.270> so<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:13.570> can<00:06:13.720> see<00:06:13.870> it<00:06:13.990> has

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
feature as well so you can see it has
