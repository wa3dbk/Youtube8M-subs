00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.400
 outs of spiderman 3 d there are many movies 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.930
 in three of adventures then if you say here 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.570
 Well, you have the TV series online 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.730
 and what you want on air television 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.380
 many channels is the full house channel 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.870
 here as you can see this is here another 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.490
 time of c3 plus 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.900
 to choose to choose what you want 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.410
 practically series there are a lot of 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410
 series 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.650
 Cartoon 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.510
 a very useful application of the play3 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.780
 free with custom firmware 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.570
 which I recommend that you put it because 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.480
 you can also see mkv in the play thing 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.800
 that you can not normally 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.800
 it is high definition 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.270
 and it's like for example career if you have 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.970
 60 seconds of bottom at full throttle and 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.410
 vehicular transport taxi 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.410
 car movies no 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.890
 and series as series 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.850
 but there is another section 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.220
 here you have for example we eat series and 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.630
 there are so many back here there are so many 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.700
 series with the ass to the air 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.580
 which you want there are many 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.560
 jope 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.920
 lost what you want and that we go 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.560
 practically from youtube 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.170
 this youtube is crap is not worth to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.260
 nothing not down 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.569

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.250
