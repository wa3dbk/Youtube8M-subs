00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.550
 Hey guys 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.269
 My name is Aguiar. I'm here for today. 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.890
 to register my testimony 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.390
 referring to the program that in 48 hours 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.390
 I confess that at first I did not 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.430
 believed for two reasons 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.670
 The first of these would be the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.309
 time of each daily activity of only 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.230
 15 minutes and no problem at all is notice 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.010
 half an eight weeks 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.710
 would never enter this result 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.750
 as it was already tested is one of the members 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.530
 why do not we go there 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.050
 Who knows , I got it. 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.710
 that in the course of the days 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.500
 the medium carried out activities not only 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.470
 balance and showed a result 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.110
 positive as I realized that in the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.869
 Overall everything has been improving even 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.010
 conditioning my quality in the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:18.990
 memory reflected in my service in the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.740
 quite studies 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:28.770
 and all this is added up the next day 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:33.299
 in my activity also during the course 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.360
 of the program I have tried to improve 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.600
 my food I reduce 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.960
 amount of carbohydrates consumed 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.000
 and I also looked for 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.440
 to eliminate 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.830
 The bad fats are also realizing that 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.560
 indicating an additional activity thought 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.690
 result it is amplified, then not 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.210
 measured efforts to make meals 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.890
 within the established time limit 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.080
 obviously that within my 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.300
 physical limitations is for today in 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.990
