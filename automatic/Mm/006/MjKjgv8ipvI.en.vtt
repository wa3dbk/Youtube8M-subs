00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.880 

Oh

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.600 

so<00:01:39.520> just<00:01:39.760> right<00:01:39.940> before<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.390> understand

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.220 

now<00:01:45.610> I'm<00:01:46.240> gonna<00:01:46.420> try<00:01:46.660> to<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:48.390> former<00:01:49.390> half<00:01:49.570> 1/2

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
now I'm gonna try to a former half 1/2

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.720 
now I'm gonna try to a former half 1/2
turn<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:53.410> can't<00:01:53.650> really<00:01:53.800> run<00:01:54.040> an<00:01:54.250> old<00:01:54.430> pal

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
turn so you can't really run an old pal

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.120 
turn so you can't really run an old pal
I<00:01:55.090> don't<00:01:55.840> think<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.350> should<00:01:56.380> try<00:01:56.650> this<00:01:56.740> just

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
I don't think you should try this just

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:08.029 
I don't think you should try this just
yet<00:01:57.490> just<00:01:57.520> get<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.150> home<00:01:58.420> half<00:01:58.630> master<00:02:02.460> slide

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.990 

so<00:02:10.320> once<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.440> got<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.740> down<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:12.010> didn't<00:02:12.520> want

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
so once you got that down I didn't want

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.260 
so once you got that down I didn't want
to<00:02:13.090> be<00:02:13.209> able<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.450> go<00:02:13.600> for<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> double<00:02:14.200> fold

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
to be able to go for the double fold

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.430 
to be able to go for the double fold
when<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.330> first<00:02:16.600> was<00:02:16.780> learning<00:02:17.140> down<00:02:17.320> with

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
when I first was learning down with

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.210 
when I first was learning down with
fools<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.920> would<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:19.230> spin<00:02:20.230> my<00:02:20.650> whole<00:02:20.890> kind<00:02:21.070> of

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
fools I would just spin my whole kind of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.430 
fools I would just spin my whole kind of
tuck<00:02:23.250> pull<00:02:24.250> open<00:02:25.090> up<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.660> do<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> last<00:02:26.050> thing

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
tuck pull open up and do the last thing

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.020 
tuck pull open up and do the last thing
so<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.430> get<00:02:28.560> last<00:02:29.560> bin

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:42.790 

I'll<00:02:35.030> show<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.390> pellets

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
it makes me put really fast money those

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.050 
it makes me put really fast money those
but<00:02:47.980> because<00:02:48.980> they're<00:02:49.190> trying<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.490> do<00:02:49.580> go<00:02:49.730> full

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060
