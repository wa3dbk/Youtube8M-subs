hi<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.610> little<00:00:02.969> do-it-yourself

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:03.680 
hi this is a little do-it-yourself

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.390 
hi this is a little do-it-yourself
inverter<00:00:04.680> now<00:00:05.009> these<00:00:05.160> are<00:00:05.399> these<00:00:05.669> are<00:00:08.269> backup

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
inverter now these are these are backup

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.970 
inverter now these are these are backup
supplies<00:00:11.400> for<00:00:12.000> computers<00:00:12.660> where<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.530> plug<00:00:13.769> it

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
supplies for computers where you plug it

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.070 
supplies for computers where you plug it
the<00:00:14.400> plug<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.820> keep<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> computer<00:00:15.870> plug

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
the plug in keep you the computer plug

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.660 
the plug in keep you the computer plug
into<00:00:16.290> that<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:18.500> then<00:00:19.500> if<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.850> power<00:00:21.090> goes<00:00:21.480> out

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
into that and then if the power goes out

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.130 
into that and then if the power goes out
this<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:24.660> inverter<00:00:26.420> powers<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.600> your<00:00:27.780> keeps

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
this this inverter powers up your keeps

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.020 
this this inverter powers up your keeps
your<00:00:28.260> computer<00:00:28.710> powered<00:00:29.070> steady<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.000> you

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
your computer powered steady so you

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.439 
your computer powered steady so you
don't<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.600> at<00:00:30.720> least<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:31.140> time<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.759> to<00:00:32.759> shut

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
don't you at least have time to to shut

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.540 
don't you at least have time to to shut
down<00:00:33.629> your<00:00:33.809> computer<00:00:33.870> well<00:00:34.769> what<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.949> did<00:00:35.219> here

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
down your computer well what I did here

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.790 
down your computer well what I did here
is<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.730> basically<00:00:36.239> took<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.929> back<00:00:37.140> off<00:00:37.379> very

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
is I basically took the back off very

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.450 
is I basically took the back off very
simple<00:00:38.249> I<00:00:38.629> attached<00:00:39.629> some<00:00:39.899> jumper<00:00:40.260> cables<00:00:40.649> red

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
simple I attached some jumper cables red

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.500 
simple I attached some jumper cables red
to<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> red<00:00:41.999> lead<00:00:43.489> black<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.820> black<00:00:45.269> lead

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
to the red lead black to the black lead

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.229 
to the red lead black to the black lead
and<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:46.440> uh<00:00:46.920> now<00:00:47.370> I'll<00:00:47.579> hook<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.120> my

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and just uh now I'll hook this to my

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.619 
and just uh now I'll hook this to my
battery<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.929> I<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.320> an<00:00:50.359> inverter<00:00:51.359> for

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
battery so that I have an inverter for

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.470 
battery so that I have an inverter for
my<00:00:51.749> car<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.769> need<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> when<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.519> need<00:00:53.730> 110

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
my car when I need it when I need 110

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.290 
my car when I need it when I need 110
power<00:00:54.839> but<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.280> show<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
power but just to show you I have a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.790 
power but just to show you I have a
little<00:00:59.059> battery<00:01:00.059> power<00:01:00.539> pack<00:01:00.929> here<00:01:01.319> that's<00:01:01.530> 12

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
little battery power pack here that's 12

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.619 
little battery power pack here that's 12
volts<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.219> I've<00:01:02.370> I've<00:01:02.670> hooked<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> cables<00:01:03.479> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
volts and I've I've hooked the cables to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
volts and I've I've hooked the cables to
that<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:03.899> hook<00:01:04.080> jumper<00:01:04.470> cables<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.520> ends

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that now hook jumper cables to the ends

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.400 
that now hook jumper cables to the ends
of<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.390> hook<00:01:07.050> it<00:01:07.170> right<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
of this so that I can hook it right to

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.390 
of this so that I can hook it right to
my<00:01:07.530> battery<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.790> believe<00:01:09.120> I<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.390> um

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
my battery and I believe I just um

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.260 
my battery and I believe I just um
switched<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.550> over<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
switched that over like that and you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.190 
switched that over like that and you
kind<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.720> come<00:01:12.960> on

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
kind of here come on

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.530 
kind of here come on
and<00:01:13.500> there<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.550> have<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.590> 110<00:01:16.590> out<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.540> out

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and there you have it 110 out of the out

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.120 
and there you have it 110 out of the out
of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.690> output<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:19.260> it<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.530> power<00:01:19.710> something

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
of the output so it will power something

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.150 
of the output so it will power something
yeah<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> don't<00:01:22.230> know<00:01:22.350> probably<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
yeah what I don't know probably not a

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.670 
yeah what I don't know probably not a
lot<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:23.760> and<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.480> it's<00:01:24.780> saying<00:01:25.050> um<00:01:25.410> I

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
lot but and I think it's saying um I

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
lot but and I think it's saying um I
think<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.490> saying<00:01:26.670> you've<00:01:26.910> lost<00:01:27.150> power<00:01:29.840> get

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
think it's saying you've lost power get

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.170 
think it's saying you've lost power get
me<00:01:31.050> get<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:31.920> computer<00:01:32.280> saved<00:01:32.760> I<00:01:33.000> think

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
me get your computer saved I think

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
me get your computer saved I think
that's<00:01:33.330> what<00:01:33.510> it's<00:01:33.630> saying<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.080> do<00:01:34.470> speak<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that's what it's saying I do speak a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.490 
that's what it's saying I do speak a
little<00:01:35.190> bit<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.550> beep<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:37.050> it<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.170> pretty

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
little bit of beep so there it is pretty

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.310 
little bit of beep so there it is pretty
simple<00:01:37.770> thing<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.730> you<00:01:39.660> know<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.930> that's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
simple thing and you know not that's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.440 
simple thing and you know not that's
about<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:41.030> they're<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.300> have<00:01:42.330> a

about you know they're they have a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.640 
about you know they're they have a
little<00:01:42.570> weight<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.810> them<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.260> pretty<00:01:43.470> nice

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
little weight to them and pretty nice

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.610 
little weight to them and pretty nice
little<00:01:43.920> unit<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.610> I'm<00:01:45.240> mostly<00:01:45.870> using<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.410> for

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
little unit so I'm mostly using it for

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.100 
little unit so I'm mostly using it for
my<00:01:46.830> remote<00:01:47.790> control<00:01:47.850> car<00:01:48.390> stuff<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.080> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
my remote control car stuff so that I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
my remote control car stuff so that I
can<00:01:49.290> take<00:01:49.440> my<00:01:49.500> remote<00:01:50.130> control<00:01:50.160> charger<00:01:50.850> when

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
can take my remote control charger when

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.200 
can take my remote control charger when
I'm<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.660> my<00:01:51.840> car<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.410> you<00:01:52.470> know<00:01:53.210> simple
