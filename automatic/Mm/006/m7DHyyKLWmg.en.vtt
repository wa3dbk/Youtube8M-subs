00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:08.420
 after touring it's the moment of guzzi 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:10.910
 california custom a version more in the 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.160
 more extreme indeed all the disappeared 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.349
 trappings that characterized the touring 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.779
 here we have a more minimalist style 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.180
 as you can see, all are missing 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.100
 chromed parts, however, the style is more 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.050
 most sought after 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.640
 the mechanics is the same as 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.750
 therefore also the electronic equipment 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.279
 v2 engine 1400 cc the biggest ever 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.649
 produced by the mandello house of the 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.210
 top quality electronic control unit 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.210
 of traction but also engine 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.760
 besides the unpublished details of the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.010
 california custom are all in favor 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.650
 of radical style and of the position of 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.270
 more sporty is the saddle 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.880
 two-seater where the logo dominates 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.980
 of the hot-stamped and unpublished eagle is 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.180
 also the drag bar handlebar with supports 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.130
 lightened as well as the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.440
 adjustable rear shock absorbers 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.140
 extension and preloading doped of 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.970
 external savior the result is one 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.770
 sportier position than the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.780
 touring in particular higher and more 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.360
 loaded on the front 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.520
 not least the wheels now black lacquered with 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.079
 the moto guzzi red logo while the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.609
 mirrors are black 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.829
 speaking of mechanics as well instead the 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:23.469
 custom follows a toto as much as it already has 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:27.219
 seen on the big sister touring motore big 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:29.469
 1,380 cc bore with elasto supports 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.659
 kinematic to dampen the rules 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.520
 double cradle frame vibrations in 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.819
 steel with mammoth measurements e 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.229
 200 rear dinghy is not missing 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.280
 very complete electronic equipment 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.250
 cruise control abs traction control 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.200
 mg ct and triple mapping engine everything 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.310
 included in the price that also in this 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.140
 case it remains â‚¬ 17,300 to these 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.569
 it would be good to add the bag kit 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.000
 35-liter side wheels to charge it up 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.140
 indispensable and maybe even the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.140
 star of gerbi place 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.610
 Once in the saddle you notice 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.310
 immediately the differences with the turin facts 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.030
 the position is sportier and more loaded 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.370
 whether it is less or less in luxury there is less 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.980
 comfort but the location in life one 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.510
 sportier, healthier driving 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.860
 the package instead 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.870
 electronic and what we already have 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.209
 so great on touring then 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.130
 traction control that today seen that 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.500
 it was raining we could put it to the test 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.250
 works wonders after all 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.380
 from rsv4 they even tell us in motion 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.420
 guzzi also the chassis is 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.220
 incredibly sporty sportier than 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.550
 what you might think looking at 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.790
 indeed, looking at it from outside it is true 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.340
 but in the first few meters the bike is heavy 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.480
 once you have exceeded 10 kilometers per hour 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.070
 it really becomes a twig to drive 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.110
 with the california custom moto guzzi 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.390
 enters right into the category of custom 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.400
 of excellence offering among other things a 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.040
 technology package that competitors 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.730
 they certainly don't have the price for 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.320
 all 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.489
 but then even the competition 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.489
 sold at the weight of iron
