first though let's go ahead and start

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.609 
first though let's go ahead and start
with<00:01:06.580> a<00:01:06.610> 1635<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.810> reason<00:01:08.170> is<00:01:08.260> such<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.380> good

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
with a 1635 the reason is such a good

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.960 
with a 1635 the reason is such a good
time<00:01:08.799> lapse<00:01:09.010> lens<00:01:09.280> this<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:09.580> an<00:01:09.700> ultra

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
time lapse lens this is an ultra

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.719 
time lapse lens this is an ultra
wide-angle<00:01:10.240> lens<00:01:10.720> from<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:11.020> 16<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:12.130> more<00:01:12.460> than

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
wide-angle lens from a 16 to more than

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.410 
wide-angle lens from a 16 to more than
normal<00:01:12.880> 35<00:01:13.539> but<00:01:14.229> at<00:01:14.350> 16<00:01:14.799> especially<00:01:15.310> or<00:01:15.399> 20<00:01:15.789> the

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
normal 35 but at 16 especially or 20 the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.120 
normal 35 but at 16 especially or 20 the
lens<00:01:16.600> has<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:17.020> properties<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.740> really

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
lens has the properties of really

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.980 
lens has the properties of really
emphasizing<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:18.880> foreground<00:01:19.359> and<00:01:19.600> making<00:01:19.929> an

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
emphasizing the foreground and making an

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.359 
emphasizing the foreground and making an
environment<00:01:20.409> feel<00:01:20.560> very<00:01:21.039> three-dimensional

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
environment feel very three-dimensional

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.090 
environment feel very three-dimensional
so<00:01:21.880> it's<00:01:21.969> a<00:01:22.030> great<00:01:22.420> lens<00:01:22.659> for<00:01:22.780> time<00:01:23.049> lapse<00:01:23.259> when

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
so it's a great lens for time lapse when

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.319 
so it's a great lens for time lapse when
you're<00:01:24.219> going<00:01:24.460> ahead<00:01:24.579> and<00:01:24.850> framing<00:01:25.119> your

you<00:01:47.200> treat<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:47.619> frame<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.340> way<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.520> would

you treat that frame the way you would

let's say a final painting on your wall
it's<00:01:51.100> got<00:01:51.219> to<00:01:51.340> be<00:01:51.399> composed<00:01:51.929> absolutely

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
it's got to be composed absolutely

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.809 
it's got to be composed absolutely

you need pay attention to when you

that's<00:02:25.710> when<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.920> might<00:02:25.980> want<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.190> go<00:02:26.280> with

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
that's when you might want to go with

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.070 
that's when you might want to go with
the<00:02:26.490> tighter<00:02:26.730> lens<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.270> compress<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.960> little

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
the tighter lens and compress a little

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.630 
the tighter lens and compress a little
bit<00:02:28.260> more<00:02:28.440> towards<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> back<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.220> your<00:02:29.460> frame

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640

bit more towards the back of your frame
in<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.360> end<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.960> may<00:02:31.110> find<00:02:31.350> out<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.530> you're

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
in the end you may find out that you're

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
in the end you may find out that you're
not<00:02:31.710> exactly<00:02:32.160> sure<00:02:32.400> what<00:02:32.430> lens<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.150> go<00:02:33.270> with

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
not exactly sure what lens to go with

not exactly sure what lens to go with
this<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.110> really<00:02:34.440> particularly<00:02:34.920> true<00:02:35.070> in

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
this is really particularly true in

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.980 
this is really particularly true in
time-lapse<00:02:35.430> because<00:02:35.970> you're<00:02:36.510> not<00:02:36.630> sure<00:02:36.870> if

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
time-lapse because you're not sure if

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.210 
time-lapse because you're not sure if
the<00:02:37.110> clouds<00:02:37.440> are<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.770> play<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> big<00:02:38.190> part

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the clouds are going to play a big part

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.280 
the clouds are going to play a big part
in<00:02:38.700> your<00:02:38.760> time-lapse<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.930> may<00:02:40.020> want<00:02:40.170> to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
in your time-lapse and you may want to

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.840 
in your time-lapse and you may want to
shoot<00:02:40.410> with<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.560> tighter<00:02:40.830> lance<00:02:41.130> or<00:02:41.310> focus<00:02:41.670> on

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
shoot with a tighter lance or focus on

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.210 
shoot with a tighter lance or focus on
the<00:02:42.450> landscape<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.140> foreground<00:02:43.440> my

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
the landscape in the foreground my

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.920 
the landscape in the foreground my
solution<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.090> shoot<00:02:45.270> with<00:02:45.390> two<00:02:45.540> cameras

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
solution is to shoot with two cameras

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.660 
solution is to shoot with two cameras
now<00:02:46.230> that's<00:02:46.680> obviously<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:47.130> bit<00:02:47.250> extreme<00:02:47.460> for

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
now that's obviously a bit extreme for

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.100 
now that's obviously a bit extreme for
some<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.570> something<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.900> consider

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
some of you but something to consider

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.750 
some of you but something to consider
gives<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.740> best<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.980> both<00:02:50.040> worlds<00:02:50.580> all

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
gives you the best of both worlds all

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
over a 30 minute period but a little

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.260 
over a 30 minute period but a little
magical<00:03:23.070> moments<00:03:23.310> going<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.490> happen<00:03:23.850> let's

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
magical moments going to happen let's

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.660 
magical moments going to happen let's
say<00:03:24.360> an<00:03:25.290> interval<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.860> one<00:03:26.160> or<00:03:26.250> two<00:03:26.370> minutes

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
say an interval of one or two minutes

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.790 
say an interval of one or two minutes
and<00:03:26.850> that's<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.780> advantage<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:28.350> over

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
and that's the advantage of over

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.260 
and that's the advantage of over
shooting<00:03:29.070> because<00:03:29.310> what<00:03:29.550> you<00:03:29.670> can<00:03:29.790> do<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.060> post

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.810 
shooting because what you can do in post
is<00:03:30.600> what<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:30.780> call<00:03:30.960> ramping<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:32.040> can<00:03:32.220> speed<00:03:32.790> up

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
is what we call ramping you can speed up

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.880

the<00:03:32.970> boring<00:03:33.390> sections<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.050> then<00:03:34.440> slow<00:03:34.860> down

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
the boring sections and then slow down
