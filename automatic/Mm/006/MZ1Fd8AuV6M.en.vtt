where else should be reality
we<00:03:25.040> thought<00:03:25.280> about<00:03:25.340> brutalist<00:03:26.269> at<00:03:26.900> one<00:03:27.079> point

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
we thought about brutalist at one point

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.949 
we thought about brutalist at one point
we<00:03:27.409> went<00:03:27.590> our<00:03:27.739> brutalist<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.599> concrete

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
we went our brutalist so the concrete

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.280 
we went our brutalist so the concrete
the<00:03:30.199> movement<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.769> takes<00:03:31.129> away<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:32.090> know

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the movement that takes away you know

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.039 
the movement that takes away you know
any<00:03:33.669> sensibility<00:03:34.669> that<00:03:34.909> I<00:03:35.479> think<00:03:35.659> that's<00:03:35.720> one

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
any sensibility that I think that's one

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.640 
any sensibility that I think that's one
of<00:03:36.139> the<00:03:36.199> sub<00:03:36.440> themes<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.239> film<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:39.019> search

of the sub themes of the film the search
for<00:03:39.859> personality<00:03:40.519> we<00:03:41.150> improvised<00:03:41.659> a<00:03:41.690> lot<00:03:41.870> on

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
for personality we improvised a lot on

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.219 
for personality we improvised a lot on
set<00:03:42.470> but<00:03:43.400> from<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:43.729> visual<00:03:44.060> point<00:03:44.419> of<00:03:44.629> view<00:03:44.810> it

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
set but from a visual point of view it

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.530 
set but from a visual point of view it
has<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.560> have<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.799> lot<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.370> logic<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.180> kind<00:03:47.419> of

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
has to have a lot of logic and I kind of

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.409 
has to have a lot of logic and I kind of
deal<00:03:48.349> with<00:03:48.379> specific<00:03:49.010> elements<00:03:49.400> so<00:03:49.970> when<00:03:50.120> we

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
deal with specific elements so when we

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:51.879 
deal with specific elements so when we
gonna<00:03:50.599> edit<00:03:50.810> different<00:03:51.079> together<00:03:51.500> at<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.769> end

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
gonna edit different together at the end

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.210 
gonna edit different together at the end
it<00:03:51.979> looks<00:03:52.190> like<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:53.449> same<00:03:53.659> Universal<00:03:54.229> so<00:03:55.010> we

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
it looks like the same Universal so we

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.879 
it looks like the same Universal so we
were<00:03:55.400> specific<00:03:56.120> filters<00:03:56.599> with<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:57.229> specific

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
were specific filters with a specific

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.390 
were specific filters with a specific
lenses<00:03:58.720> specific<00:03:59.720> camera<00:04:00.079> movement<00:04:00.620> specific

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
way to light the movie

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.920 
way to light the movie
and<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.730> we<00:04:04.000> have<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.270> be<00:04:04.360> very<00:04:04.690> very

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
and that we have to be very very

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.050 
and that we have to be very very
distillate<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.710> discipline<00:04:06.250> we<00:04:06.790> wanted

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
distillate of discipline we wanted

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.910 
distillate of discipline we wanted
something<00:04:07.300> really<00:04:07.480> rock-solid<00:04:08.080> technically

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
something really rock-solid technically

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.130 
something really rock-solid technically
that<00:04:09.069> could<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.520> could<00:04:09.640> just<00:04:09.900> propulsor<00:04:10.900> the

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
that could that could just propulsor the

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.550 
that could that could just propulsor the
film<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.590> move<00:04:11.770> it<00:04:11.890> forward<00:04:12.130> all<00:04:12.490> the<00:04:12.520> time<00:04:13.560> so

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
film and move it forward all the time so

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.920 
film and move it forward all the time so
my<00:04:14.709> first<00:04:14.980> attempt<00:04:15.520> to<00:04:15.640> go<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:15.970> go<00:04:16.420> in<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.630> new
