00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.580
 and then youtube people I'm linense 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.280
 is with samsung galaxy s and four 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.679
 mini and I'll talk some tips 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.380
 Here are some tips on when to 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.859
 write a personal message 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.910
 that's right let's go there for example 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.890
 the people 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.930
 They asked me how you do it. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.480
 disable only the text 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.560
 because sometimes you have to have 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.730
 a test that for example does not look at the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.950
 contact is by contact any message 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.260
 test for example he already what completes 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.040
 people do not like for example also 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.570
 Do not like people, come on and off here. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.870
 She erased that bar of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:56.719
 down here okay I'll write some 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.719
 things here understand why work 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:05.790
 here the cursor control control 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:10.049
 cursor by sliding your finger across the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:15.299
 keyboard is so hot it makes a lot of handle 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.340
 but even here the letter d course 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.560
 You can see what he's walking around. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.650
 as you walk with your finger on the keyboard 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.280
 he walks Ã“ the keyboard turns a cursor 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:33.329
 Personally, I just clicked very cool. 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:41.040
 another interesting resource he has 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:42.530
 here we show here entrance entry 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.070
 to be continued 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 we need to enable people 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.420
 intelligent continuous input as 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.990
 want to enter the continuous 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:02:04.320
 it is nothing more than the personal right uip 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:06.590

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.599
