00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.890
 all of them every day an hour later the newspaper has been emerging 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.750
 Spanish the world published on December 26, 2009 a chronicle titled 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.880
 Snow White and Cuban Facebook 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.320
 in it when mentioning the premiere at the cinema charles chaplin of the havana of a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.340
 restored version of digitized ti of 1937 snow white closeup 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.470
 Animation feature film of Walt Disney studios was claimed 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.230
 erroneously that it had been the first exhibition of this film in Cuba 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.520
 on the contrary snow white was issued by Cuban television ago 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.720
 already decades on several occasions but what can be interpreted as a mistake 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.690
 journalistic news was soon evident in the text as a lie 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.880
 intentional 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.080
 the world affirmed 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.140
 for half a century the Castro brothers put a heavy bolt on 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.450
 information 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.450
 0 cartoons an unmitigated lie 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.700
 since both theaters and the different television channels of 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.860
 Cuba have an abundant programming of animation series and movies 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.280
 childcare, in which the one produced in states has a prominent role 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.720
 basically linked Disney movies even in the 70s era of 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.880
 The largest exchange with televisions from Eastern European countries 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.850
 maintained the programming of American animation productions of some 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 way the world text recognizes this by stating the following 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.920
 despite the ideological restrictions imposed by the olive green revolution 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.820
 from small the boys and girls of Cuba 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.510
 they know micky mouse or the lion king the little mermaid and other characters from the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.450
 disney factory 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.210
 but the world blatantly lies in explaining that it is the illegal business of 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.549
 parabolic antennas the one that gives access to these films to the population 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.610
 childish 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.659
 the television channels of the island 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.820
 they have been broadcasting these productions for decades 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.350
 even more the children of Cuba have been the first in the world to see 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.840
 on television a few weeks before its commercial premiere 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.340
 movies like 'the lion king' beauty and the beast aladdin or few cons 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:17.699
 the reason is in the economic and commercial blockade of the United States itself 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.860
 against cuba that grants the legal argument 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.960
 economic and moral so that Cuban television does not pay a single 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.729
 dollar to united states for copyright 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:31.909
 but to understand this gross example of journalistic manipulation is necessary 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.789
 explain that the author of the aforementioned chronicle Dodge Garcia 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.909
 one of the so-called independent Cuban journalists 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.359
 who for years have been writing under a contract of large foreign media 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.609
 like the newspaper the world 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.680
 It is not strange that they affirm the same text that the Cuban people have as 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.219
 only way to be decently informed listen to the bbc of london 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.219
 outside radio of spain or the voice of america 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.449
 United States 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.619
 who writes at the request of the powerful media that monopolize the 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.279
 world information 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.629
 censor and criminalize dissenting opinions to capitalism 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.469
 and they flood us with their daily propaganda, it is not strange that they make their time profitable 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.120
 inventing repression in a country where nobody has seen a burden a 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.889
 police beating or turning snow white in the new incident 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:24.430
 cuban 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.959
 all the news 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.590
 this whole thing with all this your intent
