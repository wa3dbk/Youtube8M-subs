have some dill oranges tomatoes and
lemons<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.330> first<00:00:39.720> I'm<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:41.480> take<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
lemons so first I'm going to take the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.560 
lemons so first I'm going to take the
peel<00:00:43.140> off<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.220> orange<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.880> I<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.420> this

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
peel off of the orange and I do it this

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.810 
peel off of the orange and I do it this
way<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:45.900> it's<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:47.370> little<00:00:47.640> bit

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
way because it's just a little bit

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.540 
way because it's just a little bit
quicker<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:49.830> you<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.220> down<00:00:50.400> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
quicker and if you just go down the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.049 
quicker and if you just go down the
sides<00:00:51.650> just<00:00:52.650> take<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.370> peel<00:00:53.700> off<00:00:53.850> very

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
sides just take the peel off very

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.460 
sides just take the peel off very
quickly<00:00:54.120> instead<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:55.489> fighting<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.700> it<00:00:57.470> and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
quickly instead of fighting with it and

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.100 
quickly instead of fighting with it and
this<00:00:59.100> whole<00:00:59.339> recipe<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.570> done<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110

this whole recipe is going to be done in
the<00:01:01.739> Vitamix<00:01:02.750> usually<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.680> oranges

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and the tomatoes in first because

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.420 
and the tomatoes in first because
they're<00:01:07.590> wet<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.900> helps<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.409> mix<00:01:11.040> easier

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
they're wet and that helps it mix easier

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:23.390 
they're wet and that helps it mix easier
