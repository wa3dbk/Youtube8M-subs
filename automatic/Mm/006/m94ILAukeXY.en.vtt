00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
right i am moving and i've known that it

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.099 
right i am moving and i've known that it
was<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.490> possibility<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> while<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.020> was

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
was a possibility for a while but it was

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.660 
was a possibility for a while but it was
always<00:00:22.230> something<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:23.039> talked<00:00:23.550> about

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
always something that we talked about

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.670 
always something that we talked about
but<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.330> never<00:00:24.510> really<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.289> happen

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
but it never really was going to happen

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.320 
but it never really was going to happen
or<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.609> those<00:00:26.730> things<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.090> was

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
or it was one of those things that was

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.390 
or it was one of those things that was
just<00:00:27.689> an<00:00:27.900> idea<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:28.710> never<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.010> formed

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
just an idea but never really formed

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.790 
just an idea but never really formed
into<00:00:29.580> anything<00:00:29.789> solid<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.660> now<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
into anything solid and now it's a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.889 
into anything solid and now it's a
pretty<00:00:32.099> big<00:00:32.340> possibility<00:00:32.610> i<00:00:33.059> mean<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
pretty big possibility i mean it's not a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.620 
pretty big possibility i mean it's not a
hundred<00:00:34.230> percent<00:00:34.440> sure<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.460> there's<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.420> good

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hundred percent sure but there's a good

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.880 
hundred percent sure but there's a good
chance<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> next<00:00:37.350> two<00:00:37.590> or<00:00:37.620> three<00:00:37.739> months

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890

we're not going to be able to move it's
going<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.420> too<00:02:30.569> stressful<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.110> stuff<00:02:31.260> like

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
going to be too stressful and stuff like

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.410 
going to be too stressful and stuff like
that<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:32.069> kind<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.459> has<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.700> happen<00:02:33.180> or<00:02:33.299> it

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
that so it kind of has to happen or it

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.870 
that so it kind of has to happen or it
won't<00:02:33.959> happen<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.799> have<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> feeling<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> will

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.319 
exciting I'm not gonna have to drive as
far<00:02:52.829> so<00:02:53.130> it's<00:02:53.310> gonna<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.610> really<00:02:54.030> good<00:02:54.269> thing

far so it's gonna be a really good thing
I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.260> not<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.440> hundred<00:02:55.650> percent

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
I think and it's not a hundred percent

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.130 
I think and it's not a hundred percent
like<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.220> said<00:02:56.489> but<00:02:57.329> it's<00:02:57.480> almost<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.079> hundred

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
like I said but it's almost a hundred

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.720 
like I said but it's almost a hundred
percent<00:02:58.349> like<00:02:58.650> ninety<00:02:59.010> percent<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.549> feel

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
percent like ninety percent so I feel

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.440 
percent like ninety percent so I feel
like<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.880> something's<00:03:00.090> gonna<00:03:00.180> be<00:03:00.329> really

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
