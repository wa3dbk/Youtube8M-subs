we're<00:00:02.460> known<00:00:02.669> for<00:00:02.700> making<00:00:03.380> instruments<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.830> be

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
we're known for making instruments to be

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.419 
we're known for making instruments to be

you<00:00:10.860> know<00:00:10.950> our<00:00:11.190> philosophy<00:00:11.969> has<00:00:12.240> always<00:00:12.570> been

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
you know our philosophy has always been

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.530 
you know our philosophy has always been
that<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.740> instrument<00:00:14.280> should<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:15.360> get<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
that the instrument should just get the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.140 
that the instrument should just get the
hell<00:00:15.660> out<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.199> way<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:17.039> let<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.490> musician

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
hell out of the way and let the musician

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.740 
hell out of the way and let the musician
being<00:00:18.570> resistant<00:00:23.090> you<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> heart<00:00:24.570> the

being resistant you know the heart the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.380 
being resistant you know the heart the
hardest<00:00:25.140> part<00:00:25.439> about<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.580> know<00:00:26.699> what<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.119> do

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
hardest part about you know what we do

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.840 
hardest part about you know what we do
is<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.199> there<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.279> these<00:00:29.960> mechanical

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
is that there are these mechanical

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.110 
is that there are these mechanical
requirements<00:00:32.850> they<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.930> conform<00:00:34.469> to

laws of physics that will not change so

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
laws of physics that will not change so
we<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.770> find<00:00:41.160> ways<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:42.110> sort<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> straddle

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
we have to find ways to sort of straddle

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.910 
we have to find ways to sort of straddle
the<00:00:43.980> line<00:00:44.030> between<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.690> actual<00:00:46.230> mechanical

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.410 
you know you spend eight hours carving
every<00:01:26.470> body<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.340> getting<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:27.790> ready<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.120> spray

every body and getting it ready to spray
how<00:01:28.990> much<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.290> gonna<00:01:29.350> charge<00:01:29.680> for<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:30.160> who<00:01:30.970> can

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
how much you gonna charge for it who can

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.130 
how much you gonna charge for it who can
afford<00:01:31.540> that<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:32.050> was<00:01:33.040> able<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.880> work<00:01:34.630> with<00:01:34.960> the

afford that I was able to work with the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.180 
afford that I was able to work with the
Machine<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:36.010> adapt<00:01:36.970> what<00:01:37.510> it<00:01:37.690> does<00:01:38.190> to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
Machine and adapt what it does to

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.510 
Machine and adapt what it does to
deliver<00:01:39.700> an<00:01:40.090> end<00:01:40.390> result<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.680> looks<00:01:42.160> and

deliver an end result that looks and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.210 
deliver an end result that looks and
feels<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:43.660> way<00:01:43.900> I<00:01:43.930> would<00:01:44.500> have<00:01:44.680> done<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.040> by

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
feels the way I would have done it by

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.570 
feels the way I would have done it by
hand

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.610 

oh<00:01:52.640> crap<00:01:53.570> I'm<00:01:53.900> replaced<00:01:54.620> by<00:01:54.980> a<00:01:55.010> machine<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:56.620> lot

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
oh crap I'm replaced by a machine a lot

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.410 
oh crap I'm replaced by a machine a lot
of<00:01:57.800> people<00:01:58.130> look<00:01:58.310> at<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.910> think<00:01:59.210> it's

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
of people look at that and think it's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.290 
of people look at that and think it's
evil<00:01:59.840> because<00:02:00.470> it's<00:02:00.680> taking<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.430> art<00:02:01.640> out<00:02:02.090> of

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
evil because it's taking the art out of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.550 
evil because it's taking the art out of
it<00:02:02.450> that's<00:02:02.660> ridiculous

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
it that's ridiculous

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.220 
it that's ridiculous
you<00:02:03.950> still<00:02:04.280> need<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.640> art<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.150> if<00:02:05.990> anything

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
you still need the art and if anything

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.560 
you still need the art and if anything
you<00:02:06.380> need<00:02:06.650> to<00:02:06.770> bring<00:02:06.950> more<00:02:07.220> art<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:08.420> get

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
you need to bring more art to it to get

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.380 
you need to bring more art to it to get
a<00:02:08.630> machine<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:09.410> emulate<00:02:09.950> what<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:10.880> human<00:02:11.270> is

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
a machine to emulate what a human is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.980 
a machine to emulate what a human is
capable<00:02:11.570> of<00:02:11.960> doing<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:13.520> it's<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.240> lot<00:02:14.480> less<00:02:14.690> wear

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
capable of doing so it's a lot less wear

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.800 
capable of doing so it's a lot less wear
and<00:02:15.020> tear<00:02:15.410> on<00:02:15.470> me<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.120> big<00:02:17.330> difference

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
and tear on me it's a big difference

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.620 
and tear on me it's a big difference
than<00:02:18.020> when<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.230> was<00:02:18.500> 28<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.310> worked<00:02:19.850> 14<00:02:20.300> hours<00:02:20.420> a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
than when I was 28 and worked 14 hours a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.320 
than when I was 28 and worked 14 hours a
day<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.080> not<00:02:21.170> feel<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:22.250> know<00:02:22.280> now<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.910> feel

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
day and not feel it you know now I feel

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.200 
day and not feel it you know now I feel
it<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:25.010> know<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.160> got<00:02:25.460> to<00:02:25.610> be<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> little<00:02:26.000> more

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
it so you know I got to be a little more

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.110 
it so you know I got to be a little more
merciful<00:02:26.810> on<00:02:27.110> my<00:02:27.290> body<00:02:27.610> having<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.700> machine

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
merciful on my body having a machine

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.800 
merciful on my body having a machine
that<00:02:29.630> allows<00:02:29.780> me<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:31.250> still<00:02:31.610> do<00:02:31.970> what<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.450> could

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
that allows me to still do what I could

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.330 
that allows me to still do what I could
do

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
do

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.080 
do
relentlessly<00:02:34.450> that's<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.600> good<00:02:35.810> thing
