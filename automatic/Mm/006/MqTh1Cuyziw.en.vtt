00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
maybe the progressive is where you have

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.980 
maybe the progressive is where you have
a<00:01:47.250> whole<00:01:47.549> new<00:01:47.729> upgrade<00:01:48.030> system<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.930> a

these things on now these are these are
fundamental<00:04:50.050> ideas<00:04:51.010> we've<00:04:51.130> already<00:04:51.280> seen<00:04:51.610> in

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
fundamental ideas we've already seen in

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.090 
fundamental ideas we've already seen in
the<00:04:51.820> game<00:04:52.000> but<00:04:52.510> there-there's<00:04:53.170> their<00:04:53.920> new

the game but there-there's their new

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.620 
the game but there-there's their new
ways<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.430> combine<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.730> parts<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.360> create<00:04:55.570> a

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
ways to combine the parts and create a

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.480 
ways to combine the parts and create a
new<00:04:55.660> experience<00:04:56.200> right<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.919> I<00:04:57.190> think<00:04:57.250> one<00:04:57.460> of

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
new experience right and I think one of

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.590 
new experience right and I think one of
the<00:04:57.580> things<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.760> people<00:04:58.030> have<00:04:58.150> enjoyed<00:04:58.450> so

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
the things that people have enjoyed so

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.330 
the things that people have enjoyed so
much<00:04:58.660> about<00:04:58.960> these<00:04:59.110> games<00:04:59.410> that<00:04:59.710> you<00:05:00.010> know<00:05:00.130> for

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
much about these games that you know for

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.560 
much about these games that you know for
one<00:05:00.550> of<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:00.700> first<00:05:00.850> times<00:05:01.000> you<00:05:01.090> actually<00:05:01.180> feel

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
one of the first times you actually feel

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.350 
one of the first times you actually feel
like<00:05:01.630> Batman<00:05:02.470> traversing<00:05:03.100> through<00:05:03.820> Gotham

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360

and Arkham Asylum what talk about the
environments<00:05:07.720> here<00:05:07.810> because<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.020> know<00:05:08.080> there's

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
environments here because I know there's

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.470 
environments here because I know there's
there's<00:05:08.860> multiple<00:05:09.250> areas<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.880> extremist

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
there's multiple areas to extremist

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.940 
there's multiple areas to extremist
games<00:05:10.660> significantly<00:05:11.290> bigger<00:05:11.470> than<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.830> last

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
games significantly bigger than the last

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.680 
games significantly bigger than the last
so<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.370> absolutely<00:05:13.210> what<00:05:13.390> you're<00:05:13.510> seeing

Batman's grappling gay blade gameplay is

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.159 
Batman's grappling gay blade gameplay is
something<00:05:22.180> we<00:05:22.270> be<00:05:22.330> able<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.510> expand<00:05:22.900> in<00:05:23.050> that

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
something we be able to expand in that

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.870 
something we be able to expand in that
area<00:05:23.350> it's<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.919> same<00:05:24.100> controls<00:05:24.520> in<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.700> same

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
area it's the same controls in the same

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.250 
area it's the same controls in the same
mechanics<00:05:25.360> but<00:05:25.690> by<00:05:25.780> having<00:05:26.020> all<00:05:26.110> these

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
mechanics but by having all these

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.600 
mechanics but by having all these
crosswalks<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:26.950> he's<00:05:27.130> catwalks<00:05:27.490> these

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
crosswalks and he's catwalks these

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.219 
crosswalks and he's catwalks these
connections<00:05:27.940> between<00:05:28.240> the<00:05:28.450> buildings<00:05:28.780> we

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
connections between the buildings we

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.750 
connections between the buildings we
have<00:05:29.320> an<00:05:29.380> entirely<00:05:29.680> new<00:05:29.919> feeling<00:05:30.520> to<00:05:30.610> that

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
have an entirely new feeling to that

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.120 
have an entirely new feeling to that
area<00:05:30.970> in<00:05:31.360> terms<00:05:31.570> of<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.780> scale<00:05:32.110> in<00:05:32.410> terms<00:05:32.470> of

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
area in terms of the scale in terms of

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.310 
area in terms of the scale in terms of
just<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.030> way<00:05:34.150> you<00:05:34.210> can<00:05:34.390> kind<00:05:34.570> of<00:05:34.630> have<00:05:35.290> that

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
just the way you can kind of have that

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.560 
just the way you can kind of have that
pace<00:05:35.680> so<00:05:35.860> how<00:05:35.979> you<00:05:36.040> grab<00:05:36.280> a<00:05:36.310> blade<00:05:36.669> dive<00:05:37.060> you'll

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
pace so how you grab a blade dive you'll

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.790 
pace so how you grab a blade dive you'll
get<00:05:37.690> higher<00:05:37.930> speed<00:05:38.290> when<00:05:38.440> you're<00:05:38.560> diving

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
get higher speed when you're diving

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.240 
get higher speed when you're diving
you'll<00:05:39.460> get<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.820> much<00:05:40.240> more<00:05:40.390> kind<00:05:40.570> of<00:05:40.660> complex

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
you'll get the much more kind of complex

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.940 
you'll get the much more kind of complex
but<00:05:42.250> not<00:05:42.430> not<00:05:42.990> troublesome<00:05:43.990> navigation<00:05:44.710> so

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
but not not troublesome navigation so

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.350 
but not not troublesome navigation so
it's<00:05:45.310> something<00:05:45.550> that's<00:05:45.729> been<00:05:45.760> really<00:05:46.030> fun<00:05:46.210> to

it's something that's been really fun to

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.120 
it's something that's been really fun to
add<00:05:46.479> to<00:05:46.660> another<00:05:47.440> thing<00:05:47.680> you're<00:05:47.860> seeing<00:05:48.070> in

gargoyles so we can navigate around that

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.730 
gargoyles so we can navigate around that
way<00:06:14.850> there's<00:06:15.850> a<00:06:15.940> whole<00:06:16.229> library<00:06:17.229> of<00:06:17.470> ways<00:06:17.710> to
