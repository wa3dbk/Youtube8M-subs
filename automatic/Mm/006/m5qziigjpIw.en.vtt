then you know- 350 so they ended up
being<00:01:51.600> 50<00:01:52.049> cents<00:01:52.409> each<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.250> thought<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.000> was

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
being 50 cents each I thought that was

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.249 
being 50 cents each I thought that was
great<00:01:54.920> last<00:01:55.920> week<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.640> had<00:01:56.939> ten<00:01:57.689> dollars<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
great last week I had ten dollars and

great last week I had ten dollars and
fifty<00:01:58.619> cents<00:01:59.219> in<00:02:00.229> extra<00:02:01.229> care<00:02:01.469> bucks<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.670> was

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
fifty cents in extra care bucks so I was

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.639 
fifty cents in extra care bucks so I was
able<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:05.390> pay<00:02:07.789> sixty-nine<00:02:08.789> cents<00:02:09.450> cash<00:02:10.050> and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
able to pay sixty-nine cents cash and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.700 
able to pay sixty-nine cents cash and
the<00:02:11.190> reason<00:02:11.550> why<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.760> had<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> page<00:02:12.270> 69<00:02:12.720> cents<00:02:12.989> is

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
the reason why I had a page 69 cents is

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.620 
the reason why I had a page 69 cents is
as<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.460> pay<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.760> tax<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.510> you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
as you have to pay the tax like you

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.000 
as you have to pay the tax like you
can't<00:02:16.250> give<00:02:17.250> all<00:02:17.550> your<00:02:17.790> extra<00:02:18.090> care<00:02:18.390> bucks
