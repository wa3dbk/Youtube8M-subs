with you know trying to sell them false
ideas<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:36.000> comes<00:01:36.329> down<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:37.009> if<00:01:38.009> you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
ideas and it really comes down to if you

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580 
ideas and it really comes down to if you
show<00:01:38.490> people<00:01:38.850> step<00:01:39.090> by<00:01:39.299> step<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.350> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
show people step by step and then you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.130 
show people step by step and then you
test<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.850> obvious<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.450> works<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
test it then it's obvious it works and I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.630 
test it then it's obvious it works and I
think<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.340> integrity

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
think that you know that integrity

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.190 
think that you know that integrity
factor<00:01:45.210> that's<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.570> thing<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.049> your

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
factor that's one thing like with your

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.319 
factor that's one thing like with your
steam<00:01:46.439> generator<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.250> built<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.670> that's

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
steam generator that you built is that's

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.910 
steam generator that you built is that's
one<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> reasons<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.110> absolutely<00:01:49.500> respect

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
one of the reasons I absolutely respect

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.100 
one of the reasons I absolutely respect
your<00:01:50.340> channel<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.820> Wales<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.869> show

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
your channel as Wales because you show

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.899 
your channel as Wales because you show
people<00:01:52.470> step<00:01:52.770> by<00:01:52.950> step<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> end<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
people step by step and at the end of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
people step by step and at the end of
the<00:01:53.970> day<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.210> works<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:55.140> that's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the day it works and that's what that's

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410 
the day it works and that's what that's
why<00:01:55.799> people<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> look<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.299> know

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
why people is going to look for you know

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.709 
why people is going to look for you know
they<00:01:58.259> don't<00:01:58.530> always<00:01:58.740> work<00:01:59.299> some<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> stuff

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
they don't always work some of the stuff

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.139 
they don't always work some of the stuff
but<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:02.040> that's<00:02:02.219> all<00:02:02.399> thing<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> grew

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
but but that's all thing you know I grew

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.639 
but but that's all thing you know I grew
up<00:02:03.270> reading<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:03.689> these<00:02:03.840> books<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.469> you

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
up reading all these books right you

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.810 
up reading all these books right you
read<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> books<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.549> start

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
read all the books and you start

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.429 
read all the books and you start
thinking<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
thinking you can do you know the the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.169 
thinking you can do you know the the
boys<00:02:07.649> got<00:02:07.860> mangled<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> bow<00:02:08.700> drill<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
boys got mangled of the bow drill it

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.550 
boys got mangled of the bow drill it
works<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.780> doesn't<00:02:10.080> work<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.410> you've

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
works but it doesn't work if you've

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.510 
works but it doesn't work if you've
never<00:02:10.770> done<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.069> yeah<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.910> takes<00:02:12.180> some

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
never done it yeah that takes some

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.470 
never done it yeah that takes some
yeah<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.840> started<00:02:14.380> doing<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:14.830> stuff<00:02:15.480> just

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
yeah so so I started doing my stuff just

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.930 
yeah so so I started doing my stuff just
because<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:17.050> wanted<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.800> start<00:02:18.370> learning<00:02:18.610> how

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
because I wanted to start learning how

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.670 
because I wanted to start learning how
to<00:02:18.970> do<00:02:19.180> things<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.840> figured<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.290> I'm<00:02:20.560> gonna

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
to do things and I figured if I'm gonna

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.710 
to do things and I figured if I'm gonna
do<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.980> might<00:02:21.100> as<00:02:21.160> little<00:02:21.370> video<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:22.090> but

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
do it I might as little video but but
