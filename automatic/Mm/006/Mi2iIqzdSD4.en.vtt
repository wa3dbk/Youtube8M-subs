00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.020 
I'm Dave Mustaine at Guitar Center when
I<00:00:08.530> was<00:00:08.740> growing<00:00:09.040> up<00:00:09.160> one<00:00:09.490> of<00:00:09.520> my<00:00:09.610> influences

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
I was growing up one of my influences

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.090 
I was growing up one of my influences
was<00:00:10.750> Michael<00:00:11.110> Schenker<00:00:11.410> that's<00:00:11.560> by<00:00:11.680> a<00:00:11.710> play<00:00:11.950> of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
was Michael Schenker that's by a play of

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.950 
was Michael Schenker that's by a play of
V<00:00:12.310> and<00:00:12.790> I<00:00:13.270> thought<00:00:13.420> his<00:00:13.600> guitar<00:00:13.930> playing

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
V and I thought his guitar playing

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.529 
V and I thought his guitar playing
because<00:00:14.350> was<00:00:14.620> classically<00:00:15.240> influenced<00:00:16.240> was

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
because was classically influenced was

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.749 
because was classically influenced was
just<00:00:17.230> amazing<00:00:17.890> every<00:00:18.130> time<00:00:18.160> I<00:00:18.369> would<00:00:18.609> hear<00:00:18.730> a

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759 
just amazing every time I would hear a

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.519 
just amazing every time I would hear a
solo<00:00:19.060> there<00:00:19.329> was<00:00:19.419> a<00:00:19.449> new<00:00:19.749> direction<00:00:19.960> it<00:00:20.380> went

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
solo there was a new direction it went

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.870 
solo there was a new direction it went
into<00:00:20.919> and<00:00:21.070> that<00:00:21.159> was<00:00:21.279> part<00:00:21.519> of<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.640> challenge

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
it wasn't until I found Dean that I

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.380 
it wasn't until I found Dean that I
really<00:00:34.630> found<00:00:34.810> my<00:00:35.080> home<00:00:35.350> never<00:00:36.280> had<00:00:36.760> a<00:00:37.060> single

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
really found my home never had a single

guitar<00:00:37.750> from<00:00:38.200> Dean<00:00:38.410> show<00:00:38.710> up<00:00:38.830> to<00:00:38.980> me<00:00:39.130> that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
guitar from Dean show up to me that

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.120 
guitar from Dean show up to me that
wasn't<00:00:39.660> absolutely<00:00:40.660> ready<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.110> play<00:00:41.380> when<00:00:42.010> the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
wasn't absolutely ready to play when the

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.550 
wasn't absolutely ready to play when the
guitar<00:00:42.250> first<00:00:42.580> was<00:00:42.970> developed<00:00:43.540> we<00:00:44.110> wanted<00:00:44.470> to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
guitar first was developed we wanted to

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.170 
guitar first was developed we wanted to
give<00:00:44.740> it<00:00:44.770> a<00:00:44.920> little<00:00:45.190> bit<00:00:45.460> of<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:45.700> difference

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
give it a little bit of a difference

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.380 
give it a little bit of a difference
from<00:00:46.510> when<00:00:47.320> we<00:00:47.470> were<00:00:47.650> with<00:00:47.800> ESP<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.850> not<00:00:49.030> copy

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
from when we were with ESP and not copy

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.190 
from when we were with ESP and not copy
the<00:00:49.980> Jackson<00:00:50.980> model<00:00:51.550> too<00:00:51.790> much<00:00:52.090> I<00:00:52.360> think

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
the Jackson model too much I think

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.660 
the Jackson model too much I think
probably<00:00:53.380> one<00:00:53.710> of<00:00:53.740> the<00:00:53.890> coolest<00:00:54.250> things<00:00:54.490> was

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
probably one of the coolest things was

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.810 
probably one of the coolest things was
having<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.210> six<00:00:55.570> tuners<00:00:56.410> in<00:00:56.440> line<00:00:56.920> for<00:00:57.430> me<00:00:57.610> and

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
having the six tuners in line for me and

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.850 
having the six tuners in line for me and
of<00:00:57.910> tuning<00:00:58.360> and<00:00:58.510> then<00:00:58.630> having<00:00:58.840> to<00:00:58.990> turn<00:00:59.530> on<00:00:59.740> the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
of tuning and then having to turn on the

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.800 
of tuning and then having to turn on the
bottom<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.370> turn<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.150> opposite<00:01:01.570> way<00:01:01.780> a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
bottom and turn it the opposite way a

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.109 
bottom and turn it the opposite way a
lot<00:01:02.079> of<00:01:02.110> times<00:01:02.410> it's<00:01:03.400> critical<00:01:03.880> when<00:01:03.970> you're

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
lot of times it's critical when you're

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.060 
lot of times it's critical when you're
on<00:01:04.210> stage<00:01:04.360> you<00:01:04.659> need<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.809> tune<00:01:05.080> quickly<00:01:05.590> between

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
on stage you need a tune quickly between

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.330 
on stage you need a tune quickly between
songs<00:01:06.550> so<00:01:07.270> for<00:01:07.780> me<00:01:07.980> one<00:01:08.980> of<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.130> most

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
songs so for me one of the most

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.980 
songs so for me one of the most
important<00:01:09.790> things<00:01:09.940> about<00:01:10.060> design<00:01:10.600> for<00:01:10.870> this

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
important things about design for this

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.230 
important things about design for this
guitar<00:01:11.170> was<00:01:11.680> playability<00:01:12.220> one<00:01:12.940> thing<00:01:13.120> that

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
guitar was playability one thing that

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.840 
guitar was playability one thing that
sets<00:01:13.450> this<00:01:13.510> guitar<00:01:13.900> part<00:01:14.170> -<00:01:14.380> is<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:15.100> use<00:01:15.700> of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
sets this guitar part - is the use of

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.760 
sets this guitar part - is the use of
the<00:01:15.940> frets<00:01:16.210> -<00:01:16.360> jumbo<00:01:16.570> frets<00:01:16.900> on<00:01:17.140> here<00:01:17.380> we're

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
the frets - jumbo frets on here we're

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.430 
the frets - jumbo frets on here we're
not<00:01:17.920> using<00:01:18.550> really<00:01:18.880> thin<00:01:19.210> frets<00:01:19.630> so<00:01:19.870> the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
not using really thin frets so the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.190 
not using really thin frets so the
guitar<00:01:20.590> has<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> kind<00:01:21.610> of<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.729> twangy<00:01:22.300> sound<00:01:22.600> this

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
guitar has a kind of a twangy sound this

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.960 
guitar has a kind of a twangy sound this
is<00:01:23.530> like<00:01:23.830> one<00:01:24.010> of<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.159> best<00:01:24.400> metal<00:01:24.700> sound<00:01:24.880> of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
is like one of the best metal sound of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.690 
is like one of the best metal sound of
guitars<00:01:25.240> I've<00:01:25.420> ever<00:01:25.570> played<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.920> album<00:01:27.100> 13
