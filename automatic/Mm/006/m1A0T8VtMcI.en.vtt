00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.050
 Hello, how are you going to talk? 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.050
 a little about microtubules 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.570
 in microtubules have a very role 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.660
 important in what the organization is 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.090
 of eukaryotic cells are tubes 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.340
 protein hollows long and very rigid 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.860
 which have a capacity 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.140
 impressive of powers to assemble with 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.080
 very quickly somewhere and be able to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.150
 reassembled in another in a 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.430
 animal cell the original microtubules 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.980
 from the centrosome from there they go to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.540
 extend to the cellular periphery forming 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 well an inter cellular care system 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.190
 so that throughout them 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.110
 displace what are the vesicles 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.180
 organelles and some other components 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.160
 another characteristic is that I need 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.960
 skeleton angelinos organelles that are 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.180
 delimited by membranes inside the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.329
 cell also serve as a guide in the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.489
 intracellular transport 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.890
 in the following scheme we can observe 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.170
 how the microtubules are shaped 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.629
 so it is a number composed of 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.479
 two globular proteins what is the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.100
 alpha tubulin and beta tubulin 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.409
 marked each one of a different color 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.659
 these two proteins are held together 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.310
 by a non-covalent bond the first 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.500
 of tubulin are going to start stacking 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.810
 linked by a non-covalent bond 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.990
 among all the first to constitute 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.670
 so what would be the proto filament with 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.649
 the union of what all the monies 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.140
 of tubulin is going to form what is the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.960
 proto filamento which is going to give 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.789
 structure to the microtubules to form 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.289
 a microtubule proto filaments are 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.869
 they have to line up in the form of a 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.330
 circle leaving a light between space 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.490
 what there is between all of them as if it were 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.319
 a roll of paper in total has to 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.090
 have 13 proto filaments and so 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.399
 finally you are going to be able to build what 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.100
 which is a defined structure of a 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.049
 microtubules 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.460
 in this scheme we can appreciate the 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.759
 origin of what microtubules are 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.400
 more specifically referring to what 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.540
 which is the animal cell which are going to 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.299
 derive from a structure called 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.860
 centrosome this structure is in its 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.350
 surface has a series of rings 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.810
 called nucleation sites which 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.220
 they will settle for the gamma tubulin and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.960
 from that ring, the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.510
 microtubules 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.880
 the first of alpha and beta tubulin are 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.530
 they are going to add these rings in the 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.020
 output of each ring from the site of 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.750
 nucleation is going to be inserted what is the 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.430
 negative end of the microtubules and the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.850
 growth will only occur in the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.990
 positive ends that are going to guide 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.990
 towards the outside of the centrosome
