the<00:01:10.290> use<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.610> three-way<00:01:12.090> swivel<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the use of that three-way swivel in the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.929 
the use of that three-way swivel in the
middle<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> rig<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.430> eliminates

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
middle of the rig and it eliminates

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.749 
middle of the rig and it eliminates
having<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.450> tie<00:01:15.720> all<00:01:16.140> those<00:01:16.470> knots<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.490> sit

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
having to tie all those knots to sit

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.810 
having to tie all those knots to sit
this<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.630> absolutely<00:01:19.380> hate<00:01:19.860> wasting<00:01:20.640> time

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
this up I absolutely hate wasting time

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
this up I absolutely hate wasting time
messing<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.479> time<00:01:21.780> knots<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.470> having<00:01:22.710> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
messing with time knots and having to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.880 
messing with time knots and having to
keep<00:01:22.950> threeways<00:01:23.400> swivels<00:01:23.880> around<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.890> all

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
keep threeways swivels around and all

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.830 
keep threeways swivels around and all
that<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:27.409> eliminated<00:01:28.850> doing<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.060> so

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that so I just eliminated doing that so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.810 
that so I just eliminated doing that so
the<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.530> set<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.640> your

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the way this is set up is you have your

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.280 
the way this is set up is you have your
main<00:01:33.030> line<00:01:35.390> that<00:01:36.390> runs<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.049> fishing<00:01:37.439> rod

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.130 

and<00:01:45.730> what<00:01:46.730> you<00:01:46.880> do<00:01:47.060> is<00:01:47.210> tie<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.660> barrel

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
and what you do is tie on a barrel

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.360 
and what you do is tie on a barrel
swivel<00:01:48.290> here<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:51.650> this<00:01:51.860> barrel<00:01:52.250> swivel

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
swivel here and to this barrel swivel

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.310 
swivel here and to this barrel swivel
you're<00:01:52.850> going<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.060> attach<00:01:53.390> your<00:01:53.600> catfish<00:01:54.050> rig

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
you're going to attach your catfish rig

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.710 
you're going to attach your catfish rig
so<00:01:55.160> what<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.490> do<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.880> take<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.120> length<00:01:56.420> of

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
so what you do is take a length of

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.290 
so what you do is take a length of
monofilament<00:01:57.020> fishing<00:01:57.530> line<00:01:57.890> and<00:02:01.300> you

that<00:02:19.640> knot<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.090> tie<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.450> another<00:02:21.050> overhand

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
that knot and tie it another overhand

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.410 
that knot and tie it another overhand
knot<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:22.070> top<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.490> that<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.850> really<00:02:23.270> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
knot on top of that is really the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.940 
knot on top of that is really the
simplest<00:02:23.840> way<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.170> do<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.590> that's<00:02:24.709> what<00:02:24.920> I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
simplest way to do it that's what I

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.310 
simplest way to do it that's what I
always<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.880> then<00:02:26.660> you're<00:02:26.810> gonna<00:02:26.900> go<00:02:27.110> down

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
always do and then you're gonna go down

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.230 
always do and then you're gonna go down
here<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.709> bottom<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.750> attach<00:02:29.750> your<00:02:29.990> way

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
here to the bottom and attach your way

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.040 
here to the bottom and attach your way
to<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.990> attach<00:02:33.320> your<00:02:33.530> hook<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:35.050> you

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
to this you attach your hook and you

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.680 
to this you attach your hook and you
have<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.260> big<00:02:36.560> loop<00:02:36.830> there<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.940> what<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.300> do<00:02:38.480> is

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
have a big loop there so what you do is

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.480 
have a big loop there so what you do is
you<00:02:38.840> feed<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.140> loop<00:02:39.560> through<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.010> eye<00:02:40.040> on

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
you feed that loop through the eye on

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.880 
you feed that loop through the eye on
your<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:40.820> your<00:02:40.880> fishing<00:02:41.660> hook<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.140> then<00:02:42.620> pull

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
your on your fishing hook and then pull

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.590 
your on your fishing hook and then pull
your<00:02:43.010> hook<00:02:43.250> through<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.880> loop<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.330> pull<00:02:44.570> it

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
your hook through that loop and pull it

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.180 
your hook through that loop and pull it
tight<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.230> that's<00:02:45.290> how<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.590> attach<00:02:45.980> your

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
tight and that's how you attach your

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.910 
tight and that's how you attach your
hook<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.760> loop<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.680> again<00:02:48.680> it

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
hook to that loop and again it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.430 
hook to that loop and again it
eliminates<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.640> need<00:02:50.420> for<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.930> three-way

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
eliminates the need for that three-way

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.240 
eliminates the need for that three-way
swivel<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.209> on<00:02:53.570> that<00:02:53.989> rig<00:02:54.320> makes

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
swivel that you have on that rig makes

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.580 
swivel that you have on that rig makes
it<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.489> lot<00:02:55.700> faster<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.480> tie<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:58.450> eliminates

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
it a lot faster to tie and eliminates

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.490 
it a lot faster to tie and eliminates
tackle<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.970> process<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.959> setting<00:03:03.350> up

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
tackle in this process of setting up

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.830

this<00:03:03.680> rig<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.670> some<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.150> questions<00:03:05.630> I've

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
this rig so some of the questions I've

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.820 
this rig so some of the questions I've
had<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.530> how<00:03:07.430> long<00:03:07.670> should<00:03:07.970> this<00:03:08.150> line<00:03:08.450> be<00:03:09.019> from

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
had is how long should this line be from

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.880 
had is how long should this line be from
the<00:03:09.950> swivel<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:11.120> where<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.420> hook<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:11.900> how<00:03:12.650> long

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
the swivel to where the hook is how long

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.120 
the swivel to where the hook is how long
should<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.310> line<00:03:13.550> be<00:03:14.080> from<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.350> weight<00:03:15.560> to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
should the line be from the weight to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.699 
should the line be from the weight to
where<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:17.060> loop<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.140> hook<00:03:18.350> there

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
where the the loop is and the hook there

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.350 
where the the loop is and the hook there
the<00:03:18.890> leader<00:03:19.100> that<00:03:19.220> comes<00:03:19.580> off<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:19.820> that<00:03:19.970> and

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
the leader that comes off of that and

the leader that comes off of that and
how<00:03:21.050> much<00:03:21.230> weight<00:03:21.470> should<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:21.860> use<00:03:22.130> as<00:03:22.370> a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
how much weight should I use as a

how much weight should I use as a
general<00:03:23.360> rule<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.930> use<00:03:24.830> an<00:03:25.010> ounce<00:03:25.190> and<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.489> half

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
general rule I use an ounce and a half

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.820 
general rule I use an ounce and a half

I'd say 18 inches from your weight to

your hook maybe less 12 inches would

your hook maybe less 12 inches would
probably<00:04:21.260> work<00:04:21.440> if<00:04:22.130> you're<00:04:22.640> using<00:04:22.850> this<00:04:23.180> for

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
weight is all going to depend on where

those<00:04:34.070> fish<00:04:34.280> are<00:04:34.520> in<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.730> water<00:04:34.940> column<00:04:35.210> if

the fish are suspending 4 or 6 feet up
from<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.880> bottom<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.360> lake<00:04:41.570> then<00:04:42.050> you're

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
from the bottom of the lake then you're

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.590 
from the bottom of the lake then you're
going<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.440> want<00:04:42.650> this<00:04:42.920> rig<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.220> be<00:04:43.520> longer<00:04:43.790> if

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
going to want this rig to be longer if

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.080 
going to want this rig to be longer if
their<00:04:44.810> fish<00:04:45.080> are<00:04:45.320> real<00:04:45.500> down<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.460> hugged<00:04:46.820> real

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
their fish are real down and hugged real

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.030 
their fish are real down and hugged real
tight<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.930> bottom<00:04:48.140> of<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.440> lake<00:04:48.650> or<00:04:48.860> river

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
tight to the bottom of the lake or river

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.580 
tight to the bottom of the lake or river
then<00:04:49.940> you're<00:04:50.300> gonna<00:04:50.420> want<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:50.870> shorter<00:04:51.380> you

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
then you're gonna want it shorter you

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.920 
then you're gonna want it shorter you
know<00:04:51.770> maybe<00:04:52.100> like<00:04:52.400> this<00:04:52.640> 18<00:04:53.210> inches<00:04:53.540> or<00:04:53.720> so

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
know maybe like this 18 inches or so

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.290 
know maybe like this 18 inches or so
I've<00:04:54.290> seen<00:04:54.830> these<00:04:55.070> made<00:04:55.370> as<00:04:55.610> long<00:04:55.850> as<00:04:56.030> four

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
I've seen these made as long as four

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.930 
I've seen these made as long as four
feet<00:04:56.570> long<00:04:56.840> on<00:04:57.080> occasion<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.830> would<00:04:58.340> say<00:04:58.610> that

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
feet long on occasion I would say that

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.270 
feet long on occasion I would say that
if<00:04:59.060> you're<00:04:59.180> gonna<00:04:59.360> get<00:04:59.570> that<00:04:59.870> long<00:05:00.280> probably

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
if you're gonna get that long probably

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.480 
if you're gonna get that long probably
more<00:05:01.550> than<00:05:01.730> about<00:05:01.940> maybe<00:05:02.570> 24<00:05:03.290> or<00:05:03.680> 30<00:05:03.980> inches

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
more than about maybe 24 or 30 inches

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.490 
more than about maybe 24 or 30 inches
then<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.360> probably<00:05:05.720> want<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:05.990> switch<00:05:06.230> to<00:05:06.470> a

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
then you probably want to switch to a

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.720 
then you probably want to switch to a
santi<00:05:07.010> rig<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.660> put<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:08.840> cork<00:05:09.230> on<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.830> use

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
santi rig and put that cork on and use

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.850 
santi rig and put that cork on and use
the<00:05:10.910> bottom<00:05:11.270> as<00:05:11.390> a<00:05:11.419> reference<00:05:11.900> point<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.380> go<00:05:12.560> up

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
the bottom as a reference point to go up

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.620 
the bottom as a reference point to go up
and<00:05:13.160> that's<00:05:13.610> probably<00:05:13.880> going<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.210> be<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.390> lot

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
and that's probably going to be a lot

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.659 
and that's probably going to be a lot
