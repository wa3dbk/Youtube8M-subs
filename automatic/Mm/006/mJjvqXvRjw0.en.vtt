kind<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> goes<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.049> show<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.680> could

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
kind of goes to show that this could

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.219 
kind of goes to show that this could
possibly<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.180> real<00:01:24.600> release<00:01:24.840> date<00:01:25.049> because

possibly be a real release date because

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.570 
possibly be a real release date because
that<00:01:25.500> does<00:01:25.740> kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> seem<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.369> something

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
that does kind of seem like something

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.950 
that does kind of seem like something
but<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.850> would<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.180> release<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> game<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
but that would do release a game that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.780 
but that would do release a game that
has<00:01:28.110> something<00:01:28.290> some<00:01:28.860> sort<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.189> significance

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
has something some sort of significance

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.789

obviously i do want to say thank you to
write<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.170> again<00:01:52.320> because<00:01:52.500> most<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.250> them<00:01:53.340> said

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.679 
write it again because most of them said
this<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> comments<00:01:54.210> section<00:01:54.240> down<00:01:54.450> below

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
this in the comments section down below

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.440 
this in the comments section down below
but<00:01:54.960> basically<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:56.250> all<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.909> links<00:01:57.270> in

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
but basically this all kind of links in

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.899 
but basically this all kind of links in
in<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.549> believable<00:01:59.549> because

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
in a way that it's believable because

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
in a way that it's believable because
you<00:02:00.689> know<00:02:00.810> i<00:02:00.990> could<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.380> them<00:02:01.530> doing<00:02:01.680> all

you know i could see them doing all

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.230 
you know i could see them doing all
these<00:02:01.979> things<00:02:02.040> because<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:02.880> release<00:02:03.030> out

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
these things because if they release out

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.520 
these things because if they release out
on<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> friday<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:04.020> honest<00:02:04.229> i'm<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.380> whole

getting it this year and not 2016 but I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.320 
getting it this year and not 2016 but I
mean<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.380> only<00:02:40.500> way<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.770> really<00:02:41.040> know<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.580> this

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
mean the only way to really know is this

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.480

June<00:02:43.230> fourteenth<00:02:43.800> when<00:02:44.100> we<00:02:44.220> get<00:02:44.370> the

June fourteenth when we get the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.830 
June fourteenth when we get the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
livestream basically I think it's like a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.630 
livestream basically I think it's like a
30<00:02:46.050> minute<00:02:46.320> live<00:02:46.500> stream<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:47.010> gameplay<00:02:47.370> and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
30 minute live stream of gameplay and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.160 
30 minute live stream of gameplay and
they're<00:02:48.150> gonna<00:02:48.240> be<00:02:48.330> answering<00:02:48.540> questions<00:02:48.630> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
they're gonna be answering questions and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.440 
they're gonna be answering questions and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
I'm sure that we're probably going to be

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.340 
I'm sure that we're probably going to be
getting<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.690> release<00:02:51.900> date<00:02:52.050> for<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.230> game
