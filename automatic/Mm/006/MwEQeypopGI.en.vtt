this played the goal fast time like

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.519 
this played the goal fast time like
normal<00:00:23.820> speed<00:00:24.090> because<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.350> watch<00:00:25.500> it

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
normal speed because if you watch it

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.170 
normal speed because if you watch it
normal<00:00:26.010> speed<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.340> doesn't<00:00:26.609> even<00:00:26.670> look<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:26.939> I

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
normal speed it doesn't even look like I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.779 
normal speed it doesn't even look like I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
