00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
and but we're ready to go we're going to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.520 
and but we're ready to go we're going to
move<00:02:21.950> on<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.790> our<00:02:22.820> fifth<00:02:23.600> cupcake<00:02:23.990> in<00:02:24.200> our

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
move on to our fifth cupcake in our

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.310 
move on to our fifth cupcake in our
first<00:02:25.070> row<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.460> five<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.060> again<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.170> start

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
first row of five and again just start

all that way we'll know what we're left
with<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.269> extend<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:38.900> out<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.110> little<00:03:39.440> bit

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
with and just extend it out a little bit

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.860 
with and just extend it out a little bit
more<00:03:39.950> than<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:40.730> normally<00:03:40.880> would<00:03:41.150> so<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:41.780> we

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
more than you normally would so that we

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.830 
more than you normally would so that we
have<00:03:42.050> smaller<00:03:42.350> gaps<00:03:42.650> okay<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:43.730> then<00:03:44.360> again

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
have smaller gaps okay and then again

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:56.089 
have smaller gaps okay and then again
our<00:03:45.080> third<00:03:45.530> one

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.599 

okay<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.060> then<00:03:57.719> four<00:03:58.140> we<00:03:58.439> got<00:03:58.620> two<00:03:58.980> left<00:03:59.310> here

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
okay and then four we got two left here

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.610 
okay and then four we got two left here
guys<00:03:59.849> we<00:03:59.879> are<00:04:00.269> almost<00:04:00.480> done<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.260> it's<00:04:01.379> this

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
guys we are almost done and it's this

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.160 
guys we are almost done and it's this
simple<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:02.159> mean<00:04:02.189> really<00:04:04.549> all<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.730> way<00:04:05.819> around

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
simple I mean really all the way around

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.890 
simple I mean really all the way around
to<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.290> edge<00:04:07.469> if<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:07.980> overlap<00:04:08.459> one<00:04:08.900> don't

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
to the edge if you overlap one don't

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.050 
to the edge if you overlap one don't
even<00:04:10.200> worry<00:04:10.379> about<00:04:10.469> it<00:04:10.680> that's<00:04:11.060> perfectly

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
even worry about it that's perfectly

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.949 
even worry about it that's perfectly
fine<00:04:12.359> and<00:04:12.840> that's<00:04:13.439> what<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.799> want<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.069> do<00:04:14.219> just

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
fine and that's what you want to do just

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.080 
fine and that's what you want to do just
to<00:04:15.959> get<00:04:16.139> better<00:04:16.349> coverage<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:17.039> our<00:04:17.310> last<00:04:17.669> ones

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
to get better coverage so our last ones

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.930 
to get better coverage so our last ones
