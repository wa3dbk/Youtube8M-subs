00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.469
 then I ask you first that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.080
 responsibility is to have a team like that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 strong in short with a great expectation like this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.119
 from fans in short if you hear one 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.369
 responsible person I feel no type 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.930
 of liability other than those 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.460
 of last year 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.160
 honestly I felt a lot more 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.869
 responsible when I started this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.940
 profession that I trained boys of 14 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.820
 years and I could be very influential on 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.399
 of them rather than having one 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.100
 personality and a different responsibility 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.750
 in short to send us must remain a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.090
 florence madama 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.220
 has grown over the past six 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.860
 months in the second part of the championship 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.870
 remarkable in my opinion he still has to 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.079
 to complete his journey because of his own 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.149
 luck 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.289
 he is not yet at the peak of his has not 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.629
 expressed his maximum yet 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.390
 potential then I believe a champion 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.880
 prove it over time to be such with 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.580
 the continuity he had only 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.600
 in the last part so I believe that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.729
 what I said also and second 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.340
 me to send us must remain in florence 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.679
 Madame 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.780
 has grown over the past six 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.450
 months in the second part of the championship 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.490
 remarkable in my opinion he still has to 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.650
 to complete his journey because of his own 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.750
 luck 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.890
 he is not yet at the peak of his has not 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.260
 expressed his maximum yet 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.990
 potential then I believe a champion 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.480
 prove it over time to be such with 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.180
 the continuity he had only 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.200
 in the last part so I believe that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.810
 what I said to him also second 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.750
 me and everyone else you have to think about 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.690
 including the player having one 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.160
 team with many good players with 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.200
 some that need to grow 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.820
 the Florentine must do this ours 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.110
 ours is also our ambition 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.940
 possibilities are those also makes you 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.000
 to grow young people who are now 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.440
 behind but the technical aspects I believe that 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.170
 in short, there is little to discover 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.390
 international player 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.400
 just look at the numbers but the numbers don't 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.650
 only not only in the bundesliga 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.870
 but international numbers 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.900
 in short, then in the national champions 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.090
 a very high level first player 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.490
 profile in the aspect to what then more 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.890
 important character 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.290
 he looks like a great guy under each 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.630
 point of view perhaps a little reserved but 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.290
 fully immersed in the mentality in the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.510
 reality that he chose among others is a 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.430
 very large goalkeeper 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.920
 potentiality 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.469
 the question we must ask ourselves together 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.739
 to boy we like me as coach and 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.659
 as a society as he is convinced of 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.739
 possibly facing a situation 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.569
 that probably won't come 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.049
 forgiven nothing if he were to make mistakes 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.709
 a little bit the seeds if it will show if 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:09.609
 prove himself to be able to have the copper 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.219
 force to accept a possible error 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.859
 which I believe that inevitably a 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:17.739
 any keeper arrivals any 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:21.040
 reaction that will have because I can already 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.450
 imagine what if we can say if to the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.189
 minimal uncertainty and therefore will be 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.010
 more important to me more important 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.389
 the psychological aspect considering neto 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.849
 I will have a chance to do it at this time 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.980
 will have a way of talking to him and now 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.579
 he is the goalkeeper of the Florentine of e 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.519
 we are very confident in him but his 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.670
 situation is very simple 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:48.180
 then he was the one 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.630
 I believe he experienced conflicts 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.170
 interior and perhaps even exterior will have 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.630
 made some evaluations but I have not since 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.280
 its part seen her the opening 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.599
 total to continue with us 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.600
 so I believe what you told me 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.390
 him and not what was said of him 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.290
 assures neither to catania we played with 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.750
 bergessio who is a center forward of 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.609
 movement but one of structure therefore I 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.049
 in February I also had that though 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.519
 to try to have maximum from 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.030
 Florentine made the name of mario 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.510
 gomez 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.940
 they satisfied me, I stayed a while 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.620
 incredulous maybe a little all and thanks 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.500
 to the skill of our leaders is 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.680
 the maximum I could get 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.680
 suck
