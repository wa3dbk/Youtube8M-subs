00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.930
 i 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.989
 Y 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.830
 and one I paint thousands a restaurant of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.950
 Mexican cuisine and then what we think 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.830
 is reflect a bit what is the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.110
 Mexican in 2013 is a person who 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.630
 Take care that you are interested not only in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.640
 how to eat but where does it come from 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.119
 eat and then in a little more way 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.119
 integral 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.740
 we try to have a language 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.220
 own a personal ideology 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.720
 at the end of the day you learn the best in a 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.570
 book even if they do not tell you 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.810
 do it well do it clean 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.190
 do it the first to have dedication 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.290
 behave as if you were the best to 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.960
 can not get at least the best 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.640
 can be very close to being it is not 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.460
 nothing more than a new staff but of 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.080
 Give your customers satisfaction 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.270
 as I tell you the main philosophy that 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.190
 we have is to offer a good 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.989
 service and that the service is warm 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.550
 friendly and that the food is good if 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:19.390
 we comply with new parameters because 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:21.709
 we are doing our job well and 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.200
 the passion for what cuisine is 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.820
 mexicana and the passion for detail and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.760
 by doing things right and your country 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.680
 I do not think it's nothing more than a topic of a 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.959
 personal challenge or doing it for yourself 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.340
 but we all go together as 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.080
 country is something that was always what 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.180
 learned and carve the mind in addition to 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.540
 expressed a person 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.480
 Well now they are our best friends and 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.909
 to date he continues to support us and it is not 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:03:03.920
 someone that we have as very inside the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:03:06.139
 heart is that established when 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.099
 We decided to put the name of food 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:13.310
 run we want in Mexico not me 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.040
 I think a lot of people go to the kitchens 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.909
 economical and ask for your run food 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.560
 then it was logical for us to call 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.739
 to our food tasting menu 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.760
 run then it is composed of six 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:32.230
 dishes we have 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.560
 there are three entrances two main dishes 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.090
 dessert and fasting also courtesies them 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.720
 We give all customers when they come 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.170
 to quintón and slow at the end the menu is 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.170
 composed of nine dishes 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.170
 s 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.950
 and we also try a lot of 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.739
 support local producers we try to 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.760
 support small producers that are 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:04.720
 making the best cheese in Querétaro 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.799
 done not our whole cheese board is 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:13.060
 of Querétaro cheeses and one of the 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.950
 cheeses is world champion is not 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.479
 incredible and already mexico starts to 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.639
 position and that starts doing 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.289
 very good quality products there 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.330
 to give them to know the whole world 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.260
 so if we try hard to support 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.180
 small producers and then give them the 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:35.380
 hand to sell their products that the 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:37.120
 people know them is output 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.630
 ingredients but above all quality 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.419
 of people I think there's a whole 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.120
 movement of cooks and people who 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.460
 He cares about doing things well 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.050
 professionals personally we are in 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.599
 the search for another 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.759
 good experiences I think it's very 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.770
 important that there are people who want it 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.470
 make her willing to wear the 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.919
 overalls and do the job to feel 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.449
 professionals and that is the people that we 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.400
 come the restaurants as well 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:11.139
 come with a project of a mind 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:14.740
 wide and without and without prejudice or yes or yes 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.050
 it is not as it is always said to understand 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:26.979
 who will eat like in Spain or 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:28.750
 France because it is in Mexico and if 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.940
 you have a restaurant that pretends 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.280
 receive clients and mimes and dismiss 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.169
 friends and that is our philosophy to 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.990
 end of the day that people feel 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.819
 comfortable that you enjoy your meal and well that 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.440
 have a good time they 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.440
 hope that we wait for your house
