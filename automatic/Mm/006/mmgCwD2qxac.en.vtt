00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 deprive him of his luster 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.570
 paint technicians re-inspect the r8 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.059
 this time under the back light of a fluorescent battery we look for 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.669
 any muscle particle or eighths 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.019
 is a very relevant fact meticulous in order to achieve a result 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.890
 positive 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.830
 painting is the first line of defense against the elements and protects 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.380
 the body of corrosion 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.829
 but a high quality paint job has its price 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.280
 audi there is a dumping 360 million euros in this painting workshop 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.850
 The professor of painting also represents one of the greatest consumptions of 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.660
 Factory energy 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.370
 the use of fully automated robots conveyor systems and 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.750
 Four huge drying ovens consumes 70% of the factory's energy 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.890
 As part of its global strategy, the company is undertaking large 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.890
 measures to reduce energy expenditure 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.710
 alternative heat exchangers recover the heat from the valves of 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.530
 Exhaust the paint dryer and mix it with the cooler outside air 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.810
 in this way it can be used to heat the plant in winter 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.170
 heat it low temperature dryers 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.799
 the environmental benefit is significant 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.819
 the operation of heat recovery systems reduces itself 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.560
 alone the emission of 7 thousand tons of greenhouse gases per year 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.020
 the equivalent energy that is needed to heat more than three thousand homes 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.650
 after four days of careful cleaning and have worn the r8 presents its 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.650
 dazzling and impeccable appearance 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.490
 0 is not ready to go on the road yet 14 stages await 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 assembly in a prone process brought me to the second 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.390
 the audi r8 still has two days to complete 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.470
 from here it passes to the last assembly hangar 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 There are 14 stations on the R8 assembly line 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.009
 Each construction phase consists of a series of tasks that must be carried out in 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.369
 the space of 30 minutes 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:17.330
 despite the rigid control of time there is hardly a robot in sight 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
 all the assembly is done by hand 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.240
 when the car entered the assembly line 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.620
 the body of the body rests on adjustable frames in height of that 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.210
 workers can access any part of the car they need 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.840
 When the R8 starts its journey on the assembly line the technicians retire 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.840
 the doors to easily access the interior 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.769
 a personalized book always travels next to the vehicle, the book is unique 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.449
 for each model since it details the express requests of the 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.449
 client 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.309
 in station one the team extends an endless freeway of cables through 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.219
 all the car 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.999
 these cables will serve to transport energy all systems 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:13.239
 electronic engine hydraulic steering speakers and instrument panel 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.589
 the cables will also serve to activate the distinctive set of headlights 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:21.849
 rebuff 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.660
 we are talking in a way the car face photo percent front 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.659
 of consensus with the face well the lights would be the eyes 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.999
 The Audi R8 is the first car in the world that has LED technology in all 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:38.780
 its lights 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.780
 headlights turn signal lights 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.369
 LEDs consume a quarter of energy compared to 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:47.709
 conventional lamps 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.139
 for the company they also serve as a way to attract all eyes 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.790
 now our idea of ​​conceiving a solution is that they served to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.199
 identify two of them unmistakably and we wanted that 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.439
 concept apply that point during the day as during the night inn and this 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.439
 it is a fantastic possibility 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.409
 my daughter the body square of station two where the 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.529
 power steering system 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.739
 so much 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.060
 the brake and clutch pedals and i the cooling tubes 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:29.919
 two 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.400
 from station 3 the technicians incorporated into the deposit 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.770
 90 liter capacity fuel 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.950
 with a consumption of 12 as 5 liters at 100 km 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.120
 its consumption per kilometer is lower than that of most sports cars 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.069
 in mass production the usual duration of a station of 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.280
 assembly is only two minutes the assembly time for the r8 is fifteen 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.819
 times higher 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.020
 the longer the work sequence the more complex the series is 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.020
 of tasks to be performed by technicians 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.210
 Each station requires the placement of 50 components in its order specified 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.210
 they need two and up to 12 different tools 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.870
 Only the most experienced audi operators are trained to 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.169
 build the r8 the series that is a task so be that girl 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.280
 I saw much encouragement to ride in the car with due precision anxiety 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.940
 that's why we have operators that in many of the cases 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.580
 They have 20 or 30 years of experience in the assembly of automobiles 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.780
 believe it or not more than half of the operators of the R8 exceeded 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.330
 The 40-year-old the easiest way to recognize an R8 fitter is 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.139
 see if he has gray hair in the factory is unknown how the 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.800
 silver the inertia is to say the gray-haired schaaf 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.870
 and to you nor 40th anniversary the company mexico january experience 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.009
 It is very important when remembering the order and peace of each of the 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.340
 components so the operator knows with certainty what pieces efe 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.379
 first the second a third and so on 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.800
 in the next phase of lalín and the team adds the interior elements 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.699
 that give the vehicle the appearance of a racing car the panel of 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.699
 instruments and the speedometer 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.599
 With the more than five thousand pieces that an R8 incorporates there is always the 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.919
 possibility of making some mistake however audi has developed a 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.059
 efficient system that helps maintain concentration 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:28.759
 the operators never have to look for the pieces are the tools 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.029
 corresponding in each case and this is so because this task falls on hands 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:37.149
 of buyers at each station a buyer went to what audi called the 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:41.110
 supermarket are a series of shelf on funds placed outside the 

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:44.899
 Assembly line carry a shopping list based on the assembly sheet 

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:48.729
 specific to each station and contains necessary parts for each car 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.599
 the whole environment of the operators 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.400
 is organized so that they have at hand all the pieces and tools of the 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:59.689
 as efficiently as possible and I can thus concentrate exclusively on 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.830
 his work 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.710
 after going through five stations only one third of the assembly was 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.860
 has made the next point the body of the r8 finally receives its 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.860
 engine 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.730
 the assembly process of the r8 is still eight hours away from its 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:21.389
 conclusion 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.999
 Once the engine has been subjected to the relevant tests it is prepared 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.149
 to be installed on the body 

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:31.209
 in a line of its assembly the technicians in sandoná transmission with the 

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:34.209
 engine 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.490
 then they are still in fuel tubes 

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:42.339
 straps 

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:43.330
 cables 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
 and thermal shields 

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:54.880
 then a wiring harness and be the 257 kilogram engine 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.720
 the witnesses to the great moment in which the engine 0
