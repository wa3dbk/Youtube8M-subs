00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 that the person thinks that the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.080
 Ceviche juice is only lemon and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.320
 When they prepare it at home, it comes out very 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.230
 acid but like the one that carries onion the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.210
 pica and onion previously in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 juliana and we put it in cold water 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.560
 so what do we do about the amount of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.130
 lemon juice that we have we add 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.609
 water and that lowers the acidity then 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.609
 it does not go wrong 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.329
 the juice of the remote of the purple onion 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.870
 well that's how we arrived we already have almost 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.789
 ready is ready we do it no longer the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.850
 we put yes but first let's put 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.740
 our little dish to be able to 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:01.570
 turn over the signature and firmer better 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.570
 with that 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.840
 the drums that he loves the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.299
 It's a bit of favor 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.260
 A little, yes 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.540
 marriage 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.100
 once in Peru on March 8, 1997 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:11.440
 and on March 8 , 2002, we 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:23.620
 we got married here in santiago because it was a 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:26.650
 symbolic ceremony but we will 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.390
 I promised to marry here already with his family and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.660
 a whole party and then we did two 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.660
 marriages 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:46.210
 and we will know a little onion 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.040
 the aphrodisiac this forgive the question 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.040
 of if we raise 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:03.129
 very useful garlic I follow so 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.890
 for all those at home now that 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.799
 comes we are already entering the spring 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.840
 really because the little plates come 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.159
 the freshest begins the solcito the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:20.760
 warmth today is going to be one more day 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:24.420
 hot day 27 you can get a rich 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.420
 this is also light 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.790
 it's like it's a cold salad 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.790
 it serves 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.840
 but those things 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:09.580
 in this framework if I wanted to ask you something 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.959
 when it is not well considered 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.350
 the bell
