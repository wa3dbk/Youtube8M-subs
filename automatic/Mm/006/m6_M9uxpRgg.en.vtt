today<00:00:01.170> welcome<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.650> tech<00:00:01.829> math<00:00:02.040> Channel

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
today welcome to the tech math Channel

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.160 
today welcome to the tech math Channel
let<00:00:03.030> me<00:00:03.120> have<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.270> look<00:00:03.449> at<00:00:03.600> in<00:00:03.689> this<00:00:03.780> video<00:00:03.959> is

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
let me have a look at in this video is

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.579 
let me have a look at in this video is
how<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.529> divide<00:00:05.130> thirds<00:00:05.609> now<00:00:06.170> certain<00:00:07.170> numbers

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
how to divide thirds now certain numbers

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.799 
how to divide thirds now certain numbers
which<00:00:07.830> can<00:00:07.859> be<00:00:08.130> expressed<00:00:08.700> basically<00:00:09.389> only

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
which can be expressed basically only

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.459 
which can be expressed basically only
exactly<00:00:10.740> as<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.429> roots<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.509> root<00:00:12.809> sign<00:00:13.110> so

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
exactly as a roots with the root sign so

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.860 
exactly as a roots with the root sign so
they're<00:00:14.400> rational<00:00:14.700> numbers<00:00:15.240> an<00:00:15.360> example<00:00:15.780> this

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
they're rational numbers an example this

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.279 
they're rational numbers an example this
might<00:00:16.109> be<00:00:16.230> say<00:00:16.609> the<00:00:17.609> square<00:00:17.970> root<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.359> 2<00:00:18.630> now

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
might be say the square root of 2 now

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.390 
might be say the square root of 2 now
look<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.740> wear<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
look you can wear this in on a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.890 
look you can wear this in on a
calculator<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.240> can<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> answer

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
calculator and you can get the answer

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.450 
calculator and you can get the answer
it's<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.340> 1.4142<00:00:23.340> 1<00:00:24.330> 3<00:00:24.600> 6<00:00:24.859> even<00:00:25.859> maybe<00:00:26.039> even<00:00:26.160> some

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
it's a 1.4142 1 3 6 even maybe even some

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.670 
it's a 1.4142 1 3 6 even maybe even some
more<00:00:26.609> numbers<00:00:26.939> depending<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.420> how<00:00:27.599> many

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
more numbers depending on how many

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.410 
more numbers depending on how many
numbers<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.710> calculated<00:00:29.340> spread<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.760> but

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
numbers you calculated spread out but

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.200 
numbers you calculated spread out but
these<00:00:31.009> decimals<00:00:32.009> would<00:00:32.309> never<00:00:32.610> hit<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.880> stage

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
these decimals would never hit a stage

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.880 
these decimals would never hit a stage
with<00:00:33.480> our<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:33.899> become<00:00:34.200> recurring<00:00:34.800> or

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
with our actually become recurring or

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.500 
with our actually become recurring or
they<00:00:35.100> were<00:00:35.190> never<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:35.579> terminate<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
they were never actually terminate so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.680 
they were never actually terminate so
this<00:00:37.020> number<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.590> expressed<00:00:38.430> most<00:00:38.670> exactly<00:00:39.390> as

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
this number is expressed most exactly as

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.600 
this number is expressed most exactly as
a<00:00:39.719> third<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.890> we've<00:00:41.010> been<00:00:41.160> looking<00:00:41.399> at<00:00:41.430> how<00:00:41.489> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
a third and we've been looking at how to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.450 
a third and we've been looking at how to
divide<00:00:41.910> these<00:00:42.320> looking<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.440> first<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> on

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
divide these looking at first off and on

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.279 
divide these looking at first off and on
surd<00:00:44.910> particular<00:00:45.870> non<00:00:46.110> certain<00:00:48.289> examples

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
surd particular non certain examples

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
surd particular non certain examples
because<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.789> easily<00:00:51.149> show

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
because this is actually can easily show

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720 
because this is actually can easily show
us<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.960> rule<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.379> would<00:00:52.500> usually<00:00:52.739> are<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.280> think

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
us the rule we would usually are I think

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
us the rule we would usually are I think
Putin<00:00:53.879> gets<00:00:54.180> wrong<00:00:54.449> boxers<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.440> that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
Putin gets wrong boxers because of that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.400 
Putin gets wrong boxers because of that
uncertainty<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.489> them<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.270> an<00:00:57.690> example<00:00:58.230> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
uncertainty with them so an example of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.369 
uncertainty with them so an example of
say<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:59.160> question<00:00:59.910> without<00:01:00.239> using<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> third<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
say a question without using a third so

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.490 
say a question without using a third so
did<00:01:01.620> say<00:01:01.829> something<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.930> square<00:01:04.110> root

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
did say something like the square root

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
did say something like the square root
of<00:01:06.770> 36<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:09.350> we<00:01:10.350> divided<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.920> by<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.820> square

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
of 36 and we divided this by the square

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.140 
of 36 and we divided this by the square
root<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.770> 9<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:14.100> both<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.490> these<00:01:14.610> numbers

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
root of 9 there both of these numbers

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.109 
root of 9 there both of these numbers
are<00:01:15.360> not<00:01:15.950> Serge<00:01:16.950> because<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.640> square<00:01:17.820> root<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
are not Serge because the square root of

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.429 
are not Serge because the square root of
36<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.960> 6<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> square<00:01:20.460> root<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.820> 9<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.900> 3<00:01:21.960> so

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
36 is 6 and the square root of 9 is 3 so

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.060 
36 is 6 and the square root of 9 is 3 so
6<00:01:22.590> divided<00:01:23.159> by<00:01:23.280> 3<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> working<00:01:25.259> equals<00:01:25.650> 2

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
6 divided by 3 of the working equals 2

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.600 
6 divided by 3 of the working equals 2
so<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:28.020> square<00:01:28.290> root<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.470> 36<00:01:28.799> divided<00:01:29.460> by<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so the square root of 36 divided by the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
so the square root of 36 divided by the
square<00:01:29.939> root<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.119> 9<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.689> actually<00:01:30.900> equal<00:01:31.470> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
square root of 9 is actually equal to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.359 
square root of 9 is actually equal to
the<00:01:32.310> square<00:01:32.640> root<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:33.650> 1<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> square<00:01:34.920> root<00:01:35.189> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the square root of 1 the square root of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.590 
the square root of 1 the square root of
what<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> answer<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:36.150> gives<00:01:36.360> us<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
what the answer which gives us the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.160 
what the answer which gives us the
square<00:01:36.720> root<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.049> 2

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
square root of 2

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.290 
square root of 2
it's<00:01:39.860> for<00:01:40.130> yeah<00:01:40.520> well<00:01:40.700> they're<00:01:40.880> ads<00:01:41.060> that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
it's for yeah well they're ads that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.120 
it's for yeah well they're ads that
gives<00:01:41.450> us<00:01:41.570> two<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.140> square<00:01:42.410> root<00:01:42.440> of<00:01:42.620> four<00:01:42.860> so

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
gives us two is a square root of four so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.250 
gives us two is a square root of four so
30<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.940> square<00:01:44.210> root<00:01:44.300> of<00:01:44.330> 36<00:01:44.630> divided<00:01:45.200> by

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
30 is the square root of 36 divided by

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.780 
30 is the square root of 36 divided by
the<00:01:45.350> square<00:01:45.650> root<00:01:45.680> of<00:01:45.860> 9<00:01:46.010> equals<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.640> square

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
the square root of 9 equals the square

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.780 
the square root of 9 equals the square

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
root of 4 6 2 over 3 equals 2 I hope you

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.730 
root of 4 6 2 over 3 equals 2 I hope you
can<00:01:49.880> see<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.090> okay<00:01:50.450> but<00:01:50.510> wait<00:01:50.750> Eunice<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:51.170> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
can see that okay but wait Eunice is the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.440 
can see that okay but wait Eunice is the
square<00:01:52.070> root<00:01:52.190> of<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.430> number<00:01:52.490> divided<00:01:53.360> by

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
square root of this number divided by

square root of this number divided by
this<00:01:53.570> number<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.140> 36<00:01:54.590> divided<00:01:54.920> by<00:01:54.950> 9<00:01:55.660> equals<00:01:56.660> 4

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
this number so 36 divided by 9 equals 4

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.310 
this number so 36 divided by 9 equals 4
itself<00:01:57.260> so<00:01:57.470> we<00:01:57.560> can<00:01:57.740> rule<00:01:58.550> with<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:59.320> okay

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
itself so we can rule with this okay

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.780 
itself so we can rule with this okay
which<00:02:00.560> is<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:02.450> square<00:02:02.750> root<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.670> 4<00:02:04.670> this

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
which is this the square root of 4 this

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.919 
which is this the square root of 4 this
particular<00:02:05.060> example<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:06.760> divided<00:02:07.760> by<00:02:07.940> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
particular example I divided by the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.600 
particular example I divided by the
square<00:02:09.259> root<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.800> B<00:02:10.690> equals<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:13.160> square<00:02:13.400> root

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
square root of B equals the square root

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.490 
square root of B equals the square root
of<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:15.760> divided<00:02:16.760> by<00:02:16.940> buddy<00:02:17.330> how<00:02:18.110> do<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.290> see

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
of a divided by buddy how do you see

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.530 
of a divided by buddy how do you see
this<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.370> square<00:02:19.670> root<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:19.910> this<00:02:20.030> divided<00:02:20.450> by

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
this the square root of this divided by

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.120 
this the square root of this divided by
the<00:02:20.630> square<00:02:20.930> root<00:02:20.959> of<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.200> actually<00:02:21.890> equals

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
the square root of this actually equals

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.760 
the square root of this actually equals
the<00:02:22.190> square<00:02:22.340> root<00:02:22.520> of<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:22.850> divided<00:02:23.300> by<00:02:23.420> this

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
the square root of this divided by this

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.880 
the square root of this divided by this
okay<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:26.150> we've<00:02:26.239> got<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.360> particular<00:02:27.020> rule<00:02:27.560> here

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
okay so we've got a particular rule here

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.610 
okay so we've got a particular rule here
that<00:02:28.130> we<00:02:28.670> can<00:02:28.850> use<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:30.310> let's<00:02:31.310> use<00:02:31.610> it

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.390 

rewrite<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.769> again<00:02:35.969> yeah<00:02:36.969> so<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:39.069> square<00:02:39.370> root

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
rewrite it again yeah so the square root

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.670 
rewrite it again yeah so the square root
of<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:40.709> divided<00:02:41.709> by<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.950> square<00:02:42.340> root<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.609> B

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
of a divided by the square root of B

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.990 
of a divided by the square root of B
equals<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.950> square<00:02:45.340> root<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.969> a<00:02:46.409> divided<00:02:47.409> by<00:02:47.560> B

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
equals the square root of a divided by B

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.140 
equals the square root of a divided by B
so<00:02:49.000> an<00:02:49.329> example<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.079> could<00:02:50.439> be<00:02:50.500> as<00:02:51.150> follows

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
so an example this could be as follows

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.440 
so an example this could be as follows
so<00:02:52.540> we<00:02:52.659> did<00:02:52.810> say<00:02:52.989> something<00:02:53.409> like<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:55.239> square

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
so we did say something like the square

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:04.759 
so we did say something like the square
root<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:58.409> 21<00:03:00.450> divided<00:03:01.450> by<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:02.349> square<00:03:02.739> root<00:03:03.040> of

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
root of 21 divided by the square root of

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.099 
root of 21 divided by the square root of
seven<00:03:05.819> okay<00:03:06.819> something<00:03:07.239> nice<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.659> easy<00:03:07.810> and

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
seven okay something nice and easy and

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.679 
seven okay something nice and easy and
the<00:03:08.650> answer<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.129> would<00:03:09.340> be<00:03:09.370> because<00:03:09.939> we

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
the answer to this would be because we

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.149 
the answer to this would be because we
actually<00:03:10.870> substituted<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.739> in<00:03:11.920> there<00:03:12.069> would

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
actually substituted this in there would

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.379 
actually substituted this in there would
be<00:03:12.189> the<00:03:12.400> square<00:03:12.700> root<00:03:12.879> of<00:03:13.290> 21<00:03:14.290> divided<00:03:15.040> by<00:03:15.069> 7

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
be the square root of 21 divided by 7

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.360 
be the square root of 21 divided by 7
which<00:03:16.389> would<00:03:16.510> be<00:03:16.569> equal<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.980> square<00:03:18.159> root

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
which would be equal to the square root

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.740 
which would be equal to the square root
of<00:03:18.879> 3<00:03:20.340> ok<00:03:21.340> that's<00:03:21.609> how<00:03:21.700> we<00:03:21.819> divide<00:03:22.150> surd<00:03:22.510> it's

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
of 3 ok that's how we divide surd it's

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.699 
of 3 ok that's how we divide surd it's
fairly<00:03:23.049> simple<00:03:23.409> yet<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.780> only<00:03:26.379> type<00:03:26.680> of

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
fairly simple yet the only type of

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.140 
fairly simple yet the only type of
example<00:03:27.189> that<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.340> might<00:03:27.489> see<00:03:27.760> if<00:03:28.000> you're

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
example that you might see if you're

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.490 
example that you might see if you're
getting<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.540> type<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.930> question<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.290> know

getting this type of question you know

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.470 
getting this type of question you know
especially<00:03:29.829> I<00:03:30.519> know<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.060> lot<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.239> us<00:03:31.329> will

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
especially I know that a lot of us will

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.940 
especially I know that a lot of us will
be<00:03:31.569> in<00:03:31.599> maths<00:03:31.840> books<00:03:32.109> I'll<00:03:32.680> give<00:03:32.799> you<00:03:32.889> an

be in maths books I'll give you an

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.619 
be in maths books I'll give you an
example<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.579> also<00:03:33.760> might<00:03:34.120> get<00:03:34.329> with<00:03:34.480> these

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
example you also might get with these

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.080 
example you also might get with these
you<00:03:35.349> might<00:03:35.500> get<00:03:35.680> say<00:03:35.859> some<00:03:36.129> examples<00:03:37.000> that

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
you might get say some examples that

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.089 
you might get say some examples that
look<00:03:37.299> like<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:37.780> well<00:03:38.470> they<00:03:38.650> like<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:38.979> do

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
look like this well they like to do

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.629 
look like this well they like to do
things<00:03:39.430> like<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:41.470> might<00:03:41.709> get<00:03:41.889> it<00:03:42.010> written<00:03:42.489> as

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
things like you might get it written as

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.039 
things like you might get it written as
a<00:03:42.669> fraction<00:03:42.879> where<00:03:43.299> you<00:03:43.389> say<00:03:43.599> get<00:03:43.870> say

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
a fraction where you say get say

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.790 
a fraction where you say get say
something<00:03:44.440> like

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
something like

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.550 
something like
what<00:03:46.430> about<00:03:46.520> we<00:03:46.670> do<00:03:46.820> 20<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:49.190> square<00:03:49.550> root<00:03:49.820> of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
what about we do 20 the square root of

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:00.720 
what about we do 20 the square root of
30<00:03:52.390> divided<00:03:53.390> by<00:03:54.610> 5<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:58.190> square<00:03:58.550> root<00:03:58.820> of<00:03:59.060> 5

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
30 divided by 5 the square root of 5

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.130 
30 divided by 5 the square root of 5
ok<00:04:01.730> now<00:04:01.910> what<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.330> answer<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.750> this<00:04:02.870> the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
ok now what is the answer to this the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.110 
ok now what is the answer to this the
other<00:04:03.320> way<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.560> we<00:04:03.860> do<00:04:04.070> this<00:04:04.280> is<00:04:04.730> as<00:04:05.090> follows

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
other way that we do this is as follows

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.690 
other way that we do this is as follows
so<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.020> means<00:04:06.260> this<00:04:06.530> amount<00:04:06.920> divided

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
so this just means this amount divided

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.630 
so this just means this amount divided
by<00:04:08.000> this<00:04:08.510> amount<00:04:08.960> so<00:04:09.290> first<00:04:10.250> off<00:04:10.400> what<00:04:10.550> we

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
by this amount so first off what we

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.190 
by this amount so first off what we
actually<00:04:10.790> do<00:04:11.060> is<00:04:11.180> we<00:04:11.210> just<00:04:11.510> divide<00:04:11.840> these

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
actually do is we just divide these

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.410 
actually do is we just divide these
normal<00:04:12.680> numbers<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.010> minute<00:04:13.340> so<00:04:13.580> we<00:04:14.300> could

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
normal numbers a minute so we could

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.260 
normal numbers a minute so we could
actually<00:04:14.540> get<00:04:14.840> this<00:04:15.050> as<00:04:16.630> 20<00:04:17.770> divided<00:04:18.770> by<00:04:18.799> 5

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
actually get this as 20 divided by 5

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:25.400 
actually get this as 20 divided by 5
okay<00:04:20.270> so<00:04:20.330> it's<00:04:20.660> what<00:04:20.840> do<00:04:20.930> you<00:04:21.020> divided<00:04:21.799> by<00:04:21.890> 5

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.100 

and<00:04:25.980> this<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.880> actually<00:04:27.180> gonna<00:04:27.240> be<00:04:27.360> time<00:04:27.720> spy

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
and this is actually gonna be time spy

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.600 
and this is actually gonna be time spy
cuz<00:04:28.350> we're<00:04:28.500> just<00:04:28.620> times<00:04:28.890> he<00:04:29.040> won<00:04:29.220> some<00:04:29.430> out

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
cuz we're just times he won some out

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:37.640 
cuz we're just times he won some out
here<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.920> square<00:04:32.310> root<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:33.980> 30<00:04:34.980> over<00:04:35.970> 5<00:04:36.650> okay

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
here the square root of 30 over 5 okay

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.940 
here the square root of 30 over 5 okay
so<00:04:38.580> 20<00:04:39.240> divided<00:04:39.540> by<00:04:39.690> 5<00:04:39.990> okay<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:40.530> we<00:04:40.740> could<00:04:40.860> have

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
so 20 divided by 5 okay so we could have

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.530 
so 20 divided by 5 okay so we could have
just<00:04:41.100> done<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.370> before<00:04:41.490> 20<00:04:41.940> divided<00:04:42.240> by<00:04:42.270> 5

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
just done it before 20 divided by 5

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.920 
just done it before 20 divided by 5
equals<00:04:42.600> 4<00:04:43.170> and<00:04:43.820> we<00:04:44.820> got<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.060> square<00:04:45.390> root<00:04:45.660> of

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
equals 4 and we got the square root of

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.770 
equals 4 and we got the square root of
the<00:04:46.170> 30<00:04:46.490> divided<00:04:47.490> by<00:04:47.520> 5<00:04:47.640> so<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.180> square<00:04:48.510> root

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
the 30 divided by 5 so the square root

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.750 
the 30 divided by 5 so the square root
of<00:04:49.310> 6<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.690> that's<00:04:51.690> our<00:04:51.960> answer

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
of 6 and that's our answer

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.690 
of 6 and that's our answer
okay<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:54.180> hopefully<00:04:54.540> that's<00:04:54.720> some<00:04:54.900> help<00:04:55.110> there

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
okay so hopefully that's some help there

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.220 
okay so hopefully that's some help there
maybe<00:04:56.700> I'll<00:04:56.910> just<00:04:57.030> go<00:04:57.180> through<00:04:57.390> one<00:04:57.930> last

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
maybe I'll just go through one last

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.440 
maybe I'll just go through one last
example<00:04:58.470> just<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.460> see<00:04:59.670> how<00:04:59.880> you<00:04:59.940> go<00:05:00.240> with

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
example just to see how you go with

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.270 
example just to see how you go with
these<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:01.350> can<00:05:01.410> lot<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.800> people<00:05:02.070> feel

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
these you can lot of people feel

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.740 
these you can lot of people feel
uncomfortable<00:05:02.910> with<00:05:03.030> sides<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.480> lot<00:05:03.570> of<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
uncomfortable with sides a lot of the

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.500 
uncomfortable with sides a lot of the
time<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.290> we'll<00:05:05.040> go<00:05:05.190> through<00:05:05.220> just<00:05:05.820> one<00:05:06.210> more

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
time so we'll go through just one more

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.800 
time so we'll go through just one more
example<00:05:07.260> of<00:05:07.560> things<00:05:08.060> so<00:05:09.060> say<00:05:09.270> we<00:05:09.390> do<00:05:09.540> something

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
example of things so say we do something

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:18.880 
example of things so say we do something
like<00:05:11.690> let's<00:05:12.690> go<00:05:12.900> 9<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.300> square<00:05:15.450> root<00:05:15.900> of

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.160 

25

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
25

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.140 
25
divided<00:05:22.170> by

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.130 

three<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.620> square<00:05:27.040> root<00:05:27.370> of<00:05:27.610> they<00:05:28.570> gets<00:05:28.960> them

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
three the square root of they gets them

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.260 
three the square root of they gets them
to<00:05:29.230> do<00:05:29.350> it<00:05:29.470> five<00:05:29.740> yeah<00:05:30.130> so<00:05:30.790> how<00:05:30.940> do<00:05:31.000> we<00:05:31.120> work

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
to do it five yeah so how do we work

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.990 
to do it five yeah so how do we work
this<00:05:31.330> out<00:05:32.160> so<00:05:33.160> 9<00:05:33.370> divided<00:05:33.760> by<00:05:33.880> 3<00:05:34.000> is<00:05:34.780> 3<00:05:36.000> and

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
this out so 9 divided by 3 is 3 and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.360 
this out so 9 divided by 3 is 3 and
we're<00:05:37.120> gonna<00:05:37.210> get<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.450> square<00:05:37.750> root<00:05:38.020> of<00:05:38.370> 25

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
we're gonna get the square root of 25

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.700 
we're gonna get the square root of 25
divided<00:05:39.910> by<00:05:39.940> 5<00:05:40.300> which<00:05:40.680> is<00:05:41.680> 5<00:05:43.290> okay<00:05:44.290> so

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
divided by 5 which is 5 okay so

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.050 
divided by 5 which is 5 okay so
hopefully<00:05:45.010> you<00:05:45.310> feel<00:05:45.490> pretty<00:05:45.670> good<00:05:45.820> with

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
hopefully you feel pretty good with

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.420 
hopefully you feel pretty good with
these<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.830> in<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.920> next<00:05:48.130> couple<00:05:48.310> of<00:05:48.340> videos

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
these and in the next couple of videos

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.610 
these and in the next couple of videos
are<00:05:48.760> gonna<00:05:48.850> be<00:05:49.000> actually<00:05:49.120> looking<00:05:49.630> at<00:05:49.930> then

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
are gonna be actually looking at then

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.740 
are gonna be actually looking at then
going<00:05:50.920> through<00:05:50.950> adding<00:05:51.610> subtracting<00:05:51.790> surd's

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
going through adding subtracting surd's

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.600 
going through adding subtracting surd's
and<00:05:53.020> it<00:05:53.260> might<00:05:53.410> be<00:05:53.530> simplified<00:05:54.130> Thirds<00:05:54.460> a

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
and it might be simplified Thirds a

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.300 
and it might be simplified Thirds a
little<00:05:54.880> bit<00:05:55.030> and<00:05:55.920> hopefully<00:05:56.920> you'll<00:05:57.190> be

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
little bit and hopefully you'll be

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.010 
little bit and hopefully you'll be
around<00:05:57.520> for<00:05:57.670> those<00:05:57.880> so<00:05:58.390> see<00:05:58.600> you<00:05:58.660> next<00:05:58.870> time

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
around for those so see you next time

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.770 
around for those so see you next time
thank<00:05:59.410> you<00:05:59.470> bye
