00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.009
 little tips and especially their tips 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.490
 to correct our faults and forget about our 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.369
 complex 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.859
 we identified three complexes the three 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.769
 big French complex that's at 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.260
 say the little chest the waves a little 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.029
 too wide and too far shoulders 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.619
 gold delphine is what you can we 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.510
 remember the little tips there for the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.669
 the small breast then some 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.530
 little shopping tips precisely so 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.960
 first worn a maximum of v-neck 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.899
 to make a maximum of the cost 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.370
 dresses water tunics form in 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.649
 worse, that is, pinching under the chest 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 range of the sleeve three quarters and for 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.370
 those who have wide hips to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.649
 time the hips wide so we go 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 have too much volume down and not enough 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.770
 at the top, ie at the level of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.570
 shoulders at the shoulders one goes 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.870
 wear mainly shoulder pads 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.120
 to melt the hips of the shapes 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.129
 empire also that is to say blurred a 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.320
 maximum and hips and of course wear 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.600
 heels to refine the silhouette 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.760
 is me then I do not know if it's true 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 but I feel like I have 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.020
 shoulders a little bit too much 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.060
 square and suddenly it does not 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.909
 female sat is what a minister at 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.680
 my presence then justin to soften the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.360
 line the line time and therefore 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.159
 horizontal we will go on the pose 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.530
 ie the vertical so there too 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.030
 v-necks 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 we avoid the paul is we will avoid 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.369
 add volume here and there is also 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.170
 the accessory who who has a role to 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.790
 play for example at the spit 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.229
 it is worn a little bit too much 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.110
 outside it would have needed the door and a 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.820
 maximum on the inside so refocused and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.740
 put the focus on the inside for 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.020
 forget about the outdoors 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.020
 that is to say the shoulders it stank so 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.890
 large chokers or parade with 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.090
 big buttons in the center brief 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.860
 divert attention the look of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.659
 outside to add a maximum 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.509
 inward and therefore attract the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.340
 look towards these qualities rather than his 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.140
 flaws so to conclude justin on 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.790
 can all have his own look and the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.600
 lure as long as we know its morphology 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.500
 silhouette 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.030
 that is its assets 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.740
 German his little faults the good 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.350
 news of the day so we can 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.950
 to be everything hot when you know 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.950
 valorize
