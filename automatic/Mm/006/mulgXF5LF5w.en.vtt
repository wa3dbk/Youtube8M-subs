drops<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.570> as<00:00:48.719> opposed<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> runescape

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
drops on here as opposed to runescape

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.100 
drops on here as opposed to runescape
are<00:00:50.129> actually<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.360> more<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.930> lower

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
are actually a little more for the lower

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.180 
are actually a little more for the lower
levels<00:00:52.500> i<00:00:52.649> don't<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.829> about<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> higher

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
levels i don't know about the higher

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.380 
levels i don't know about the higher
levels<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:54.390> i<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:55.579> how<00:00:56.579> much<00:00:56.760> how

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
levels but i don't know how much how

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.979 
levels but i don't know how much how
much<00:00:57.510> things<00:00:57.750> cost<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.460> game<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.090> opposed

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
much things cost in this game as opposed

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.139 
much things cost in this game as opposed
to<00:01:01.079> runescape<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.770> maybe<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.340> less<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.120> more

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
to runescape so maybe it's less or more

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.270 
to runescape so maybe it's less or more
you<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.719> whatever<00:01:03.930> ratio<00:01:04.640> i<00:01:08.990> constantly<00:01:10.280> way

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you know whatever ratio i constantly way

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.149 
you know whatever ratio i constantly way
more<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> i<00:01:12.299> can't<00:01:12.630> run<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.590> problem

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
more and i can't run and it's problem

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.420 
more and i can't run and it's problem
and<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:14.610> I've<00:01:15.090> sped<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.750> video<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.430> just

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and now I've sped this video up just

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.679 
and now I've sped this video up just
because<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.420> would<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.890> too<00:01:19.920> long<00:01:20.600> if<00:01:21.600> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
because it would be way too long if I

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
because it would be way too long if I
hadn't<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:25.080> can't<00:01:25.590> run<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.939> watch<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
hadn't and I can't run if you watch the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.080 
hadn't and I can't run if you watch the
video<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.840> see<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.500> running

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090

i'm<00:01:30.090> walking<00:01:30.570> very<00:01:31.049> quickly<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.680> sped

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
i'm walking very quickly because I sped

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.350
