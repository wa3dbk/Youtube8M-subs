00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.730 

and<00:02:53.120> there<00:02:53.360> goes<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> half-time<00:02:54.170> whistle<00:02:54.230> and

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
and there goes a half-time whistle and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.950 
and there goes a half-time whistle and
sate<00:02:55.010> will<00:02:55.880> be<00:02:56.030> extremely<00:02:56.540> annoyed<00:02:56.780> by

sate will be extremely annoyed by

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.240 
sate will be extremely annoyed by
themselves<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.470> they<00:02:57.650> missed<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:58.010> chance

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
themselves that they missed a chance

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.360 
themselves that they missed a chance
like<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.580> in<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.240> very<00:02:59.570> very<00:03:00.010> evenly<00:03:01.010> balanced

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
like that in a very very evenly balanced

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.700 
like that in a very very evenly balanced
game<00:03:01.720> evenly<00:03:02.720> balanced<00:03:03.080> in<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.290> sense<00:03:03.560> that

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
game evenly balanced in the sense that

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.170 
game evenly balanced in the sense that
they're<00:03:04.100> both<00:03:04.280> defenses<00:03:04.820> have<00:03:05.000> been

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
they're both defenses have been

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.200

extremely good parting dangerous in the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.850 
extremely good parting dangerous in the
breakaways<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:08.900> Johnson<00:03:09.320> perhaps<00:03:09.530> more<00:03:09.800> of

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
breakaways and Johnson perhaps more of

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.070 
breakaways and Johnson perhaps more of
the<00:03:10.040> play<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.400> midfield<00:03:10.550> but<00:03:11.120> as<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.600> said<00:03:11.660> a

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
the play in midfield but as I said a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.170 
the play in midfield but as I said a
real<00:03:12.590> cut<00:03:12.920> time<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.430> know<00:03:13.550> I<00:03:13.730> thought<00:03:14.030> at<00:03:14.150> the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
real cut time you know I thought at the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.880 
real cut time you know I thought at the
start<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.990> the<00:03:15.050> game<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.350> crowd<00:03:15.650> was

start of the game the crowd was
generating<00:03:16.490> something<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.420> players

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
generating something that the players

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.570 
generating something that the players
wouldn't<00:03:17.990> match<00:03:18.290> well<00:03:18.620> they<00:03:18.740> have<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.160> fact

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
wouldn't match well they have in fact

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.070 
wouldn't match well they have in fact
have<00:03:19.730> exceeded<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.300> at<00:03:20.420> times<00:03:20.690> are<00:03:20.900> played
