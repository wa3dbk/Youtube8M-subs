00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
like what I'm saying matches up with

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.450

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
all in a game was mainly story based

all in a game was mainly story based
it's<00:00:29.410> going<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:29.650> be<00:00:29.710> kind<00:00:29.980> of<00:00:30.070> hard<00:00:30.340> so<00:00:31.119> might

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
it's going to be kind of hard so might

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.369 
it's going to be kind of hard so might
as<00:00:31.480> well<00:00:31.570> get<00:00:31.690> right<00:00:31.900> on<00:00:32.050> this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379

this<00:00:32.860> video<00:00:33.160> will<00:00:33.399> probably<00:00:33.610> contain

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
this video will probably contain

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.390 
this video will probably contain
spoilers<00:00:34.539> for<00:00:35.050> The<00:00:35.140> Walking<00:00:35.350> Dead<00:00:35.560> Season<00:00:35.739> 1

in<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.579> background<00:00:37.090> I<00:00:37.390> mean<00:00:37.570> like<00:00:37.720> they'll

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
in the background I mean like they'll

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.780 
in the background I mean like they'll
probably<00:00:38.230> be<00:00:38.470> one<00:00:38.650> right<00:00:38.860> after<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.190> intro<00:00:39.730> so

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
probably be one right after the intro so

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.710 
probably be one right after the intro so
you<00:00:40.120> know<00:00:40.390> be<00:00:40.810> very<00:00:41.079> careful<00:00:41.590> of<00:00:41.620> that<00:00:42.720> anyway

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
you know be very careful of that anyway

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.620 
you know be very careful of that anyway
let's<00:00:44.079> get<00:00:44.200> started<00:00:44.739> so<00:00:44.800> first<00:00:45.489> off<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:46.329> looks

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
let's get started so first off it looks

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.470 
let's get started so first off it looks
much<00:00:46.899> better<00:00:47.170> it<00:00:47.710> really<00:00:47.980> does<00:00:48.160> it<00:00:48.460> looks<00:00:48.820> much

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
much better it really does it looks much

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.720 
much better it really does it looks much
better<00:00:49.809> for<00:00:50.050> some<00:00:50.290> reason<00:00:50.890> everything<00:00:51.550> looks

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
better for some reason everything looks

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.670 
better for some reason everything looks
a<00:00:51.850> bit<00:00:51.880> smoother<00:00:52.720> I<00:00:52.750> think<00:00:53.140> we've<00:00:53.260> applied<00:00:53.620> a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
a bit smoother I think we've applied a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.860 
a bit smoother I think we've applied a
couple<00:00:53.950> more<00:00:54.309> effects<00:00:54.700> over<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.090> top<00:00:55.450> that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
couple more effects over the top that

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.840 
couple more effects over the top that
make<00:00:56.200> it<00:00:56.410> look<00:00:56.620> slightly<00:00:56.980> better<00:00:57.399> than<00:00:57.520> it<00:00:57.730> did

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
make it look slightly better than it did

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.850 
make it look slightly better than it did
in<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.090> last<00:00:58.300> game<00:00:58.630> yeah<00:00:59.320> something<00:00:59.829> like

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
in the last game yeah something like

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.740 
in the last game yeah something like
that<00:01:00.190> I'm<00:01:00.309> not<00:01:00.430> really<00:01:00.640> sure<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.210> thing<00:01:01.390> is<00:01:01.570> we

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
that I'm not really sure the thing is we

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.350 
that I'm not really sure the thing is we
trade<00:01:02.020> that<00:01:02.140> in<00:01:02.379> for<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.829> lower<00:01:03.070> frame<00:01:03.550> rate<00:01:03.610> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
trade that in for a lower frame rate the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.690 
trade that in for a lower frame rate the
frame<00:01:04.719> rate<00:01:04.930> tends<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:05.439> drop<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:06.009> lot<00:01:06.310> during

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
frame rate tends to drop a lot during

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.849 
frame rate tends to drop a lot during
heavy<00:01:07.030> action<00:01:07.360> sequences<00:01:08.229> I'm<00:01:08.439> not<00:01:08.560> really

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
heavy action sequences I'm not really

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:10.980 
heavy action sequences I'm not really
sure<00:01:09.280> what<00:01:09.520> is<00:01:09.969> that<00:01:10.119> there's<00:01:10.359> this<00:01:10.450> one<00:01:10.659> scene

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
sure what is that there's this one scene

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.379 
sure what is that there's this one scene
in<00:01:11.049> episode<00:01:11.619> 2<00:01:11.889> there's<00:01:12.459> this<00:01:12.579> one<00:01:12.850> scene<00:01:13.149> on<00:01:13.359> a

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:13.389 
in episode 2 there's this one scene on a

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:16.199 
in episode 2 there's this one scene on a
bridge<00:01:13.749> in<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:15.369> of<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.609> characters

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:16.209 
bridge in one of the characters

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.940 
bridge in one of the characters
something<00:01:16.959> happens<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.289> whether<00:01:17.469> characters

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
something happens to whether characters

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.309 
something happens to whether characters
and<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:18.100> framerate<00:01:18.399> literally<00:01:19.119> drops<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.749> sub

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
and the framerate literally drops to sub

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.330 
and the framerate literally drops to sub
5<00:01:20.799> fps<00:01:21.399> like<00:01:21.880> three<00:01:22.420> seconds<00:01:22.959> it's<00:01:23.340> ridiculous

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
5 fps like three seconds it's ridiculous

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.160 
5 fps like three seconds it's ridiculous

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
thankfully they actually fixed the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.940 
thankfully they actually fixed the
marker<00:01:28.690> or<00:01:28.810> stutter<00:01:29.050> though<00:01:29.500> see<00:01:29.680> you<00:01:29.800> who

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
marker or stutter though see you who

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.830 
marker or stutter though see you who
didn't<00:01:30.220> play<00:01:30.340> The<00:01:30.550> Walking<00:01:30.760> Dead<00:01:30.940> Season<00:01:31.360> 1<00:01:31.690> on

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
didn't play The Walking Dead Season 1 on

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.010 
didn't play The Walking Dead Season 1 on
Peter<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.770> micro<00:01:33.250> stutter<00:01:33.640> is<00:01:34.000> when<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.810> game

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
Peter the micro stutter is when the game

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.170 
Peter the micro stutter is when the game
would<00:01:35.350> merely<00:01:35.770> stop<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.490> between<00:01:36.640> loading

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
would merely stop in between loading

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.810 
would merely stop in between loading
scenes<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.710> would<00:01:38.860> even<00:01:39.130> do<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.460> even

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
scenes and it would even do this even

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.780 
scenes and it would even do this even
before<00:01:39.909> action<00:01:40.510> sequences<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.860> they<00:01:42.369> got<00:01:42.610> rid

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
before action sequences and they got rid

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.310 
before action sequences and they got rid
of<00:01:42.940> this<00:01:43.060> micro<00:01:43.540> stutter<00:01:43.900> for<00:01:44.080> The<00:01:44.140> Walking

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
of this micro stutter for The Walking

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.990 
of this micro stutter for The Walking
Dead<00:01:44.440> Season<00:01:44.590> 2<00:01:44.920> I'm<00:01:45.190> not<00:01:45.369> sure<00:01:45.550> how<00:01:45.700> they<00:01:45.820> did

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
it but they almost completely got rid of

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.760 
it but they almost completely got rid of
it<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.610> only<00:01:48.759> time<00:01:49.090> I<00:01:49.240> see<00:01:49.450> micros<00:01:49.960> data<00:01:50.320> is<00:01:50.590> in

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
it the only time I see micros data is in

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.460 
it the only time I see micros data is in
between<00:01:50.890> some<00:01:51.640> scenes<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:52.840> never<00:01:53.080> happens

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
when I did it sounded like it had some

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.860 
when I did it sounded like it had some
weak<00:02:35.769> corruption<00:02:36.459> going<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.840> know

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
weak corruption going on like you know

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
design of the game just seems to be a

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.080 
design of the game just seems to be a
little<00:02:53.470> bit<00:02:53.590> off<00:02:53.770> or<00:02:54.010> broken<00:02:54.550> I'm<00:02:54.700> not<00:02:54.880> sure

much better if you're just listening

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.460 
much better if you're just listening
through<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.510> speakers<00:02:59.020> because<00:02:59.290> that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
be kind of stupid anyway the controls

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.770 
be kind of stupid anyway the controls
the<00:03:30.400> controls<00:03:30.790> themselves<00:03:30.970> are<00:03:31.420> actually

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
the controls themselves are actually

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.350 
the controls themselves are actually
fine<00:03:32.080> for<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.560> most<00:03:32.770> part<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.310> mean<00:03:33.520> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
fine for the most part I mean the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.770 
fine for the most part I mean the
controls<00:03:34.900> are<00:03:35.410> okay<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:37.209> thing<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.450> they've

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
controls are okay the thing is they've

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.390 
controls are okay the thing is they've
actually<00:03:37.959> changed<00:03:38.290> in<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.980> oscillator<00:03:39.340> you

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
actually changed in the oscillator you

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.699 
actually changed in the oscillator you
can<00:03:39.550> use<00:03:39.700> both<00:03:39.940> touch<00:03:40.300> being<00:03:40.780> fun<00:03:41.080> controls<00:03:41.560> at

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
can use both touch being fun controls at

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.199 
can use both touch being fun controls at
the<00:03:41.740> same<00:03:41.980> time<00:03:42.250> it's<00:03:42.459> their<00:03:42.580> time<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.850> swap

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
the same time it's their time to swap

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.240 
the same time it's their time to swap
between<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.720> two<00:03:43.900> that's<00:03:44.560> kind<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.010> annoying

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
between the two that's kind of annoying

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.949 
between the two that's kind of annoying
I<00:03:45.760> don't<00:03:45.940> know<00:03:46.000> why<00:03:46.150> they<00:03:46.270> did<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.720> first

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
I don't know why they did in the first

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.810 
I don't know why they did in the first
game<00:03:47.230> thankfully<00:03:47.740> they<00:03:47.860> changed<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.520> so<00:03:48.670> that

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
game thankfully they changed it so that

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.370 
game thankfully they changed it so that
you<00:03:49.090> don't<00:03:49.120> have<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.570> do<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.720> in<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:49.989> second

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
you don't have to do it in the second

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.680 
you don't have to do it in the second
game<00:03:50.560> most<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.670> action<00:03:51.910> sequences<00:03:52.269> to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
game most of the action sequences to

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.130 
game most of the action sequences to
control<00:03:53.080> using<00:03:53.440> combination

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
two of the action sequences I actually

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.460 
two of the action sequences I actually
had<00:04:01.250> real<00:04:01.430> trouble<00:04:01.640> getting<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.350> except<00:04:03.350> my

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
had real trouble getting to except my

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.810 
had real trouble getting to except my
joystick<00:04:03.680> inputs<00:04:04.300> so<00:04:05.300> it's<00:04:06.020> a<00:04:06.440> bit<00:04:06.800> off<00:04:07.040> but

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
joystick inputs so it's a bit off but

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.760 
joystick inputs so it's a bit off but
you<00:04:08.420> know<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:08.600> can<00:04:08.870> just<00:04:08.900> swap<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.650> other

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
you know you can just swap to the other

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.620 
you know you can just swap to the other
control<00:04:10.160> scheme<00:04:10.460> if<00:04:10.610> you<00:04:10.700> need<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:11.060> an<00:04:11.270> idea

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
control scheme if you need to an idea

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.450 
control scheme if you need to an idea
that<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.870> got<00:04:12.110> past<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.590> events<00:04:12.920> fine<00:04:13.130> but<00:04:13.370> it

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
that I got past the events fine but it

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.820 
that I got past the events fine but it
did<00:04:13.610> take<00:04:13.820> a<00:04:13.850> few<00:04:14.260> 20-second<00:04:15.260> loading<00:04:15.590> times

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
did take a few 20-second loading times

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.400 
did take a few 20-second loading times
that<00:04:16.220> kind<00:04:16.519> of<00:04:16.609> annoyed<00:04:16.880> me<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.810> just<00:04:18.140> keep

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
that kind of annoyed me so just keep

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.759 
that kind of annoyed me so just keep
that<00:04:18.560> in<00:04:18.620> mind<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:19.459> joysticks<00:04:20.299> are<00:04:20.660> kind<00:04:21.470> of

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
that in mind the joysticks are kind of

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.160 
that in mind the joysticks are kind of
inaccurate<00:04:22.490> but<00:04:23.180> everything<00:04:23.660> else<00:04:23.810> seems<00:04:24.050> to

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
inaccurate but everything else seems to

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.590 
inaccurate but everything else seems to
work<00:04:24.320> fine<00:04:24.680> there's<00:04:25.190> no<00:04:25.370> real<00:04:25.700> updates<00:04:26.360> or

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
work fine there's no real updates or

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.310 
work fine there's no real updates or
tweaks<00:04:27.050> made<00:04:27.460> but<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.760> all<00:04:29.150> seems<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.900> work

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
tweaks made but it all seems to work

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.770 
tweaks made but it all seems to work
just<00:04:30.890> as<00:04:31.100> well<00:04:31.310> as<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.610> needs<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.120> don't<00:04:32.330> see

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780

Dead Season 2 episode 1 extremely hard I
don't<00:05:05.960> know<00:05:06.290> there's<00:05:06.500> gonna<00:05:06.620> be<00:05:06.770> any<00:05:06.890> in

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
don't know there's gonna be any in

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
episodes 3 4 or 5 because obviously this

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.950 
episodes 3 4 or 5 because obviously this
isn't<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:10.070> freaking<00:05:10.520> future<00:05:11.030> time<00:05:11.240> show<00:05:11.600> here

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
so if you are squeamish I would suggest

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.219 
so if you are squeamish I would suggest
avoiding<00:05:16.150> episode<00:05:17.150> 1<00:05:17.390> altogether<00:05:17.900> because

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
avoiding episode 1 altogether because

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.310 
avoiding episode 1 altogether because
holy<00:05:18.940> God<00:05:19.940> some<00:05:20.540> of<00:05:20.630> those<00:05:20.720> scenes<00:05:21.020> are<00:05:21.169> just

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
holy God some of those scenes are just

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.000 
holy God some of those scenes are just
brutal<00:05:22.330> but<00:05:23.330> it's<00:05:23.930> otherwise<00:05:24.260> is<00:05:24.680> just<00:05:24.710> as

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
brutal but it's otherwise is just as

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.300 
brutal but it's otherwise is just as
good<00:05:25.160> as<00:05:25.280> it<00:05:25.400> used<00:05:25.430> to<00:05:25.700> be<00:05:25.820> so<00:05:26.660> overall<00:05:27.169> this<00:05:28.100> is

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
good as it used to be so overall this is

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.590 
good as it used to be so overall this is
gonna<00:05:28.460> be<00:05:28.640> a<00:05:28.669> really<00:05:29.000> short<00:05:29.030> video<00:05:29.419> I

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
gonna be a really short video I

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.650 
gonna be a really short video I
apologize<00:05:30.200> for<00:05:30.380> that<00:05:30.530> but<00:05:31.370> overall<00:05:31.790> this<00:05:32.390> was

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
apologize for that but overall this was

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.810 
apologize for that but overall this was
actually<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:33.320> fairly<00:05:34.010> good<00:05:34.340> port

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
actually a fairly good port

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.400 
actually a fairly good port
I<00:05:34.940> mean<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:35.300> doing<00:05:35.630> much<00:05:35.810> better<00:05:36.050> than<00:05:36.200> the

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
I mean it's doing much better than the

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.960 
I mean it's doing much better than the
Walking<00:05:36.680> Dead<00:05:36.710> Season<00:05:36.830> 1<00:05:37.280> does<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:37.610> removal

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
Walking Dead Season 1 does the removal

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.659 
Walking Dead Season 1 does the removal
of<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.120> micro<00:05:38.570> stutter<00:05:39.130> even<00:05:40.130> in<00:05:40.220> exchange

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
of the micro stutter even in exchange

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.820 
of the micro stutter even in exchange
for<00:05:40.729> the<00:05:40.910> lower<00:05:41.450> frame<00:05:41.810> rate<00:05:41.870> it's<00:05:42.320> an<00:05:42.440> overall

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
for the lower frame rate it's an overall

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.800 
for the lower frame rate it's an overall
improvement<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.669> controls<00:05:44.150> seem<00:05:44.510> a<00:05:44.540> little

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
improvement the controls seem a little

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.600 
improvement the controls seem a little
better<00:05:45.050> I<00:05:45.470> don't<00:05:46.070> know<00:05:46.130> what's<00:05:46.310> up<00:05:46.370> at<00:05:46.520> the

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
could hear it just a bit that's all if

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.120 
could hear it just a bit that's all if
they<00:05:56.419> fix<00:05:56.690> up<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:56.960> loading<00:05:57.350> times<00:05:57.620> in<00:05:57.830> a<00:05:57.919> patch

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.890 
they fix up the loading times in a patch
it'll<00:05:58.460> be<00:05:58.550> a<00:05:58.580> much<00:05:58.940> better<00:05:59.150> pod<00:05:59.510> than<00:05:59.780> The
