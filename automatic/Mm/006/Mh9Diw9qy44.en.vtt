00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.490
 and so she gave the third place after 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.190
 short program our 15 year old 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.109
 figure skater will perform arbitrary 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:20.100
 to the music of the Pirates of the Caribbean series 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.130
 seas on strange shores composer hans 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.130
 zimmer 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.039
 there is a triple lutz-triple toe loop cascade 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.930
 well, a wonderful program 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.760
 only that at the end of the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.520
 the end they know is no longer nervous 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.490
 the tension was so great when suddenly 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.090
 all of a sudden she was left without 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.170
 jump because double axel she 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:52.200
 even single did not work out just a head start 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:56.160
 This gave rivals but I think that 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:59.070
 no doubt there will be 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.790
 winner of this tournament his first 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.480
 Grand Prix Adult Tournament 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.480
 we remember the final 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.980
 junior seaside grand prix finals 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.840
 last year in Sochi where she became 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.900
 bronze medalist and here comes the first 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.010
 so serious international already 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.730
 adult 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.730
 start 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:26.259
 everything was wonderful beginning beautiful 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.610
 triple lutz triple toe 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:33.249
 beautiful cascade of the hardest 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.529
 then another cascade of three triple jumps 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:39.520
 rittberger single ridberger triple 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:42.289
 Salchow, too, she coped with it 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.940
 the night i'm saying that obviously it is already 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.400
 at the limit she acted in the very 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.290
 the end 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.550
 your free program already 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.550
 understood that 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.689
 all she should get many here 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.689
 such 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.759
 ridiculous mistake on yours but max not 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.520
 I think that this is some serious role 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:08.599
 I do not play, especially since I look 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.610
 arbitrators become generous 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.620
 because when the 15 year old skater and 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.560
 put 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.740
 scores for program components above 7 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.590
 points and so says that the arbitrators 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.480
 appreciated 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:27.060
 her programs but here it was 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.060
 small glitch on double axel and 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.280
 one 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.770
 but in any case she's just great and 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.320
 such jumps that were in 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.760
 the beginning of the program with cascades was still 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.090
 one very good triple cascade 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.550
 rittberger double toe loop but should be 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.270
 and with very good marks for 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.720
 Components 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:55.620
 programs but should be very good 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:59.460
 complete 118 and thirty eight hundredths 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.970
 points it is her personal record and 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:06.350
 previous achievement she surpassed a little 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.350
 whether not by 9 points 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.450
 but she even speak at 10
