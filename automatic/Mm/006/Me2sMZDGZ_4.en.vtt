00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
play hard the whole game and they listen

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
play hard the whole game and they listen
to<00:01:09.020> each<00:01:09.170> other<00:01:09.350> they<00:01:09.500> have<00:01:09.620> a<00:01:09.650> really<00:01:09.920> good

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
to each other they have a really good

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.650 
to each other they have a really good
chemistry<00:01:10.220> of<00:01:10.520> each<00:01:10.610> other<00:01:10.790> as<00:01:11.060> well<00:01:11.210> as<00:01:11.270> we<00:01:11.420> do

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
chemistry of each other as well as we do

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.660 
chemistry of each other as well as we do
all<00:01:11.780> this<00:01:11.870> thing<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.170> maybe<00:01:12.320> we<00:01:12.470> do<00:01:12.590> too<00:01:12.800> they

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
all this thing that maybe we do too they

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.100 
all this thing that maybe we do too they
just<00:01:13.790> did<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:13.970> little<00:01:14.120> bit<00:01:14.240> more<00:01:14.390> tonight<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:14.990> I

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
just did a little bit more tonight and I

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.390 
just did a little bit more tonight and I
think<00:01:15.230> they<00:01:15.500> just<00:01:15.530> made<00:01:15.890> some<00:01:16.070> tough<00:01:16.160> shots

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
think they just made some tough shots

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.110 
think they just made some tough shots
and<00:01:16.700> Florida<00:01:17.510> State<00:01:17.540> played<00:01:17.840> unbelievable

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.649 

I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:22.020> receptor<00:01:22.320> go

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
I think receptor go

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.539 
I think receptor go
and<00:01:22.810> just<00:01:22.960> realize<00:01:23.140> how<00:01:23.530> every<00:01:24.070> game<00:01:24.249> is<00:01:24.429> all

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
and just realize how every game is all

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.489 
and just realize how every game is all
assam<00:01:24.999> you<00:01:25.420> got<00:01:25.539> to<00:01:25.630> come<00:01:25.749> out<00:01:25.899> from<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.289> gates
