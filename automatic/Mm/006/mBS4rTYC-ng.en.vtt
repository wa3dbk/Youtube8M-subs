if you're working on websites of bronze
for<00:00:14.230> a<00:00:14.290> reviews<00:00:14.679> and<00:00:14.860> so<00:00:14.980> on<00:00:15.040> so<00:00:15.250> forth<00:00:15.280> it<00:00:16.270> is

for a reviews and so on so forth it is

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.439 
for a reviews and so on so forth it is
at<00:00:16.540> the<00:00:16.630> x11<00:00:16.960> card<00:00:17.500> OpenGL<00:00:18.400> supposed<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.269> full

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
at the x11 card OpenGL supposed to full

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.320 
at the x11 card OpenGL supposed to full
1080p<00:00:20.430> obviously<00:00:21.430> we're<00:00:21.939> going<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.150> hire

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
1080p obviously we're going to hire

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.710 
1080p obviously we're going to hire
that's<00:00:23.080> just<00:00:23.289> a<00:00:23.439> gimmick<00:00:24.070> but<00:00:24.400> if<00:00:24.609> using<00:00:24.970> a<00:00:25.090> TV

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
that's just a gimmick but if using a TV

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.820 
that's just a gimmick but if using a TV
input<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:27.279> coming<00:00:27.519> to<00:00:27.609> play<00:00:28.500> 7.1<00:00:29.500> HD

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
input just coming to play 7.1 HD

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.700 
input just coming to play 7.1 HD
surround<00:00:30.009> sound<00:00:30.460> for<00:00:30.519> HDMI<00:00:31.119> pci<00:00:31.689> express<00:00:32.410> 2.0

surround sound for HDMI pci express 2.0

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.590 
surround sound for HDMI pci express 2.0
so<00:00:33.489> you<00:00:33.550> obviously<00:00:33.670> need<00:00:33.969> like<00:00:34.120> motherboard

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
so you obviously need like motherboard

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.130 
so you obviously need like motherboard
which<00:00:34.719> will<00:00:34.930> have<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.230> buy<00:00:35.379> his<00:00:35.590> card<00:00:37.140> 1024

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
which will have you buy his card 1024

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.490 
which will have you buy his card 1024
megabytes<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:40.329> is<00:00:40.510> pretty<00:00:40.719> standard<00:00:41.079> now

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
megabytes which is pretty standard now

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.430 
megabytes which is pretty standard now
obviously<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.460> higher<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.820> better<00:00:43.350> 1024<00:00:44.350> is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
obviously the higher the better 1024 is

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.560 
obviously the higher the better 1024 is
pretty<00:00:44.680> decent<00:00:45.070> amount<00:00:45.309> to<00:00:46.300> around<00:00:46.390> about

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
pretty decent amount to around about

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.229 
pretty decent amount to around about
1920<00:00:47.140> x<00:00:47.379> 1080<00:00:47.730> over<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:48.879> you're<00:00:49.030> going<00:00:49.149> to

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
1920 x 1080 over that you're going to

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.319 
1920 x 1080 over that you're going to
want<00:00:49.390> more<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:51.070> long<00:00:51.250> as<00:00:51.280> you've<00:00:51.489> got<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.730> 1080p

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
want more as long as you've got a 1080p

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.180 
want more as long as you've got a 1080p
monitor<00:00:52.570> or<00:00:52.930> below<00:00:53.170> they're<00:00:53.949> going<00:00:54.039> to<00:00:54.100> be

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
monitor or below they're going to be

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.619 
monitor or below they're going to be
fine<00:00:54.430> which<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:54.730> guess<00:00:54.879> just<00:00:55.090> go<00:00:55.239> hand<00:00:55.480> in<00:00:55.570> hand

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
fine which I guess just go hand in hand

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.229 
fine which I guess just go hand in hand
with<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:56.109> 1080p<00:00:56.500> full<00:00:56.859> HD<00:00:57.250> support<00:00:57.579> even

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
with the 1080p full HD support even

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.700 
with the 1080p full HD support even
though<00:00:58.480> it's<00:00:58.629> not<00:00:58.840> technically<00:00:59.289> meaning<00:00:59.620> the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
though it's not technically meaning the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.099 
though it's not technically meaning the
same<00:00:59.920> thing<00:01:00.219> with<00:01:01.180> NVIDIA<00:01:01.570> you<00:01:01.660> also<00:01:01.870> going<00:01:02.050> to

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
same thing with NVIDIA you also going to

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.229 
same thing with NVIDIA you also going to
see<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.440> physics<00:01:02.920> which<00:01:03.609> is<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:03.760> great<00:01:04.030> great

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
see the physics which is a great great

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.790 
see the physics which is a great great
thing<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.600> have<00:01:04.930> obviously<00:01:05.470> things<00:01:05.680> like

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
thing to have obviously things like

you<00:02:06.220> crossfire<00:02:07.030> equivalent<00:02:07.870> in<00:02:08.050> nvidia

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
you crossfire equivalent in nvidia

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.070 
you crossfire equivalent in nvidia
mobile<00:02:09.490> graphics<00:02:09.670> cards<00:02:10.149> or<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.600> forth<00:02:10.899> and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
mobile graphics cards or so forth and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.960 
mobile graphics cards or so forth and
video<00:02:11.590> 3d<00:02:11.980> vision<00:02:12.190> mode<00:02:12.460> in<00:02:12.640> us<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.850> other

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
video 3d vision mode in us the other

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.199 
video 3d vision mode in us the other
thing<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.440> obviously<00:02:15.310> bauer<00:02:15.520> 3d<00:02:15.880> monitors

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
thing so obviously bauer 3d monitors

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.480 
thing so obviously bauer 3d monitors
were<00:02:16.360> first<00:02:16.600> released<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:18.160> was<00:02:18.250> all<00:02:18.400> about

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
were first released it was all about

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.090 
were first released it was all about
nvidia<00:02:19.090> only<00:02:20.020> does<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.440> right<00:02:20.590> now<00:02:20.830> but

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
nvidia only does have the right now but

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.800 
nvidia only does have the right now but
the<00:02:21.459> proper<00:02:21.670> three<00:02:21.940> days<00:02:22.120> on<00:02:22.300> your<00:02:22.450> own<00:02:22.540> video

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the proper three days on your own video

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.330 
the proper three days on your own video
so<00:02:22.959> another<00:02:23.170> great<00:02:23.260> thing<00:02:23.560> about<00:02:23.709> these<00:02:23.920> cards

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
so another great thing about these cards

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.190 
so another great thing about these cards
