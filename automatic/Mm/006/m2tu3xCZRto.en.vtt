and we don't recommend changing the
exhaust<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.240> might<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> little<00:00:30.689> bit<00:00:30.779> too

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
exhaust it might be a little bit too

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.269 
exhaust it might be a little bit too
loud<00:00:31.080> if<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.349> want<00:00:31.529> more<00:00:31.650> power<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.099> want

loud if you want more power if you want
pop<00:00:32.520> those<00:00:32.730> wheelies<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.630> we've<00:00:33.780> decided<00:00:34.050> is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
pop those wheelies what we've decided is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.229 
pop those wheelies what we've decided is
the<00:00:34.829> transmission<00:00:35.309> needs<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.730> upgraded<00:00:35.910> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the transmission needs to be upgraded so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.970 
the transmission needs to be upgraded so
we're<00:00:36.360> using<00:00:36.540> doctor<00:00:36.930> pulley<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.800> hit

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
we're using doctor pulley the hit

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.250 
we're using doctor pulley the hit
clutches<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.329> variator<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.020> slider

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
clutches and the variator and slider

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110 
clutches and the variator and slider
weights<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.739> well<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> clutch<00:00:41.460> belt<00:00:41.700> we're

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
weights as well as a clutch belt we're

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.670 
weights as well as a clutch belt we're
also<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> try<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:42.960> MRP<00:00:43.440> clutch

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
also going to try out some MRP clutch

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.729 
also going to try out some MRP clutch
bells<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.250> some<00:00:44.460> MRP<00:00:44.910> rollers<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.170> so

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
bells and some MRP rollers on it so

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.139 
bells and some MRP rollers on it so
we're<00:00:46.890> gonna<00:00:46.950> upgrade<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.579> transmission

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
we're gonna upgrade the transmission

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.270 
we're gonna upgrade the transmission
system<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:49.110> should<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.920> where<00:00:50.160> you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
system this should get you where you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.979 
system this should get you where you
want<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> go<00:00:50.760> which<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> over<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> 60<00:00:51.840> mile

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
want to go which is over the 60 mile

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.500 
want to go which is over the 60 mile
range<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.500> give<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.039> potential<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.910> pop

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
range and give you that potential to pop

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.600 
range and give you that potential to pop
some<00:00:54.750> wheelies<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.440> again<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.489> don't

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
some wheelies on it again we don't

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.910 
some wheelies on it again we don't
recommend<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.539> whole<00:00:57.899> exhausting<00:00:58.590> cuz<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
recommend the whole exhausting cuz it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.229 
recommend the whole exhausting cuz it
might<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> bit<00:00:59.520> too<00:00:59.670> loud<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
might be a bit too loud it is a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.510 
might be a bit too loud it is a
two-stroke<00:01:00.870> most<00:01:01.859> states<00:01:02.100> right<00:01:02.280> now<00:01:02.309> are

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
two-stroke most states right now are

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
two-stroke most states right now are
cracking<00:01:02.879> down<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.170> want<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
cracking down on that so if you want to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
cracking down on that so if you want to
make<00:01:04.500> some<00:01:04.680> changes<00:01:04.710> modifications<00:01:05.339> we

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
make some changes modifications we

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.370 
make some changes modifications we
suggest<00:01:06.510> starting<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> transmission

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
suggest starting with the transmission

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.770 
suggest starting with the transmission
before<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.400> exhaust<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.330> would

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
before you go to the exhaust I would

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.120 
before you go to the exhaust I would
leave<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> last<00:01:10.590> resort<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:11.010> you're

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
leave that as a last resort if you're

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
leave that as a last resort if you're
gonna<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.340> doing<00:01:11.580> racing<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.360> course<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.720> have

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
gonna be doing racing of course we have

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
gonna be doing racing of course we have
our<00:01:12.930> MRP<00:01:13.380> clutch<00:01:13.590> bells<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
our MRP clutch bells and we have the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.940 
our MRP clutch bells and we have the
doctor<00:01:14.880> pulley<00:01:15.060> sliders<00:01:15.540> which<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:16.080> twenty

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
doctor pulley sliders which are twenty

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
doctor pulley sliders which are twenty
and<00:01:17.040> thirty<00:01:17.100> percent<00:01:17.580> faster<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.360> they

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and thirty percent faster and they

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
and thirty percent faster and they
engage<00:01:19.020> quicker<00:01:19.350> than<00:01:19.650> regular<00:01:19.890> materials

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
engage quicker than regular materials

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.760 
engage quicker than regular materials
rollers<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.110> want<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> take<00:01:22.470> out<00:01:22.619> those

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
rollers so you want to take out those

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.230 
rollers so you want to take out those
rollers<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.189> they<00:01:23.430> bring<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> factory

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
rollers that they bring from the factory

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.149 
rollers that they bring from the factory
they<00:01:24.420> don't<00:01:24.600> use<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> best<00:01:25.080> materials<00:01:25.229> go

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
they don't use the best materials go

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.819 
they don't use the best materials go
with<00:01:26.340> nylon<00:01:26.759> nylon<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.630> 20%<00:01:27.990> faster<00:01:28.560> in

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
with nylon nylon is about 20% faster in

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
with nylon nylon is about 20% faster in
the<00:01:28.920> sliding<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.460> doesn't<00:01:29.790> wear<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.930> as

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the sliding it doesn't wear out so as

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.480 
the sliding it doesn't wear out so as
soon<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.439> remove<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:32.070> transmission

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
soon as you remove that transmission
