comfortable<00:00:05.500> this<00:00:05.890> time<00:00:06.190> out<00:00:06.370> this<00:00:06.550> scrimmage

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:06.820 
comfortable this time out this scrimmage

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.520 
comfortable this time out this scrimmage
in<00:00:07.000> the<00:00:07.090> last<00:00:07.300> one<00:00:07.540> definitely<00:00:07.990> definitely<00:00:08.290> I

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
in the last one definitely definitely I

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.690 
in the last one definitely definitely I
think<00:00:08.559> the<00:00:08.770> whole<00:00:08.920> offensive<00:00:09.219> the<00:00:09.430> whole<00:00:09.580> was

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
think the whole offensive the whole was

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.730 
think the whole offensive the whole was
more<00:00:09.850> comfortable<00:00:10.030> and<00:00:10.780> we<00:00:10.900> scored<00:00:11.620> a<00:00:11.650> lot

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
more comfortable and we scored a lot

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.170 
more comfortable and we scored a lot
more<00:00:11.920> touchdowns<00:00:12.280> obviously<00:00:12.760> but<00:00:12.940> i<00:00:12.969> think

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
more touchdowns obviously but i think

key I think so that's a big key I mean

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.180 
key I think so that's a big key I mean
they've<00:00:38.260> been<00:00:38.290> working<00:00:38.500> together<00:00:38.680> now<00:00:38.950> for<00:00:38.980> a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
better every day the the pic there that

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
better every day the the pic there that
would<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:43.450> probably<00:00:43.720> would<00:00:43.840> have<00:00:43.900> been

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
would that probably would have been

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.920
