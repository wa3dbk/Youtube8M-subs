it is ultimately or bio is living things
diversity<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.070> obviously<00:00:11.460> lots<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.269> different

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
diversity is obviously lots of different

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.279 
diversity is obviously lots of different
types<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.320> things<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.639> natural<00:00:15.360> if<00:00:15.990> we're

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
types of things in a natural if we're

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.540 
types of things in a natural if we're
looking<00:00:16.529> at<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.710> natural<00:00:17.190> setting

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
looking at this natural setting

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.970 
looking at this natural setting
biodiversity<00:00:18.330> would<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.619> different

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
biodiversity would be in the different

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.370 
biodiversity would be in the different
types<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.490> species<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.359> here<00:00:21.689> plants

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
types of species that are here plants

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.160 
types of species that are here plants
and<00:00:22.590> animals<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.160> birds<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:24.170> microscopic

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
and animals and birds and microscopic

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.109 
and animals and birds and microscopic
organisms<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.980> biology<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.519> things<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
organisms and biology and things and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.380 
organisms and biology and things and
then<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.170> genetic<00:00:28.740> diversity<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.640> just

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
then it's that genetic diversity so just

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.240 
then it's that genetic diversity so just
like<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> human<00:00:31.439> race<00:00:31.590> lots<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
like we have in the human race lots of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.420 
like we have in the human race lots of
different<00:00:32.640> genetics<00:00:33.140> building<00:00:34.140> different

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
different genetics building different

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.830 
different genetics building different
genetic<00:00:35.430> strengths<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.750> that's

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
genetic strengths and so on so that's

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.520 
genetic strengths and so on so that's
ultimately<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.739> biodiversity<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
ultimately what biodiversity is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.450 
ultimately what biodiversity is
ecologists<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> scientists<00:00:41.250> around<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
ecologists and scientists around the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.310 
ecologists and scientists around the
world<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.969> say<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.390> biodiversity<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
world do say that biodiversity is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
world do say that biodiversity is
probably<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.129> most<00:00:44.430> critical<00:00:44.730> issue<00:00:45.090> there

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
probably the most critical issue there

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.400 
probably the most critical issue there
is<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.750> humankind<00:00:46.129> for<00:00:47.129> without<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.460> you

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
is to humankind for without it you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.110 
is to humankind for without it you
sacrifice<00:00:49.410> all<00:00:50.250> sorts<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> things<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.910> put

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
sacrifice all sorts of things you put

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.110 
sacrifice all sorts of things you put
yourself<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.539> an<00:00:51.629> incredible<00:00:52.079> risk<00:00:52.350> of

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
yourself at an incredible risk of

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.400 
yourself at an incredible risk of
susceptibility<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.570> environmental

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
susceptibility to environmental

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740 
susceptibility to environmental
challenges<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.120> happen<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.629> that's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
challenges that can happen and that's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.720 
challenges that can happen and that's
not<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.410> droughts<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.039> floods<00:00:59.340> that's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
not just from droughts and floods that's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
not just from droughts and floods that's
from<00:01:00.079> just<00:01:01.079> saying

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
from just saying

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.170 
from just saying
locust<00:01:01.710> plague<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> great<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.879> there

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
locust plague is a great one so there

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.929 
locust plague is a great one so there
are<00:01:03.300> biological<00:01:03.840> threats<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.830> well<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
are biological threats as well if you

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.830 
are biological threats as well if you
have<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> genuine<00:01:06.630> care<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:08.510> whether<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
have a genuine care for whether it's the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.770 
have a genuine care for whether it's the
natural<00:01:09.990> world<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.479> leave<00:01:12.479> your

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
natural world or that you leave your

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.750 
natural world or that you leave your
land<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> better<00:01:13.740> place<00:01:14.070> than<00:01:14.340> when<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> got

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
land in a better place than when you got

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.420 
land in a better place than when you got
it<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.900> about<00:01:16.110> your<00:01:16.500> attitude<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it it's about your attitude and how you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.240 
it it's about your attitude and how you
perceive<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> world<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.259> live<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.860> try

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
perceive the world that we live in I try

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.859 
perceive the world that we live in I try
not<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.180> we're<00:01:21.360> doing<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
not to think that what we're doing is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
not to think that what we're doing is
sustainability<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.310> me<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
sustainability because to me that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.780 
sustainability because to me that
reflects<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:25.080> you're<00:01:26.070> comfortable<00:01:26.369> where

reflects that you're comfortable where

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.370 
reflects that you're comfortable where
you<00:01:26.939> are<00:01:27.090> I'd<00:01:27.360> rather<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.229> we're

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you are I'd rather see that what we're

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
you are I'd rather see that what we're
trying<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.009> regenerative<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:30.180> won't

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
trying to do is regenerative we won't

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.069 
trying to do is regenerative we won't
accept<00:01:31.430> stagnation<00:01:32.430> trying<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.900> keep

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
accept stagnation trying to just keep

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.010

going forward repair the landscape and

to its potential having kids made me

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.109 
to its potential having kids made me
probably<00:01:42.509> appreciate<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:44.000> we're<00:01:45.000> not

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
probably appreciate more that we're not

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060 
probably appreciate more that we're not
the<00:01:45.299> only<00:01:45.689> living<00:01:45.930> thing<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.770> I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the only living thing that's here I

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.880 
the only living thing that's here I
often<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.060> say<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:49.439> we're<00:01:49.619> doing

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
often like to say that what we're doing

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.719 
often like to say that what we're doing
is<00:01:49.979> not<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.360> human<00:01:51.960> species<00:01:52.729> but

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
is not just for the human species but

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.219 
is not just for the human species but
that<00:01:54.000> we're<00:01:54.210> actually<00:01:54.360> trying<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> look<00:01:55.020> after

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that we're actually trying to look after

that we're actually trying to look after
