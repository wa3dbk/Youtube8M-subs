 Dude, I'm extremely anxious to 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.040
 reading this from here said that it is 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.619
 extremely heavy but too beautiful 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.720
 Good, let's go monthly so I got it. 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.480
 edition number 1 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.080
 original sin that went out was there in the 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.500
 fest comix the edition number three of end 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.030
 from the days of dc and that i'm well 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.890
 hopeful with this saga saw this 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.650
 format is already a bit thinner than 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.110
 those two previous ones and so 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.610
 I'm going to make a video just talking 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.620
 about the end of time I got this 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.770
 single edition that special day of 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.300
 lectin boyfriends who are extremely 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.560
 fun and yes this cover has a lot to 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.740
 do not see the story 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.170
 she kind of has a romantic dinner one 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.310
 romantic evening with bruce wayne 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.700
 It's really fun, even I got batman. 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.030
 and suit 24 and 25 that I did not even 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.730
 self-test that are late 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.890
 there is a lot of delayed internal debate 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.290
 I caught the top spider man the great 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.630
 end is that it is precisely to know how 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.240
 that ended this saga because from 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.730
 Now we're going to have a new home. 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.410
 There the spider man and I go 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.630
 follow this new bow so I 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.670
 I took this last one just to know 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.080
 How did you end up to understand everything? 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.390
 when to start the next 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.890
 you should probably post more 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.769
 I got the four editions of 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.660
 avengers who was late 19 and 20 to 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.209
 21 and 22 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.040
 and yes I came back to accompany avengers 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.320
 now I'm going to read from the beginning 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.019
 true, I 'm back, right? 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.090
 the law of number 1 of the new marvel to 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.459
 to be able to understand a little more everything that 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.160
 is happening in secret wars 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.930
 so now I'm going to follow everything and I'm going 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.120
 make this past mix with the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.459
 present so that you can understand the 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.670
 universe and everything that is happening 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.980
 right 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.230
 we took a break in the fat and the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.330
 people think the nation of midnight 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.250
 number one of six hours we arrived at 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.560
 number 1 but it was already worth it because 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.470
 it was very cheap and also worth to 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.720
 I want to present this 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.519
 I'm not very familiar then 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.880
 when I do not know who is a video 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.400
 talking about them and I got it twitter 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.920
 the first bow is travels to the texas in 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.769
 Monthly format is not this yes khader 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.290
 from carton cover to part 1 and 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.629
 part 2 also be 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.030
 As soon as I read I will also 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.889
 review I know how to make a video only 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.000
 about politics that I think is asked 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.090
 too much 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.240
 we got this one that spider men 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.789
 michael bendis that this meeting of the 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.850
 miles morales with peter parker that is 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.750
 very interesting so if you find yourself out there 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.560
 lost 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.190
 It's worth it and I also took all 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.199
 marvel universe since the number 17 had 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.440
 There were a lot of pickup trucks I was going to get 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.020
 because here begins the captain marvel but 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.780
 here begins the humans and starts quartet 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.740
 fantastic and now I'm going to follow up month 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.740
 a month the marvel universe also continues 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.590
 there for the best moment of this pi camps 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.470
 I found the gringa version in the hail of 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.530

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.190
 I asked myself that question and he 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.199
 answered yes yes, it will launch this 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.690

 curiosity, my galera says it 's the 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.289

 with some collections and also acquired 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.169
 other collections and mines there that I 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.419
 I wish I did not think anywhere 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.000
 I had the opportunity I'm still talking 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.729

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.780
 including the beard of the distopia cast and me 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.210
 I bought number one to see if it really 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.669
 All of these here in Brazil are only 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.220

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.590
 Let's see if it really is all that 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.380
 Do not you think she was at the comix fest? 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.020

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.449
 Behold, O for you that asked me in 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.289
 some social network if this is worth the 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.099
 feather 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:32.949
 It's worth a lot even for levi's reasons. 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.900
 Trinity said that after the storm hote 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:36.759
 and after I finish tolotti that in the 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:41.440
 Brazil he'll already have arrest 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:43.419
 torque or is taken that is of the postage 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.120
 stay poor or in my past in 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.009
 commission before the comix fest I bought 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.349

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.889
 and there at the party I bought it said the 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.210
 number 3 because it's number four is 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.940
 exhausted and I'm behind the number 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:03.430
 four and it is very likely that I will 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.590
 video for you talking about campus 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:09.159

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.530
 But, look, it's only happiness, because from here 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:15.430

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:27.880
 inserts if you have not read without bullets yet 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:31.300
 go after 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.789
 so is this people and cip giant field 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.740
