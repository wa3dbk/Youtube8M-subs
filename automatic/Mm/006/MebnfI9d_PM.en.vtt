00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.189
 welcome to contact again Alexander 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.800
 re smart school 2 guitar me 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.960
 school and today is the second video on parsing 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.910
 the composition of this MFP time we will analyze 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.910
 second parts of this soundtrack 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.970
 so the first phrase from the new part 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.760
 We start with the fact that we clamp the note salt 1 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 string 3 fret and do it not as usual 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.320
 fingertip and not using bars 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.730
 and we clamp this phalanx here 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.920
 index finger 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.440
 it needs to be done in order to further 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.320
 could easily and quickly put the next 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 chord and so we pinch the note sol games and 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.129
 now we press to give out on a finger 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.530
 sixth on the third fret on the little finger 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.370
 first on the seventh we play 6 1 together and 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:09.500
 farther open string 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:09.500
 4 3 2 3 again how this phrase sounds 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.149
 now the second phrase 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 again hold the note salt 30 watts first 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.710
 string and tass necessarily the second finger 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.229
 play it 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.540
 further I take the string we pin the little finger on 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.130
 fifth fret 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.130
 play along with 4 and 1 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.340
 now the third on the second fret the second 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:50.170
 string on 3 fret 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:52.890
 again 3 at the end 4 openly and the second phrase 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.890
 sounds like 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.030
 now the third phrase 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.229
 I clamp the first string first on 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.880
 in the seventh year I play it and then 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.440
 at the same time put the barre on four 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.060
 strings on the fifth fret 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.630
 and the little finger is pressing the first string on 8 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:32.100
 playing together 5 and 1 further 4 on the seventh 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:34.310
 then play 3 2 3 again as it sounds 3

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.840
