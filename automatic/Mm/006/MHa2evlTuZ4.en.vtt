00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:10.512
 Welcome to the fast course on the Druid of Balance. 

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:13.076
 In this video, we'll show you a brief summary of what 

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:17.708
 you must do to start playing with a Level 90 Druid of Balance. 

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:23.188
 Balancing Druids have a unique mechanics feature called Energy. 

00:00:23.188 --> 00:00:27.756
 In combat, the balance bar goes back and forth automatically. 

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:30.183
 The left is lunar and the right is solar. 

00:00:30.183 --> 00:00:34.597
 The further left, the more damage the lunar spells cause. 

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:38.166
 The farther to the right, the more damage the solar spells do. 

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:42.636
 It starts by going to the lunar side on the left and when the fight ends 

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:44.415
 she stops in the middle. 

00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:50.335
 Before beginning the fight, take the form of Luniscante and activate the Mark of the Untamed. 

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.081
 Start by firing Starfire 

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:57.459
 which is the most basic spell when the bar is in the lunar phase. 

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:01.929
 When you reach the lunar peak, you gain a bonus that doubles the Lunar Fire damage 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.377
 the lunar spell of time damage. 

00:01:04.377 --> 00:01:09.251
 Cast Lunar Fire as soon as possible When the bar comes in 

00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:12.998
 in the solar phase, it is better to use Ira instead of Starfire. 

00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:17.582
 The Lunar Fire spell will turn into Solar Fire in the action bar. 

00:01:17.582 --> 00:01:21.978
 Like Lunar Fire, the damage of Solar Fire doubles in the solar peak. 

00:01:21.978 --> 00:01:23.739
 Wait for the right time to launch. 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.686
 The basic spin is this, but there are other spells that are also important. 

00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:33.671
 Stellar outbreak causes a lot of damage, but the great advantage 

00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:37.235
 is the bonus, which will increase the damage of the next 

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:42.207
 2 Stellar Fires or 3 Iras, depending on the stage at which the bar is. 

00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:46.221
 Lance Starburst just before reaching the lunar and solar peaks 

00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:49.391
 when Starfire and Wrath are causing more damage. 

00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:53.618
 You can have up to 3 saved Starburst charges. Sometimes 

00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:57.672
 the Lunar Fire and Solar Fire spells activate Falling Stars 

00:01:57.672 --> 00:02:00.628
 renewing a charge immediately. 

00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:04.745
 When joining 3 charges, go ahead and use Starburst on the hour 

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:07.036
 even if it is not the ideal time. 

00:02:07.036 --> 00:02:10.762
 There is much more to learn to master the druid 

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:13.075
 but we hope this video will give you the knowledge you need 

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:15.216
 to go in the right direction. 

00:02:15.216 --> 00:02:19.147
 Once you've mastered the basics, spend some time 

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:24.189
 reading about the library, the talents and glyphs to know other skills 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.672
 not mentioned here. 

00:02:25.672 --> 00:02:29.238
 Thanks for watching, and see you in Draenor!
