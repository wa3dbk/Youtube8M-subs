00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
have to press a block as you charge up

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.350 
have to press a block as you charge up
an<00:00:33.630> attack<00:00:33.899> right<00:00:34.610> okay<00:00:35.610> there<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:35.880> go<00:00:36.000> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
an attack right okay there we go that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.819 
an attack right okay there we go that
seems<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> bit<00:00:36.630> more<00:00:36.840> better<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.170> try<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> map<00:00:37.649> my

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
seems a bit more better I try to map my

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.670 
seems a bit more better I try to map my
controls<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.670> order<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.510> why<00:00:40.290> would<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
controls in order to do it why would you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.030 
controls in order to do it why would you
transform<00:00:41.100> no<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:43.050> still<00:00:43.469> took<00:00:43.800> these

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
transform no and you still took these

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.500 
transform no and you still took these
attacks<00:00:46.820> it's<00:00:47.820> kind<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> hard<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.360> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
attacks it's kind of hard because I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.959 
attacks it's kind of hard because I
mapped<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.140> block<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.590> r2<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.760> try<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
mapped on block to r2 so I can try and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.600 
mapped on block to r2 so I can try and
do<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.100> working<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.460> as

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
do it but it's not really working out as

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.889 
do it but it's not really working out as
good<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.940> thought<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.329> would<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
good as I thought it would but it is

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.889 
good as I thought it would but it is
with<00:00:55.110> let's<00:00:56.010> transform<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.699> super<00:00:57.120> sand<00:00:57.360> can

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
with let's transform to super sand can

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
with let's transform to super sand can
you<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.140> beyond<00:00:58.590> super<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.280> okay<00:00:59.640> yes<00:00:59.850> again
