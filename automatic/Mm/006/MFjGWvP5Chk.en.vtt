00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.589 
that's kind of not doing well in this
tank<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
tank is the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.720 
tank is the
Vesuvius<00:02:13.599> sword<00:02:13.900> which<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:14.560> would<00:02:14.709> one<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.640> my

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
Vesuvius sword which I would one of my

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.250 
Vesuvius sword which I would one of my
favorite<00:02:16.030> plants<00:02:16.329> in<00:02:16.420> here<00:02:16.599> I<00:02:16.659> mean<00:02:16.930> there's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
favorite plants in here I mean there's

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.069 
favorite plants in here I mean there's
one<00:02:17.530> really<00:02:17.829> good<00:02:18.220> new<00:02:18.489> leaf<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.970> that's<00:02:19.900> been

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
one really good new leaf and that's been

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.050 
one really good new leaf and that's been
growing<00:02:20.200> taller<00:02:20.560> each<00:02:20.769> day<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.849> should<00:02:22.030> be

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
growing taller each day so it should be

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.670 
growing taller each day so it should be
taken<00:02:22.420> off<00:02:22.540> now<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.810> think<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.230> just<00:02:23.290> needed<00:02:23.560> a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
taken off now I think it just needed a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.240 
taken off now I think it just needed a
little<00:02:23.709> longer<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.280> adopt<00:02:25.769> but<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:26.950> guy<00:02:27.129> I'm

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
little longer to adopt but that guy I'm

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.240 
little longer to adopt but that guy I'm
hoping<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.640> fill<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.909> whole<00:02:28.120> corner<00:02:29.250> which

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
hoping to fill this whole corner which

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.580 
hoping to fill this whole corner which
it<00:02:30.489> should<00:02:30.819> I<00:02:31.120> mean<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:31.689> grown<00:02:31.900> pretty<00:02:32.349> well

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590
