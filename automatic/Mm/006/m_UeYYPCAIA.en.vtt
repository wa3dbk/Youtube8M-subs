 in these national holidays there is nothing 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.189

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.800
 quoted and most sold in the sectors 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.270
 quoted especially for its price and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 abundance on the grid but there is a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.239
 prejudice about eating meat from 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.920
 horse 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.320
 there is a prejudice anyway there are 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.670
 much today they consume it and more without 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.530
 many times to know that they are 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.659
 consuming if you do not know well the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.280
 differences many times will be 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.060
 eating horse without realizing it and 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.460

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.850
 find little final I tell you that 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.700
 Several European countries such as Belgium 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.950
 spain holland and in france it's almost a 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.930
 dish top with tell him it's considered 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.510
 much healthier because of its low level in 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.510
 fats he tells me I did not understand 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.000
 another question is whether the meat of 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.679
 horse is good to throw it to the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.119
 grill and then accompany it with the 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.770

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.619
 traditional cuts that meat has 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.539
 of the beef that are the fillet steak

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.560
 It has many qualities we can 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.850
 articulate then with narrow that is 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.770

 to go outside and make a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.770
 nice experiment we'll see if the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.780

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.200
 parrillero 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.900

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.810
 horse meat 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:54.160

 delicious 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.530
 horse meat is an alternative 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.540
 economic for this space store 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.730
 easy preparation and very tasteful 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.069
 It is a bad look but as it says well 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.280
 said to a gift horse you do not look at him 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.280
