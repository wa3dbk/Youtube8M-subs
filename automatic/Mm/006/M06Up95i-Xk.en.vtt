of<00:02:53.959> my<00:02:54.049> car<00:02:55.540> but<00:02:56.540> what's<00:02:57.440> different<00:02:57.799> now<00:02:58.099> is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
of my car but what's different now is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.270 
of my car but what's different now is
that<00:02:58.459> our<00:02:58.760> opener<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.360> mounted<00:02:59.840> on<00:03:00.049> the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
that our opener is mounted on the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.470 
that our opener is mounted on the
farthest<00:03:01.280> bracket<00:03:01.849> and<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.120> makes<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.390> go

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
farthest bracket and it makes it go

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.850 
farthest bracket and it makes it go
higher<00:03:03.849> right<00:03:04.849> up<00:03:04.970> there<00:03:05.180> like<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.860> I

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
higher right up there like that and I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.380 
higher right up there like that and I
don't<00:03:07.190> know<00:03:07.459> if<00:03:07.519> that's<00:03:07.670> very<00:03:07.730> good<00:03:08.120> or<00:03:08.269> not

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
don't know if that's very good or not

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.770 
don't know if that's very good or not
cuz<00:03:08.690> usually<00:03:08.930> like<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.920> rail<00:03:10.069> it<00:03:10.250> goes<00:03:11.030> up<00:03:11.360> and

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
cuz usually like the rail it goes up and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.690 
cuz usually like the rail it goes up and
stuff<00:03:11.989> down<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:12.920> hope<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.310> makes<00:03:13.579> a

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
stuff down and I hope it makes a

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.420 
stuff down and I hope it makes a
difference<00:03:14.060> or<00:03:14.180> anything<00:03:15.130> but<00:03:16.130> uh<00:03:16.190> yeah<00:03:18.340> so<00:03:19.340> I

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
it drops what I would have done is that

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.479 
it drops what I would have done is that
and<00:03:45.769> then<00:03:46.459> oh<00:03:46.579> yeah<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.930> wall<00:03:48.109> button

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
goes through the roof thumb is down and

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.199 
goes through the roof thumb is down and
then<00:03:51.440> is<00:03:51.560> just<00:03:51.590> right<00:03:51.950> there<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.150> is

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
then is just right there and this is

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
and then we actually I guess you had

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.920 
and then we actually I guess you had
another<00:04:07.489> one<00:04:07.669> like<00:04:08.569> yeah<00:04:09.109> you<00:04:09.169> can<00:04:09.380> see<00:04:09.590> like

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
another one like yeah you can see like

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.099
