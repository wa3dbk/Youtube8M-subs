and cut an angle and then cut another

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.050 
and cut an angle and then cut another
angle<00:01:20.799> it<00:01:21.799> probably<00:01:22.220> makes<00:01:22.399> it<00:01:22.549> easier<00:01:22.940> if

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060

my<00:06:29.570> first<00:06:30.050> try<00:06:30.410> and<00:06:30.710> this<00:06:30.920> is<00:06:31.070> my<00:06:31.220> second<00:06:31.730> try

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
my first try and this is my second try

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.990 
my first try and this is my second try
the<00:06:33.230> first<00:06:33.410> try<00:06:33.710> I<00:06:33.740> ended<00:06:34.100> up<00:06:34.160> doing<00:06:34.340> a<00:06:34.550> flat

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
the first try I ended up doing a flat

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.900 
the first try I ended up doing a flat
shell<00:06:35.360> but<00:06:35.960> it<00:06:36.740> looks<00:06:36.920> a<00:06:37.010> little<00:06:37.130> bit<00:06:37.310> off<00:06:37.520> when

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
shell but it looks a little bit off when

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.390 
shell but it looks a little bit off when
it's<00:06:38.060> flat<00:06:38.390> the<00:06:39.230> rounder<00:06:39.590> one<00:06:39.860> looks<00:06:40.190> I<00:06:40.370> feel

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
it's flat the rounder one looks I feel

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.950 
it's flat the rounder one looks I feel
like<00:06:40.670> it<00:06:40.790> looks<00:06:40.940> a<00:06:41.030> little<00:06:41.240> bit<00:06:41.360> cuter<00:06:41.690> and

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
like it looks a little bit cuter and

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.680 
like it looks a little bit cuter and
both<00:06:42.590> of<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:42.830> faces<00:06:43.220> are<00:06:43.460> a<00:06:43.640> little<00:06:43.940> different

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
both of the faces are a little different

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.050 
both of the faces are a little different
so<00:06:45.500> these<00:06:45.650> are<00:06:45.860> my<00:06:45.950> two<00:06:46.010> bulbous<00:06:46.550> ours<00:06:46.760> and

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
so these are my two bulbous ours and

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.880 
so these are my two bulbous ours and
they're<00:06:47.450> basically<00:06:47.900> almost<00:06:48.110> the<00:06:48.380> same<00:06:48.590> thing

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
they're basically almost the same thing

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.670 
they're basically almost the same thing
except<00:06:49.850> for<00:06:50.060> I<00:06:50.210> painted<00:06:50.600> the<00:06:50.810> faces<00:06:51.050> a<00:06:51.260> little

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
except for I painted the faces a little

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.460 
except for I painted the faces a little
bit<00:06:51.890> different<00:06:52.340> and<00:06:52.690> this<00:06:53.690> is<00:06:53.870> how<00:06:53.990> both<00:06:54.170> of<00:06:54.350> my

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
bit different and this is how both of my

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.990 
bit different and this is how both of my
little<00:06:54.740> Pikachu's<00:06:55.220> turned<00:06:55.490> out<00:06:55.670> and<00:06:55.880> their

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
little Pikachu's turned out and their

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.640 
little Pikachu's turned out and their
faces<00:06:56.330> are<00:06:56.480> almost<00:06:56.870> the<00:06:56.960> same<00:06:57.110> thing<00:06:57.380> except

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
faces are almost the same thing except

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.410 
faces are almost the same thing except
for<00:06:57.680> their<00:06:58.190> looking<00:06:58.640> different<00:06:58.970> directions

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420 
for their looking different directions

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.920 
for their looking different directions
and<00:06:59.950> on<00:07:00.950> the<00:07:01.520> back<00:07:01.700> they're<00:07:02.060> almost<00:07:02.330> the<00:07:02.690> same

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
and on the back they're almost the same

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.840 
and on the back they're almost the same
thing<00:07:03.230> except<00:07:03.800> for<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:04.160> little<00:07:04.430> lines<00:07:04.610> or<00:07:04.820> a

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
thing except for the little lines or a

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.850 
thing except for the little lines or a
little<00:07:05.210> bit<00:07:05.300> bigger<00:07:05.510> than<00:07:05.690> each<00:07:05.840> other<00:07:06.050> so

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
little bit bigger than each other so

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.650 
little bit bigger than each other so
this<00:07:07.130> is<00:07:07.280> my<00:07:07.430> little<00:07:07.760> collection<00:07:07.910> if<00:07:08.540> you
