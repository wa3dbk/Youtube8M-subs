00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
reason they don't tell you obviously if

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.819 
reason they don't tell you obviously if
you<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.600> come<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.079> all<00:00:46.260> righty<00:00:46.739> guys

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you right as you come in all righty guys

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.459 
you right as you come in all righty guys
so<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.280> kind<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.700> sum<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:49.200> will

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
so just kind of sum that up you will

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.060 
so just kind of sum that up you will
fail<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.120> visual<00:00:51.539> test<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.260> there's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> check

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
fail the visual test if there's a check

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.189 
fail the visual test if there's a check
engine<00:00:53.340> light<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.699> some<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:54.960> like

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
engine light on some of the other like

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.380 
engine light on some of the other like
ABS<00:00:55.739> lights<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.370> something<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
ABS lights or something like that you

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.319 
ABS lights or something like that you
will<00:00:57.510> actually<00:00:57.719> still<00:00:58.140> pass<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.120> had<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
will actually still pass but if I had a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
will actually still pass but if I had a
check<00:01:00.629> engine<00:01:00.870> light<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.859> went<00:01:02.129> into<00:01:02.280> my

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
check engine light on and I went into my

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.119 
check engine light on and I went into my
go<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.910> my<00:01:03.030> smog<00:01:03.390> tested<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.920> pass

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
go get my smog tested I would pass

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.010 
go get my smog tested I would pass
emissions<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.570> would<00:01:06.689> fail<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
emissions but then I would fail the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.460 
emissions but then I would fail the
visual<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.299> again<00:01:09.299> they're<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
visual and again they're not going to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.840 
visual and again they're not going to
tell<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> off<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> bat<00:01:11.159> because<00:01:11.400> obviously

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
tell you off the bat because obviously

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.070 
tell you off the bat because obviously
they'd<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.240> losing<00:01:12.390> money<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:12.990> they

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
they'd be losing money and then they

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.750 
they'd be losing money and then they
want<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> come<00:01:13.650> back<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.890> retest<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
want you to come back and retest and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
want you to come back and retest and
they<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> charge<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.200> retest<00:01:16.680> some

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
they want to charge you to retest some

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.609 
they want to charge you to retest some
places<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> free<00:01:18.330> retest<00:01:18.810> some<00:01:19.049> places<00:01:19.290> are

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
