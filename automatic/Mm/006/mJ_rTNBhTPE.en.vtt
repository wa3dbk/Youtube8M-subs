00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.430
 Maybe the new leather under the title 50 of the lucky charms on this 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.050
 weekend 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.469
 Ladies of victory 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.589
 in the first race Ford posts by Nadal 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.339
 María Morales 20 hours 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.550
 on the 3 2 8 kilometer long route 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.949
 Choice of talk 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.910
 On it one wants a better result at the final run and for the last time 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.619
 Cheap meat at the start 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.190
 and parallel to the first race Schmitz will make the best start 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.150
 Ford to sequence 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.969
 and she was born 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.710
 fog 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.870
 Teuchert 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.300
 Werner Daemen 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 the top group after the start 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.090
 Skimmed milk of the Thuringian championship not necessarily a giant club this 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.190
 wm-haul 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.020
 Barbara again in the lead 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.060
 Muntwiler Dr Man of the Weekend Dario Giuseppetti 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 his rear wheel 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.360
 the attack 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.240
 only a matter of time 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.210
 The Yamaha straw fire form the Vivanco want a short the two said Ernst 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.640
 already over and over again the position change 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.480
 Josef St the Irish would not have cars at the top 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.640
 of the field 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.260
 the goal of a passage who drove this Platzek always strong at this 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.100
 also Nadal 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.280
 with the torque of the card m 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.680
 comes over too 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 i can do it mild shape PC crisis 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.820
 moderate on the straights 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.030
 neither a bit faster than the careers of Stefan Nebel Nebel at the white helmet 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.260
 clearly visible 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.330
 Martin Bauer the teammate 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 alone dark on the head 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 and that he did better than the first round had the podium 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.240
 lost 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.360
 and similar to the first round 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.610
 Stefan fog 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.150
 new second 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.580
 moderate strobel chance demanded 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.580
 started this insurance again 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.339
 definitely 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.299
 from the tips 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.629
 from the seven infrastructures 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.639
 exist with small ones 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.169
 not as well positioned as the western part of Switzerland Dr 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.259
 the reigning champion with 4 1 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:37.669
 Jörg Teuchert 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.669
 a great fighter he too has 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:45.929
 Hardly a guest is only the couple with the destination in Schleiz 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:49.689
 and he's back to the top riders again 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.439
 So there can be a lot of bad luck together this season 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.309
 the action is sharp 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.059
 because otherwise he would certainly have a slightly better role in the fight for the 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.529
 Title game 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.599
 Change of leadership more 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.579
 the way of life of the animals died 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.980
 So not so pushed the Berliners 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.379
 Stefan fog 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.970
 uneven, the group shows c but did not reach a gripping duel 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.229
 the victory question mark 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.629
 Farmer behind 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.389
 Much more secure it looks sovereign than in the first round 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.349
 and Werner Daemen passing by Ankara Markowitsch Teuchert demolishing Mousavi 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:33.139
 to let 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.679
 The emission-free dinner honored the Vivanco want that 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.839
 Driver behind it 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.499
 Sister Chelsea 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:46.849
 Stefan does not want to move away from me, he wants to show himself 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.849
 Woke up other horses in it 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.299
 the line was a legal problem standing and again Dario Giuseppetti 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.109
 in the lead and now he makes Ernst Bauer say no 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.379
 Barbara Emme has been stranded 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.329
 the fight for second place 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.779
 of the two teammates 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.509
 Werner Daemen on the fourth time people 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.739
 Driving behavior 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.159
 bought the championship 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.159
 on the fifth position 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:23.069
 The call for the Nations call on the spot advises Ferlemann 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.599
 want to go to the first Janko 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.599
 from the oven at Inter 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.009
 and in front 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.080
 meanwhile Werner Daemen 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.809
 Fog and over 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:39.009
 and there may 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.710
 the reigning champion she also Germany 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.710
 we have already twice 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:48.770
 Cairo 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 Milster used privately 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.710
 and Dario Argento in the front precisely what a week call 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.210
 the phenomenal very strong 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.260
 the only thing he lacked to perfection 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.979
 in this second race, the fastest race lap 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.779
 driven by Werner Daemen on the BMW 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.189
 So also from there this was not better than in the first round that would be 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.639
 for us therefore that Heinemann 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.400
 then Swertz like the bank at Olympus this was no fun from me 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 and Oliver Klaukien of this chase group 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.180
 and in front Dario Giuseppetti showed himself to look around 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.599
 Bottom the competition is Trulli was far away 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.009
 and how the next exit in it is told 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.370
 double victory 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.409
 haix 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.689
 a phenomenal performance 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.150
 dpa-AFX 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.090
 the Ducati optimally used on to its popular range but that alone 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.309
 is not it 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:56.309
 such on the weekend against the competition from Riga Emden you have to 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:59.309
 first done 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:06.029
 that was through the heart is another thing I've ever done 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:07.100
 it was relative 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.460
 rather soft had guessed that he Werner them from accelerator city Sirte 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.840
 hurt that he had already done with me because I knew how it was in his 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.969
 tactics 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:18.419
 yes, I've seen the void 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.379
 so this year 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.249
 it was 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.409
 It was true but it was absolutely fair so give each other nothing 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.260
 under first year double podium offset 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.589
 is currently playing and you can see the extremely uptrend 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:34.189
 For decades first row the only brand which had twin-engine 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:36.559
 Although in Poland effect perfect day 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:38.419
 where already over but we ourselves too 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.960
 as soon as possible from time to time so I have 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.410
 the worry is great that I constantly showed the boxers real and so track 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.770
 and yes I tried my rhythm software giant Saddam Hussein works 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.470
 no not only 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.189
 and so driving to the front it was 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:56.189
 then finally his boss was Stefan 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.569
 a this name is over 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.779
 which then also in the German ladies Martin Schäfer in the Bavarian Zirndorf 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:06.119
 Per cent it was made to problems or wrong place to book 

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:08.669
 which never a dangerous situation between us 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:10.860
 that's how it should be and so yes 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.050
 Hot spots Erlanger could still fight for third place was strong 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.809
 I am very pleased with performance for cacti 

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:16.760
 Percent at 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.809
 Chooses Motorcycles Podium is of course already sensational 

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:23.569
 nothing has been decided in the championship as soon as I was over 95 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.099
 Counter in front of Werder Bremen 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:26.120
 but I look 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.280
 He also had the finish line 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.990
 Dario 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.620
 nursery school places
