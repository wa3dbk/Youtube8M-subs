00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.230
 this car proves its technology 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.540
 you find it on golf gti that's it 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.130
 so who's going out right now is 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.710
 exactly the same technique it is this 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.810
 that you explained to me and for the same trio 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.240
 is stalled for the same so it's blurry 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.430
 so what car finally s understands the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.480
 mouth do for the law is then you you 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.730
 says that golf is the most 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 socially acceptable diana puppies 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 but as if hot 17 to 19 I tell you 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.719
 I'm not at the parody man 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 but the strength of this car is 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.110
 they go completely unnoticed 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.120
 that she remains chic rocket lalalala 3 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.940
 like that sportback forget about 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.610
 techniques it's ok it's clean 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.480
 chiper that's it goes unnoticed that's it 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.969
 their strength 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.980
 so for casting defects odi she 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.390
 is totally socially acceptable 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.219
 this case there Hungary as its 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.219
 seaweed ceremony or see you go 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.350
 she says to you held that's okay my guy you see 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.589
 yes yes but 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.830
 but between a fly between the logo 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.470
 volkswagen and the i way logo in a 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 France that is not going as well as its life 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.060
 every time no but wait I hurt 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.409
 to my ever so important france 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.070
 what is better when you go 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.740
 see for example customers as long as 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.140
 body to cg what necessarily volkswagen 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.150
 was nice volkswagen is socially 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.130
 unfortunately or fortunately more 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.250
 okay what are we going to charge me for 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.380
 g7 have repeated the deduction in your login 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.090
 you take their cash that the screen the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.920
 difference on the right the show bertrand 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.900
 the screens here it is actually 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.680
 touch but it's tactile in golf 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.659
 in golf 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.939
 no but here on the kernel not touch 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.079
 he was little all the hot party 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.200
 is not tactile so it is not 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.210
 touch hair in the golf he is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.860
 really tactical 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.860
 finally if you prefer and I say 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.870
 that today the meaning of history 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.670
 it's still a beautiful touch screen 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.310
 on the center console when you touch 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.500
 very long with your fingers you see that's it 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.100
 agree that we rank a difference 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.560
 important 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.740
 so in summary you have two cars that 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.870
 are cousins â€‹â€‹almost half sister whose 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.560
 the differences hold the envelope 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.700
 outdoor and touch screen so if 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.500
 it's the same price it's going crazy 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.170
 the audi strategy because you tell yourself 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.250
 but then why pay must finally if 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.660
 it's the same price people are going 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.320
 to say well I want one or ten years at best 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:34.920
 we will see democracy and that's going to 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.920
 to be very interesting
