 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.559
 your home welcome to antro for all 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.849
 anticyclone erase precipitation here 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.290
 drizzle I have it checked carlos 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.849
 I bring the umbrella I have prepared 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.799
 because I before being from home always 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.900
 I look at my application of time and if you do not 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.340
 you look you have no excuse because 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.859
 this video found the 5 best 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.939
 weather applications get ready 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.939
 shower glove 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.370
 well let's go there we start with the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.320
 different weather applications 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.110
 for our android and the first one that 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.730
 I want to highlight is there is in Skype a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.590
 application also personally I 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.809
 I really like a pretty application 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.120
 simple that pulls the information from 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.430
 custom weather is from there where it has 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.920
 all meteorological data that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.930
 show some important aspects of 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.210
 this application are your style just that 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.680
 the truth will be very very favorable for 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.690
 all android users we like 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.820
 much obviously this kind of 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.620
 customization and something that I also think 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.390
 what is important to review is that we have 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.129
 different cones packs that we can 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.120
 commute and change in a very 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.680
 simple in the section of 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.880
 notifications is also present in 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.050
 someone from skype we will be able to 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.460
 configure what we want us to 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.409
 show notifications in the bar 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.760
 also note that it is very minimalist 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.670
 and in the widgets section very 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.780
 important because we have three available 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.580
 next application on this occasion is 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.650
 a classic increasingly uses more people 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.229
 how is yahoo time an application 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.299
 quite complete and especially very 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.940
 visual because he uses flickr images 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.830
 to illustrate the different locations 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.570
 where we find something very 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.190
 important is also where does the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.430
 information 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.750
 second round dotcom a website or a 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.600
 website where we found information 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.950
 of the very reliable time besides this 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.840
 we also have the possibility of 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.310
 visualize a map to see even which 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.710
 it is the route that the clouds have 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.610
 we will be able to see the sunrise the sunset 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.470
 through a pretty graphic 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.970
 interesting and especially what has 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.650
 commented flame is mostly his 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.930
 main differentiation well in their 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.670
 widgets three sizes the truth that they are 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.530
 precious and I personally use it 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.450
 and it's one of the widgets I think in 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.590
 lack of March, let's go with the number 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.270
 three with weather 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.860
 webber you may not need 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.960
 too much information it is possible that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.820
 you only need the temperature the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.200
 time you are going to do and this application 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.570
 about everything he does is that 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.640
 very scarce information goes direct to 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.530
 effectively record its biggest flaw 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.640
 However, its greatest virtue is the truth 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.040
 which is a vibration where we will find 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.750
 the basic information where the majority 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.760
 of users will have more than enough 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.170
 in the configuration section the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.790
 truth is that the configuration is very 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.250
 very simple there are very few parameters 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.880
 that we can modify that we will have 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.260
 access to notifications in the bar 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.000
 notifications and we also have two 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.500
 widgets also very simple as 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.030
 the application 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.460
 we are already with the fourth application in 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.080
 this chance accuweather surely one 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.100
 of the most famous are many years 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.690
 accompanying us 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.820
 this application pulls out the information 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.100
 from accuweather.com without a doubt 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.200
 one of the most reputable portals in 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.700
 Regarding meteorological information 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.350
 truth is a very very application 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.450
 professional we find a lot 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.980
 moisture visibility information 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.870
 wind etcetera the truth that is a 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.190
 complete full application in addition to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.480
 this also highlights a great deal 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.190
 detail that I liked a lot 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.410
 example the temperature graphs 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.850
 rainfall charts and there is something 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.709
 that sets it apart from the rest and is a 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.170
 sign in very own and is that we have the 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.000
 possibility to watch news and videos in 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.700
 english of the meteorological format of a 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.320
 own channel the truth that power is a 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.090
 step further on is effectively not 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.380
 both the widget the truth is that it leaves a 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.270
 little to be desired in this aspect 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.739
 we could expect a little more from the 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.970
 application notwithstanding a large 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.560
 application 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.540
 we go with the fifth application and not 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.160
 could less important webber in its 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.450
 time if you remember but I already 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.739
 made a favorite video there has been 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.380
 rather that we were with a 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.110
 application 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.800
 a creator of the above many 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.270
 minimalist design information i yes a 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.680
 very complete application we find 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.990
 information per day we find 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.640
 information per hour per week and so on 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.150
 we even have some graphics of 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.380
 fairly complete precipitation and that 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.420
 they will have enough information to 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.310
 already a little more advanced users and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.810
 one of the main strengths of 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.850
 wong weather without a doubt is the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.320
 number of widgets we have six 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.730
 available is practically impossible 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.260
 that you do not find the one that most 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.610
 adjust to your needs 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
 Well, we're done with the 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.030
 five applications that yes we do not 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.280
 We wanted to go without first leaving a 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.410
 small bonus track a question that I 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.400
 I think it will cost a gift widget 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.930
 weather 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.370
 webber very careful because it's a 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.990
 rogue is a bad spoken that widget 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.940
 it is indeed a very funny widget 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.500
 that in a somewhat different way than what 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.300
 that you are used to, will tell you how 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.730
 it's time beyond our window 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.250
 the truth a very attractive widget and to 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.690
 less different from the others, you're good 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.030
 have been the five applications plus the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.190
 bonus track gift and in this case already 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.270
 you have no excuse to know what the 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.960
 application that best fits the 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.330
 needs 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.590
 It's very variety and a lot of information and 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.270
 true that you have a little bit of everything 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.400
 some very professional applications 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.380
 others very minimalist and simple 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.270
 you have to choose from and as always 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.310
 those we invite that you use another 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.990
 application do you have any advice leave it 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.400
 in the comments that we will love 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.930
 listen to them and now as always if you 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.460
 liked this video to like and what 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.900
 more important is that you share it with 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.710
 your friends so you know our 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.710
 clear applications yes
