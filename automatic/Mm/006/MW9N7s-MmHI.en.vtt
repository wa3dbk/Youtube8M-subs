created<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.090> freedom<00:04:02.270> jacket<00:04:02.810> because<00:04:02.990> I

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
created the freedom jacket because I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.750 
created the freedom jacket because I
think<00:04:03.260> it<00:04:03.350> symbolizes<00:04:03.560> what<00:04:04.190> we<00:04:04.310> all<00:04:04.460> know

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
think it symbolizes what we all know

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.810 
think it symbolizes what we all know
which<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.390> this<00:04:06.320> brotherhood<00:04:06.950> between<00:04:07.280> riders

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
which is this brotherhood between riders

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.700 
which is this brotherhood between riders
when<00:04:08.330> you<00:04:08.450> put<00:04:08.600> on<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.810> freedom<00:04:09.170> jacket<00:04:09.560> and

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
when you put on the freedom jacket and

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.500 
when you put on the freedom jacket and
you<00:04:09.770> know<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.250> there's<00:04:10.760> been<00:04:10.940> people<00:04:11.120> around

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
the world and clubs along the world that

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.860 
the world and clubs along the world that
have<00:04:13.370> worn<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.760> jacket<00:04:13.820> it<00:04:14.450> just<00:04:14.660> symbolizes

have worn this jacket it just symbolizes

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.289 
have worn this jacket it just symbolizes
what<00:04:15.380> ridings<00:04:15.770> all<00:04:15.890> about<00:04:16.250> freedom<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.510> unity

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
what ridings all about freedom and unity

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.640 
what ridings all about freedom and unity
one<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.480> pasture<00:04:20.870> represent<00:04:21.350> film

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
one of the pasture represent film

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.500 
one of the pasture represent film
because<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.070> beauty<00:04:22.490> of<00:04:22.520> film<00:04:22.880> is<00:04:23.150> that<00:04:23.360> it

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
because the beauty of film is that it

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.050 
because the beauty of film is that it
unites<00:04:23.930> while<00:04:24.290> speaking<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:25.040> each<00:04:25.280> individual

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
unites while speaking to each individual

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.680 
unites while speaking to each individual
and<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:26.240> think<00:04:26.510> writing<00:04:26.810> does<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.470> same

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
and I think writing does the same

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.490 
and I think writing does the same
whether<00:04:29.690> you're<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.960> group<00:04:30.260> or

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
whether you're in a group or

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.130 
whether you're in a group or
acknowledging<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:31.520> single<00:04:31.910> rider<00:04:32.150> we<00:04:32.780> all<00:04:32.930> have

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
acknowledging a single rider we all have

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.410 
acknowledging a single rider we all have
this<00:04:33.260> unspoken<00:04:33.680> bond<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.640> I<00:04:34.850> think<00:04:35.330> the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
this unspoken bond and I think the

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.879 
this unspoken bond and I think the
freedom<00:04:35.630> jacket<00:04:36.140> represents<00:04:36.680> that

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.739 

I<00:04:39.039> think<00:04:39.729> it<00:04:39.789> was<00:04:39.879> cool<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.270> they<00:04:40.389> added<00:04:40.569> a

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:40.749 
I think it was cool that they added a

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:42.570 
I think it was cool that they added a
patch<00:04:40.960> honoring<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.620> iron<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.009> lead<00:04:42.189> because

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
patch honoring the iron and lead because

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.999 
patch honoring the iron and lead because
it<00:04:42.879> represents<00:04:43.689> Harley's<00:04:44.229> long<00:04:44.409> history<00:04:44.770> with

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
it represents Harley's long history with
