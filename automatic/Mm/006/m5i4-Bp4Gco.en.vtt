of<00:01:46.240> quarters<00:01:46.570> will<00:01:46.750> turn<00:01:46.960> off<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:48.280> they<00:01:48.460> don't

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
of quarters will turn off now they don't

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.530 
of quarters will turn off now they don't
remember<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:49.000> amount

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
remember that amount

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.360 
remember that amount
so<00:01:49.840> that's<00:01:50.050> that'll<00:01:50.740> get<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.950> best<00:01:51.130> espresso

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
so that's that'll get the best espresso

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.680 
so that's that'll get the best espresso
out<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:51.790> these<00:01:51.880> machines<00:01:52.240> if<00:01:52.420> you're<00:01:52.570> using

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
out of these machines if you're using

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.240 
out of these machines if you're using
oily<00:01:53.140> beans<00:01:53.380> for<00:01:53.710> some<00:01:53.830> reason<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.190> don't

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
oily beans for some reason I don't

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.590 
oily beans for some reason I don't
usually<00:01:54.550> recommend<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:55.240> they're<00:01:55.420> really

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
usually recommend it they're really

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.420 
usually recommend it they're really
shiny<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:56.860> may<00:01:56.979> have<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.190> go<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.310> little

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
shiny you may have to go a little

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.310 
shiny you may have to go a little
coarser<00:01:57.910> if<00:01:57.970> they<00:01:58.090> could<00:01:58.270> get<00:01:58.450> clogged<00:01:59.020> up<00:01:59.229> in

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
coarser if they could get clogged up in

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.930 
coarser if they could get clogged up in
there<00:01:59.500> so<00:01:59.860> probably<00:02:00.160> go<00:02:00.430> up<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.670> middle

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
there so probably go up to the middle

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.600 
there so probably go up to the middle
setting<00:02:01.240> on<00:02:01.510> your<00:02:01.660> grinder<00:02:01.960> setting<00:02:02.460> okay<00:02:03.460> you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
setting on your grinder setting okay you

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.950 
setting on your grinder setting okay you
want<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.820> do<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:03.940> tall<00:02:04.270> cup<00:02:04.510> of<00:02:04.600> coffee<00:02:04.750> let's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
want to do a tall cup of coffee let's

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.820 
want to do a tall cup of coffee let's
say<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.110> do<00:02:05.229> want<00:02:05.380> an<00:02:05.470> 8<00:02:05.650> ounce<00:02:05.800> cup<00:02:05.979> of<00:02:06.190> coffee

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
say you do want an 8 ounce cup of coffee

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.530 
say you do want an 8 ounce cup of coffee
what<00:02:08.830> we'll<00:02:08.979> do<00:02:09.100> we<00:02:09.490> have<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.700> set<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.030> up<00:02:10.210> to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
what we'll do we have to set this up to

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.120 
what we'll do we have to set this up to
a<00:02:10.570> course<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.990> setting<00:02:11.230> your<00:02:11.350> or<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:11.860> will

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
a course of setting your or you will

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.920 
a course of setting your or you will
over<00:02:12.430> extract<00:02:12.910> too<00:02:13.150> much<00:02:13.300> water<00:02:13.480> through<00:02:13.780> to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
over extract too much water through to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.120 
over extract too much water through to
find<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.260> coffee<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.680> bad

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
find a coffee is bad

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.770 
find a coffee is bad
so<00:02:15.790> what<00:02:16.150> I'm<00:02:16.240> gonna<00:02:16.360> do<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.600> I'm<00:02:16.720> gonna

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.240 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
program<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.380> while<00:02:17.590> we're<00:02:17.740> doing<00:02:17.860> it

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
program this while we're doing it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.880 
program this while we're doing it
I'm<00:02:18.580> gonna<00:02:18.700> push<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.030> hold<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.300> button<00:02:19.800> get<00:02:20.800> a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
I'm gonna push it hold this button get a

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.360 
I'm gonna push it hold this button get a
program<00:02:21.130> mode<00:02:22.530> I'm<00:02:23.530> gonna<00:02:23.770> set<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.130> course

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
program mode I'm gonna set this course

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.020 
program mode I'm gonna set this course
to<00:02:24.520> push<00:02:24.760> down<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.209> turn<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.980> I'll<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.160> second

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
to push down and turn it I'll go second

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.790 
to push down and turn it I'll go second
from<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.209> off<00:02:28.450> courses

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
from the off courses

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.570 
from the off courses
like<00:02:31.220> flashing<00:02:31.790> their<00:02:33.310> meeting<00:02:34.310> it's<00:02:34.430> gonna

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
like flashing their meeting it's gonna

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.640 
like flashing their meeting it's gonna
that's<00:02:34.880> gonna<00:02:35.090> program<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.960> correct<00:02:36.500> it's

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
that's gonna program this correct it's

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.830 
that's gonna program this correct it's
in<00:02:36.770> program<00:02:37.130> mode<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.600> then<00:02:38.600> we're<00:02:38.810> just

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
in program mode and then we're just

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.290 
in program mode and then we're just
gonna<00:02:39.050> let<00:02:39.140> this<00:02:39.380> run<00:02:39.910> till<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.000> fills<00:02:41.150> up

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
gonna let this run till it fills up

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.420 
gonna let this run till it fills up
about<00:02:41.540> four<00:02:41.780> ounces<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.140> coffee<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.220> then

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
about four ounces of coffee and then

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.500 
about four ounces of coffee and then
what<00:02:43.640> we'll<00:02:43.790> do<00:02:43.880> if<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.150> want<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.360> eat<00:02:44.450> down

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
what we'll do if you want to eat down

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.290 
what we'll do if you want to eat down
sack<00:02:44.720> up<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:45.710> push<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> button<00:02:46.100> twice<00:02:46.460> so<00:02:47.210> you

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
sack up you push a button twice so you

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.970 
sack up you push a button twice so you
prove<00:02:47.480> two<00:02:47.660> cups<00:02:47.930> one<00:02:48.140> right<00:02:48.320> in<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> row<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:48.920> you

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
prove two cups one right in a row so you

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.060 
prove two cups one right in a row so you
get<00:02:50.230> double<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.260> strength<00:02:51.620> instead<00:02:51.920> of

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
get double the strength instead of

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.860 
get double the strength instead of
trying<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.340> boot<00:02:52.580> eight<00:02:52.790> ounces<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.360> whatever

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
trying to boot eight ounces to whatever

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.650 
trying to boot eight ounces to whatever
it's<00:02:54.170> grinding<00:02:54.700> it'll<00:02:55.700> be<00:02:55.820> it'll<00:02:56.180> be<00:02:56.300> too<00:02:56.480> weak

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
it's grinding it'll be it'll be too weak

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.270 
it's grinding it'll be it'll be too weak
it<00:02:57.650> won't<00:02:57.860> be<00:02:57.950> good<00:02:59.500> okay<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:00.920> when<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.130> get

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
it won't be good okay so when you get

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280 
it won't be good okay so when you get
where<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.460> want<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.880> which<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.480> roughly<00:03:02.780> about

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
where you want it which is roughly about

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.480 
where you want it which is roughly about
there<00:03:04.420> that'll<00:03:05.420> stop<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.160> general

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
there that'll stop it so the general

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.360 
there that'll stop it so the general
rule<00:03:07.520> is<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.510> longer<00:03:09.230> water<00:03:09.500> contact<00:03:10.100> time

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
rule is a longer water contact time

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.320 
rule is a longer water contact time
coarser<00:03:10.970> grind<00:03:11.560> correct<00:03:12.560> yep<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.090> for<00:03:14.270> the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
coarser grind correct yep and it for the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.590 
coarser grind correct yep and it for the
longer<00:03:14.660> coffee<00:03:14.930> err<00:03:15.080> more<00:03:15.860> water<00:03:16.100> contact

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
longer coffee err more water contact

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.460 
longer coffee err more water contact
exactly<00:03:17.600> so<00:03:17.720> you're<00:03:17.840> balancing<00:03:18.380> the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
exactly so you're balancing the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.020 
exactly so you're balancing the
extraction<00:03:18.980> time<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.460> coarseness<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:19.970> the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
extraction time to the coarseness of the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.900 
extraction time to the coarseness of the
coffee<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.950> if<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.100> want<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.310> full<00:03:22.490> cup<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.670> coffee

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
coffee so if I want a full cup of coffee

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.550 
coffee so if I want a full cup of coffee
I<00:03:23.060> will<00:03:23.210> just<00:03:23.360> push<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.720> button<00:03:23.780> twice<00:03:24.140> at<00:03:24.530> a

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
I will just push that button twice at a

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.260 
I will just push that button twice at a
grind<00:03:24.800> tap<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.190> brew<00:03:25.310> two<00:03:25.520> full<00:03:25.790> round<00:03:25.970> shots

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
grind tap and brew two full round shots

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.080 
grind tap and brew two full round shots
