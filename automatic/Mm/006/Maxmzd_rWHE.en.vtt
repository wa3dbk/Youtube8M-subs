00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
to be going over how to apply a megadome

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.629 
to be going over how to apply a megadome
animation<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:19.000> our<00:05:19.150> character<00:05:20.099> so<00:05:21.099> that's<00:05:21.430> it

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
animation to our character so that's it

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.640 
animation to our character so that's it
for<00:05:21.789> this<00:05:21.880> one<00:05:22.060> that's<00:05:22.870> how<00:05:22.990> you<00:05:23.050> create<00:05:23.200> a<00:05:23.440> rag
