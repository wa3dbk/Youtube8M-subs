found out about this guy about a month
ago<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:54.410> thought<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.500> was<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.969> researched

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
ago and I thought it was I researched

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.930 
ago and I thought it was I researched
the<00:00:57.120> hell<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> internet<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the hell out of it on the internet and I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.160 
the hell out of it on the internet and I
heard<00:01:00.120> nothing<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.539> good<00:01:00.690> things<00:01:00.750> about<00:01:01.020> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
so i thought i would give it a try and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.060 
so i thought i would give it a try and
I'm<00:01:03.239> kind<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.449> glad<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.660> did<00:01:06.950> when<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> first

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
I think this gun came out last year and

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.710 
I think this gun came out last year and
there<00:03:28.190> was<00:03:28.340> problems<00:03:28.820> at<00:03:29.030> first<00:03:29.300> with<00:03:29.510> the

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
there was problems at first with the
