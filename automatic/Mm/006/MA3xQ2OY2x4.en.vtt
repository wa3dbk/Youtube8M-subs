00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 after the match with Brescia won for 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.450
 3 to 2 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.950
 closes with michel platini but 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.690
 I can't be tired of something that you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.280
 loved my pension 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.230
 one is a very passionate passion I have 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.330
 always defended I feel loved gave me 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.100
 all how can I criticize football 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:26.580
 instead the world in which football takes place 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:29.580
 it's not that I like serene vivacity 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.410
 you just want the markers that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.510
 they decide juventus brescia 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.920
 last sad day of a championship 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.920
 not positive for juventus 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.469
 the bad mood is all of the Lombard ones 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.600
 demoted in series b and the whole environment 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.520
 to have the lump in my throat because 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.309
 The time has come for Michel's greeting 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.590
 platini of wind in those years inside 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.250
 after old 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.280
 its purpose 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.240
 sorry for paola better enough with the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.070
 football 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.350
 French no longer has a crumb 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.989
 energy costs to have done two years 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.720
 of not being able to suffer demonstrated anymore 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.400
 more on this than not being able to have the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.500
 want to improve myself and I think not 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.260
 it will improve more from that then 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.630
 you want to start and be 17 years old e 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.550
 start that makes the company 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.700
 giampiero boniperti is not good at 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.260
 organize godly ceremonies 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.420
 nothing more than a race under the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.369
 curve a few bunches of flowers 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.649
 adoring public and the canonical ones 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.380
 post-match interviews but the same 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.460
 michelle at the bottom did nothing for 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.280
 color his last game there 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.140
 they are flashes because the real reality is that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.220
 le roux has long since abdicated 19 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.619
 October 1986 in ascoli last goal in 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.229
 platinum league an eternity for 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.930
 anyone like him has won three times 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.640
 the top scorer ranking 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.770
 Golden ball kit from 1983 to 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.659
 1985 and wright and now that balloon 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.909
 coltano nipple does not want to go 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.069
 is no longer bordering on me 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.170
 Platinum perplexity and managed better 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.400
 of any adjective the apathy of the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.599
 juventus died at the age of 32 on the 17th 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.090
 May 1987 writes as incipit of his 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.590
 book is a thank you friends for what 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.560
 made us come in five years of 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.890
 soccer in Italy closes an era in 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.340
 that Sunday and the main character at 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.530
 usual air of a past there by chance 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.349
 that French snobbery of those who don't 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.379
 withstands the Italian exaggerations 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.599
 high-sounding adjectives and some are right 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.840
 because for michel platini it was 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.209
 normal to be michel platini I asked 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 how come never a little distant 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.480
 I think the journalists you said about 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.730
 people had a very nice phrase 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.440
 liked it to death but if not me 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.239
 give everyone what remains 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.210
 in my secret garden 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.650
 you remember 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.710
 Now you've got the secret garden 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.620
 all for saying this i hope no i hope 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.600
 yes I don't know but understands it to be 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.150
 always on everyone's eyes is a pleasure 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.320
 difficult me ​​and when they all close 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.320
 the optics will be defended 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.770
 the first night after the football farewell I have 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.680
 did you sleep well 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.790
 you journalists are sorrowful 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.790
 life goes on
