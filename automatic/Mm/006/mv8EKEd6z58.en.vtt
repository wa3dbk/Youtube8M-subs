hey guys found this cool kryptonite

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.379 
hey guys found this cool kryptonite
tubular<00:00:07.109> padlock<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> other<00:00:07.950> day<00:00:08.389> thought

I'd do demo for you and show you how to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.080 
I'd do demo for you and show you how to
pick<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:13.019> still<00:00:13.320> works<00:00:14.420> it's<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.570> key<00:00:17.090> you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
pick it so it still works it's a key you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.990 
pick it so it still works it's a key you
can<00:00:18.270> pick<00:00:18.480> these<00:00:18.660> with<00:00:18.930> dedicated<00:00:19.410> picks<00:00:20.000> but

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
can pick these with dedicated picks but

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.570 
can pick these with dedicated picks but
you<00:00:21.150> don't<00:00:21.390> need<00:00:21.750> them<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.350> use<00:00:23.160> homemade

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
you don't need them you use homemade

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.150 
you don't need them you use homemade
tools<00:00:23.910> like<00:00:24.330> I'm<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.689> using<00:00:24.960> today

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
tools like I'm going to be using today

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.849 
tools like I'm going to be using today
the<00:00:26.160> trickiest<00:00:26.640> part<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.529> pickiness<00:00:28.529> type<00:00:28.740> of

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the trickiest part of pickiness type of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.890 
the trickiest part of pickiness type of
lock<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.189> getting<00:00:29.519> tension<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.599> I'm<00:00:30.720> going

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
lock is getting tension and so I'm going

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.240 
lock is getting tension and so I'm going
to<00:00:30.960> be<00:00:31.050> using<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:32.149> binder<00:00:33.149> clip<00:00:33.480> handle<00:00:34.260> because

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
to be using a binder clip handle because

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.510 
to be using a binder clip handle because
it's<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.780> right<00:00:36.989> shape<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:38.250> pretty

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
it's the right shape and it's pretty

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.970 
it's the right shape and it's pretty
strong<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.870> manipulate<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> pins<00:00:40.739> we're

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
strong and to manipulate the pins we're

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.330 
strong and to manipulate the pins we're
using<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.370> broken<00:00:41.910> hook<00:00:43.010> but<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.250> use

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
using a broken hook but you can use

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
using a broken hook but you can use
anything<00:00:44.600> just<00:00:45.600> sturdy<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.410> pointy<00:00:47.010> oh<00:00:48.140> this

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
anything just sturdy and pointy oh this

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.439 
anything just sturdy and pointy oh this
particular<00:00:49.649> lock<00:00:49.920> has<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:50.940> interesting

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
particular lock has an interesting

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
particular lock has an interesting
feature<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.129> pins<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
feature and that all the pins have a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
feature and that all the pins have a
different<00:00:54.870> springiness<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.100> springs

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
different springiness so the springs

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
different springiness so the springs
have<00:00:56.550> different<00:00:56.910> tension<00:00:57.300> some<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:57.690> soft<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
have different tension some are soft and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.849 
have different tension some are soft and
some<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.609> harder<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> push<00:00:59.940> down<00:01:00.469> so<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.620> get

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
some are harder to push down so to get

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
some are harder to push down so to get
tension<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.699> need<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> put<00:01:03.210> place<00:01:03.539> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
tension you just need to put place this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
tension you just need to put place this
in<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:05.570> place<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:08.630> foot<00:01:10.010> just<00:01:11.010> sitting

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
in here place the foot just sitting

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.570 
in here place the foot just sitting
there<00:01:11.310> alright<00:01:12.650> you<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.680> need<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> shape<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
there alright you just need to shape it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.910 
there alright you just need to shape it
with<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> pair<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.630> pliers<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.409> something<00:01:16.799> like

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
with a pair of pliers or something like

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.899 
with a pair of pliers or something like
that<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:19.890> trying<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.640> through

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that so so I'm trying to do this through

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
that so so I'm trying to do this through
the<00:01:21.000> viewfinder<00:01:23.540> okay<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.600> you'll<00:01:25.590> feel<00:01:25.830> when

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the viewfinder okay so you'll feel when

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.640 
the viewfinder okay so you'll feel when
you<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.310> tension<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> when<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.350> tension

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you get tension so when you get tension

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.359 
you get tension so when you get tension
you<00:01:29.780> just<00:01:30.780> kind<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:30.990> hold<00:01:31.140> onto<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.710> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you just kind of hold onto it like that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.929 
you just kind of hold onto it like that
and<00:01:33.920> just<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.070> picking<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> regular<00:01:35.729> lock

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and just like picking a regular lock

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.090 
and just like picking a regular lock
you're<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:36.509> around<00:01:36.750> trying<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.320> feel

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
you're going to go around trying to feel

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.730 
you're going to go around trying to feel
which<00:01:38.369> pin<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.759> binding<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:39.590> push<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
which pin is binding and then push it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.789 
which pin is binding and then push it
down<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.520> should<00:01:41.909> set<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.649> go

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
down and that should set so as I go

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.020 
down and that should set so as I go
around<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.189> should<00:01:44.250> hear<00:01:44.579> these<00:01:44.729> pins

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
around you should hear these pins

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:57.940 
around you should hear these pins
setting<00:01:50.720> to

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.069 

before

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:13.550 

okay<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:07.210> still<00:02:07.539> springy<00:02:07.869> so<00:02:08.619> we'll<00:02:08.800> go<00:02:08.950> back

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.809 

yep<00:02:14.670> got<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.830> we'll<00:02:17.830> just<00:02:18.040> turn<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.760> like

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
yep got it so we'll just turn it like

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.490 
yep got it so we'll just turn it like
that<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.569> opens<00:02:21.180> okay<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:22.569> think<00:02:22.870> one<00:02:23.470> of

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
that and it opens okay so I think one of

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.070 
that and it opens okay so I think one of
these<00:02:23.879> pins<00:02:24.879> is<00:02:26.970> cut<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.269> deep<00:02:28.569> on<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.900> key

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
these pins is cut really deep on the key

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.240 
these pins is cut really deep on the key
because<00:02:29.410> one<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.620> didn't<00:02:30.040> need<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> even<00:02:31.030> set

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
because one I didn't need to even set

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.400 
because one I didn't need to even set
this<00:02:33.250> one<00:02:33.519> here<00:02:33.849> so<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.840> didn't<00:02:35.110> even<00:02:35.170> really

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
this one here so I didn't even really

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.350 
this one here so I didn't even really
need<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.709> push<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.040> one<00:02:36.220> down<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:38.019> yeah<00:02:39.360> these

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
need to push that one down so yeah these

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.240 
need to push that one down so yeah these
aren't<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:41.319> don't<00:02:41.530> see<00:02:41.620> these<00:02:41.739> much<00:02:41.799> anymore

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
aren't you don't see these much anymore

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.880 
aren't you don't see these much anymore

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
for that reason they're not that hard to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.830 
for that reason they're not that hard to
pick<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:47.849> yeah<00:02:48.849> but<00:02:49.090> they're<00:02:49.269> still<00:02:49.480> kind<00:02:49.720> of
