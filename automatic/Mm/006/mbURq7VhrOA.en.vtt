00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
of the many sets available I think this

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.520

again<00:04:53.039> because<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.460> all<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:53.940> detail<00:04:54.449> and

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
again because of all the detail and

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.149 
again because of all the detail and
strangeness<00:04:55.889> I<00:04:56.400> believe<00:04:57.240> it's<00:04:57.419> priced<00:04:57.750> around

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:58.159 
strangeness I believe it's priced around

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.649 
strangeness I believe it's priced around
29.99<00:04:59.159> so<00:04:59.610> it's<00:04:59.759> a<00:04:59.849> pretty<00:05:00.090> good<00:05:00.330> price

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659
