00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.530
 hello it is from the basement today we 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.360
 got an angry letter 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.799
 and in what they are dry 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.449
 who tell them what will be complete 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.119
 better noted that in general not play 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.939
 we have what 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.869
 we do not need to know a stone to beat 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.669
 to 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.450
 the outcome became normal 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.050
 2 but generally new stadium 100 full 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.050
 so today we will fight 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.609
 in sabitov will pass right 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.099
 now 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.179
 lessons we share 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:34.610
 so simple 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.570
 now we will meet it became boring 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.080
 the prosecutor's office of the Perm region apparently 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.220
 speech according to 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.640
 spawn percentage 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.640
 conducted from half a word 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.030
 this class will not 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.790
 and even more so with closed eyes I 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.680
 I think it will be someone else 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.160
 won 5 deliver and Caspian in this village 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.200
 miss russia so could main battle 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.690
 watch this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.000
 it is so as traitor eyes 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.300
 I try and periodically 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.810
 press 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.719
 on what 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.330
 keys so much attack 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.900
 get used to it most 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.140
 honestly pay directions 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.210
 by the way unlike mortal kombat 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 everything is bad here 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.110
 not mad at the individual buttons and he 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 as is well known prohibition of the purchase 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.810
 easy enough 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.990
 we see him as a winner 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.740
 the back key did not help 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 because I did not understand 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.040
 this project is not so much 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.440
 Spartak player Ecura 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.360
 for this year 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.020
 by the way 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 hands hurt after every match 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.550
 then I learned years of training 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.850
 By the way I want to note that 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.260
 some players play 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.300
 and play with them 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.220
 quite difficult 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.260
 than joystick turns 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.980
 in the sense of playing with players like 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.280
 lose in part 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.840
 itar tass it fails such 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.490
 receptions 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.189
 the market shows over 8 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.889
 here for example from any combination of the ussr 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.529
 He built about what used 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.149
 what is that in one soul gathered 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.659
 the key 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.659
 just unreal 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.209
 keyboard already in his youth shirt 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.189
 we will not his wife and scold 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.429
 complex issue 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.149
 and then 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:35.599
 Here I will carry square 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.669
 embracing 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.369
 one more time and it generally 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.020
 most likely affects 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.709
 extras 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.099
 key crowds 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.289
 they are shipping 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.439
 but we don't know it for million st 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.619
 we guessed it 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.419
 because we do not like to offend 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.419
 me boys who passed 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:00.859
 girls and features 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.849
 not easy 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.889
 so here is the second fight 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.249
 this time in 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:07.809
 I will fight the ocean 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.429
 in the photo laugh all 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.079
 and dad debts 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:13.859
 I choose 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.449
 characters to descendants 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.829
 he has enough shocks 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.679
 easiest to play potemkin 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.079
 on the keyboard because he 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.989
 According to enough protvino 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.309
 continue on speedway 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:28.089
 number of strokes 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.389
 many times less than 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.569
 other characters 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.569
 there is no 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.509
 stress is all hitting 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.769
 this is the most powerful blow he takes from them 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.549
 a quarter of honor 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.959
 four hits and a way out of them 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.839
 i play like that 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:52.389
 Many consider it a cure because 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.479
 the character is supposedly not balanced by 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.489
 everything was very calm 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.879
 balanced balanced gift 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.699
 well here look last yes 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.139
 not 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.729
 in tents 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.189
 but 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.019
 bob help all over 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.730
 some kind of resist here 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.729
 see and by the way we don't have 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.019
 This character could cause a clinic 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.019
 besides not helped 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.569
 they with leadership 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.069
 we decided to play 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.270
 I understood clearly as I understood during 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.219
 dry very upset that's why 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.080
 and do not try to build a court 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.050
 we all won 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.520
 yes we won 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.169
 I don't know why people call themselves 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.639
 Tatarstan for example, I can be because 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.550
 they are in locks like extreme masked 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.949
 being bullied by dogs 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.419
 why choose shinsky 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.319
 in the camp is most similar here by the way 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.150
 speaking characters 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.479
 about some Putin 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:54.849
 hard to determine 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.960
 here he is disconnect by the way he 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.189
 what we are not used to each 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.659
 I just did not see 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.400
 but 100 many 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.559
 the players 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.609
 when they start to lose Shumakov 

00:05:07.609 --> 00:05:10.199
 Christ does not lead the game out there 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.159
 or 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.059
 defeat defense 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:15.529
 it was a very low class country 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.749
 developers to do 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:20.710
 here we are fighting with 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.930
 a and so on 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.930
 we will hope that he did not answer 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.460
 hijacking is not done the same powder 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.580
 Well I spoke masterfully 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.059
 the word play in Europe 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:41.969
 no, no veins playing 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.900
 well, okay, this is what guys were playing 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.219
 here he will show that east Moscow 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.339
 According to the head of the priests, why does he need it 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:50.080
 made 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.439
 this is the only one 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.680
 Well, in general, we probably 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.960
 making mass January 19 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.470
 we won the color don't forget to go on 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.789
 sites with failure 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.789
 film forum 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.990
 hall of city hall
