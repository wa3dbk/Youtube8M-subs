 but also for the Sunday program 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.520
 It is the one that aired every weekend on 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.250
 radio number one 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.260
 you can also find it in podcast format if 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.760
 you want or you can listen to it if not 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.240
 you are in an age of radio reception 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.510
 number one 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.090
 you can also listen online then 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.370
 in a period of great announcements by 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.219
 great news great releases e 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.170
 let's go back a bit in time to 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.629
 meet a product that actually was 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.620
 was announced many months ago then they are 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.500
 a little lost track 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.899
 samsung had chosen to take some 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.160
 more time before throwing this 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.870
 product on the market had been 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.399
 announced for the end of December is in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.570
 actually came to the market only in the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.399
 month of January 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.829
 I speak of the Italian market among other things 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.189
 January forwarded vote is not easy 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.890
 finding this product is easier 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.450
 finding it online in Italy is easy 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.430
 find it in the big chains of 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.619
 electronics for the rest is not really 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.270
 one of those who will fall on you 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.850
 entering any store of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.799
 telephony, however, let's talk about samsung a 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.130
 tvs or samsung's version of 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.600
 windows phone 8 the shape of the box is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.640
 that of almost all samsung products 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.040
 now even what's inside is one 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.750
 form that we know very well for a 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.329
 product that I like very much I have to say 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.730
 then let's take a good look at the phone 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.460
 let's see the box 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.040
 what offers a beautiful booklet of 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.840
 instructions is perfect for making the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.540
 shims under the tables when you have 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.000
 some tables wobbling inside the house 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.950
 I believe this would be the only true one 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320
 utility for the instruction booklet e 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.470
 applies to all electronic products 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.450
 of the world since nobody reads them 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.250
 charger is always the cable 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.290
 usb and then the earphones in ear with the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.150
 adapters 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:16.560
 in addition to this in the box there is also 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.390
 obviously the phone that is in practice 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.700
 a galaxy s iii with an operating system 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.020
 different ie if you see it right it is 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.450
 exactly the impact he had on 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.560
 galaxy s iii i have to say with some 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.640
 very positive aspects we have for 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.220
 order, however, upper part 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.840
 noise balance and 3 mm jack 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.920
 and a half for the headset on this side there is 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.220
 the power button and then the button 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.370
 camera that as you know in windows 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.280
 zone is always a physical key and a key 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.020
 very precise choice of microsoft that you 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.440
 gives the possibility to unlock the 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.489
 phone even when it's in rock version 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.770
 by pressing this button you can 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.330
 activate at any time the 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.950
 camera on the lower part 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:14.420
 instead there is the usb attack and on this 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.280
 side the infamous now well-known 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.600
 incredibly famous valium rock 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.739
 or the volume rocker from one 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.239
 amazing thing beautiful you 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.040
 crush the volume on this side 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.950
 salt where you crush on this side 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.520
 the volume goes down is a magic that I do not 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.920
 I still can't explain myself on the back you have 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.020
 this material I'm looking for 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.720
 play a game i hope francesco i do 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.210
 always gives a hand with the videos succeed in 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.790
 capture it looks like aluminum but is not in 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:51.410
 in reality it is a material like that 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.510
 of the samsung galaxy s3 you see is a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.910
 material and I believe it is polycarbonate 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.960
 this too with this small grid 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.810
 on the bottom that hides the high gab 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.120
 which you actually see is so small 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.190
 grid instead spreads the given idea 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.240
 talking a little bit about everyone on the whole 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:16.670
 micro sd phone you can insert one 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:19.880
 micro sd up to 32gb officially and then 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:24.920
 a micro sim battery is the one that 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.770
 you see exactly I say it is one 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.420
 battery that I can never find i 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.310
 one thousand amps 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.370
 I tell you and in a second year 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:39.350
 should be exactly the battery 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:43.490
 of the samsung galaxy of 2,300 milly unfair 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.500
 this is the battery power e 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.480
 you see that enough fits 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.930
 easily as it happened for the 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.330
 galaxy s3 in particular this model 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.140
 I noticed something rather special 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.630
 decentralized the room compared to 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.160
 compared to the cover but these are and 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.870
 demons and therefore not only units 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.710
 commercial then always send us 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.060
 they are one hundred percent perfect 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.250
 we completed the tour saw me 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.330
 8 megapixel camera 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.490
 the cover with the LED flash also says so 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.750
 and therefore you see in practice the 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.770
 also feature of the camera 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.580
 on the front as always 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.490
 the sensors the front camera and then 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.530
 the goddess part of the audio on the in part 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.080
 low this is the feature that 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.600
 differentiates this phone from the s3 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.810
 changes practically only the key with the 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.720
 windows phone symbol and then i 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.030
 the usual keys are the search keys 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.820
 universal of windows phone is that of 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.340
 back that also the key with which one is 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.640
 handles multitasking 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.890
 then I told you quick preview for 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.640
 tell him about a dual core nfc phone he has 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.980
 all the typical features of a 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.170
 high-end product in Italy comes 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.080
 sold for 539 euros, however, you can find it at 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.900
 much more interesting prices online 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.610
 I find it a very nice product since 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.960
 point of view of the functionality of the 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.810
 ease of lightness e 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.340
 especially weighs are 130 grams which is 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.300
 for this kind of products today 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.680
 obviously becomes an interesting weight 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.500
 the pressure of windows phone and is the most 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:31.230
 recent that samsung is known for sure 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.620
 missing the goodies in quotes that i 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.170
 nokia products then offer the nokia 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.210
 drive in particular and then all are 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.250
 other things that nokia has developed 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.140
 specifically for windows phone that 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.910
 make it from the perspective of perhaps 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.790
 completeness of the software experience 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.080
 with windows phone a miti now though 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.700
 it must be said that in terms of quality 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.710
 camera quality screen 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.840
 in short, a series of characteristics 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.540
 this is a product that competes 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:02.120
 very well then again 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.860
 you who are rich properly not 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.020
 there you have nothing to do to retest 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.970
 you are there to balance the pixels for 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.650
 thumb all these nine guide I have not 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.479
 having said that it is better product 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.310
 I said that if you should enter a 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.320
 shop and buy and spend ours 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.240
 money because you like windows phone e 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.970
 you want a great phone of 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.320
 windows phone and with this surely 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.080
 you will not be disappointed 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.080
 this then nokia lumia 920 these are the 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.500
 two products in my opinion at the top of the 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.030
 range to think about if you want a windows 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.500
 phone the next few days we will do one 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.450
 full review we're going to see them all 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.880
 the functions all the hidden aspects 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:40.280
 of this phone 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.510
 Meanwhile, thanks for following this 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.510
 moment on the mister gadget
