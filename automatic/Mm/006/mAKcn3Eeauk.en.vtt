on<00:00:06.839> subsurface<00:00:07.620> scattering<00:00:08.010> so<00:00:08.900> what<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:09.929> have

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
on subsurface scattering so what I have

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.270 
on subsurface scattering so what I have
here<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.620> very<00:00:11.160> bad<00:00:11.610> model<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.769> candle<00:00:13.769> okay

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
here is a very bad model of candle okay

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.060 
here is a very bad model of candle okay
uh-huh<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.230> think<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.440> all<00:00:16.560> agree<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
uh-huh I think we can all agree it's a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.240 
uh-huh I think we can all agree it's a
very<00:00:17.340> very<00:00:17.730> bad<00:00:18.000> model<00:00:19.340> but<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:21.800> have<00:00:22.800> global

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
very very bad model but I have global

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.279 
very very bad model but I have global
illumination<00:00:23.460> turn<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.630> everything<00:00:24.840> so

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
illumination turn on and everything so

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.080 
illumination turn on and everything so
let's<00:00:25.529> let's<00:00:25.890> take<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> look<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> light

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
let's let's take a look with the light

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.670 
let's let's take a look with the light
on<00:00:27.119> by<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> way<00:00:27.960> don't<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.289> don't<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
on by the way don't we don't have the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.950 
on by the way don't we don't have the
flame<00:00:28.980> yet<00:00:29.250> let's<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.269> assume<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
flame yet let's just assume we have the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.170 
flame yet let's just assume we have the
flame<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.500> let's<00:00:31.830> look<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.910> light

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
flame but let's look but we have light

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
flame but let's look but we have light
anyway<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.570> let's<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.410> happens<00:00:34.440> if

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
anyway so let's just see what happens if

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.740 
anyway so let's just see what happens if
we<00:00:35.190> render<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.670> using<00:00:36.030> global<00:00:36.180> illumination

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.600 

this<00:00:39.750> happens<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.410> don't<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:40.860> nothing<00:00:41.430> else

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
this happens you don't see nothing else

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.779 
this happens you don't see nothing else
you<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.510> stick<00:00:43.379> or<00:00:43.800> whatever<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you just see the stick or whatever the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.479 
you just see the stick or whatever the
Flint<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.809> called<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.399> just<00:00:47.399> see

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
Flint I think it's called and just see

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.880 
Flint I think it's called and just see
that<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.820> part<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.809> real<00:00:49.200> candle<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that this part but in a real candle to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.680 
that this part but in a real candle to
light<00:00:50.070> would<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.640> through<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.270> would<00:00:51.510> see

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
light would go through and you would see

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.619 
light would go through and you would see
some<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.379> part<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.149> a<00:00:54.149> little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.570> of

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
some of this part and a little bit of

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.790 
some of this part and a little bit of
others<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.590> well<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.420> here

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
others as well but you don't see it here

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.190 
others as well but you don't see it here
so<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:02.780> basically

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.719 

turn<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.500> today<00:01:07.710> first<00:01:08.189> because<00:01:08.580> it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
turn on them today first because it's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.670 
turn on them today first because it's
going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.659> bright<00:01:12.409> that's<00:01:13.409> too<00:01:13.920> low

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
going to be that bright that's too low

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.649 
going to be that bright that's too low
but<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.369> good<00:01:17.850> oh<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:20.390> yeah<00:01:21.390> that's

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
but that's that's good oh so yeah that's

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.649 
but that's that's good oh so yeah that's
kind<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.110> whatever<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.090> first<00:01:24.450> thing

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
kind of whatever right so first thing

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.160 
kind of whatever right so first thing
we're<00:01:24.780> gonna<00:01:24.930> do<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.619> get<00:01:25.830> some<00:01:26.280> light<00:01:26.580> um

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
we're gonna do is to get some light um

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
we're gonna do is to get some light um
let's<00:01:28.170> make<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.369> course

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
let's make this more like can of course

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.950 
let's make this more like can of course
without<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.150> much<00:01:30.270> reflection<00:01:30.689> because

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
without so much reflection because

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.780 
without so much reflection because
candle<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> bit<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.960> tad<00:01:34.560> bit

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
candle is a bit just a tad bit

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.870 
candle is a bit just a tad bit
reflective<00:01:35.790> 0<00:01:36.590> for<00:01:37.590> 4<00:01:39.409> yeah<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.710> will<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
reflective 0 for 4 yeah that will do and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.060 
reflective 0 for 4 yeah that will do and
add<00:01:42.210> some<00:01:42.390> bump

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
add some bump

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:54.520 
add some bump
the<00:01:45.060> boys<00:01:47.690> down<00:01:48.690> right<00:01:50.840> that's<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:52.790> good

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
the boys down right that's that's good

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.070 
the boys down right that's that's good
so<00:01:55.530> um<00:01:55.830> let's<00:01:56.340> add<00:01:56.580> some<00:01:56.610> sort<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.390> panels

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
so um let's add some sort of like panels

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.120 
so um let's add some sort of like panels
let<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.220> a<00:01:59.250> phone<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:01.020> simulate<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
let that like a phone to simulate the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.530 
let that like a phone to simulate the
walls<00:02:02.400> um<00:02:04.190> where<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.220> can<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.580> put<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.759> really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
walls um where you can just put a really

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:16.960 
walls um where you can just put a really
small<00:02:07.050> light<00:02:08.660> no<00:02:09.660> matter<00:02:10.350> what<00:02:10.740> you<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:11.280> what

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:26.960 

okay<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.030> let's<00:02:18.420> try<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.080> once<00:02:19.560> more<00:02:25.820> as<00:02:26.820> you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
okay so let's try this once more as you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.460 
okay so let's try this once more as you
can<00:02:27.090> see<00:02:27.239> now<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.600> can<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> little<00:02:28.320> bit

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
can see now you can see a little bit

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.220 
can see now you can see a little bit
more<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.070> but<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.550> still<00:02:30.150> don't<00:02:30.600> seed

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
more of this but you still don't seed

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.500 
more of this but you still don't seed
light<00:02:31.680> kind<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.070> going<00:02:32.340> through<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.239> that's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
light kind of going through so that's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.830 
light kind of going through so that's
where<00:02:33.690> subsurface<00:02:34.140> scattering<00:02:34.410> comes<00:02:35.040> in

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
where subsurface scattering comes in

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.900 
where subsurface scattering comes in
come<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:36.959> here<00:02:37.170> turn<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.709> luminance<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.430> just

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
come in here turn on luminance and just

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.330 
come in here turn on luminance and just
go<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.269> subsurface<00:02:39.989> scattering<00:02:40.470> effect

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
go to a subsurface scattering effect

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.340 
go to a subsurface scattering effect
subsurface<00:02:42.000> scattering<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:44.550> boom<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.570> if

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
subsurface scattering and boom and if

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.030 
subsurface scattering and boom and if
you<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.590> leave<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.220> like<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.430> or<00:02:47.940> work<00:02:48.180> but

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
you just leave it like this or work but

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.800 
you just leave it like this or work but
turn<00:02:50.040> down<00:02:50.280> leg<00:02:51.209> strength<00:02:53.239> turn<00:02:54.239> down<00:02:54.420> all<00:02:54.660> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
turn down leg strength turn down all the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.890 
turn down leg strength turn down all the
way<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.560> goes<00:02:55.620> like<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.640> cannot<00:02:59.900> just

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
way it goes like that so cannot just

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.479 
way it goes like that so cannot just
experiment<00:03:01.650> with<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:04.820> school<00:03:06.320> as<00:03:07.320> much<00:03:08.130> as<00:03:08.340> you

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
experiment with it school as much as you

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:19.350 
experiment with it school as much as you
can

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.820 

as<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.510> can<00:03:20.660> see<00:03:20.810> now<00:03:21.020> it's<00:03:21.200> kind<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.470> too

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
as you can see now it's kind of too

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.280 
as you can see now it's kind of too
transparent<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:23.000> can<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.300> see<00:03:23.569> through<00:03:23.900> so

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
transparent you can I see through so

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.270 
transparent you can I see through so
that's<00:03:24.590> not<00:03:24.830> good<00:03:25.160> at<00:03:25.250> all<00:03:26.890> what<00:03:27.890> we're<00:03:28.100> going

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
that's not good at all what we're going

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:47.110 
that's not good at all what we're going
to<00:03:28.400> be<00:03:28.520> going<00:03:28.790> there<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:46.030> it's<00:03:47.030> absolutely

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
to be going there and it's absolutely

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:55.870 
to be going there and it's absolutely
very<00:03:47.600> hard<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.230> do<00:03:50.980> turn<00:03:51.980> down<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.190> length<00:03:54.880> to

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
very hard to do turn down the length to

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:05.620 
very hard to do turn down the length to
like<00:03:56.120> in<00:03:56.540> one<00:03:57.170> seller<00:04:02.110> lists<00:04:04.269> see<00:04:05.269> how<00:04:05.570> it

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
like in one seller lists see how it

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:14.220 
like in one seller lists see how it
looks<00:04:05.870> like<00:04:06.140> what<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:06.890> looks<00:04:07.190> like<00:04:07.340> sorry

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.940 

still<00:04:15.230> no<00:04:15.440> luck<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:17.030> let's<00:04:17.780> change<00:04:18.290> everything

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
still no luck so let's change everything

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:26.680 
still no luck so let's change everything
to<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.459> really<00:04:20.090> low<00:04:20.950> 1<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.760> next<00:04:26.210> won't<00:04:26.419> turn

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
to like really low 1 and next won't turn

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:40.429 
to like really low 1 and next won't turn
this<00:04:26.840> up<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.140> little<00:04:27.470> more

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.899 

okay<00:04:41.439> and<00:04:41.740> hopefully<00:04:42.459> that<00:04:43.029> will<00:04:43.240> do<00:04:43.509> better

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
okay and hopefully that will do better

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:52.260 
okay and hopefully that will do better
let's<00:04:45.909> see<00:04:48.959> as<00:04:50.399> you<00:04:51.399> can<00:04:51.520> see<00:04:51.729> now<00:04:51.999> it's

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
let's see as you can see now it's

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.149 
let's see as you can see now it's
looking<00:04:52.479> more<00:04:52.869> like<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.139> candle<00:04:53.679> um<00:04:55.800> it's<00:04:56.800> going

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
looking more like a candle um it's going

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:04.260 
looking more like a candle um it's going
again<00:04:57.699> and<00:04:59.729> smell<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.879> strength<00:05:03.149> to<00:05:04.149> like

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
again and smell the strength to like

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:16.739 
again and smell the strength to like
hundred<00:05:04.659> and<00:05:04.869> forty<00:05:05.909> or<00:05:06.909> so<00:05:08.399> shun<00:05:15.599> shun<00:05:16.599> the

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:16.749 
hundred and forty or so shun shun the

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:22.079 
hundred and forty or so shun shun the
minimum<00:05:17.259> set<00:05:17.499> this<00:05:17.679> up<00:05:19.439> and<00:05:20.759> scattering<00:05:21.759> lens

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.089 
minimum set this up and scattering lens

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:25.980 
minimum set this up and scattering lens
trying<00:05:22.599> to<00:05:22.809> like<00:05:22.959> five<00:05:24.599> really<00:05:25.599> want<00:05:25.929> to

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
trying to like five really want to

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:36.179 
trying to like five really want to
experiment<00:05:26.289> with<00:05:26.529> this<00:05:34.740> long<00:05:35.740> as<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:35.949> can<00:05:36.069> see

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:36.189 
experiment with this long as you can see

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.399 
experiment with this long as you can see
it's<00:05:36.339> looking<00:05:36.580> more<00:05:36.759> like<00:05:36.909> candle<00:05:37.509> against

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
it's looking more like candle against

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:39.689 
it's looking more like candle against
this<00:05:38.469> bright<00:05:38.769> over<00:05:39.039> here<00:05:39.219> not<00:05:39.429> too<00:05:39.550> bright

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
this bright over here not too bright

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.999 
this bright over here not too bright
over<00:05:39.939> there<00:05:40.149> looks<00:05:40.959> more<00:05:41.050> like<00:05:41.169> a<00:05:41.319> candle<00:05:41.800> but

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
over there looks more like a candle but

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.769 
over there looks more like a candle but
if<00:05:42.129> you<00:05:42.219> turn<00:05:42.430> down<00:05:42.490> playing<00:05:43.089> turn<00:05:43.509> off<00:05:43.629> the

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:43.779 
if you turn down playing turn off the

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.429 
if you turn down playing turn off the
plane<00:05:44.279> it<00:05:45.279> will<00:05:45.550> still<00:05:45.999> be<00:05:46.029> like<00:05:46.629> a<00:05:46.659> candle<00:05:47.229> it

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
plane it will still be like a candle it

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.049 
plane it will still be like a candle it
will<00:05:47.649> actually<00:05:47.740> give<00:05:48.219> a<00:05:48.339> little<00:05:48.759> bit<00:05:48.849> more

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:49.059 
will actually give a little bit more

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:54.809 
will actually give a little bit more
dramatic<00:05:49.240> effect<00:05:51.629> see<00:05:53.339> light<00:05:54.339> is<00:05:54.519> passing

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
dramatic effect see light is passing

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.589 
dramatic effect see light is passing
through<00:05:55.029> a<00:05:55.240> little<00:05:55.629> bit<00:05:55.719> more<00:05:56.669> but<00:05:57.669> let's<00:05:58.180> turn

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
through a little bit more but let's turn

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.609 
through a little bit more but let's turn
up<00:05:58.629> the<00:05:58.749> plane<00:05:59.079> again<00:05:59.199> and<00:06:00.869> go<00:06:01.869> to<00:06:01.930> bump<00:06:02.349> and

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:02.619 
up the plane again and go to bump and

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:05.040 
up the plane again and go to bump and
turn<00:06:02.860> it<00:06:02.979> off<00:06:03.099> to<00:06:03.309> like<00:06:03.430> five<00:06:04.029> at<00:06:04.509> least<00:06:04.689> eight

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
turn it off to like five at least eight

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:17.609 
turn it off to like five at least eight
or<00:06:05.529> five<00:06:05.860> whatever<00:06:06.519> you<00:06:06.759> want<00:06:07.499> and<00:06:16.379> boom<00:06:17.379> right

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:17.619 
or five whatever you want and boom right

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:22.259 
or five whatever you want and boom right
you<00:06:17.979> got<00:06:18.249> pretty<00:06:18.909> cool<00:06:19.029> looking<00:06:21.269> selections

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:22.269 
you got pretty cool looking selections

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.509 
you got pretty cool looking selections
but<00:06:22.449> let's<00:06:22.689> go<00:06:22.839> into<00:06:23.110> our<00:06:23.259> bump<00:06:23.800> channel<00:06:24.339> and

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:24.519 
but let's go into our bump channel and

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:26.699 
but let's go into our bump channel and
turn<00:06:24.789> down<00:06:24.819> the<00:06:25.300> global<00:06:25.629> scales<00:06:25.869> like<00:06:26.139> fifty

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:26.709 
turn down the global scales like fifty

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:40.769 
turn down the global scales like fifty
percent<00:06:27.839> so<00:06:28.839> our<00:06:28.929> bumps<00:06:29.289> aren't<00:06:29.649> too<00:06:29.979> big<00:06:39.779> it's

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:40.779 
percent so our bumps aren't too big it's

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:43.669 
percent so our bumps aren't too big it's
still<00:06:41.229> very<00:06:41.499> big<00:06:41.800> let's<00:06:42.309> turn<00:06:42.519> it<00:06:42.610> down<00:06:42.759> more

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:43.679 
still very big let's turn it down more

00:06:43.679 --> 00:07:01.290 
still very big let's turn it down more
it's<00:06:44.679> like<00:06:44.919> more<00:06:45.189> like<00:06:45.219> 30<00:06:59.550> this<00:07:00.550> is<00:07:01.029> how<00:07:01.269> I

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
it's like more like 30 this is how I

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.779 
it's like more like 30 this is how I
make<00:07:01.539> a<00:07:01.569> candle<00:07:02.490> thank<00:07:03.490> you<00:07:03.610> guys<00:07:03.729> for
