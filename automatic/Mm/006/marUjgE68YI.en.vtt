00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
in here I got this about two weeks ago

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.050 
in here I got this about two weeks ago
and<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.070> food<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.400> pretty<00:00:20.580> much<00:00:20.789> eaten

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and all the food is pretty much eaten

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.670 
and all the food is pretty much eaten
out<00:00:21.359> from<00:00:21.779> where<00:00:21.990> they<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.430> reach<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.060 

there's<00:00:28.680> one<00:00:29.039> still<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.730> there<00:00:30.000> he's<00:00:30.769> at<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
there's one still in there he's at the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.500 
there's one still in there he's at the
roaming<00:00:32.520> stage<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.239> he's<00:00:33.390> probably<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:39.440> I

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
roaming stage so he's probably right I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.130 
roaming stage so he's probably right I
am<00:00:42.510> trying<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.020> free<00:00:43.649> these<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.750> happens

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
am trying to free these so what happens

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.350 
am trying to free these so what happens
is<00:00:46.410> they<00:00:46.770> eat<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.340> eat<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> eat<00:00:47.940> until<00:00:47.969> they

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
and kind of roam around on the bottom

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
and kind of roam around on the bottom
and<00:00:55.829> what<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> wild<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.300> dig

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and what they do in the wild is they dig

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.040 
and what they do in the wild is they dig
a<00:00:57.570> little<00:00:57.719> hole<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.030> look<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.870> can

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
a little hole and if you look you can

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.880 
a little hole and if you look you can
see<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.530> these<00:01:01.739> guys<00:01:01.800> are<00:01:05.360> clearly

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
see that these guys are clearly

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.760 
see that these guys are clearly
different<00:01:08.060> yeah<00:01:09.290> unfortunately<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.680> don't

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
different yeah unfortunately I don't

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.980 
different yeah unfortunately I don't
have<00:01:10.860> any<00:01:11.010> good<00:01:11.790> comparison<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:12.840> that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
have any good comparison because that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.830 
have any good comparison because that
other<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:14.000> pretty<00:01:15.000> much<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> roaming

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
other one is pretty much in the roaming

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.100 
other one is pretty much in the roaming
stage<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.350> well<00:01:16.650> digging<00:01:17.430> stage<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
stage as well digging stage and that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.999 
stage as well digging stage and that
means<00:01:19.290> they're<00:01:19.470> about<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.799> pupate<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> I've

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
means they're about to pupate so I've

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.100 
means they're about to pupate so I've
got<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.490> two<00:01:23.729> three<00:01:23.759> four<00:01:24.570> five<00:01:25.080> six<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:26.009> here

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
got one two three four five six in here

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.200 
got one two three four five six in here
now<00:01:29.150> let's<00:01:30.150> say<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:31.430> put<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:32.850> today

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
now let's say I put them in here today

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.749 
now let's say I put them in here today
they've<00:01:33.509> been<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.470> stage<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> few

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
they've been in this stage for a few

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.469 
they've been in this stage for a few
days<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:37.079> I'll<00:01:37.259> probably<00:01:37.500> pupate<00:01:38.479> pretty

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
days now so I'll probably pupate pretty

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.910 
days now so I'll probably pupate pretty
soon<00:01:40.820> they're<00:01:44.899> significantly<00:01:45.899> smaller<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
soon they're significantly smaller and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560 
soon they're significantly smaller and
you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.729> they're<00:01:47.909> legal<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.420> they're

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you can see they're legal and they're

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.539 
you can see they're legal and they're
not<00:01:48.720> quite

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
not quite

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.580

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
going on is underneath that exoskeleton

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.740

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
little lift if they're female so I put

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.530 
little lift if they're female so I put
them<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.180> there<00:02:51.360> because<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.690> little<00:02:52.280> bit<00:02:53.540> more

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
them in there because a little bit more

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.890 
them in there because a little bit more
moist<00:02:54.950> on<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.160> side<00:02:56.459> they<00:02:57.180> were<00:02:57.239> over<00:02:57.540> there

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
moist on this side they were over there

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.569 
moist on this side they were over there
you<00:02:58.319> really<00:02:58.590> shouldn't<00:02:58.890> move<00:02:59.250> them<00:02:59.459> around

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
you really shouldn't move them around

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.670 
you really shouldn't move them around
too<00:02:59.910> much<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.239> this<00:03:00.299> side<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:01.230> because<00:03:01.530> these

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
too much on this side but because these

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.559 
too much on this side but because these
are<00:03:01.829> all<00:03:01.920> female<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.579> these<00:03:03.150> are<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.540> a

larger these know I don't know if that's

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.319

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
because I had six of these guys in one

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.309 
because I had six of these guys in one
container<00:03:39.900> sharing<00:03:40.739> all<00:03:40.889> the<00:03:41.010> food<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.450> these

caterpillars I just left them in there
and<00:03:47.579> they<00:03:48.359> eventually<00:03:48.569> keep<00:03:48.989> added<00:03:49.940> so<00:03:50.940> they

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
and they eventually keep added so they

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.970 
and they eventually keep added so they
