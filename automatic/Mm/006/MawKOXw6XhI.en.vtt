again<00:01:00.649> again<00:01:02.000> that's<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> good<00:01:03.540> that's<00:01:03.750> not

anything<00:01:12.330> changes<00:01:12.930> there's<00:01:13.800> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.190> be<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
anything changes there's going to be a

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.460 
anything changes there's going to be a
way<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> convert<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.750> could<00:01:15.900> always<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
way to convert it you could always go to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.760 
way to convert it you could always go to
D<00:01:16.710> ng<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.790> wanted<00:01:18.120> but<00:01:18.960> again

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
D ng if you really wanted but again

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.860 
D ng if you really wanted but again
that's<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.790> good<00:01:21.030> enough<00:01:21.240> reason<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.720> say

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
that's not a good enough reason to say

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.660 
that's not a good enough reason to say
I'm<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> shoot<00:01:22.409> JPEG<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.490> they're

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
going to change JPEG formats too so what

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.789 
going to change JPEG formats too so what
they<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.130> still<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.490> read<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.000> 25<00:01:27.870> years<00:01:27.900> my

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
years in what format I don't know but

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.180

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
catalogue to make sure that I can

catalogue to make sure that I can
convert<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:37.890> people<00:01:38.159> doing<00:01:38.369> with

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
convert it what are people doing with

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.609 
convert it what are people doing with
film<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.000> slides<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.659> they're<00:01:40.140> having<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
film and slides now they're having it

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.609 
film and slides now they're having it
digitized<00:01:41.280> because<00:01:42.150> film<00:01:42.450> has<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> lifespan<00:01:43.080> it

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
digitized because film has a lifespan it

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.250 
digitized because film has a lifespan it
goes<00:01:44.010> away<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.060> disintegrate<00:01:45.420> over<00:01:46.049> time

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
goes away it can disintegrate over time

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.800 
goes away it can disintegrate over time
the<00:01:46.470> colors<00:01:46.830> can<00:01:47.100> shift<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.210> people<00:01:48.540> offer

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the colors can shift so people offer

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.950 
the colors can shift so people offer
scanning<00:01:49.650> same<00:01:50.640> thing<00:01:50.970> you're<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> have

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
scanning same thing you're going to have

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.390 
scanning same thing you're going to have
time<00:01:52.229> you're<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.740> able<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.010> change

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
time you're going to be able to change

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.469 
time you're going to be able to change
the<00:01:54.000> file<00:01:54.270> format<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:56.010> your<00:01:56.189> images<00:01:56.610> for

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the file format and have your images for

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.230 
the file format and have your images for
however<00:01:57.630> long<00:01:57.900> you<00:01:58.170> need<00:01:58.350> them

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.680 

so<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.270> guess<00:02:05.600> this<00:02:05.840> took<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.410> one<00:02:06.890> huge<00:02:07.690> reverse

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
so I guess this took on one huge reverse

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.310 
so I guess this took on one huge reverse
