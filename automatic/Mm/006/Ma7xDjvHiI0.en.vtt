00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.949
 today I'm going to sing the cane shoemaker 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.560
 good as always 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.919
 I think I'm home and I sing 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.939
 it's a shame that they are granted nothing makes sense I think I'm going to 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.860
 kill I said is foolish has not known the pope still has value and that 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:39.519
 includes yours, strange as it may seem, I do not tell you that I'm going to kill myself for a while 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.699
 doing sudoku while the new president takes care of the country a new 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.530
 president yes for more than I have tried everything I have not managed to finish with 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.339
 the crisis and that the idea that people to work until 135 years 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.570
 It looked pretty good I'm tired and it's lacking in ideas and it left a worthy successor 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.369
 yes 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:59.579
 sure they are opposed competent are you what as in command of the moncloa 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.769
 me meanwhile a nudge on a joint 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.810
 valero survived but to celebrate my withdrawal 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.200
 enjoy your new position president I can not believe it indeed the president 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.460
 read the president 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 Bolus the president 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.760
 President 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.130
 Kennedy was telling them to adopt with pensions lowered I do not think that assured 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.630
 they were low about six or others that can be done I suppose 1 leave everything as 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.180
 is 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.359
 because you have clear how to get out of the crisis the taxi man 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.670
 very clear 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 this alfredo you have a clinex I think I'm going to cry 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.650
 I decline that the act the president is very complicated I do not know how he could 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.650
 do it for so long that I think I was not very conscious 1 and who will be the 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.020
 next full tuc it turns out that legally I could not resign and please 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.780
 so he's still president who reported complaints 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.479
 another point to close it to the public or what milk 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.390
 it's a real gun I kill myself before I go back there
