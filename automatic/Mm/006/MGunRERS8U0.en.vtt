00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.820
 at 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.430
 the Geneva fair 2015 on caradisiac 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.779
 it is to follow with manuel cailliot en 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.520
 direct from stang honda or manu m you go 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.710
 to discover or rediscover 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.430
 somehow a 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.840
 jazz and the small city jazz 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.000
 today the third generation the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 first appeared in 2001 actually in 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.920
 2002 in europe is called fit on 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.780
 other markets but jazz at us a 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.890
 little city dweller who and it's always a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.960
 little out of the box 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.860
 she is a little monovolume you 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.660
 know she's a lot more so but 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.640
 50.2 for this one then others so 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.440
 a good habitability remains enough 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.809
 compact even though she grew 10 cm 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.059
 small novelty so to the big island 10 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.830
 centimes is enlarged by 10 cm 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.620
 wheelbase it's a little bit improved 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.670
 as aesthetically it's a revenge 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.680
 to their exchange bread 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.610
 aesthetically she joined visually 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.619
 the rest of the current honda range to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.590
 the interior, however, changes 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.670
 high level 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.200
 of the dashboard and all that but by 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.909
 against all the little practicalities 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.009
 the little tricks of jazz are 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.539
 always there we will go see him all at their 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.360
 bubble small storage and especially the 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.030
 magic site at the back 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.650
 I wanted to show that and then and then a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 very large capacity chest too 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.000
 for a city girl with 354 begging 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.750
 a lot of good there already called - the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.400
 competitors so this is the c1 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.480
 then no go on the service it is 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.330
 above the c1 c2 108 kg paulo 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.610
 their fingers 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.010
 yes everything will make you want to give birth in 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.660
 this car after your intro rather 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.050
 positive and in fact I feel rather 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.430
 not bad with this big so a big 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.840
 tactical screen and no serial on 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.200
 all versions but on the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.729
 versions his friends it's true that 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.670
 at the equipment level this new 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.799
 jazz 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.509
 enriched notation here we can for example 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.790
 have the shit crossing 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.830
 line a reversing camera we even have the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.860
 reading signs or an active city 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.990
 break is little 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.560
 so obstacle detection she can 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.720
 curb herself too she joins 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.590
 the best of the category at the level 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.590
 of the presentation 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.780
 it's still one of the honda 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.459
 it's pretty hard plastics but 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.230
 it's not too bad I did not think 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.660
 actually achieve and small 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.760
 tips when it comes back disturbance 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.110
 here commit cans here here we have 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.580
 a little by little housing also for 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.680
 put a little bottle there that they 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.130
 cover a large glove box we have 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.360
 still a storage here under the armrest 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.700
 12 volt socket USB plug 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.140
 that's it's also without but in 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.390
 the little things like that that can 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.900
 that can seduce even the counters 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.790
 circled a little sport way it's very 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.160
 fashion yes we see everywhere finally the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.450
 there are here is also then a steering wheel 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.550
 which may not be super ergonomic 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.020
 because a lot of buttons this says 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.580
 that's all that's multimedia that if 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.410
 everything that is cruise control 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.540
 here it is relatively well 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.490
 organized even though there are a lot of goals 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.690
 and we will go to the back and I will 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.350
 to demonstrate the magic 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.840
 did not agree 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.160
 show me that the magic site we talk about it 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.930
 often but it's true we show 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.470
 quite rare when it works 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.430
 in fact it's simple 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.140
 seats in the block we come across as 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.360
 you see now eh ben we can place 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.819
 what did you come bike of the big 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.439
 green plants more than we want and 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.999
 and that's the only builder 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.469
 propose this guy is the only one 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.120
 constructor but on many of their 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.859
 models I have several of their models 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.150
 here is the small city like the one 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.769
 this until new suv is by 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.209
 elsewhere such classical modulation with 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.040
 the banks is that they fall back 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.480
 it is this one who is who and who do 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.050
 switch the six 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.700
 at the same time which allows anton 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.860
 one to have a flat floor for a 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.660
 it is the city Goethe practicality 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.060
 was talking about it was not a vain 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.440
 excellent expression we'll finish with 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.450
 the engines then this new 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.120
 generation arrives in France with a leak 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.070
 3,202 horses only for the moment 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.210
 a little bit surprising because 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.470
 the older generation has a 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.820
 hybrid motorization so we wait for it 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.720
 she will certainly hopefully in any 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.940
 case arrived 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.740
 also in europe this said for 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.570
 the moment we go on a single engine 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.590
 essence that could deprive her of a 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.950
 some clientele it's a little bit 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.290
 pity 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.510
 and then it's jazz too 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.070
 interested in marketing on the date of 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.450
 marketing it will be in the month of 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.040
 September of this year not yet the 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.040
 Rates we do not have the rates yet 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.060
 what I like is really 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.919
 its practical aspects the magic side the 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.210
 little little tricks of all these 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.529
 small storage is true that in 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.419
 many cars are missing 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.969
 but not in this one I like it 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.389
 well especially for that 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:48.389
 the week
