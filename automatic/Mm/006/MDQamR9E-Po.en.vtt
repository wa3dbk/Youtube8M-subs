bistro<00:00:23.230> so<00:00:24.230> first<00:00:24.470> we're<00:00:24.619> gonna<00:00:24.740> get<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.100> link

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
bistro so first we're gonna get the link

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.930 
bistro so first we're gonna get the link
out<00:00:26.060> of<00:00:26.119> the<00:00:26.330> way<00:00:26.830> and<00:00:27.830> drop<00:00:28.160> this<00:00:28.369> down<00:00:30.940> we

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
out of the way and drop this down we

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.180 
out of the way and drop this down we
have<00:00:32.150> two<00:00:33.910> unweight<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:37.010> rear<00:00:37.220> end<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:37.790> we<00:00:37.910> can

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
have two unweight the rear end so we can

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:47.470 
have two unweight the rear end so we can
pull<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.340> bolt<00:00:40.520> out

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.270 

this<00:00:48.079> will<00:00:48.200> also<00:00:48.320> give<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:48.770> better<00:00:49.010> access

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
for the lower shock mount so with the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.160 
for the lower shock mount so with the
link<00:00:55.340> lowered<00:00:55.730> now<00:00:55.910> we<00:00:55.970> have<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.450> lower<00:00:56.870> shock

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
link lowered now we have the lower shock

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.710 
link lowered now we have the lower shock
mount<00:00:57.199> exposed<00:00:57.980> we<00:00:58.280> can<00:00:58.460> go<00:00:59.059> ahead<00:00:59.150> and<00:00:59.360> remove

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
mount exposed we can go ahead and remove

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.100 
mount exposed we can go ahead and remove
that<00:00:59.900> kind<00:01:00.680> of<00:01:00.739> broken<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:01.309> free<00:01:01.550> already<00:01:03.699> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
just yet now we have to loosen up the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.090 
just yet now we have to loosen up the
remote<00:01:23.820> preload<00:01:24.330> adjuster<00:01:24.840> okay<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.860> we've

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
just get the top shock mount out of the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
just get the top shock mount out of the
way

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.870 

and<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:43.670> OEM<00:01:44.670> shock<00:01:45.110> comes<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.670> with<00:01:47.670> very

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and the OEM shock comes out with very

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.880 
and the OEM shock comes out with very
little<00:01:48.090> drama

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.580 

it's<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.670> pretty<00:01:55.180> good<00:01:55.360> practice<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.960> kind<00:01:56.530> of

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
it's a pretty good practice to kind of

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.800 
it's a pretty good practice to kind of
look<00:01:56.770> around<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:58.120> bike<00:01:58.330> when<00:01:58.540> you<00:01:58.630> have<00:01:58.780> a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
look around the bike when you have a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.210 
look around the bike when you have a
shock<00:01:59.170> or<00:01:59.440> anything<00:01:59.470> that<00:01:59.830> you<00:02:00.070> normally

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
shock or anything that you normally

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.790 
shock or anything that you normally
don't<00:02:00.640> take<00:02:00.820> off<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.380> see<00:02:02.530> if<00:02:02.620> there's

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
don't take off just to see if there's

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.160 
don't take off just to see if there's
something<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.340> can<00:02:03.490> tighten<00:02:03.910> up<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:05.020> in

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
something that you can tighten up so in

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.130 
something that you can tighten up so in
this<00:02:05.290> case<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.250> mid<00:02:06.880> pipe<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.780> header

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
this case the mid pipe to the header

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.710 
this case the mid pipe to the header
there's<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:08.860> clamp<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.700> we<00:02:10.060> probably<00:02:10.300> want<00:02:10.570> to

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
there's a clamp that we probably want to

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.790 
there's a clamp that we probably want to
get<00:02:10.960> to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
get to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.290 
get to
it's<00:02:12.070> normally<00:02:12.490> covered<00:02:12.940> with<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.240> shock<00:02:13.450> in

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
it's normally covered with the shock in

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.460 
it's normally covered with the shock in
this<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:16.480> we'll<00:02:16.600> just<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:17.110> little<00:02:17.380> bit<00:02:17.500> loose

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
this one we'll just a little bit loose

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.050 
this one we'll just a little bit loose
okay<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.530> now<00:02:20.740> we're<00:02:20.860> gonna<00:02:20.950> install<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
okay so now we're gonna install the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.400 
okay so now we're gonna install the
progressive<00:02:22.510> shock<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:23.110> you're<00:02:23.260> going<00:02:23.380> to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
progressive shock so you're going to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.949 
progressive shock so you're going to
want<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> reach<00:02:23.800> down<00:02:24.180> inside<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.630> swingarm

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
want to reach down inside the swingarm

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.699 
want to reach down inside the swingarm
actually<00:02:27.060> grab<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.600> wrap<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.290> guide<00:02:29.680> it

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
actually grab the wrap and guide it

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.820 
actually grab the wrap and guide it
through<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.940> let<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.270> chill<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:32.770> the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
through just let that chill on the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.550 
through just let that chill on the
backside<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.640> swing<00:02:33.880> arm<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:37.200> then<00:02:38.200> bring

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
backside of the swing arm and then bring

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.180 
backside of the swing arm and then bring
it<00:02:39.930> up<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.530> top<00:02:41.770> shock<00:02:42.220> mount<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.860> with<00:02:45.010> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
it up to the top shock mount so with the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.290 
it up to the top shock mount so with the
shock<00:02:45.400> up<00:02:45.940> into<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.330> frame<00:02:46.540> just<00:02:47.190> slide<00:02:48.190> your

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
shock up into the frame just slide your

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.900 
shock up into the frame just slide your
top<00:02:49.300> shock<00:02:49.660> mount<00:02:49.959> back<00:02:50.200> in<00:02:50.610> wouldn't<00:02:51.610> tighten

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
top shock mount back in wouldn't tighten

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.420 
top shock mount back in wouldn't tighten
it<00:02:52.030> tighten<00:02:52.690> everything<00:02:52.930> anything<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.709> just

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it tighten everything anything up just

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.640 
it tighten everything anything up just
yet<00:02:54.670> we<00:02:55.450> want<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:56.880> put<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> lower<00:02:58.620> shock<00:02:59.620> mount

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
yet we want to put the lower shock mount

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:10.640 
yet we want to put the lower shock mount
in

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.860 

and<00:03:10.830> it's<00:03:11.489> also<00:03:11.640> very<00:03:11.760> important<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
and it's also very important that the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.350 
and it's also very important that the
rebound<00:03:13.680> adjuster<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.190> facing<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.000> riders

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
rebound adjuster is facing to the riders

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.690 
rebound adjuster is facing to the riders
the<00:03:15.540> left-hand<00:03:15.959> side

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.750 

so<00:03:23.330> next<00:03:23.660> we<00:03:23.750> want<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.050> tighten<00:03:24.680> up<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:25.069> the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
so next we want to tighten up the the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:34.399 
so next we want to tighten up the the
rear<00:03:26.170> shock<00:03:27.170> mount<00:03:27.440> bolt<00:03:27.709> only

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.420 

and<00:03:55.709> gotta<00:03:56.709> put<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.040> nut<00:03:57.250> up<00:03:57.400> on<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:59.430> top

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
and gotta put the nut up on the top

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.030 
and gotta put the nut up on the top
shock<00:04:00.790> mount

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.530 

and<00:04:06.430> then<00:04:06.670> we're<00:04:06.760> gonna<00:04:06.849> walk<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.390> other

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
and then we're gonna walk to the other

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.250 
and then we're gonna walk to the other
side<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.110> tighten<00:04:08.709> up<00:04:08.920> these<00:04:09.159> nuts<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.959> more

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
side and tighten up these nuts so more

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.780 
side and tighten up these nuts so more
often<00:04:11.379> enough<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:11.920> don't<00:04:12.129> have<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.400> help<00:04:12.610> or

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
often enough you don't have the help or

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.880 
often enough you don't have the help or
helping<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.450> we've<00:04:14.170> got<00:04:14.349> a<00:04:14.379> wrench<00:04:14.650> on<00:04:14.769> the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
helping you so we've got a wrench on the

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.000 
helping you so we've got a wrench on the
other<00:04:15.040> side<00:04:15.310> holding<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:15.970> bolt<00:04:17.010> stationary

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
other side holding this bolt stationary

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.430 
other side holding this bolt stationary
so<00:04:18.489> we<00:04:18.699> can<00:04:18.940> torque<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.989> nut<00:04:22.289> putting<00:04:23.289> it<00:04:23.350> so

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
so we can torque the nut putting it so

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.810 
so we can torque the nut putting it so
last<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.949> bolt<00:04:24.130> so<00:04:24.310> we<00:04:24.400> have<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.639> top

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
last of the bolt so we have the top

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.060 
last of the bolt so we have the top
shock<00:04:25.240> mount<00:04:25.510> again<00:04:26.350> we've<00:04:26.770> kind<00:04:27.039> of

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
shock mount again we've kind of

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.800 
shock mount again we've kind of
positioned<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.610> wrench<00:04:27.789> on<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.090> other<00:04:28.240> side<00:04:28.510> so

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
positioned a wrench on the other side so

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.230 
positioned a wrench on the other side so
no<00:04:28.960> one<00:04:29.080> has<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.289> hold<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:30.610> we<00:04:30.729> can<00:04:30.880> tighten

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
no one has to hold it so we can tighten

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.820 
no one has to hold it so we can tighten
down<00:04:31.270> our<00:04:33.090> nut<00:04:37.380> so<00:04:38.380> with<00:04:38.530> your<00:04:38.650> shock

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
down our nut so with your shock

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.379 
down our nut so with your shock
installed<00:04:39.250> now<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.729> last<00:04:39.910> thing<00:04:40.030> we<00:04:40.210> have<00:04:40.330> to

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
installed now the last thing we have to

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.710 
installed now the last thing we have to
do<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.780> knock<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.229> preload<00:04:41.919> adjuster<00:04:42.370> so

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
do is knock the preload adjuster so

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.020 
do is knock the preload adjuster so
here's<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.960> soprano<00:04:44.320> supplied<00:04:44.830> bracket<00:04:45.039> all

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
here's the soprano supplied bracket all

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.870 
here's the soprano supplied bracket all
we<00:04:46.150> going<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.449> do<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.840> just<00:04:47.639> install<00:04:48.639> the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
we going to do is just install the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.540 
we going to do is just install the
mounting<00:04:49.210> screws<00:04:49.539> to<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.960> bracket<00:04:50.410> and<00:04:50.650> then

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
mounting screws to the bracket and then

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:03.050 
mounting screws to the bracket and then
we'll<00:04:52.000> mount<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.389> bracket<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:52.990> frame

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.510 

there<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.210> go<00:05:04.920> so<00:05:05.920> now<00:05:06.040> we're<00:05:06.160> going<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.310> set

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
there you go so now we're going to set

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.370 
there you go so now we're going to set
the<00:05:06.640> sag<00:05:06.850> so<00:05:07.150> it's<00:05:07.600> very<00:05:07.720> important<00:05:08.140> that<00:05:08.260> we

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
the sag so it's very important that we

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.550 
the sag so it's very important that we
do<00:05:08.560> this<00:05:08.740> each<00:05:09.040> and<00:05:09.160> every<00:05:09.250> time<00:05:09.610> because<00:05:10.560> with

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
do this each and every time because with

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.310 
do this each and every time because with
the<00:05:11.650> amount<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:11.920> luggage<00:05:12.160> or<00:05:13.110> person's<00:05:14.110> body

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
the amount of luggage or person's body

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.430 
the amount of luggage or person's body
weight<00:05:14.590> it's<00:05:14.830> going<00:05:14.980> to<00:05:15.070> vary<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:16.230> pretty<00:05:17.230> large

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
weight it's going to vary a pretty large

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.230 
weight it's going to vary a pretty large
degree<00:05:17.680> so<00:05:18.100> what<00:05:18.670> we're<00:05:18.760> going<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:18.910> do<00:05:19.120> is

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
degree so what we're going to do is

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240 
degree so what we're going to do is
we're<00:05:19.390> gonna<00:05:19.480> measure<00:05:20.170> the<00:05:20.530> extended<00:05:21.100> length

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
we're gonna measure the extended length

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.160 
we're gonna measure the extended length
first<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:21.850> the<00:05:22.150> wheel<00:05:22.450> is<00:05:22.630> off<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.990> ground

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
first so the wheel is off the ground

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.800 
first so the wheel is off the ground
we're<00:05:24.100> going<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.280> just<00:05:24.760> pick<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.060> point<00:05:25.450> and

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
we're going to just pick a point and

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.930 
we're going to just pick a point and
measure<00:05:26.350> obviously<00:05:27.070> from<00:05:27.220> that<00:05:27.370> same<00:05:27.580> point

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
measure obviously from that same point

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:38.050 
measure obviously from that same point
each<00:05:28.150> time

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.910 

so<00:05:38.600> now<00:05:38.720> that<00:05:38.780> we<00:05:38.930> got<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.230> extended<00:05:39.620> length

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
so now that we got the extended length

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.320 
so now that we got the extended length
now<00:05:40.130> we're<00:05:40.250> gonna<00:05:40.370> get<00:05:40.580> on<00:05:40.730> the<00:05:40.880> bike<00:05:41.060> and

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
now we're gonna get on the bike and

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.120 
now we're gonna get on the bike and
measure<00:05:41.600> the<00:05:42.020> sag<00:05:42.800> leg<00:05:44.560> we<00:05:45.560> see<00:05:45.710> we<00:05:45.860> got<00:05:45.980> the

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
measure the sag leg we see we got the

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.800 
measure the sag leg we see we got the
bike<00:05:46.280> on<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:46.520> ground<00:05:46.760> now<00:05:46.970> we're<00:05:47.390> gonna<00:05:47.510> take

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
bike on the ground now we're gonna take

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.939 
bike on the ground now we're gonna take
that<00:05:47.990> same<00:05:48.230> measurement

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.070 

so<00:05:53.490> now<00:05:53.639> that<00:05:53.699> we've<00:05:53.909> taken<00:05:54.120> our<00:05:54.449> extended

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
so now that we've taken our extended

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.350 
so now that we've taken our extended
measurement<00:05:55.590> and<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.370> then<00:05:56.610> we've<00:05:56.759> taken<00:05:56.969> our

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
measurement and and then we've taken our

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.129 
measurement and and then we've taken our
Ryder<00:05:57.870> sag<00:05:58.409> measurement<00:05:58.999> we<00:05:59.999> subtract<00:06:00.930> those

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
Ryder sag measurement we subtract those

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.269 
Ryder sag measurement we subtract those
two<00:06:01.199> and<00:06:01.800> that<00:06:02.639> gives<00:06:02.969> us<00:06:03.210> our<00:06:03.419> sag

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:05.279 
two and that gives us our sag

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.580 
two and that gives us our sag
we<00:06:05.729> recommend<00:06:06.090> that<00:06:06.449> it<00:06:06.719> be<00:06:06.749> a<00:06:06.930> third<00:06:07.289> of<00:06:07.469> the

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
we recommend that it be a third of the
