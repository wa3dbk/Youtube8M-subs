turbo<00:00:19.710> package<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:21.150> truck<00:00:21.449> had<00:00:21.630> been

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
turbo package this truck had been

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.779 
turbo package this truck had been
sitting<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.289> while<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.949> needs<00:00:23.490> some

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
sitting a while and needs some

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.240 
sitting a while and needs some
maintenance<00:00:23.970> done<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> hard

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
maintenance done to it so it's a hard

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.429 
maintenance done to it so it's a hard
starter<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.269> couldn't<00:00:27.599> quite<00:00:27.689> get<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.199> fire

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
starter we couldn't quite get it to fire

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
starter we couldn't quite get it to fire
up<00:00:28.710> today<00:00:29.039> I'm<00:00:29.400> gonna<00:00:29.580> go<00:00:29.760> over<00:00:30.000> some<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
up today I'm gonna go over some of the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.240 
up today I'm gonna go over some of the
steps<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.929> took<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.619> troubleshooting

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
steps we took and the troubleshooting

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.549 
steps we took and the troubleshooting
that<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.669> did<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.300> order<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.290> motor

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that we did in order to get this motor

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
that we did in order to get this motor
fired<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.610> could<00:00:35.760> limp<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.120> back<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
fired up so we could limp it back to the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.180 
fired up so we could limp it back to the
garage<00:00:37.010> okay<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.309> let's<00:00:38.520> get<00:00:38.700> started<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
garage okay so let's get started so the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.880 
garage okay so let's get started so the
first<00:00:41.550> thing<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.910> noticed<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.750> motor<00:00:43.050> was

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
first thing we noticed on this motor was

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.889 
first thing we noticed on this motor was
that<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.489> was<00:00:44.670> missing<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> second<00:00:45.600> battery

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that it was missing the second battery

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.590 
that it was missing the second battery
which<00:00:46.170> belongs<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.329> it's<00:00:48.329> very

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
which belongs right here it's very

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600 
which belongs right here it's very
important<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> diesel<00:00:49.739> engine<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> have

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
important for a diesel engine to have

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
important for a diesel engine to have
the<00:00:50.789> proper<00:00:51.180> amount<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.629> cold<00:00:51.899> cranking<00:00:52.289> amps

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the proper amount of cold cranking amps

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.700 
the proper amount of cold cranking amps
in<00:00:53.100> order<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.120> rotate<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.780> assembly<00:00:54.930> quick

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
in order to rotate the assembly quick

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.639 
in order to rotate the assembly quick
enough<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.699> support<00:00:57.120> combustion<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:58.350> you're

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
enough to support combustion if you're

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.650 
enough to support combustion if you're
not<00:00:58.800> rotating<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> assembly<00:01:00.059> quick<00:01:00.300> enough

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
not rotating the assembly quick enough

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.540 
not rotating the assembly quick enough
you're<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> support<00:01:01.890> combustion

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you're not going to support combustion

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
you're not going to support combustion
so<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.359> went<00:01:03.570> ahead<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.049> hooked<00:01:04.140> jumper

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
so we went ahead and hooked jumper

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.230 
so we went ahead and hooked jumper
cables<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.700> my<00:01:05.909> Ford<00:01:06.270> Taurus<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> truck<00:01:09.000> has

rotate the motor over and see if fuel

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
rotate the motor over and see if fuel
comes<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.280> verify<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.820> there<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.390> fuel

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
comes out to verify that there is fuel

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.749 
comes out to verify that there is fuel
at<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.110> top<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> motor<00:01:28.829> being<00:01:29.340> supplied
