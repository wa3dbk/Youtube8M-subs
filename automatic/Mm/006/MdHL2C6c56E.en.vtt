our<00:00:08.940> philosophy<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.660> creating<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> foundry

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
our philosophy in creating the foundry

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.400 
our philosophy in creating the foundry
is<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.639> have<00:00:11.820> powerful<00:00:12.300> tools<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:13.080> are<00:00:13.110> easy

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
is to have powerful tools that are easy

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.310 
is to have powerful tools that are easy
to<00:00:13.530> use<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.639> accomplish<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.389> by<00:00:15.450> focusing<00:00:15.900> on

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
to use we accomplish this by focusing on

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.730 
to use we accomplish this by focusing on
storytelling<00:00:19.880> if<00:00:20.900> you<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.109> dream<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.529> your

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
storytelling if you can dream up your

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.250 
storytelling if you can dream up your
own<00:00:22.890> episode<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.670> Star<00:00:23.939> Trek<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.630> foundry<00:00:25.109> can

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
own episode of Star Trek the foundry can

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.939 
own episode of Star Trek the foundry can
make<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.619> reality<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:31.439> foundry<00:00:31.769> lets

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
make it a reality the foundry lets

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.889 
make it a reality the foundry lets
players<00:00:32.189> write<00:00:32.730> direct<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.300> star<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.719> their

players write direct and star in their
own<00:00:33.960> episodes<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.710> then<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.730> take<00:00:35.880> your

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
own episodes and then you can take your

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.119 
own episodes and then you can take your
stories<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> put<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.380> into<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> rest<00:00:37.980> of
