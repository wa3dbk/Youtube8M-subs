is<00:02:23.530> very<00:02:23.799> important<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:25.150> check<00:02:25.420> quite

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
is very important and you check quite

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.390 
is very important and you check quite
often<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.739> digital<00:02:27.220> clock<00:02:28.230> however<00:02:29.400> human
