00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you guys can probably tell just as a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.899 
you guys can probably tell just as a
regular<00:01:34.560> game<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.159> love<00:01:35.400> sending<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
regular game I love sending out the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.899 
regular game I love sending out the
waves<00:01:36.090> early<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> am<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> wave<00:01:38.250> early<00:01:38.610> type<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
waves early so I am a wave early type of

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.730 
waves early so I am a wave early type of
guy<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:40.409> these<00:01:40.530> four

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
guy that was with a with these four

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.929 
guy that was with a with these four
little<00:01:40.920> areas<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.369> here<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:41.880> I'm

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
little areas down here I think what I'm

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.490 
little areas down here I think what I'm
gonna<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.390> all<00:01:42.600> reinforcements<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
gonna do is get all reinforcements and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.429 
gonna do is get all reinforcements and
put<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:43.829> all<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.310> course<00:01:44.810> closer<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
put them all of course closer to the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.600 
put them all of course closer to the
middle<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.920> all<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.159> my<00:01:47.220> towers<00:01:47.520> can

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
middle here so all of my towers can

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.060 
middle here so all of my towers can
attack<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.829> might<00:01:52.950> actually

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
attack and for this one I might actually

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.260 
attack and for this one I might actually
get<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.310> barracks<00:01:53.549> down<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.820> bottom<00:01:54.090> left

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
get a barracks down in this bottom left

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.260 
get a barracks down in this bottom left
corner<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.570> first<00:01:55.520> first<00:01:56.520> look<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.210> we
