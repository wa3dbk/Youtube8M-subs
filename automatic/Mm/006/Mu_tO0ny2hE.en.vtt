00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
I mean why I don't really have a reason

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.490

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
it straightening but I think though that

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.260 
it straightening but I think though that
if<00:05:20.080> I<00:05:20.230> do<00:05:20.290> straighten<00:05:20.770> it<00:05:20.830> in<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.550> curls<00:05:22.090> might

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
if I do straighten it in the curls might

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.950 
if I do straighten it in the curls might
drop<00:05:22.480> this<00:05:23.260> is<00:05:23.410> an<00:05:23.560> example<00:05:24.720> this<00:05:25.720> is<00:05:25.780> an

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
drop this is an example this is an
