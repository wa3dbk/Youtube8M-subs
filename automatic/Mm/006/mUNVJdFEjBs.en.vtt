00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.680 
then the tail you want to pinch it
horizontally<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.800> it's<00:02:48.950> easier<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.690> each

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
horizontally so it's easier for each

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.699 
horizontally so it's easier for each
take<00:02:51.110> off<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.830> peel<00:02:52.010> off<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.340> shelf<00:02:52.610> like<00:02:53.650> this

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.390 

and<00:02:59.099> then<00:02:59.430> just<00:03:00.000> pull<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.510> out<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:01.280> lot<00:03:02.280> of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
and then just pull it out a lot of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.059 
and then just pull it out a lot of
people<00:03:02.700> tend<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> eat<00:03:03.329> crawfish<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:04.620> like

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
people tend to eat crawfish just like

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.569 
people tend to eat crawfish just like
this<00:03:05.480> but<00:03:06.480> for<00:03:06.780> me<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.319> don't<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.219> all<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
this but for me I don't like all the

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.020 
this but for me I don't like all the
dirty<00:03:08.790> stuff<00:03:08.939> inside<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:10.109> I<00:03:10.590> tend<00:03:11.159> to<00:03:11.340> take<00:03:11.849> out

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
dirty stuff inside so I tend to take out

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.860 
dirty stuff inside so I tend to take out
the<00:03:12.209> doodoo

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
the doodoo

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.589 
the doodoo
so<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:13.439> how<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.680> do<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.189> is<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:15.090> pinch<00:03:15.389> the

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
so what how you do this is you pinch the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.050 
so what how you do this is you pinch the
bottom<00:03:15.900> with<00:03:15.989> crawfish<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:17.459> top<00:03:17.700> and

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
bottom with crawfish and the top and

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.470 
bottom with crawfish and the top and
then<00:03:18.689> you<00:03:18.840> peel<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.680> off<00:03:19.920> slowly<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.849> as<00:03:21.359> you

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
then you peel it off slowly and as you

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.500 
then you peel it off slowly and as you
can<00:03:21.659> see<00:03:21.959> all<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.500> DS<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:23.099> right<00:03:23.370> here<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.450> you

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
can see all the DS is right here so you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.490 
can see all the DS is right here so you
just<00:03:24.719> take<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.019> out<00:03:26.180> after<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:27.480> done<00:03:27.750> you
