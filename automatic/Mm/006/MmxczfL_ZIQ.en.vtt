00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.140
 more 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.880
 then let's enter this our compound of

 high sr chat and bigger confectioners always recommend that the cream be 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.510

 bridal 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.130
 - then 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.119
 while in the cream then it should be inserted into the puff pastry should be 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.100

 we did well to comment but to make a partition to be 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.660

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.240

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.419

 our disc of puff pastry previously short 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.189
 then we put ourselves 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.039
 the cream 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.379
 another disc 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.249

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:13.059
