00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.730
 effects of the first cold fronts of 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.889

 minimum temperatures oscillate in some 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.000
 regions between 6 degrees Celsius 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.920

 prepare an anti-flu juice that 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.130
 recommends to go taking reinforcements 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.190
 to deal with changes in the 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.190

 pulp helps more to 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.719
 bad and also to the other and more eduardo 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.969

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.100
 to prevent respiratory diseases 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.250
 and it can be taken at any time 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.260

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.230
