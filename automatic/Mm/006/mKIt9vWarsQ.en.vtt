00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.490
 title of ffg them it's not like you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.110
 Think of the vitako man, I was excited 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.580
 actually it was nothing special 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.379
 we knew each other for a long time 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.840
 That was not the first time 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.859
 that we went away together 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.470
 We usually had friends with us 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.060
 but that we were alone was not 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.619
 exception 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.420
 and in my opinion much too 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.420
 Rare 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.460
 but a little different today 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.079
 I felt it and in the sense of these feelings 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.320
 I had decided to take today 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.570
 to say what I am feeling 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.600
 Still, I was unsure it was possible 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.629
 it could actually be possible 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.489
 having my feelings returned from 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.030
 professional reasons, I had to do so 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.980
 decided 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.770
 from my old home to Cologne too 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.850
 my new friends were there 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.300
 unlike earlier 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.280
 but when I met her it was over 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.870
 happen to me 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.399
 At first I was surprised by this feeling 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.530
 infatuation to find 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.710
 but now I was wearing a long time with me 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.390
 there is no showing around 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.189
 interest that about friendship 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.670
 went out 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.689
 that made me unsure it rang 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.979
 I was in for a last look 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.290
 mirrored and directed a brown 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.680
 hair again deal opens 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.299
 the door is in full size and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.900
 beauty stood in front of me and grinned at me 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.659
 with his unmistakable grin on her 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.630
 hd welcomed me i represent mine 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.060
 eyes that was not my favorite 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.920
 nickname as my right one 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.590
 do not know names and therefore mean 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.790
 Youtube took take but because was first 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.409
 he allowed himself to go through it 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.310
 The double-cd I replied was with him 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.729
 that something different 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.479
 he likes to be called so we are short 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.490
 and every touch of credit until completely 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.130
 nice brown noticed on the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.149
 away to the restaurant we ran there is only 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.979
 A few streets from my apartment 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.840
 was removed 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.740
 Well, maybe a little bit 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 bit my veins and one 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.440
 he protested then he held his arm 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.480
 take mine 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.200
 the difference was more than clear 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.300
 see 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.470
 It's not what you think I am 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.250
 not without his knowledge in the summer 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.500
 holiday driven 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.230
 that is just offered to defend 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.110
 I'm right, too 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.959
 I know, she grinned in the restaurant 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.890
 He grabs his camera, I'm allowed to short 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.340
 to record in front of her blog 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.920
 he asks why he did not flinch with the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.430
 shoulder and set off so we go 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.450
 eat delicious now say hello hello 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.069
 I called and waved 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.459
 I pushed myself even more into it 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.620
 picture a camel or what did she ask 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.760
 That's my job in every way 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.930
 then we leave and you she invited me 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.450
 the evening was lukewarm when we got the restaurant 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.310
 left the sun just went down 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.500
 and so we decided something else 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.760
 to walk on the Rhine with the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.890
 Hands in the bags we love 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.790
 next to each other 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.190
 My eyes are hard on you 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.930
 I assigned sneakers should I 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.959
 urgently get new ones were here 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.130
 not really my style anyway 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.019
 the pure glitter walls have but 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.140
 and I decided that I necessarily 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.190
 again something shore would have to record 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.060
 again to drive here again 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.910
 seemed to me a good idea 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.950
 But she would most like to have to 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.709
 I tell him because the evening went 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.639
 slow to decline 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.359
 jerkily I stopped and turned 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.049
 me to him 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.709
 He looks me straight in the eye I have to 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.859
 tell you something 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.690
 place out and I hope that's it 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.670
 nothing breaks between us but 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.900
 rather better 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.569
 my heart nearly beat me 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.889
 I did not care 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.840
 so what are the passers-by around us 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.819
 maybe surprised or disgusted 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.430
 but look at me 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.850
 approach and simply kissed him, it is he 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.500
 just look right 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.209
 solved after a small finiteness 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.910
 we will meet again 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.579
 I hope that was what you meant grins 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.430
 I looked at his face completely 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.040
 exactly his gray eyes with the brown ones 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.010
 the middle his light dark circles 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.590
 his beard approach all that I kept in 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.880
 my thoughts are something of mine 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.359
 lipsticks on his and hang 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.400
 remained 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.639
 I grinned because that would hopefully 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.650
 To look more often that was exactly what I was 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.450
 I meant love you 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.550
 I'm so glad you know that 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.909
 you died back to berlin 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.319
 berlin berlin was far away and if 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:35.389
 I actually return there 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:38.970
 would only be easy with my side 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.440
 the horror that they end up in this 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.389
 do not serve and she means 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.150
 Some of you may call to 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.819
 the sharks among you from one last 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.340
 part 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:53.460
 why this video comes today why 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.370
 this video comes today because i enjoy it 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.870
 on it had only definition 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.400
 let's see maybe I'll manage 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.340
 the next part of bringing me was 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.139
 Living something means today or tomorrow 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.530
 record and then within 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.659
 to upload this weekend 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.449
 if not then the next one will come 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:17.069
 probably only on wednesday but I think so 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.430
 Should do it because this is not 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:23.210
 took so long and it is 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:27.349
 weekend and I have a lot of time because 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:30.690
 Valentine's Day and I have nothing to do 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.300
 for all the Valentine's Day right 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.529
 I wish to celebrate a nice one 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.229
 Happy Valentine's Day for all who do not 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.550
 I just say celebrate you anyway 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.610
 a nice fall services said 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.860
 like everyone else 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.090
 apart from that, that's the same me 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.680
 should be removed at this point 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.060
 turn 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.539
 I hope we will be back and up 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.539
 next time
