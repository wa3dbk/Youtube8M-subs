kind of took the hinge in the pillar and
overextended<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.969> try<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.090> open<00:00:42.300> this

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
overextended it so just try to open this

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.790 
overextended it so just try to open this
door<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.320> how<00:00:43.500> wonky<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:45.800> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
door so you see how wonky it is the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.060 
door so you see how wonky it is the
geometry<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.489> bit<00:00:47.640> messed<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.690> have

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.369 

253<00:00:53.070> half-ton<00:00:53.760> doors<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:55.020> don't<00:00:55.199> have

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
253 half-ton doors but they don't have

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.000 
253 half-ton doors but they don't have
that<00:00:55.410> little<00:00:57.079> quarter<00:00:58.079> moon<00:00:58.230> crescent<00:00:58.559> cut

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that little quarter moon crescent cut

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.560 
that little quarter moon crescent cut
out<00:00:59.129> down<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.789> you'd<00:00:59.910> have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.180> cut<00:01:00.390> that

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
out down there so you'd have to cut that

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.119 
out down there so you'd have to cut that
out<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:00.960> wanted<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> swap<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> whole<00:01:01.920> door

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
out if you wanted to swap the whole door

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.870 
out if you wanted to swap the whole door
I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:03.500> this<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.559> salvageable<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.670> don't

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
I think this is salvageable but I don't

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.810 
I think this is salvageable but I don't
just<00:01:06.060> depends<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:08.119> type<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.299> body<00:01:09.420> work<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
just depends on on type of body work you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
just depends on on type of body work you
you<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:14.299> let's<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.540> inside<00:01:15.920> the

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.300 
here there's very very few rust issues
like<00:02:11.459> very<00:02:11.700> light<00:02:11.879> surface<00:02:12.120> rust

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
like very light surface rust

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.470 
like very light surface rust
but<00:02:13.520> there's<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.760> little<00:02:13.970> bit<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.180> an<00:02:14.330> alley

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.320 
they're not too bad looks like he pulled
it<00:02:17.239> out<00:02:17.360> at<00:02:17.540> one<00:02:17.690> point<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> pan<00:02:19.849> around<00:02:20.060> to

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
it out at one point it's a pan around to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.360 
it out at one point it's a pan around to
the<00:02:20.450> rear<00:02:20.690> there<00:02:21.470> was<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:22.270> bed<00:02:23.270> on<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.569> truck
