they<00:01:47.200> got<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.470> stop<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:47.980> so<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.280> this

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
they got to stop and so is this

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.850 
they got to stop and so is this
basketball<00:01:49.150> but<00:01:49.660> obviously<00:01:50.380> we've<00:01:50.710> been

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
basketball but obviously we've been

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.280 
basketball but obviously we've been
doing<00:01:51.040> her<00:01:51.130> loudly<00:01:51.870> we've<00:01:52.870> been<00:01:53.050> everywhere

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
doing her loudly we've been everywhere

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.719 
doing her loudly we've been everywhere
we<00:01:53.500> have<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.620> good<00:01:53.800> enough<00:01:53.890> team<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.520> our

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
we have a good enough team and our

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.700 
we have a good enough team and our
chemistry<00:01:55.240> is<00:01:55.270> good<00:01:55.660> enough<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:55.930> think<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.229> make

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
chemistry is good enough I think to make

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.950 
chemistry is good enough I think to make
comebacks<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.190> forth<00:01:57.520> it's<00:01:57.760> not<00:01:57.910> like<00:01:58.810> we're

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
comebacks and forth it's not like we're

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.130
