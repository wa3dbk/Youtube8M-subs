using the piarc inserts which I am happy

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.520 
using the piarc inserts which I am happy
told<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.520> guys<00:01:26.640> before<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.659> printed<00:01:28.200> some

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
told you guys before that I printed some

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.030 
told you guys before that I printed some
inserts<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:30.180> tried<00:01:30.890> experimenting<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
inserts and I tried experimenting with a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.100 
inserts and I tried experimenting with a
lot<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.250> different<00:01:32.610> things<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.450> I've<00:01:33.810> just

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
lot of different things but I've just

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.249 
lot of different things but I've just
come<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.650> realize<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.960> cannot<00:01:36.960> print

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
come to realize that I cannot print

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.249 
come to realize that I cannot print
things<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.700> me<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.390> easier<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
things so for me it's just easier to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.410 
things so for me it's just easier to
purchase<00:01:41.119> pre-printed

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
purchase pre-printed

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.109 
purchase pre-printed
inserts<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.549> happy<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.939> these

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
inserts and I'm really happy with these

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.929 
inserts and I'm really happy with these
from<00:01:45.390> PR<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:47.040> paper<00:01:47.250> quality<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.759> great

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.050 
really really nice and I'm very happy
with<00:01:51.149> them<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.170> I'm<00:01:52.290> using<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
with them so this is what I'm using and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
with them so this is what I'm using and
as<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.409> week<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:56.070> one

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
as you can see because it's week on one

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.980 
as you can see because it's week on one
page<00:01:56.640> there's<00:01:57.090> not<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.420> much<00:01:57.750> room<00:01:57.810> for<00:01:58.439> every

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
page there's not as much room for every

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.710 
page there's not as much room for every
so<00:02:00.410> I<00:02:00.710> still<00:02:01.070> do<00:02:01.280> decorating<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.240> still<00:02:02.540> try

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
so I still do decorating and I still try

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.860 
so I still do decorating and I still try
to<00:02:02.780> put<00:02:03.080> in<00:02:03.170> these<00:02:03.320> little<00:02:03.590> accent<00:02:04.070> pieces<00:02:04.310> but

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
to put in these little accent pieces but

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.330 
to put in these little accent pieces but
mostly<00:02:05.870> what<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.140> found<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:06.800> I've<00:02:07.010> had<00:02:07.190> to

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
mostly what I found is that I've had to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.810 
mostly what I found is that I've had to
do<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.640> after<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.270> fact<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:08.869> instead<00:02:09.470> of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
do it after the fact so instead of

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.430 
do it after the fact so instead of
decorating<00:02:10.820> for<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.600> week<00:02:11.780> ahead<00:02:11.930> and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
decorating for the week ahead and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.740 
decorating for the week ahead and

so<00:04:47.460> because<00:04:48.060> these<00:04:48.539> two<00:04:48.840> pages<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.590> look<00:04:49.830> at

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
so because these two pages I look at

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.469 
so because these two pages I look at
them<00:04:50.070> at<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> same<00:04:50.460> time<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:51.090> don't

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
them at the same time I don't

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.420 
them at the same time I don't
necessarily<00:04:51.630> decorate<00:04:52.620> them<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.949> same<00:04:53.160> but<00:04:53.400> I

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
necessarily decorate them the same but I

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.159 
necessarily decorate them the same but I
like<00:04:53.669> it<00:04:53.849> to<00:04:53.940> kind<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.210> coordinate<00:04:54.630> I<00:04:54.720> could<00:04:54.990> if

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
like it to kind of coordinate I could if

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.310 
like it to kind of coordinate I could if
I<00:04:55.289> wanted<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.740> decorate<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:57.360> use<00:04:57.720> this<00:04:58.050> as

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
I wanted to decorate and use this as

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.540 
I wanted to decorate and use this as
just<00:04:58.710> one<00:04:59.130> whole<00:05:00.199> themed<00:05:01.199> page<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:02.070> guess<00:05:02.250> I

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
just one whole themed page I guess I

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.830 
just one whole themed page I guess I
could<00:05:02.699> do<00:05:02.849> that<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.090> don't<00:05:03.360> think<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:03.720> really

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
could do that I don't think it really

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.620 
could do that I don't think it really
matters<00:05:04.139> that<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:05.310> is<00:05:05.520> one<00:05:06.030> week<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.539> this
