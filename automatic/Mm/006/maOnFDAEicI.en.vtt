but you should that's not true well now

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.029 
but you should that's not true well now
they're<00:01:56.330> doing<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:56.989> now<00:01:57.200> more<00:01:57.560> people<00:01:57.800> are

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
they're doing it and now more people are

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.979 
they're doing it and now more people are
doing<00:01:58.310> conversion<00:01:58.819> so<00:01:58.910> we<00:01:59.000> think<00:01:59.179> in<00:01:59.509> general

00:01:59.979 --> 00:01:59.989 
doing conversion so we think in general

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.229 
doing conversion so we think in general
as<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.410> community<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:00.979> u.s.<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.640> think

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239 
as the community the u.s. I think

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:03.729 
as the community the u.s. I think
they're<00:02:02.390> finally<00:02:02.750> maturing<00:02:03.110> or<00:02:03.440> finally

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
they're finally maturing or finally

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.529 
they're finally maturing or finally
growing<00:02:03.920> up<00:02:04.069> and<00:02:04.220> saying<00:02:04.340> wow<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:05.119> isn't

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
growing up and saying wow this isn't

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.639 
growing up and saying wow this isn't
that<00:02:05.810> bad<00:02:06.050> we<00:02:06.380> can<00:02:06.849> we<00:02:07.849> can<00:02:07.880> have<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> more<00:02:09.289> games

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
that realizing okay they stamped this

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.800 
that realizing okay they stamped this
for<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.520> reason<00:02:22.730> they<00:02:22.970> put<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.240> sticker<00:02:23.510> on

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
for that reason now we understand so is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.900 
for that reason now we understand so is
it<00:02:27.200> there's<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.040> community<00:02:28.490> there<00:02:28.610> really<00:02:28.820> is

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
years and I think I came back at when a

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.560 
years and I think I came back at when a
system<00:06:02.020> was<00:06:02.380> created<00:06:02.590> at<00:06:02.830> an<00:06:02.919> all-time<00:06:03.100> low

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
system was created at an all-time low

system was created at an all-time low
about<00:06:04.570> last<00:06:05.470> year<00:06:05.830> september-october<00:06:06.430> I

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
about last year september-october I

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
a little high by posed here a post there

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.330 
a little high by posed here a post there
and<00:06:13.080> when<00:06:14.080> I<00:06:14.169> came<00:06:14.229> back<00:06:14.440> about<00:06:14.770> three<00:06:15.130> four

and when I came back about three four
months<00:06:15.490> later<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.880> system<00:06:16.240> just<00:06:16.390> peaked<00:06:16.780> and

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
months later the system just peaked and

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.750 
months later the system just peaked and
that<00:06:17.650> had<00:06:17.800> a<00:06:17.830> lot<00:06:17.979> to<00:06:18.100> do<00:06:18.190> as<00:06:18.280> well<00:06:18.460> gee<00:06:18.550> we<00:06:18.669> all

SMBs<00:06:44.400> I<00:06:44.640> could<00:06:45.510> see<00:06:45.920> really<00:06:46.920> really<00:06:47.250> taking<00:06:47.400> on

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
SMBs I could see really really taking on

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.250 
SMBs I could see really really taking on
all<00:06:47.640> they<00:06:48.120> need<00:06:48.270> to<00:06:48.300> die<00:06:48.480> start<00:06:48.780> to<00:06:48.870> when<00:06:48.990> I<00:06:49.080> was

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
all they need to die start to when I was

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.220 
all they need to die start to when I was
figuring<00:06:49.980> out<00:06:50.040> how<00:06:50.250> to<00:06:50.280> do<00:06:51.050> maybe<00:06:52.050> the

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
figuring out how to do maybe the

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.500 
figuring out how to do maybe the
controllers<00:06:53.180> because<00:06:54.180> some<00:06:54.360> of<00:06:54.390> these

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510 
controllers because some of these

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.500 
controllers because some of these
constant<00:06:54.990> lies<00:06:55.110> MBS<00:06:55.560> is<00:06:55.940> they<00:06:56.940> haven't<00:06:57.330> even

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
constant lies MBS is they haven't even

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.050 
constant lies MBS is they haven't even
have<00:06:57.660> controllers<00:06:58.140> to<00:06:58.410> match<00:06:58.670> you<00:06:59.670> may<00:06:59.850> still

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
have controllers to match you may still

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.600 
have controllers to match you may still
have<00:07:00.120> to<00:07:00.330> plug<00:07:00.540> in<00:07:00.750> an<00:07:00.960> old<00:07:01.650> neogeo<00:07:02.190> system

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
have to plug in an old neogeo system

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.180 
have to plug in an old neogeo system
controller<00:07:03.030> or<00:07:03.270> control<00:07:03.630> pad<00:07:03.840> I<00:07:04.200> would<00:07:05.040> love

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
controller or control pad I would love

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.760 
controller or control pad I would love
to<00:07:05.250> see<00:07:05.550> a<00:07:05.580> new<00:07:05.910> class<00:07:06.570> based<00:07:06.990> controller<00:07:07.500> may

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
to see a new class based controller may

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.090 
to see a new class based controller may
be<00:07:07.830> a<00:07:07.920> new<00:07:08.540> different<00:07:09.680> plastic<00:07:10.680> controller

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
be a new different plastic controller

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.450 
be a new different plastic controller
maybe<00:07:11.730> a<00:07:11.940> walnut<00:07:12.510> controller<00:07:13.020> no<00:07:13.530> I<00:07:13.740> just<00:07:14.160> want

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
maybe a walnut controller no I just want

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.490 
maybe a walnut controller no I just want
to<00:07:14.550> see<00:07:14.700> what<00:07:14.850> what<00:07:15.390> the<00:07:15.540> creations<00:07:16.230> are<00:07:16.380> going

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
to see what what the creations are going

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.620 
to see what what the creations are going
to<00:07:16.560> be<00:07:16.710> the<00:07:16.890> next<00:07:17.010> five<00:07:17.310> years<00:07:17.640> where<00:07:18.480> does<00:07:18.600> it

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
to be the next five years where does it

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.250 
to be the next five years where does it
end<00:07:19.490> maybe<00:07:20.490> I<00:07:20.580> would<00:07:21.120> love<00:07:21.180> to<00:07:21.240> see<00:07:21.510> new

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.260 
end maybe I would love to see new

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.070 
end maybe I would love to see new
cartridge<00:07:22.740> designs<00:07:23.190> for<00:07:24.060> the<00:07:24.090> AES<00:07:24.540> maybe<00:07:24.870> new

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
cartridge designs for the AES maybe new

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.350 
cartridge designs for the AES maybe new
boxes<00:07:25.620> we're<00:07:26.580> talking<00:07:26.730> with<00:07:27.060> one<00:07:27.210> of<00:07:27.270> the

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.940 
boxes we're talking with one of the
distributors<00:07:27.810> we're<00:07:27.990> talking<00:07:28.350> about<00:07:28.500> making

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.950 
distributors we're talking about making

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.860 
distributors we're talking about making
new<00:07:29.220> boxes<00:07:29.760> I<00:07:29.970> would<00:07:30.360> love<00:07:30.419> to<00:07:30.480> see<00:07:30.720> new

new boxes I would love to see new

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.780 
new boxes I would love to see new
cartridge<00:07:31.350> design<00:07:31.680> I<00:07:31.950> would<00:07:32.520> be<00:07:32.669> interested

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.790 
cartridge design I would be interested

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.940 
cartridge design I would be interested
to<00:07:33.240> seeing<00:07:33.510> some<00:07:33.900> of<00:07:33.930> the<00:07:34.050> glass<00:07:34.290> ones<00:07:34.680> come

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:34.950 
to seeing some of the glass ones come

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.850 
to seeing some of the glass ones come
out<00:07:35.070> in<00:07:35.340> class<00:07:35.610> cartridge<00:07:36.210> would<00:07:36.330> be<00:07:36.419> good

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.860 
out in class cartridge would be good
