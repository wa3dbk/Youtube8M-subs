set and we will fit sticks into here so

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.519 
set and we will fit sticks into here so
obviously<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.760> want<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.210> flat<00:00:21.570> side<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.869> be

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
obviously you want the flat side to be

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.259 
obviously you want the flat side to be
on<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.769> pudding<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.760> gonna<00:00:23.850> pop<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.210> in

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
on the pudding so just gonna pop this in

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.009 
on the pudding so just gonna pop this in
and<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.840> doesn't<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.199> snap<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.640> it

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
and it doesn't really snap in but it

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.990 
and it doesn't really snap in but it
goes<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:29.400> guess<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:29.820> you

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
goes like this and I guess then you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.680 
goes like this and I guess then you
place<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.779> pudding<00:00:34.940> like<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.660> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
place it in the pudding like that I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.680 
place it in the pudding like that I
think<00:00:37.670> okay<00:00:38.670> guys<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.300> did<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.510> very

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
think okay guys I just did that very

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229 
think okay guys I just did that very
wrong<00:00:39.989> you're<00:00:40.260> supposed<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> slide<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.489> thin

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
wrong you're supposed to slide the thin

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.650 
wrong you're supposed to slide the thin
side<00:00:42.510> through<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.480> thought<00:00:45.480> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
side through like that I thought it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.569 
side through like that I thought it
didn't<00:00:45.930> fit<00:00:46.110> well<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.030> pop<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.390> in

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
didn't fit well and then you pop it in

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
didn't fit well and then you pop it in
okay<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> got<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.300> fixed<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.530> are

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
okay now that I got that fixed they are

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.279 
okay now that I got that fixed they are
ready<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.539> you<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.780> pop<00:00:54.960> them<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
ready and you just pop them in the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.810 
ready and you just pop them in the
freezer<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.399> said<00:00:56.610> eight

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
freezer like this and it said eight

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
freezer like this and it said eight
hours<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> big<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.109> six<00:00:58.620> hours<00:00:58.920> for

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
hours for the big one and six hours for

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.279 
hours for the big one and six hours for
the<00:00:59.160> smaller<00:00:59.399> ones<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.690> takes<00:01:00.870> quite<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the smaller ones so it takes quite a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.399 
the smaller ones so it takes quite a
while<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> freeze<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:03.570> put<00:01:04.170> them<00:01:04.290> in
