00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.580
 hello that such friends speak to them Jorge 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.860
 camargo from where your tutorials today 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.279
 we continue with the tricks for windows 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.380
 7 in its remastered version 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.189
 this time we will explore the 3d flip function 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.780
 I hope you like this good video 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.699
 There are three ways to use this function 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.910
 well I'll start with the hardest up 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.949
 get to the simplest then then 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.019
 you simply choose the one that best 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.270
 see fit and start once the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.190
 video then first thing let's create 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.500
 a shortcut this is the first 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.040
 shape 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.079
 and new right 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.690
 direct access 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.190
 well we will appear this window we are going to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.699
 paste the code that I will leave in 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.699
 the description 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.230
 ah 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.740
 we stick it 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.869
 I love you next 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.110
 let's put a name in this case 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.110
 it will be 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.290
 3d 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.180
 and here we have it well this can be 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.150
 be for example anchoring it in the bar 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.360
 tasks for example enter here or by 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.540
 here and well 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.890
 here you can see what I have and 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.890
 access to what you want 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.690
 good in the same way in which those who 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.420
 we live in the previous video also what 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:58.070
 we have here to change the window 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.619
 we can get to this same one to this same 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.190
 function then this would be the second 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.850
 way to use the 3d flip 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.290
 ok now well there is a keyboard method 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.330
 much easier 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.400
 I will also teach you that 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.260
 achieve with the windows key 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.840
 more tabular here you can see 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.629
 and well that would be the three methods 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.230
 to use this function personally 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.350
 Well, I prefer the method of wing + 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.710
 tabulate you 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.620
 choose the one that seems best to you and that 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.090
 better suits your needs 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.580
 good so they do not have present the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.980
 reforms in case you forget the method 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.650
 by keyboard or how to place it on the bar 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.510
 of tasks 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.769
 so, I hope you liked it
