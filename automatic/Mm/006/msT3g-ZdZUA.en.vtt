00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
you and you see that you pass through

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.499 
you and you see that you pass through
the<00:01:39.570> bar<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.920> color<00:01:41.189> changes<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:42.299> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the bar and the color changes like that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
the bar and the color changes like that
and<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.439> choose<00:01:43.619> any<00:01:43.770> color<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.130> like

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.730 
and you can choose any color you like
but<00:01:44.520> I'm<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> choose<00:01:45.390> green<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.409> again

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
but I'm going to choose green so again

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.139 
but I'm going to choose green so again
here<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.250> pretty<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:48.350> green<00:01:49.350> color<00:01:50.119> okay

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
here are pretty pretty green color okay

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.539 
here are pretty pretty green color okay
you<00:01:51.509> see<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.990> green<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.649> not<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:53.100> it's

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you see that this green is not like it's

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.780 
you see that this green is not like it's
not<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.729> real<00:01:54.060> eye<00:01:54.689> green<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.250> are<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.640> on

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
not a real eye green so we are just on

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.330 
not a real eye green so we are just on
the<00:01:56.820> saturation<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.600> us<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> make<00:01:58.340> darker

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the saturation like us to make darker

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.450 
the saturation like us to make darker
and<00:01:59.549> more<00:01:59.780> believable<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.799> decreasing

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and more believable so I decreasing

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.300 
and more believable so I decreasing
inter-cell<00:02:02.969> eration

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
inter-cell eration

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.710 
inter-cell eration
and<00:02:05.310> lightness

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
and lightness

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.830 
and lightness
and<00:02:07.200> okay<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.620> guess<00:02:07.980> now<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.520> better
