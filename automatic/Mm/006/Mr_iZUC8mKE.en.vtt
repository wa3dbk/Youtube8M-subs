00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
this to work have been on 64-bit so I

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.570 
this to work have been on 64-bit so I
guess<00:00:24.060> I've<00:00:24.210> got<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> correct<00:00:25.430> solution<00:00:26.430> here

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
guess I've got the correct solution here

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.120 
guess I've got the correct solution here
I<00:00:27.029> found<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> solution<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.380> minecraft

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
I found the solution in the minecraft

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.429 
I found the solution in the minecraft
forums<00:00:29.670> somewhat<00:00:30.150> buried<00:00:30.480> under<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
forums somewhat buried under one of the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.880 
forums somewhat buried under one of the
many<00:00:31.650> why<00:00:32.610> isn't<00:00:33.030> minecraft<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.930> Steam<00:00:34.230> posts

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
many why isn't minecraft on Steam posts

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.860 
many why isn't minecraft on Steam posts
and<00:00:35.010> things<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.420> so<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> figure<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> make

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and things like that so I figure to make

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720 
and things like that so I figure to make
a<00:00:36.899> video<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.260> showing<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.920> how<00:00:38.610> they

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
a video just showing it to you how they

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.660 
a video just showing it to you how they
get<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> sit<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.300> nice<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.719> easily

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
get to sit up nice and easily

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
get to sit up nice and easily
specifically<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:41.910> when<00:00:42.090> there's<00:00:42.239> 64<00:00:42.690> bit

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
specifically for when there's 64 bit

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.400 
specifically for when there's 64 bit
this<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.590> will<00:00:43.710> also<00:00:43.800> work<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.219> 32-bit

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
this this will also work on 32-bit

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.600 
this this will also work on 32-bit
possibly<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.559> easier<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.160> might

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
possibly a little easier you might

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.020 
possibly a little easier you might
actually<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:48.000> able<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:49.250> add<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.610> exe

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
actually be able to just add the exe

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.580 
actually be able to just add the exe
directly<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.719> steam<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.920> anyway<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.899> let's<00:00:55.020> as

I'm<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.619> handed<00:01:43.890> open<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.970> dudettes<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I'm just handed open and dudettes like a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.910 
I'm just handed open and dudettes like a
program<00:01:46.020> that'll<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.409> least<00:01:46.560> give<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
program that'll at least give it the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.440 
program that'll at least give it the
right<00:01:47.070> name<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.290> some<00:01:49.290> other<00:01:49.470> stuff<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.450> guess

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450

this exe file and the problem with this

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
is that exe file essentially closes and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.249 
is that exe file essentially closes and

which what I just copied okay so

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.920 
which what I just copied okay so
essentially<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.389> want<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.660> start<00:03:48.810> with

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
essentially you you want to start with

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.300 
essentially you you want to start with
the<00:03:48.989> minecraft.exe<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:49.980> get<00:03:50.100> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
the minecraft.exe so that you get the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.490 
the minecraft.exe so that you get the
the<00:03:50.549> icon<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.269> name<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.660> everything<00:03:51.840> and

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
the icon and the name and everything and

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.559 
the icon and the name and everything and
the<00:03:52.709> correct<00:03:52.950> start<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.579> folder<00:03:54.030> which<00:03:54.389> I

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
the correct start in folder which I

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.970 
the correct start in folder which I
don't<00:03:54.630> actually<00:03:54.989> think<00:03:55.200> matters<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:55.829> this

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.509 
don't actually think matters for this
particular<00:03:56.790> game<00:03:57.060> but<00:03:57.920> they<00:03:58.920> need<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.190> make

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
particular game but they need to make

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.759 
particular game but they need to make
sure<00:03:59.549> it's<00:03:59.819> pointing<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.329> job<00:04:00.510> at<00:04:00.690> wxz

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
sure it's pointing to the job at wxz

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.009 
sure it's pointing to the job at wxz
and<00:04:01.950> then<00:04:02.310> -<00:04:02.609> jar<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.299> then<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.540> path<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.930> your

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
and then - jar and then the path to your

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.080 
and then - jar and then the path to your
actual<00:04:04.380> minecraft<00:04:04.590> exe<00:04:05.220> file<00:04:05.750> so<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:08.090> should

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
actual minecraft exe file so that should

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.599 
actual minecraft exe file so that should
in<00:04:09.389> theory<00:04:09.660> be<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:10.139> so<00:04:10.859> we're<00:04:10.980> gonna<00:04:11.069> hit<00:04:11.250> close

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
in theory be it so we're gonna hit close

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.569 
in theory be it so we're gonna hit close
and<00:04:12.000> test<00:04:12.389> it<00:04:13.340> okay

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
and test it okay

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.020 
and test it okay

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
here yeah the keys all still work so you

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.580 
here yeah the keys all still work so you
kind<00:04:44.759> of<00:04:44.819> have<00:04:44.939> to<00:04:44.969> they<00:04:45.900> sort<00:04:46.169> of<00:04:46.199> work<00:04:46.379> I<00:04:46.560> just

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
kind of have to they sort of work I just

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.279 
kind of have to they sort of work I just
pushed<00:04:46.979> a<00:04:47.219> shift<00:04:47.789> tab<00:04:48.029> but<00:04:48.419> then<00:04:48.509> I<00:04:48.539> just<00:04:48.599> hit<00:04:48.870> W

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
pushed a shift tab but then I just hit W

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.379 
pushed a shift tab but then I just hit W
while<00:04:50.069> I'm<00:04:50.249> in<00:04:50.370> this<00:04:50.520> menu<00:04:50.909> and<00:04:51.150> I'm<00:04:51.240> actually

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
while I'm in this menu and I'm actually

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.029 
while I'm in this menu and I'm actually
moving<00:04:51.689> around<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.139> game<00:04:52.379> so<00:04:52.680> that's<00:04:52.740> not

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
moving around on the game so that's not

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.230 
moving around on the game so that's not
ideal<00:04:53.249> so<00:04:54.770> they<00:04:55.770> will<00:04:55.949> kind<00:04:56.069> of<00:04:56.159> have<00:04:56.279> to<00:04:56.550> an

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
ideal so they will kind of have to an

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.670 
ideal so they will kind of have to an
actually<00:04:57.659> appears<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.229> have<00:04:58.319> completely

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680
