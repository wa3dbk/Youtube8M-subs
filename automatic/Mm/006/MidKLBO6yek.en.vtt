00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.540
 and what's up all this is my new bass 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.040
 that I just bought is a tender base 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.420
 precision this lefty of course and then 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.900
 well I wanted to do it in box and nothing else 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.730
 because I do not know about the video and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:32.110
 it's an adame box like we are a meter 40 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:35.610
 not as much as 30 meter to be opening 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.610
 so let's start 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.710
 like two days I started doing the other 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.710
 video for some reason the other part 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.330
 like it was not recorded was deleted I'm not 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.830
 very sure that happened but it is not enough 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.260
 say the norm because I finish it 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.990
 say so good here is the bass already 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.460
 this I had to change the ropes 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.790
 because the strings were with him 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.500
 straight 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.230
 was the maturity has been either was a 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.110
 low salary that someone used right 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.970
 I do not know why all his for everyone 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.510
 Alicante the ropes put him 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.590
 to learn 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.090
 I used the video already like a song 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.700
 with him we have probably gone up 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.410
 around this week that looks very 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.270
 well in prayer very well use the 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.180
 same broad guitar because I do not have 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.300
 another but the bass would be fine and so 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.300
 good
