 good morning today is monday and me 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.219
 just woke up I already showered I have 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.960
 brushed my teeth I had breakfast 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.690
 in the garden because today is super tasty 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.460
 outside again i just felt it 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.840
 become warm because it becomes one to 25 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.250
 degrees of faith or something 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.320
 I can just rub my family on 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 with a factor of 50 because I don't have to go too long 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 in the sun without factor because I read 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.080
 so undergo treatment from it 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.939
 tomorrow is now really super glossy 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.080
 but I will record a video later and 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.559

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.910
 namely the 5 minute makeup challenge 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.520

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.040
 bit short day 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.960
 and then I will work on my blog 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.760
 yes there are still some things on my to do 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 list that I need so I can finish it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.100
 beautiful today 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.049
 and hopefully I can do a little more 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 enjoy the sun in the garden it really is 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.259
 very tasty today so yes I go 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.729
 but start quickly 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.860
 i 'm just working for my blog 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.960
 I need a campaign photo 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.180
 edit and this write is the program 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.369
 that i use this is called pixel meter and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.960
 I'll just see how this looks exactly 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.689
 that's how you write it 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.950
 how to focus pixel meter this is a whole 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.380
 useful program it looks a bit like 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.970
 photoshop but you have so just what 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 other functions and so it something 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.049
 easier and a lot cheaper than you 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.579
 if you don't have a photo shop , this is it 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.810
 just a very good alternative you can 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.430
 you simply download it via the app store 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.890
 from mac 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.460
 and the only thing I often adjust 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 and the rate that is that here so that ordinary 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.110
 comparison shows that I get here 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.430
 to it and then you can do this one thing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.520
 move around a photo 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.560
 very clear or very dark or 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.689
 clear and then you can do some contrast 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.210
 adjust a little look now see what 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.530
 dark the there i can really do anything 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.060
 I just think it is very useful 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.010
 to edit my photos 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.540
 and often the only thing I change 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.670
 so that choice 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.380
 I curt help him be here and 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.120
 furthermore I do something with the color and stuff 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.340
 but for now this is 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.110
 yes only what i use and i am going now this one 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.270
 We finish and then I'm filming 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.959
 for my youtube channel 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.830
 I have issued invoices and I have my e- mails 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.290
 I answer 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.640
 so I can also cross that and 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.640
 I also made payments 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.130
 so the makeup a bit further I have to 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.930
 there are still a few things to do and people like me 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.430
 him again I finished it a quick loop 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.209
 made myself ready because 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.890
 wrap with chicken and lettuce and garlic sauce 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.420
 and you also see the foil around it because me 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.860
 hate it when that bottom is falling apart 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.720
 falls is this is just very bad for me 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.970
 easy way to eat it 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.170
 because you just do a sort of yes 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.720
 I from 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.610
