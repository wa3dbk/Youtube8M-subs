00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Well welcome guys today in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.420
 this new video 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.109
 we are the review of young dos 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.889
 santos 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.660
 the agreement informs or simply yes 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.849
 then the source liked the nurse 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.390
 I really bought this a lot 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.789
 player has a price that is around 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.199
 50 thousand credits 45,000 in short, we are there and 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.720
 I bought it twice because I have it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.250
 made a kind of sale and there 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.279
 I earned 10,000 at the end but 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.660
 this thing does not interest you 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.969
 this is the second team as you can 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.730
 see in the one used for that in 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.460
 a first team used it in a 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.410
 4 1 2 1 2 with peacock I'm not at all 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.809
 found well but marked very few 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.840
 goal but played bad I put it with a 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.239
 physical striker like karim is gone 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.100
 well really very high statistics e 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.760
 perfect network work and screen I'd say of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.989
 start talking about the pros of this 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.780
 player 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 then the first pro is dribbling 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.920
 because this player counts 90's 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.369
 ball control and 92 affective books 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.299
 beyond the 4 stars skill monza then 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.010
 What I have to say 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.869
 because in any case it's the boys rooms 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.000
 sun balloon in addition to telling you that this 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.860
 player is really very fast indeed 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.200
 very agile and really very skilled 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.430
 other names I can say because anyway 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.340
 let the man skip any way you do 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.119
 take the man you jump it does too 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 rhyme 92 dribbling and 90 control 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.329
 ball for a striker really is 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.610
 important controls the ball though 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.900
 however at least the control can 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.420
 to the bow because the one strength and 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.840
 ie a player or and low with a good 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.030
 good finalization or is ball control 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 tall maybe with more ball control 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.420
 however thin, the stronger he is 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.990
 the first option, however, is a great first 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.280
 option 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.160
 then against the ball excellent dribbling 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.180
 great and 4 stars I write on totti 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.610
 second, however, a finalization 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.290
 which however is not really perfect though 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.190
 in front of the doorman this guy does not 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.670
 never wrong 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.350
 87 reported on shooting card 82 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.750
 this brings the finalization back to the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.450
 power because in front of the goalkeeper 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.650
 ok but a little more outside the area is located 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.090
 bad this player 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.430
 thanks to the piero power I found 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.930
 insufficient 84 shot power mi 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.510
 I was waiting for a shot from the Madonna 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.220
 so it wasn't because of how much 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.270
 it's about shooting a volley 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.220
 long shot long shot even oh well pulls 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.650
 around the fly is fine facts 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.019
 I could even if the lines with indeed the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.410
 also included in the pros however the 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:57.769
 shooting power is not really pointless 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:00.290
 84 which seems to be 75 75 is not at all a 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.660
 good parameter the shooting power 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.390
 I think it's the basis of a good shot e 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.250
 I am not saddened by this 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.080
 because in any case it is an attacker like 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.739
 he had good shooting power 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.420
 would be great would have changed between the 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.780
 pro obviously the four stars 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.069
 foamy 4-star weak eye foot 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.799
 excellent excellent excellent 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.040
 the ultimate pro instead of the agility and the 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.239
 I balance them because this 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.599
 player is low 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.780
 175 thanks to its enormous agility it was 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.269
 its standards balancing the agility the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.730
 very high balance as very high 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.510
 as parameters as parameter do 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.719
 really a super fast player 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:49.270
 very fast which makes space thanks to the 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:53.900
 his small size 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.150
 among all practically of pensions and it is 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.490
 really strong 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.430
 among the chrono among the cons therefore beyond 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.130
 to the power pull the positioning 72 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.680
 he is absolutely not well 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.930
 72 positioning for an attacker with 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:14.420
 87 of finalization very little if he 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.860
 would have 90 the positioning would do 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.900
 five times as many goals 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.549
 the fivefold is certainly not a bomber 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.630
 of this area I can assure you it is 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.820
 strong 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.460
 in front of the goalkeeper but it is certainly not a 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.450
 penalty area bomber type negri ed 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.340
 steve inzaghi I understood ok perfect 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.860
 these are the best and the pros 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.340
 against john dos santos second informs 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:41.810
 player that I think 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.630
 nor valid here are worth 20k 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.080
 it should cost 30k per axis 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.180
 the toti and I wouldn't want to do even one 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.930
 bikes on perfect set-pieces 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.930
 Hi everyone
