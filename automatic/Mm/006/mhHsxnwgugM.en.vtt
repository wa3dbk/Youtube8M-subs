00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 good part of the coffee that Brazil produces 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 adi hard-hit areas 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.559
 is the so-called mountain coffee now you 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.200
 will know a technique that aims to 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.810
 facilitate management of the crop and with this 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.060
 reduce the farmer's effort to beauty 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.960
 landscape contrasts with the difficulty 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.269
 to work on the uneven terrain 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.429
 no matter what the task is in the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.810
 The first challenge here is to 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.630
 stand up 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.530
 I avoided that it will correct floor assert 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.700
 when the foot 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 now the leg gets very irritated explain 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.160
 asked a quick so the grain did not come down 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.200
 down hill and worker improvise until 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.360
 a school to hold the cloth 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.489
 harvest the slope that is so 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.559
 that the coffee can go away 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.510
 it hurts everything though the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.600
 in Brazil occupies an area of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.699
 approximately 600 thousand hectares and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.440
 production in this type of relief is 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.110
 concentrated in mine states 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.869
 santo rio de janeiro and are 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.970
 paulo with something around 10 to 12 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.840
 millions of bags per year 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.220
 this corresponds to 20 to 25% of all 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.240
 coffee is harvested 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.549
 here the slope in the mountains 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.700
 producers of coffee which generally varies 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.460
 30 to 50 percent has always been a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.250
 obstacle to the farmer is what 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.670
 agronomist josé braz matiello points out 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.259
 Procafé the foundation that is coming up the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.920
 bank 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.930
 we are accustomed 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.869
 imagine the car carrying coffee, right? 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.259
 because the coffee came to rest on the mountain 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.320
 since last year colonization was 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.990
 made in this region, the terrain is 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.899
 weather is good it rains well because a part 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.509
 of the day gets sunshine another does not get a coffee 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.520
 like this half- shadow how it got 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.290
 the question of legislation for the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.439
 agriculture on top of hill 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.479
 this part here respecting this 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.489
 slope is perfect 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.039
 in addition it has the part that after 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.450
 consolidated legislation considered this 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.849
 because the people have been farming a lot 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.930
 this is in several regions of several 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.300
 cultures 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.920
 now it's laborious to deal with a crop 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.160
 on the ground like that, right? 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.860
 it is because you can not mechanize this so 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.140
 little faith from 30 to 50 percent in tone 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.360
 walk the slide 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.390
 to change this situation the foundation 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.160
 together with the federation of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.769
 agriculture of the state of rio de janeiro 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.760
 is proposing the construction of 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.680
 technically it has been called micro 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.590
 Terracing is because the land its 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.180
 close on small land to know 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.450
 How is that work done? 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.030
 we came to good jesus from itabapoana 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.700
 in the northwest of the state of rio de janeiro 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.730
 on his family's sport property 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.370
 where all the coffee is planted in a curve 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.170
 level before showing how to do a 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.090
 micro terracing we need 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.400
 introduce the character who does most 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.829
 strength in this work the ox 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.019
 his general to work in a field 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.959
 so inclined so it takes traction 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.970
 animal it is necessary that if it was not 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.799
 retaliation would be very difficult to 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.900
 access to its value and this type of 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.220
 work how flame is black 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.799
 Sergipe 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.829
 besides the sergipe his general account still 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.959
 with the help of the Franciscan brother who operates 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.840
 equipment that will be pulled by the 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.790
 Ox is holding it so it does not get out of the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.120
 line that has to the person hold 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:45.340
 when you reach the end of the line you turn 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.480
 mutt is easy to turn fan back and 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.459
 so on 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.790
 the work that will be done separately 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.160
 He cuts dirt to get loose. 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.519
 with equipment that will drag up 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.519
 scraping and leveling the earth 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:04.329
 Shoot that other outfit a blade 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:07.060
 of animal traction turned the mud on one side 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.790
 for the other to play land and there 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.130
 will be general of your francisco cutting 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.040
 the street between one career and another 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.150
 coffee must be at least three meters 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.329
 width 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.840
 will be at least four passes until 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.930
 the micro terracing is ready as 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.139
 floating on average 2 kilometers per hour 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.249
 work in a 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:34.069
 hectare takes about three days and the 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.330
 that he follows the Lord's voice that 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.629
 stick how is it 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.529
 is the voice with the van she goes goes how was the 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.569
 nilton steering wheel 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.840
 the rod then looks like it's a direction 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.889
 I was a steering wheel of 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.259
 francisco, how do you have to be at 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.810
 land to help make the best 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.330
 work to the good with wet land and 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.749
 The coast is very wet. 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.550
 it's not good it's very dry too 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:02.000
 It's not good, it has to be in the middle too. 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.900
 having my time in and out of 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.360
 past 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.779
 the street is gaining an appearance 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.379
 most passable worker can do 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:14.150
 all the deal you want to do bai tho 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.680
 of an ease to put a cloth 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.830
 nicoletta 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.930
 and also holds water from the 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.969
 that make all the water and all 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.699
 puts it that will filter and will favor 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.770
 much the labor and that ditch that was 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.169
 made ditch we do a finish 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.300
 part while ground is still well 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.339
 loose will hold the water it's as if it were 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.919
 a guarantee for the initial terrace 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.900
 then the terrain stabilizes there 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.089
 ends up assuming this valley and the very 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.699
 rain food with handsome 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:46.219
 stayed if I go to see here with check 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.500
 here as when he gave itv who is 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.259
 with an order of one meter and 30 exactly who 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.689
 It is trying to undermine the final en 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:56.750
 the tractor that we use the tact was 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:59.149
 made and had one meter one meter and 15 more 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.879
 or less then step gauge pass 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:04.939
 and quiet and see with the flat way 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.589
 tractor safety shovel to work 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:08.449
 so give the security of working for 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:10.849
 seeming to work on the plan and 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:13.039
 so small equipments already do 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.139
 part of the national coffee 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.919
 even in flat areas because the crops 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.779
 have become increasingly advanced is 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.789
 doing about four months 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:25.279
 that micro-terracing has been 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:27.560
 made on this property and in the areas where 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:29.899
 the work is older the farmer 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.020
 noticed a difference not only in the ease of 

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:34.099
 dealing with farming but also vigor 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.349
 of plants 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:38.000
 the unit is getting on the sound then the 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.030
 people see clearly that the sheet is 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.530
 growing in this period is not 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.090
 9 and here we are not 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.690
 just what actions are being done 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.310
 new 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.590
 how do we perceive that we have 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.680
 new budding of these younger leaves 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.170
 here's something greener I bring this 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.970
 here is only the voting is new that the part 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.830
 what was not done you do not find 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.260
 in this phase of a 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.660
 that means what it means 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.930
 productivity signal next year 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.660
 so far their post family has made the 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.510
 micro- terracing in one of its five 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.300
 hectares and the expectation here 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:17.030
 This new technique is exciting. 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.790
 Our goal is to make a show where 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.560
 to do because even without the 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.440
 machine people already feel very 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.870
 favored is both in the harvested 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.590
 fertilizer spraying the ground having 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.780
 per annum 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.030
 we did not see the time that they wanted 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.100
 and you may think they are 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.480
 more in the handling of the mark than in 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:44.330
 You 'll step on it and it makes a difference. 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:46.370
 much difference at the end of a micro 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:50.410
 terracing costs 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.410
 around 600 reais per hectare
