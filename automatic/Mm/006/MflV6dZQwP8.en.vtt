00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.060
 new video on the game with me channel 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.919
 You can easily recognize what I am here 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.530
 in my hands ready for you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.420
 clever game clever game you know 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.080
 maybe smart under the name 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.880
 dough 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.880
 we have new intelligent play dough 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.369
 you are worried today in the color 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.050
 shiny silver and clever partie 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.310
 That's from a manufacturer who had 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.619
 we in the channel not yet and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.380
 Although a manufacturer toba I believe 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.359
 from the UK and the smart one 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.309
 crisis comes here in a box as usual 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.350
 synonymous with other manufacturers but 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.730
 this time here in his black loose way 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.610
 matt black, I personally find a lot 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.320
 cool and in front we see the logo 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.110
 by clever partie a human 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.149
 skull with an orange in brain and 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.730
 the hint what the intelligent 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.520
 can knead 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.989
 Zuber treble vertebrate potthoff to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.809
 So I jump on you can do it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.309
 tear shape and stretch and still 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.770
 because we are testing it today, of course 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.539
 in this video 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.050
 suitable is the spie Ã¤tna that is the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.870
 question 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.150
 once six plus and 0 to 3 so on 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.850
 no case for small children under three 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.780
 years and probably only from six 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.310
 years, ok gleams out ok 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.210
 silver I think it is not time 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.290
 unpack 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.810
 This is really easy this time 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.430
 the dose is open but seen 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.650
 this intelligent kneeling is still 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.320
 packed up 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.800
 also for the first time for the right one 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.800
 broken bag and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.360
 So intelligent knead our selection 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.760
 this really really hard to mold that 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.710
 she was that is we see here and 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.700
 you can reach them too 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.700
 works very well 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.680
 I'll go what I do 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.009
 Did you know yes I do not know if 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.290
 that comes from the bag or from the bag 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:09.030
 Kneading itself smells a bit this time 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.920
 a little bit more so on everyone 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.920
 Hard case before I have to say 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.600
 it's also grayer to me than 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.260
 shiny silver, it is gray 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.260
 but it can defend my eyes 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.220
 you have to be a bit too 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.220
 play to make it easier 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.800
 no, that's not how fast we are 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.550
 can in any case to this before 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.380
 well, we can often be form- clear though 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.030
 a bit I say more exhausting 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.040
 as with the other intelligent crisis 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.720
 that we have met so far 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.520
 There were one or two candidates 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.960
 maybe you also know from the best 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.420
 of course wants to be the best again 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.900
 Of course, but come to a 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.450
 other times there are candidates too 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.410
 a bit harder to shape 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.790
 and candidates who are not too heavy 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.980
 this candidate was clearly partie 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.590
 definitely belongs to the something 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.920
 of course, we want more difficult now 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.700
 even our candidate jump here 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.920
 Let's see if that works 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:31.340
 every case very well even more important 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:36.270
 rubbery be okay as I have already seen 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:39.800
 that is also a bit exhausting 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.800
 I have to say quite honestly 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.709
 As I said , it looks silver now 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.239
 me not necessarily if you 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.400
 then you can go very close 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:55.250
 perhaps silver but recognize at 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:04:03.230
 normal range, so to speak eyes to 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:04.329
 hand that for me gray as I said 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.849
 a bit difficult 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:12.760
 but otherwise the intelligent knead the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:16.910
 we also know great here 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.910
 stretchable ok all clear clever partie of 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.300
 toba the new smart kneading machine 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.880
 in the canal 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.650
 what do you think of our shiny yes 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:35.870
 silver church for me rather gray play dough 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:39.169
 let me know this i here and 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.910
 Keep playing with the intelligent one 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.510
 kneel around see you next time 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.750
 times 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.750
 ciao
