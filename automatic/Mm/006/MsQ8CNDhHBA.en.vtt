don't<00:04:54.760> know<00:04:55.050> probably<00:04:56.050> not<00:04:56.380> so<00:04:56.800> much<00:04:56.860> my<00:04:57.220> kind

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
don't know probably not so much my kind

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.250 
don't know probably not so much my kind
of<00:04:57.610> music<00:04:57.729> on<00:04:58.150> there<00:04:58.419> but<00:04:58.630> we'll<00:04:58.810> see<00:04:58.990> what

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
of music on there but we'll see what

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.430 
of music on there but we'll see what
Bo's<00:04:59.590> likes<00:05:00.039> and<00:05:00.660> then<00:05:01.660> I<00:05:01.810> suppose<00:05:02.020> this<00:05:02.229> is

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
Bo's likes and then I suppose this is

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.379 
Bo's likes and then I suppose this is
the<00:05:02.560> accessory<00:05:02.919> packet<00:05:03.610> here<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:06.330> let's<00:05:07.330> go

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
the accessory packet here and let's go

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.610 
the accessory packet here and let's go
ahead<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.660> get<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:07.840> box<00:05:08.050> out<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.470> way

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
ahead and get that box out of the way

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.010 
ahead and get that box out of the way
there<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.150> then<00:05:10.150> they<00:05:10.240> talk<00:05:10.450> about<00:05:10.479> their

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
there and then they talk about their

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.100 
there and then they talk about their
commitment<00:05:11.680> to<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:12.510> and<00:05:13.510> I<00:05:13.780> suppose<00:05:13.990> this

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
commitment to you and I suppose this

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.320 
commitment to you and I suppose this
would<00:05:14.229> be<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.440> owner's<00:05:14.740> manual

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
would be the owner's manual

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.659 
would be the owner's manual
maybe<00:05:16.330> I'll<00:05:16.419> take<00:05:16.510> a<00:05:16.570> look<00:05:16.660> at<00:05:16.780> that<00:05:16.870> later

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
maybe I'll take a look at that later

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.620 
maybe I'll take a look at that later
usually<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:18.729> don't<00:05:18.820> spend<00:05:19.180> too<00:05:19.270> much<00:05:19.360> time<00:05:19.419> in

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
usually I don't spend too much time in

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.170 
usually I don't spend too much time in
the<00:05:19.780> owner's<00:05:19.990> manuals<00:05:20.700> this<00:05:21.700> would<00:05:21.880> be<00:05:22.000> the

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
the owner's manuals this would be the

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.440 
the owner's manuals this would be the
power<00:05:22.780> supply<00:05:24.120> um<00:05:26.729> you<00:05:27.729> know<00:05:27.849> we<00:05:27.940> open<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.300> up

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
power supply um you know we open that up

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:36.600 
power supply um you know we open that up
and<00:05:29.139> take<00:05:29.260> a<00:05:29.320> look<00:05:29.410> at<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.620> power<00:05:29.830> supply<00:05:30.310> here

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.060 

okay<00:05:37.870> that's<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:38.990> power<00:05:39.170> supply<00:05:39.620> not<00:05:39.860> real

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
okay that's the power supply not real

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.870 
okay that's the power supply not real
big<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.670> mean<00:05:40.940> you<00:05:41.090> know<00:05:41.770> no<00:05:42.770> not<00:05:43.070> huge<00:05:43.970> but

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
big I mean you know no not huge but

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.470 
big I mean you know no not huge but
anyway<00:05:48.130> one<00:05:49.130> thing<00:05:49.340> I<00:05:49.460> like<00:05:49.669> about<00:05:49.700> it<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:50.180> see

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
anyway one thing I like about it I see

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.200 
anyway one thing I like about it I see
is<00:05:50.660> that<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.960> power<00:05:51.139> supply<00:05:51.669> has<00:05:52.669> an<00:05:52.910> extra

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
is that the power supply has an extra

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.970 
is that the power supply has an extra
cord<00:05:53.570> on<00:05:53.810> it<00:05:53.990> so<00:05:54.139> you<00:05:54.230> don't<00:05:54.320> have<00:05:54.440> that<00:05:54.530> big

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
cord on it so you don't have that big

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.760 
cord on it so you don't have that big
old<00:05:55.240> power<00:05:56.240> supply<00:05:56.720> brick<00:05:57.110> taking<00:05:57.560> up<00:05:57.680> your

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
old power supply brick taking up your

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.360 
old power supply brick taking up your
power<00:05:58.010> strap<00:05:58.550> so<00:05:59.450> it<00:05:59.540> has<00:05:59.660> a<00:05:59.770> separate<00:06:00.770> cord<00:06:01.070> to

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
power strap so it has a separate cord to

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.270 
power strap so it has a separate cord to
it<00:06:01.490> which<00:06:01.730> is<00:06:01.880> kind<00:06:02.120> of<00:06:02.210> nice<00:06:02.980> well<00:06:03.980> thought

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
it which is kind of nice well thought

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.010 
it which is kind of nice well thought
out<00:06:04.690> engineering<00:06:08.050> this<00:06:09.050> is<00:06:09.110> the<00:06:10.000> wafer-thin

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
out engineering this is the wafer-thin

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.800 
out engineering this is the wafer-thin
remote<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:12.880> so<00:06:13.880> this<00:06:14.030> is<00:06:14.180> a<00:06:14.210> little<00:06:14.540> remote

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
remote and so this is a little remote

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.930 
remote and so this is a little remote
just<00:06:15.350> the<00:06:15.530> volume<00:06:15.950> and<00:06:16.160> the<00:06:16.220> power<00:06:18.730> and<00:06:19.730> then

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
just the volume and the power and then

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.020 
just the volume and the power and then
last<00:06:20.240> this<00:06:20.630> would<00:06:20.870> be<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.290> cable<00:06:21.680> to<00:06:22.610> hook<00:06:22.880> it

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
last this would be the cable to hook it

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.180 
last this would be the cable to hook it
up<00:06:23.150> to<00:06:23.300> the<00:06:23.390> computer<00:06:23.720> so<00:06:24.530> we<00:06:24.680> can<00:06:24.830> get<00:06:24.950> some

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
up to the computer so we can get some

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.290 
up to the computer so we can get some
sound<00:06:25.430> so<00:06:26.410> that<00:06:27.410> would<00:06:27.530> be<00:06:27.650> the<00:06:27.940> cable<00:06:28.940> that

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
sound so that would be the cable that

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.900 
sound so that would be the cable that
goes<00:06:29.330> from<00:06:29.540> the<00:06:29.720> computer<00:06:30.080> to<00:06:30.229> the<00:06:30.260> speaker<00:06:30.910> so

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
goes from the computer to the speaker so

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.020 
goes from the computer to the speaker so
anyway<00:06:32.440> these<00:06:33.440> are<00:06:33.530> the<00:06:33.710> bose<00:06:34.010> computer<00:06:34.639> music

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
anyway these are the bose computer music

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.540 
anyway these are the bose computer music
monitors<00:06:36.729> expensive<00:06:37.729> little<00:06:37.970> buggers<00:06:38.419> but

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
monitors expensive little buggers but

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.100 
monitors expensive little buggers but
bose<00:06:40.550> says<00:06:40.910> they<00:06:41.060> spent<00:06:41.180> five<00:06:41.540> years<00:06:41.600> on

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
bose says they spent five years on

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.290 
bose says they spent five years on
designing<00:06:42.620> them<00:06:42.800> they're<00:06:43.760> well<00:06:43.970> built

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
designing them they're well built

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.000 
designing them they're well built
they're<00:06:44.540> made<00:06:44.660> out<00:06:44.690> of<00:06:44.900> aluminum<00:06:45.440> they<00:06:45.950> are

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
they're made out of aluminum they are

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.680 
they're made out of aluminum they are
supposed<00:06:46.460> to<00:06:46.550> provide<00:06:46.610> very<00:06:47.210> good<00:06:47.270> base<00:06:47.660> for

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
supposed to provide very good base for

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.340 
supposed to provide very good base for
their<00:06:48.140> size<00:06:48.410> and<00:06:49.130> a<00:06:49.700> lot<00:06:49.850> of<00:06:49.940> clarity<00:06:50.150> so<00:06:50.750> we're

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
their size and a lot of clarity so we're

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.330 
their size and a lot of clarity so we're
going<00:06:51.440> to<00:06:51.500> go<00:06:51.620> ahead<00:06:51.710> I'm<00:06:51.890> going<00:06:52.039> to<00:06:52.100> go<00:06:52.220> ahead

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
going to go ahead I'm going to go ahead

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.620 
going to go ahead I'm going to go ahead
and<00:06:52.610> get<00:06:52.760> these<00:06:52.850> hooked<00:06:53.150> up<00:06:53.330> to<00:06:53.450> the<00:06:53.510> computer

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
and get these hooked up to the computer

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.130 
and get these hooked up to the computer
and<00:06:54.260> then<00:06:55.210> we'll<00:06:56.210> see<00:06:56.479> what<00:06:56.630> they<00:06:56.720> sound<00:06:56.990> like

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
and then we'll see what they sound like

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.980 
and then we'll see what they sound like
I'll<00:06:58.010> make<00:06:58.250> another<00:06:58.490> video<00:06:58.789> and<00:06:59.300> let<00:06:59.750> you<00:06:59.870> know

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
I'll make another video and let you know

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.270 
I'll make another video and let you know
what<00:07:00.140> I<00:07:00.169> think<00:07:00.550> thank<00:07:01.550> you<00:07:01.669> for<00:07:01.880> watching
