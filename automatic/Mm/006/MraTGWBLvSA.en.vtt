00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
so I put this clip up last week and a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.530 
so I put this clip up last week and a
few<00:00:13.500> people<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:13.950> Facebook<00:00:14.460> one<00:00:14.759> as<00:00:14.910> far<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.150> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
accuse me of using drum samples not so I

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.880 
accuse me of using drum samples not so I
say<00:00:19.500> me<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.400> samples<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.630> nuts<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
say me you samples we nuts that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.800 
say me you samples we nuts that
goes<00:00:23.220> against<00:00:23.699> everything<00:00:23.820> would<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.689> been

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
goes against everything would have been

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.080 
goes against everything would have been
ranting<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.560> raving<00:00:25.619> against<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.670> YouTube

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
ranting and raving against on YouTube

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.250 
ranting and raving against on YouTube
for<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> last<00:00:27.539> year

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
for the last year

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.980 
for the last year
the<00:00:28.830> truth<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.400> I'm<00:00:29.880> using<00:00:30.210> something<00:00:30.599> that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the truth is I'm using something that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590 
the truth is I'm using something that
just<00:00:31.439> made<00:00:31.830> drum<00:00:32.399> sample<00:00:32.910> replacement

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
just made drum sample replacement

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.880 
just made drum sample replacement
obsolete<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:35.420> 2015<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.469> time<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
obsolete it's 2015 and it's time to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.390 
obsolete it's 2015 and it's time to
bring<00:00:38.430> back<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.059> drummer

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.460 

so<00:00:47.400> what<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.880> it's<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.390> plug-in<00:00:48.900> from<00:00:49.140> sound

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
so what is it it's a plug-in from sound

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.460 
so what is it it's a plug-in from sound
radix<00:00:49.920> called<00:00:50.400> drum<00:00:51.090> leveler<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:52.230> does<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
radix called drum leveler what does it

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.610 
radix called drum leveler what does it
do<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:53.280> not<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> compressor<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.900> rather<00:00:55.290> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
do it's not a compressor but rather a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.890 
do it's not a compressor but rather a
program<00:00:56.310> that<00:00:56.640> detects<00:00:57.090> each<00:00:57.360> beat<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
program that detects each beat and

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.520 
program that detects each beat and
controls<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.040> dynamics<00:00:59.640> intelligently<00:01:00.530> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
controls the dynamics intelligently it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.290 
controls the dynamics intelligently it
looks<00:01:02.040> ahead<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> audio<00:01:02.730> stream<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
looks ahead in the audio stream and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.290 
looks ahead in the audio stream and
adjusts<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.290> volume<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> hit<00:01:05.430> based<00:01:06.060> on

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
adjusts the volume of the hit based on

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.810 
adjusts the volume of the hit based on
the<00:01:06.450> desired<00:01:06.930> output<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.800> has<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> percentage

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the desired output and has a percentage

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.540 
the desired output and has a percentage
control<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:10.050> how<00:01:10.380> tight<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:11.040> dynamics

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
control of just how tight the dynamics

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:48.330 
control of just how tight the dynamics
are<00:01:11.670> processed

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.430 

look<00:01:49.340> at<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:49.580> way<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.210> drum<00:01:50.990> sample

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
look at it this way and drum sample

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.890 
look at it this way and drum sample
replacement<00:01:52.160> especially<00:01:52.850> say<00:01:53.210> on<00:01:53.510> heavy

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
replacement especially say on heavy

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.560 
replacement especially say on heavy
metal<00:01:54.110> kicks<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.190> dynamics<00:01:55.790> are<00:01:56.000> usually

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
metal kicks the dynamics are usually

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.280 
metal kicks the dynamics are usually
tossed<00:01:56.900> out<00:01:57.310> almost<00:01:58.310> completely<00:01:59.200> having<00:02:00.200> a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
tossed out almost completely having a

tossed out almost completely having a
kick<00:02:00.590> jumping<00:02:01.190> up<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.460> down<00:02:01.580> in<00:02:02.060> volume<00:02:02.540> all

kick jumping up and down in volume all

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.170 
kick jumping up and down in volume all
over<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.080> mix<00:02:03.320> doesn't<00:02:03.800> sound<00:02:04.160> very<00:02:04.550> powerful

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
over a mix doesn't sound very powerful

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.109 
over a mix doesn't sound very powerful
believe<00:02:05.840> me<00:02:06.050> I<00:02:06.260> get<00:02:06.350> it

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
believe me I get it

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.300 
believe me I get it
well<00:02:08.119> now<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:08.840> can<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.380> same<00:02:09.590> thing<00:02:09.920> with

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
well now you can do the same thing with

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.940 
well now you can do the same thing with
a<00:02:10.550> real<00:02:10.970> drum<00:02:11.540> performance<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.500> difference

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
a real drum performance the difference

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.760 
a real drum performance the difference
being<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:13.580> still<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.690> sound<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
being it's still the sound of the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.340 
being it's still the sound of the
drummer<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.220> was<00:02:16.520> recorded<00:02:17.270> instead<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.170> him

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
drummer that was recorded instead of him

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.470 
drummer that was recorded instead of him
being<00:02:18.380> replaced<00:02:18.980> with<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.400> sound<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.210> drum

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
being replaced with the sound of a drum

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:32.820 
being replaced with the sound of a drum
being<00:02:21.080> played<00:02:21.200> by<00:02:21.860> someone<00:02:22.130> else

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.650 

visually<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:34.130> pretty<00:02:34.460> simple<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.120> orange

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
visually it's pretty simple the orange

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.390 
visually it's pretty simple the orange
hits<00:02:35.900> are<00:02:36.080> being<00:02:36.320> turned<00:02:36.530> up<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.950> blue<00:02:37.160> ones

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
hits are being turned up the blue ones

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.170 
hits are being turned up the blue ones
are<00:02:37.580> turned<00:02:37.850> down<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.890> thing<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.400> great

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
are turned down and this thing is great

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.130 
are turned down and this thing is great
for<00:02:41.450> blastbeats

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
for blastbeats

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.530 
for blastbeats
as<00:02:42.200> well<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.830> can<00:02:43.070> completely<00:02:43.580> control<00:02:44.300> the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
as well you can completely control the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.260 
as well you can completely control the
volume<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.410> those<00:02:45.770> weak<00:02:46.070> hits<00:02:46.430> something

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
volume of those weak hits something

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.170 
volume of those weak hits something
that's<00:02:47.750> driven<00:02:48.170> me<00:02:48.440> completely<00:02:49.310> up<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.700> LA<00:02:49.880> for

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that's driven me completely up to LA for

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:03.119 
that's driven me completely up to LA for
the<00:02:50.239> last<00:02:50.510> few<00:02:50.780> years

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.430 

and<00:03:04.129> the<00:03:04.790> great<00:03:05.000> thing<00:03:05.030> is<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:05.690> transparent

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
and the great thing is it's transparent

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.710 
and the great thing is it's transparent
it<00:03:06.800> doesn't<00:03:07.280> change<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.849> sound<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.480> drum

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
it doesn't change the sound of the drum

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.040 
it doesn't change the sound of the drum
it<00:03:08.900> just<00:03:09.290> turns<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:10.010> up<00:03:10.129> and<00:03:10.310> down<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:11.050> when

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
it just turns it up and down and when

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.530 
it just turns it up and down and when
you<00:03:12.260> turn<00:03:12.680> drum<00:03:13.069> leveler<00:03:13.489> into<00:03:13.849> an<00:03:13.940> expander

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
you turn drum leveler into an expander

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.750 
you turn drum leveler into an expander
something<00:03:15.230> extremely<00:03:15.799> cool<00:03:16.069> happens<00:03:16.580> when

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
something extremely cool happens when

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:43.320 
something extremely cool happens when
you<00:03:16.879> place<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.209> on<00:03:17.510> your<00:03:17.840> drum<00:03:18.200> bus

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.830 

and<00:03:43.710> it<00:03:44.710> also<00:03:44.980> includes<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.670> gate<00:03:45.940> for<00:03:46.210> clamping

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
and it also includes a gate for clamping
