00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
controller before so I wasn't quite sure

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.890 
controller before so I wasn't quite sure
how<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:21.750> about<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:23.030> mean<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.659> look

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
there's like hair sticking to the analog

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.630 
there's like hair sticking to the analog
and<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.540> there<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.740> kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.219> twist

position

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
position

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.710 
position
and<00:02:07.819> it<00:02:08.819> doesn't<00:02:09.090> want<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.240> go<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.600> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
and it doesn't want to go back to the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.860 
and it doesn't want to go back to the
middle<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.740> I'm<00:02:11.730> gonna<00:02:11.880> be<00:02:12.030> taking<00:02:12.240> apart

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
middle so I'm gonna be taking apart

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.980 
middle so I'm gonna be taking apart
taking<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.440> apart<00:02:13.680> next<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.819> for<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> time

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
taking this apart next but for the time

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.100 
taking this apart next but for the time
being<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.530> seemed<00:02:16.740> like<00:02:17.060> yeah<00:02:18.060> they're<00:02:19.020> just

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
being it seemed like yeah they're just

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.980 
being it seemed like yeah they're just
like<00:02:19.350> all<00:02:19.590> kinds<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.510> what<00:02:21.510> appeared<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.900> be

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
like all kinds of what appeared to be

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.350 
like all kinds of what appeared to be
water<00:02:22.290> stains<00:02:23.540> signs<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.690> moisture<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:26.360> what

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
water stains signs of moisture so what

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.309 
water stains signs of moisture so what
that<00:02:27.480> moisture<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.680> only<00:02:28.739> imagine<00:02:28.980> but

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
that moisture is I can only imagine but

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.020 
that moisture is I can only imagine but
yeah<00:02:32.420> looking<00:02:33.420> at<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.750> ooh<00:02:34.790> pieces<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
yeah looking at the ooh pieces of the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.949 
yeah looking at the ooh pieces of the
places<00:02:36.989> do<00:02:37.260> control<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.800> don't<00:02:38.690> know<00:02:39.690> what<00:02:39.840> this

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
places do control I don't know what this

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.650 
places do control I don't know what this
is<00:02:40.400> it's<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.550> kind<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.880> fell<00:02:42.030> out<00:02:42.150> somewhere

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
is it's a kind of fell out somewhere

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.490 
is it's a kind of fell out somewhere
I'm<00:02:42.989> guessing<00:02:43.380> bills<00:02:43.590> under<00:02:44.030> underneath<00:02:45.030> this

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
I'm guessing bills under underneath this

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.900 
I'm guessing bills under underneath this
or<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:48.030> buttons<00:02:48.300> over<00:02:48.420> here<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:50.310> have<00:02:50.820> to

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
or the buttons over here but I have to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.720 
or the buttons over here but I have to
figure<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.120> up<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:52.550> even<00:02:53.550> looking<00:02:53.730> over<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
figure that up but even looking over the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.979 
figure that up but even looking over the
AV<00:02:56.730> cables<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:58.519> came<00:02:59.519> with<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> system<00:03:00.209> which<00:03:00.810> I

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
AV cables I came with a system which I

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.500 
AV cables I came with a system which I
just<00:03:01.170> grabbed<00:03:01.739> over<00:03:02.010> here<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.930> see<00:03:05.510> there

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
just grabbed over here you can see there

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.259 
just grabbed over here you can see there
is<00:03:06.780> some<00:03:07.170> kind<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.530> residue<00:03:08.130> all<00:03:08.790> over<00:03:08.819> this

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
is some kind of residue all over this

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.120 
is some kind of residue all over this
and<00:03:10.760> like<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.269> part<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.600> loose<00:03:13.130> which

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
and like this this part is loose which

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.319 
and like this this part is loose which
usually<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:14.910> doesn't<00:03:15.269> move<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:17.180> that'll<00:03:18.180> be

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
usually it doesn't move so that'll be

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.360 
usually it doesn't move so that'll be
quite<00:03:19.079> an<00:03:19.170> adventure<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.530> might<00:03:19.769> just<00:03:20.070> throw

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
quite an adventure I might just throw

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.479 
quite an adventure I might just throw
this<00:03:20.489> out<00:03:20.700> it's<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.209> maybe<00:03:21.390> came<00:03:22.280> see<00:03:23.280> like

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
this out it's just maybe came see like

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.180 
this out it's just maybe came see like
all<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.540> gunk<00:03:24.780> kind<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.350> in<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> grooves<00:03:25.890> of

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
all the gunk kind of in the grooves of

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.860 
all the gunk kind of in the grooves of
the<00:03:26.250> cord<00:03:26.519> itself<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:31.940> girls<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.600> my<00:03:33.720> fingers

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the cord itself you girls so my fingers

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:42.020 
the cord itself you girls so my fingers
are<00:03:34.079> all<00:03:34.170> sticky<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:37.799> yeah<00:03:40.400> I'd<00:03:41.400> seen<00:03:41.730> some

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
are all sticky so yeah I'd seen some

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.330 
are all sticky so yeah I'd seen some
other<00:03:42.180> people<00:03:42.600> take<00:03:42.930> apart<00:03:43.290> these<00:03:43.470> ps2

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
other people take apart these ps2

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.710 
other people take apart these ps2
controllers<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.180> guess<00:03:45.359> there<00:03:45.570> are

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
controllers and I guess there are

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.770 
controllers and I guess there are
different<00:03:46.140> different<00:03:46.980> models<00:03:47.660> like<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
different different models like the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.150 
different different models like the
innards<00:03:49.049> look<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.380> little<00:03:49.530> bit<00:03:49.739> different<00:03:50.040> from

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
innards look a little bit different from

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.819 
innards look a little bit different from
some<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.579> other<00:03:50.790> videos<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.120> I've<00:03:51.329> seen

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
some of the other videos that I've seen

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.860 
some of the other videos that I've seen
like<00:03:53.180> sometimes<00:03:54.180> there's<00:03:54.359> like<00:03:54.540> an<00:03:54.660> extra

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
like sometimes there's like an extra

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.400 
like sometimes there's like an extra
plastic<00:03:55.470> piece<00:03:55.890> over<00:03:56.190> here<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.640> holds<00:03:57.060> these

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
plastic piece over here that holds these

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.940 
plastic piece over here that holds these
I<00:03:58.410> guess<00:03:59.370> these<00:03:59.549> are<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.820> DualShock<00:04:00.329> motors

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
I guess these are the DualShock motors

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.440 
I guess these are the DualShock motors
and<00:04:03.350> even<00:04:04.350> on<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:05.519> controller<00:04:05.940> compared<00:04:06.359> to

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
and even on this controller compared to

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.810 
and even on this controller compared to
this<00:04:06.540> controller

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.020 

the<00:04:11.240> thing<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.480> note<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:12.050> that<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:13.280> has<00:04:13.610> one

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
the thing to note is that this has one

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.580 
the thing to note is that this has one
two<00:04:14.780> three<00:04:15.320> four<00:04:16.220> five<00:04:17.060> six<00:04:17.300> seven<00:04:17.810> screws<00:04:18.260> and

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
two three four five six seven screws and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.220 
two three four five six seven screws and
then<00:04:19.550> there's<00:04:19.850> one<00:04:20.060> screw<00:04:20.270> inside<00:04:20.480> which<00:04:21.080> is

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
then there's one screw inside which is

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.650 
then there's one screw inside which is
holding<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.590> board<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.090> one<00:04:23.270> has<00:04:23.450> one

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
holding the board and this one has one

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.720 
holding the board and this one has one
two<00:04:23.930> three<00:04:24.130> four<00:04:25.600> five<00:04:26.600> screws<00:04:27.610> oops

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
two three four five screws oops

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.920 
two three four five screws oops
oh<00:04:28.880> six<00:04:29.540> this<00:04:29.810> one<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.170> middle<00:04:30.410> so<00:04:31.930> yeah

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
oh six this one in the middle so yeah

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.870 
oh six this one in the middle so yeah
they<00:04:33.890> all<00:04:34.010> look<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.640> same

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
they all look the same

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.130 
they all look the same
but<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.300> guess<00:04:35.420> these<00:04:35.600> are<00:04:35.660> different

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
but I guess these are different

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.970 
but I guess these are different
partitions<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:37.370> didn't<00:04:37.760> really<00:04:37.970> read<00:04:38.150> the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
partitions I didn't really read the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.620 
partitions I didn't really read the
model<00:04:39.980> numbers<00:04:40.250> are<00:04:40.370> Nikki<00:04:40.550> down<00:04:40.730> there<00:04:40.910> but

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
model numbers are Nikki down there but

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.630 
model numbers are Nikki down there but
yeah<00:04:43.510> but<00:04:44.510> uh<00:04:44.570> I<00:04:45.070> clean<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.190> controller<00:04:46.520> is

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
yeah but uh I clean the controller is

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.190 
yeah but uh I clean the controller is
easy<00:04:46.790> enough<00:04:46.910> for<00:04:47.180> like<00:04:47.330> just<00:04:47.570> get<00:04:47.780> any<00:04:48.050> ones

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
easy enough for like just get any ones

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.700 
easy enough for like just get any ones
but<00:04:48.440> kind<00:04:49.280> of<00:04:49.370> bummed<00:04:49.550> out<00:04:49.730> that<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:51.110> CD<00:04:51.440> trade

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
but kind of bummed out that the CD trade

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.280 
but kind of bummed out that the CD trade
does<00:04:51.890> not<00:04:52.100> open<00:04:52.460> on<00:04:52.580> this<00:04:53.350> yet<00:04:54.490> I'm<00:04:55.490> gonna

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
does not open on this yet I'm gonna

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.690 
does not open on this yet I'm gonna
clean<00:04:57.290> this<00:04:57.410> up<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.800> see<00:04:57.980> what<00:04:58.070> happens<00:04:58.400> this

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
clean this up and see what happens this

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.220 
clean this up and see what happens this
is<00:04:58.820> how<00:05:00.790> yeah<00:05:01.790> hopefully<00:05:02.600> I'll<00:05:02.900> be<00:05:02.960> posting

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230
