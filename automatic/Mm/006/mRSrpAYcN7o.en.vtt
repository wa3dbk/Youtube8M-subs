okay now the wider and the more that our
body<00:01:16.080> sways<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.830> deceptive<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.330> V

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
body sways the more deceptive the V

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.280 
body sways the more deceptive the V
becomes<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.740> higher<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.159> take<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> here

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
becomes and the higher we take it here

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.310 
becomes and the higher we take it here
see<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.610> deceptive<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.210> becomes<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
see the more deceptive it becomes so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.130 
see the more deceptive it becomes so
let's<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.920> five<00:01:26.490> times<00:01:26.720> one<00:01:27.799> two<00:01:29.000> three

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
let's do this five times one two three

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.600 
let's do this five times one two three
four<00:01:31.340> five<00:01:32.479> very<00:01:33.479> good

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
four five very good

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.190 
four five very good
now<00:01:35.150> go<00:01:36.050> even<00:01:36.410> lower<00:01:37.540> yang<00:01:38.540> keep<00:01:38.750> close<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
now go even lower yang keep close to the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.920 
now go even lower yang keep close to the
feet<00:01:40.030> I'll<00:01:41.030> do<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:41.270> five<00:01:41.510> times<00:01:41.750> no<00:01:41.990> patch<00:01:46.930> is

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
feet I'll do this five times no patch is

00:01:47.930 --> 00:02:04.950 
feet I'll do this five times no patch is
it<00:01:48.080> more<00:01:48.260> than<00:01:48.320> five<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:49.150> like<00:01:50.150> doing<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.420> veto

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.300 

the<00:02:05.960> next<00:02:06.200> we're<00:02:06.410> going<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.590> do<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:06.920> one

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
the next we're going to do is one

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.460 
the next we're going to do is one
dribble<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.790> then<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:07.970> V<00:02:08.260> continuously<00:02:09.260> with

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
each hand we're going to start with our

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.510 
each hand we're going to start with our
right<00:02:11.660> hand<00:02:11.810> right<00:02:12.320> foot<00:02:12.350> as<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.770> pivot<00:02:13.190> with

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
our right hands the first step that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.350 
our right hands the first step that
comes<00:02:15.709> forward<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.160> left<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:16.910> tubule

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
comes forward is the left but the tubule

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750 
comes forward is the left but the tubule
must<00:02:17.510> comes<00:02:17.720> before<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.260> step<00:02:18.560> okay<00:02:19.100> one

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
must comes before the step okay one

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.930 
must comes before the step okay one
dribble<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:21.320> right<00:02:21.530> foot<00:02:21.770> comes<00:02:21.950> forward<00:02:22.040> and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
dribble the right foot comes forward and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.930 
dribble the right foot comes forward and
then<00:02:23.270> we're<00:02:23.360> going<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.540> be<00:02:24.400> then<00:02:25.400> switch<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.790> to

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
then we're going to be then switch it to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.650 
then we're going to be then switch it to
the<00:02:26.090> left

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the left
