00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.774
[Dramatic Background Music Starts Playing]

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:06.710
Not everyone is afraid of civilization being
wiped back to the stone age but perhaps this

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.959
list will change their mind. From Solar Flares
to super volcanoes we countdown 10 ways the

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.480
world could end.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.590
#10 Gamma Ray Bursts - Appearing when two
collapsed stars merge these are the strongest

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.809
kind of explosions in the universe and are
completely unpredictable. To put this in perspective,

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:24.320
about 10 seconds of gamma ray bursts will
release more energy than the sun ever will

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.750
in its entire lifetime. If we get hit by a
gamma ray burst even once, our ozone layer

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.610
will be devastated, leaving us without any
protection from UV rays.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.750
#9 Asteroids - Every few million years, an
asteroid big enough to end all life appears.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.640
The good news is, asteroids are a lot more
predictable than gamma rays. The bad news

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.970
is, if an asteroid large enough to destroy
humanity flies in our direction, we have a

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.250
very low chance of stopping it.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.989
#8
Black Holes - There are roughly 10 million

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.829
black holes in the entire universe, and it’s
game over if just ones manages to get close

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.530
enough. Even though the chances of a black
hole entering our solar system are extremely

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.280
low, the experience is something you’d never
want to go through. If a small black hole

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.850
entered the solar system, the tidal forces
caused by the steep intensification of gravity

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.899
would tear you apart. In fact, the tidal force
between your head and feet would be around

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.880
1 million g’s - to put that into perspective
the g force a typical person could handle

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.729
is about 5.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.079
#7 Solar Flares -Sometimes the sun will have
a sudden flash of brightness, which is interpreted

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.950
as a large energy release and called a solar
flare. Solar flares can bring the beautiful

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.159
northern lights, and other times they can
cause a solar storm that’s strong enough

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.709
to shut down all our electronics and cause
a catastrophic amount of damage. It has already

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:37.289
happened before during the Carrington Event
in 1859. Another solar storm almost hit us

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.240
a few years back in 2012, but luckily, it
passed us by without incident.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.679
#6 Expanding Sun Of all of the things on this
list that could end all life, this one is

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.200
the only one that’s guaranteed to do it,
eventually. The sun is expanding, every day,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.880
up until the point that it becomes a gigantic
red star that is large enough to swallow our

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.810
planet whole. It will take 5 billion years
before that’s possible, but the sun could

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.929
be our demise long before that thanks to its
sheer heat.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.249
#5 Overpopulation Our population is increasing
at an alarming rate, and unless we do something

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.950
about it we will be fighting over the world’s
last resources. There’s already cases of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.400
mass famine and resource shortages in some
parts of the world, and with an ever growing

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.450
population it will just add to an already
existing problem

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.980
#4 Robot Domination - With the speed at which
science is progressing, the sound of robots

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.379
becoming sentient and revolting sounds less
and less ridiculous. Experts say that computers

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.939
with artificial intelligence will most likely
be smarter than us in about 40 years. What

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.250
they can do once they reach that point is
scary. Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and SpaceX,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.650
has even donated 10 million dollars to prevent
this situation from happening.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.849
#3 Nuclear war Currently, there are 8 countries
that are armed with nuclear bombs, Possibly

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.659
9. 5 of these countries have a Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty. This means that there are three to

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.920
four countries that could launch a nuke whenever
they feel like it. Just 100 nuclear bombs

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.969
would be enough to cause a nuclear winter
that would absolutely ruin the state of the

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:03.109
world. A report that came out in 2014 revealed
that we have more than 15,000 nuclear weapons

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.239
in the world.

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.129
#2 Ecosystem Collapse - 30,000 Species go
extinct on a yearly basis because of human

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.760
activity. Mass extinction isn’t an unlikely
scenario if the situation won’t improve.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.400
The things one species needs to survive will
be lost, which then causes that species to

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.659
go extinct as well, and the pattern will continue
until nothing is left.

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.420
#1 Super Volcano - The Yellowstone caldera
located right under Yellowstone National Park

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.689
is supposed to erupt around every 600,000
years. The thing that’s worrisome is that

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.939
it’s been 640,000 years since it last erupted.
It could happen at any time, and when it does,

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.969
it’s estimated that two thirds of America
will be screwed. Not to mention the volcanic

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.499
ash will launch high into the stratosphere,
mix with earth's water vapor and throw the

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:46.709
globe into a volcanic winter.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.299
