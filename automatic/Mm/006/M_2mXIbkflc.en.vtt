00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.250 
all of those live records and the way
computers<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.150> technology<00:04:21.690> has<00:04:21.870> made<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.109> so

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
computers and technology has made it so

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.320 
computers and technology has made it so
everybody<00:04:22.590> can<00:04:22.680> beat<00:04:22.860> match<00:04:23.070> like<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.340> well

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
everybody can beat match like that well

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.189 
everybody can beat match like that well
I<00:04:25.070> for<00:04:26.070> me<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:27.680> shock<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.979> got<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.930> was

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
I for me that the shock I got it was

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.050 
I for me that the shock I got it was
when<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.370> start<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:33.000> work<00:04:33.690> on<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.590> real<00:04:34.770> flap

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
when I start to work on the real flap

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.400 
when I start to work on the real flap
which<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.300> like<00:04:36.510> two<00:04:36.840> years<00:04:36.990> or<00:04:37.229> three<00:04:37.260> years

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
which is like two years or three years

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.180 
which is like two years or three years
later<00:04:37.770> no<00:04:38.840> because<00:04:39.840> on<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.289> club's<00:04:40.530> they<00:04:41.010> have

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
later no because on the club's they have

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.820 
later no because on the club's they have
the<00:04:41.370> turntables<00:04:42.090> with<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.330> pitch<00:04:42.800> like<00:04:43.800> that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
the turntables with the pitch like that

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.550 
the turntables with the pitch like that
the<00:04:44.130> first<00:04:44.370> techniques<00:04:45.060> with<00:04:45.750> lights<00:04:46.080> with

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
the first techniques with lights with

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.980 
the first techniques with lights with
the<00:04:46.680> beach<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:47.190> yeah<00:04:47.460> when<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.120> get<00:04:48.539> in<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.780> club

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
you know to do a test if you you know

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.960 
you know to do a test if you you know
checking<00:04:52.260> if<00:04:52.500> I'm<00:04:52.650> okay<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.160> work<00:04:53.610> there<00:04:53.940> or

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
checking if I'm okay to work there or

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.680 
checking if I'm okay to work there or
not<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.510> did<00:04:55.139> a<00:04:55.169> test<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:55.970> for<00:04:56.970> me<00:04:57.090> was<00:04:57.300> easy<00:04:57.539> you

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
not I did a test so for me was easy you

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.200 
not I did a test so for me was easy you
know<00:04:57.990> half<00:04:58.229> this<00:04:58.740> bottom<00:04:59.220> fishing<00:04:59.490> of<00:04:59.880> the

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
know half this bottom fishing of the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.740 
know half this bottom fishing of the
tempo<00:05:00.780> up<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.229> down<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.650> was<00:05:01.770> like<00:05:02.160> is

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
tempo up and down it was like is

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.260 
tempo up and down it was like is
completely<00:05:03.750> easy<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.740> did<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.789> whole<00:05:06.000> night

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
completely easy so I did a whole night

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.040 
completely easy so I did a whole night
and<00:05:06.570> for<00:05:07.020> me<00:05:07.139> it<00:05:07.410> was<00:05:07.560> like<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.919> most<00:05:08.660> as<00:05:09.660> I

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
and for me it was like the most as I

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.170 
and for me it was like the most as I
said<00:05:10.200> before<00:05:10.260> shock<00:05:11.450> with<00:05:12.450> with<00:05:13.139> with<00:05:13.440> a

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
said before shock with with with a

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.969 
said before shock with with with a
impossible<00:05:15.180> way<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.840> mixing<00:05:16.349> to<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.770> most

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
impossible way to mixing to the most

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.020 
impossible way to mixing to the most
easy<00:05:17.250> way<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:17.820> mixing<00:05:18.300> with<00:05:18.479> that

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
easy way to mixing with that

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.860 
easy way to mixing with that
so<00:05:19.750> took<00:05:20.230> on<00:05:20.380> these<00:05:20.560> days<00:05:21.750> with<00:05:22.750> this

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
so took on these days with this

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.370 
so took on these days with this
technology<00:05:23.260> you<00:05:24.010> know<00:05:24.190> I<00:05:24.670> find<00:05:25.390> is<00:05:25.660> a<00:05:25.990> change

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
technology you know I find is a change

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.460 
technology you know I find is a change
of<00:05:26.560> which<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.070> Challenger<00:05:28.030> for<00:05:28.780> me<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.230> play

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
of which the Challenger for me to play

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.260 
of which the Challenger for me to play
because<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:30.010> I<00:05:30.610> try<00:05:30.910> to<00:05:31.950> push<00:05:32.950> more<00:05:33.340> from<00:05:33.940> from

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
because I I try to push more from from

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.330 
because I I try to push more from from
the<00:05:34.420> from<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.870> records<00:05:35.620> you<00:05:35.680> know<00:05:35.740> created

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
the from the records you know created

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.930 
the from the records you know created
more<00:05:36.550> life<00:05:37.560> because<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.590> those<00:05:39.220> days<00:05:39.460> you<00:05:39.490> was

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
more life because of those days you was

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.570 
more life because of those days you was
impossible<00:05:40.780> to<00:05:40.810> do<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:41.050> so<00:05:41.410> that's<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.430> way<00:05:42.550> I

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
impossible to do it so that's the way I

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:55.920 
impossible to do it so that's the way I
see<00:05:42.850> today<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.620> technology<00:05:44.620> for<00:05:44.980> the<00:05:45.310> DJ

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.990
