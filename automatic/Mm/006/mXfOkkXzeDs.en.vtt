00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 but with modern means a 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.010
 helicopter assault rifles that's the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.290
 latest fashion hunt in texas 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.450

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.969
 which tourist who wants to register as 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.450
 billy hunter today the pilot will be 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.980
 their guide 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.630
 together they will go through this 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 campaign to a hundred kilometers to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.980
 the west of dallas the land is huge 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.750
 as for a traditional hunt 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.250
 start by not identifying one or two 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.760
 isolated beasts but a horde of 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.920
 boars 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.810
 recently texas has to deal with 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.000
 a proliferation of these animals with 3 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 millions of animals so here we do not get 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.750
 not hide it's clearly displayed 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.750
 intention to eliminate as much as possible 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.740
 the pilots are positioned at very low 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.100
 altitude no more than eight meters from the 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.750
 target 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.700
 the hunting party lasts two hours 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 for thirty animals killed 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.199
 boar they're so late 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.039
 are able to ravage the land of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.199
 do big damage 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.570
 they eat anything from the roots 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.649
 green it devastates tower and they can 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.450
 do it in one night damage 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.250
 that texas and goes himself to 50 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.840
 millions of euros a year on his fields 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.520
 we see black streaks of marks 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.110
 which correspond to the passage of 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.430
 boars 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.899
 for the farmers 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.670
 owners of cotton fields like 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.860
 here it was essential to do something 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.229
 thing they are federated and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.690
 who asked the state of texas a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.280
 amendment of the legislation because these 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.170
 animals havoc any field 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.970
 without making any difference between wheat the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.069
 cotton or the fruits they eat at 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.569
 trampling anything in the absence 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.250
 of natural predators today 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.619
 six million wild boar in the united states 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.869
 half in this region when jean 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.229
 and his son conceals have settled here 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.590
 in 72 this kind of trap was enough 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590
 Bygone era 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.220
 when we catch one with that in a helicopter 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.270
 time you say it's much more effective 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.379
 quick 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.660
 it's clear and clear of the animals that weigh 

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:58.890
 up to 100 kg most often these 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.739
 hunters leave them on the spot 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.119
 the coyotes will sometimes take care of it 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.769
 he gets the best pieces 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.239
 for their personal consumption 

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:07.769
 but when they are too big 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.599
 number these mammals become 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:12.900
 dangerous for the man especially as 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.160
 their reproduction and fast these two 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.720
 females in the course of their lives 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.459
 can easily give birth to 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.810
 120 boars until 2011 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.310
 farmers pay hunters for 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.470
 a few outings a month 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.680
 now tourists have taken the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.680
 relay 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.540
 and jostling an activity that can 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.130
 to be shocking but now 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.580
 considered recreational in texas this 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.580
 testimony
