adults<00:00:19.740> Raptors<00:00:20.070> back<00:00:20.220> from<00:00:20.369> suspension<00:00:20.520> but

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
adults Raptors back from suspension but

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.639 
adults Raptors back from suspension but
I<00:00:21.029> think<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.270> prefer<00:00:21.509> to<00:00:21.660> play<00:00:21.779> Jarvis<00:00:22.529> because

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:22.649 
I think I prefer to play Jarvis because

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.109 
I think I prefer to play Jarvis because
he<00:00:22.890> had<00:00:23.009> a<00:00:23.040> really<00:00:23.250> good<00:00:23.430> game<00:00:23.550> last<00:00:23.759> time<00:00:23.880> out

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
he had a really good game last time out

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.790 
he had a really good game last time out
so<00:00:24.210> I'm<00:00:24.270> gonna<00:00:24.360> keep<00:00:24.599> him<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.079> side<00:00:25.259> just

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
so I'm gonna keep him in the side just

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.139 
so I'm gonna keep him in the side just
because<00:00:26.009> of<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.160> performance<00:00:26.610> that<00:00:26.790> I<00:00:27.060> have

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.149 
because of that performance that I have

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.280 
because of that performance that I have
played<00:00:27.300> really<00:00:27.450> well<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:27.989> wing<00:00:28.140> so

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
played really well on the right wing so

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.870
