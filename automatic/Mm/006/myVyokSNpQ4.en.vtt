hello<00:00:02.580> right<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.629> just<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.870> quick<00:00:04.110> video

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
hello right this is just a quick video

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.410 
hello right this is just a quick video
to<00:00:04.920> show<00:00:04.950> Alice<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.819> quick<00:00:06.060> video<00:00:06.299> it's

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
to show Alice a quick video it's

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.150 
to show Alice a quick video it's
probably<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.690> little<00:00:06.839> bit<00:00:06.990> long<00:00:07.230> but<00:00:07.440> here<00:00:07.710> goes

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
probably a little bit long but here goes

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.259 
probably a little bit long but here goes
now<00:00:08.900> what<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.080> basic<00:00:10.920> set<00:00:11.130> up<00:00:11.340> your<00:00:12.210> a

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
now what this is basic set up your a

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.810 
now what this is basic set up your a
file<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.719> core<00:00:12.990> point<00:00:13.230> here<00:00:13.469> for<00:00:13.820> alarm

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
file on core point here for alarm

sounder called a roshni a 12 volt
battery<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.539> are<00:00:19.260> really<00:00:19.529> now<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.210> idea<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
battery and are really now the idea of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.269 
battery and are really now the idea of
this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.970> a<00:00:23.970> kind<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.980> circuit<00:00:25.980> which

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this is to have a kind of circuit which

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.810 
this is to have a kind of circuit which
will<00:00:26.599> sound<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> alarm<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.830> then<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.640> would

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
will sound the alarm but then it would

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.030 
will sound the alarm but then it would
need<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> need<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> separate

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
need to have a need to have a separate

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.370 
need to have a need to have a separate
reset<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> because<00:00:33.570> there's<00:00:33.719> relay<00:00:34.020> itself

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
reset and because there's relay itself

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.370 
reset and because there's relay itself
is<00:00:34.500> wired<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.980> latch<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.239> I'll<00:00:36.899> explain

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
is wired to latch so I'll explain

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.080 
is wired to latch so I'll explain
exactly<00:00:39.079> what<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.290> need<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.710> after<00:00:41.309> I've

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
exactly what you need to do after I've

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.360 
exactly what you need to do after I've
given<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.600> quick<00:00:42.750> demonstration<00:00:43.219> which<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
given a quick demonstration which of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
given a quick demonstration which of
course<00:00:44.399> would<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.030> necessary<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.710> we're

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
course would be necessary so all we're

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.010 
course would be necessary so all we're
going<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> simulate

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
going to do we're going to simulate

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.680 
going to do we're going to simulate
breaking<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> core<00:00:49.320> point<00:00:50.270> by<00:00:51.270> using<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
breaking the core point by using the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.380 
breaking the core point by using the
test<00:00:51.989> key<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> test<00:00:53.460> key<00:00:53.610> itself<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.120> going

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
test key so the test key itself is going

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.350 
test key so the test key itself is going
to<00:00:55.010> activate<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.219> core<00:00:56.340> point<00:00:56.579> which<00:00:57.180> will

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to activate the core point which will

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.660 
to activate the core point which will
then<00:00:57.510> activate<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> relay<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> will

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
then activate the relay and then I will

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.479 
then activate the relay and then I will
show<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.090> happens<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.350> reset<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
show you what happens when we reset the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.660 
show you what happens when we reset the
core<00:01:02.670> point<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.960> first<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.799> we'll<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
core point so first of all we'll put the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
core point so first of all we'll put the
test<00:01:06.150> key<00:01:07.820> try<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.119> put<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.570> test<00:01:09.840> key<00:01:12.560> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
test key try to put the can test key the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.690 
test key try to put the can test key the
core<00:01:13.740> point<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.720> we're<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> activate<00:01:16.700> P

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
core point so we're going to activate P

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.190 
core point so we're going to activate P
system<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.720> such

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
system as such

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
system as such
so<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.860> goes<00:01:22.490> glasses<00:01:23.490> loose<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> core

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so here goes glasses loose on the core

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.710 
so here goes glasses loose on the core
point<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.259> Russian<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> activated<00:01:26.250> ok<00:01:27.030> now

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
point the Russian is activated ok now

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
point the Russian is activated ok now
what<00:01:28.110> happens<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.560> reset<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.759> was

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
what happens when you reset it if it was

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.270 
what happens when you reset it if it was
just<00:01:29.880> used<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.420> switch<00:01:30.720> without<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.170> relay<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
just used as a switch without a relay it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.300 
just used as a switch without a relay it
would<00:01:32.520> stop<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.850> sound<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.360> sound<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:35.100> now

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
would stop the sound from sound but now

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.840 
would stop the sound from sound but now
we<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> key<00:01:36.060> L<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.979> relay<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.579> still

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
we go to key L and the relay is still

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.870 
we go to key L and the relay is still
active<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> sound<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.250> still<00:01:41.400> sounding

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
active and the sound is still sounding

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.870 
active and the sound is still sounding
so<00:01:42.689> only<00:01:43.350> way<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> reset<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so only way to reset this now is the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.350 
so only way to reset this now is the
disconnect<00:01:45.360> power<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> bathroom<00:01:46.530> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.600 

you<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.660> disconnect<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.560> battery<00:01:53.070> it's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
you know disconnect the battery it's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.760 
you know disconnect the battery it's
reset<00:01:54.120> so<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.930> could<00:01:55.260> incorporate<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:58.500> could

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
reset so you could incorporate you could

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
reset so you could incorporate you could
incorporate<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.970> reset<00:02:00.540> button<00:02:00.570> that

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
incorporate like a a reset button that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.690 
incorporate like a a reset button that
momentarily<00:02:02.870> cuts<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:04.020> power<00:02:04.230> -<00:02:04.650> really<00:02:05.010> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
momentarily cuts the power - really so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.950 
momentarily cuts the power - really so
let's<00:02:05.850> see<00:02:05.970> how<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.150> works<00:02:08.660> now<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.929> a

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
let's see how this works now this is a

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.810 
let's see how this works now this is a
very<00:02:10.080> messy<00:02:10.649> job<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.370> don't<00:02:11.520> need<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.760> have

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
very messy job you don't need to have

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.580 
very messy job you don't need to have
all<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.060> wires<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.690> each<00:02:12.900> device<00:02:13.260> like

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
all the wires going to each device like

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.090 
all the wires going to each device like
this<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.270> all<00:02:15.360> local<00:02:15.840> but<00:02:16.230> no

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
this you can have it all local but no

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.730 
this you can have it all local but no
I've<00:02:17.250> done<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.520> for<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.700> time<00:02:17.880> being<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> we've

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
I've done it for the time being so we've

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.550 
I've done it for the time being so we've
got<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.130> battery<00:02:20.959> power<00:02:21.959> from<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.200> battery

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
got the battery power from the battery

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.600 
got the battery power from the battery
comes<00:02:23.310> down<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> roshni<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:26.040> positive

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
comes down to the roshni to the positive

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.750 
comes down to the roshni to the positive
side<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.660> roshni<00:02:28.020> okay<00:02:28.590> now<00:02:29.280> these<00:02:29.430> two

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
side of the roshni okay now these two

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.270 
side of the roshni okay now these two
these<00:02:30.750> two<00:02:30.780> positives<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:31.500> here<00:02:31.739> they're<00:02:32.130> both

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
these two positives on here they're both

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.229 
these two positives on here they're both
the<00:02:32.400> same<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.980> one<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.489> will<00:02:36.090> be<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
the same so one going in will be the

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.840 
the same so one going in will be the
same<00:02:36.450> coming<00:02:36.690> out<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.920> let's<00:02:38.400> follow<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.760> from

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
same coming out so let's follow it from

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.930 
same coming out so let's follow it from
here<00:02:39.209> power<00:02:40.050> from<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.320> battery<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
here power from the battery to the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.240 
here power from the battery to the
positive<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.330> roshni<00:02:42.739> from<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.920> positive

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
positive of the roshni from the positive

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.840 
positive of the roshni from the positive
of<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.459> roshni<00:02:44.880> okay<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.190> normally-open

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
of the roshni okay to the normally-open

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.650 
of the roshni okay to the normally-open
of<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.660> relay<00:02:49.050> which<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.100> here<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:51.270> normally

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
of the relay which is here it's normally

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.860 
of the relay which is here it's normally
open<00:02:52.459> I've<00:02:53.459> got<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> quick<00:02:53.820> diagram<00:02:54.209> here<00:02:54.570> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
open I've got a quick diagram here to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.440 
open I've got a quick diagram here to
show<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.130> bit<00:02:56.280> bit<00:02:56.580> easier<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> understand

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
show it's a bit bit easier to understand

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.650 
show it's a bit bit easier to understand
so<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:58.500> here<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.250> normally<00:02:59.760> open<00:02:59.850> there

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
so this one here is normally open there

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.240 
so this one here is normally open there
is<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.780> diagram<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> Rasha<00:03:01.590> neon<00:03:01.920> sorry<00:03:02.160> on

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
is a diagram on the Rasha neon sorry on

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.340 
is a diagram on the Rasha neon sorry on
the<00:03:02.370> relay<00:03:02.640> here<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:03.810> very<00:03:04.049> difficult

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
the relay here but it's very difficult

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.640 
the relay here but it's very difficult
to<00:03:05.160> sort<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.519> see<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.940> video<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:07.380> can

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
to sort of see on the video but you can

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.039 
to sort of see on the video but you can
follow<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.040> from<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.340> as<00:03:08.489> well<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:09.330> also<00:03:09.510> on

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
follow it from this as well but also on

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.380 
follow it from this as well but also on
these<00:03:10.170> particular<00:03:10.470> relays<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.670> actually

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
these particular relays you can actually

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.420 
these particular relays you can actually
see<00:03:12.630> inside<00:03:12.840> them<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.070> see<00:03:14.250> which

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
see inside them and you can see which

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.630 
see inside them and you can see which
connection<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.940> which<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:16.049> if<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:17.220> see<00:03:17.489> in

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
connection is which so if you can see in

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.750 
connection is which so if you can see in
there<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.630> probably<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:20.370> will<00:03:20.519> see

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
there you probably can you will see

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.940 
there you probably can you will see
there's<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.150> gap<00:03:21.450> between<00:03:21.780> something<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.799> point

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
there's a gap between something to point

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.110 
there's a gap between something to point
with<00:03:23.239> there's<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.360> gap<00:03:24.660> between<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.830> two<00:03:26.120> two

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
with there's a gap between the two two

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.030 
with there's a gap between the two two
points<00:03:27.510> there<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.500> we're<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.769> from<00:03:28.890> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
points there so we're going from the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.720 
points there so we're going from the
common<00:03:29.459> which<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.970> centre<00:03:30.390> one<00:03:30.540> here<00:03:31.730> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
common which is the centre one here to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.509 
common which is the centre one here to
this<00:03:32.850> one<00:03:32.910> here<00:03:33.510> which<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:33.989> normally<00:03:34.500> open<00:03:34.680> now

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
this one here which is normally open now

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.400 
this one here which is normally open now
normally<00:03:36.090> open<00:03:36.330> means<00:03:36.540> when<00:03:37.110> it's<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.350> a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
normally open means when it's in a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.580 
normally open means when it's in a
normal<00:03:37.830> state<00:03:37.950> not<00:03:38.519> activated<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.810> means<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
normal state not activated it means the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.640 
normal state not activated it means the
contact<00:03:41.010> isn't<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:42.660> open<00:03:42.989> it's<00:03:43.320> not<00:03:43.410> making

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
contact isn't is is open it's not making

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.640 
contact isn't is is open it's not making
any<00:03:43.799> contact<00:03:44.330> so<00:03:45.330> that's<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.320> best<00:03:46.500> way

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
any contact so that's the best way

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.600 
any contact so that's the best way
probably<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.340> see<00:03:47.519> inside<00:03:47.820> these<00:03:48.090> relays

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
probably to see inside these relays

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.310 
probably to see inside these relays
right<00:03:50.610> sounds<00:03:50.850> carry<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:51.959> we<00:03:52.049> come<00:03:52.200> from

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
right sounds carry on so we come from

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.289 
right sounds carry on so we come from
the<00:03:52.440> positive<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.220> normally<00:03:53.579> open<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
the positive to the normally open of the

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.960 
the positive to the normally open of the
relay<00:03:54.750> okay<00:03:55.440> now<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.450> then<00:03:58.160> linked<00:03:59.160> to

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
relay okay now that is then linked to

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.240 
relay okay now that is then linked to
the<00:04:00.090> switch<00:04:00.510> on<00:04:01.050> the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
the switch on the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.650 
the switch on the
on<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:03.050> sorry<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.850> yeah<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.150> core

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
on the sorry to the yeah to the core

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.860 
on the sorry to the yeah to the core
point<00:04:06.900> which<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.530> wired<00:04:07.740> as<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.100> switch<00:04:08.460> okay<00:04:08.940> so

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
point which is wired as a switch okay so

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.620 
point which is wired as a switch okay so
at<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.020> moment<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.470> open<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:12.480> when<00:04:12.570> you

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
at the moment this is open and when you

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.510 
at the moment this is open and when you
put<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.810> key<00:04:12.990> in<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.410> activate<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:14.010> glass<00:04:14.220> or

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
put the key in to activate a glass or

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.300 
put the key in to activate a glass or
you<00:04:14.610> break<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.910> glass<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.870> are<00:04:16.160> closing<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
you break the glass you are closing the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.060 
you break the glass you are closing the
switch<00:04:17.489> which<00:04:17.910> then<00:04:18.090> completes<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.480> circuit

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
switch which then completes the circuit

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.690 
switch which then completes the circuit
so<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.850> yeah<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.540> from<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.900> switch<00:04:22.200> or<00:04:22.950> from

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
so so yeah so from the switch or from

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.070 
so so yeah so from the switch or from
the<00:04:23.790> newly<00:04:24.060> open<00:04:24.300> contact<00:04:24.630> on<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.810> relay

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
the newly open contact on the relay

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.460 
the newly open contact on the relay
which<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.650> one<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:27.870> come<00:04:28.080> around<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.380> the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
which is this one you come around to the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.820 
which is this one you come around to the
cool<00:04:28.710> point<00:04:30.020> switch<00:04:31.020> there<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.590> then<00:04:31.740> you

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
cool point switch there and then you

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.100 
cool point switch there and then you
come<00:04:31.980> around<00:04:32.070> here<00:04:32.510> from<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.660> other<00:04:33.810> end<00:04:34.050> of

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
come around here from the other end of

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.010 
come around here from the other end of
the<00:04:34.200> switch<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:35.610> go<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.300> common<00:04:36.810> of

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
the switch and you go to the common of

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:45.530 
the switch and you go to the common of
the<00:04:37.560> relay<00:04:37.920> which<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:41.180> this<00:04:42.180> one<00:04:42.390> here<00:04:43.730> okay<00:04:44.730> so

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
the relay which is this one here okay so

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.900 
the relay which is this one here okay so
from<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.810> common<00:04:46.230> through<00:04:46.470> relay<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:47.730> then

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
from the common through relay you then

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.550 
from the common through relay you then
link<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:49.290> coil<00:04:49.700> which<00:04:50.700> is<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.000> very<00:04:51.180> top

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
link to the coil which is the very top

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.560 
link to the coil which is the very top
one<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.680> relay<00:04:53.040> here<00:04:53.310> so<00:04:53.820> this<00:04:54.030> one<00:04:54.210> here

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
one of the relay here so this one here

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.900 
one of the relay here so this one here
is<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.590> coil<00:04:57.050> right<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:59.070> from<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.340> point<00:04:59.580> if

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
is the coil right so from that point if

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.640 
is the coil right so from that point if
we're<00:05:00.120> following<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.540> through<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.840> coil<00:05:01.110> we

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
we're following it through the coil we

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.530 
we're following it through the coil we
skip<00:05:01.919> over<00:05:02.040> to<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.310> other<00:05:02.400> side<00:05:02.700> so<00:05:03.240> let's<00:05:03.419> say

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
skip over to the other side so let's say

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.330 
skip over to the other side so let's say
that's<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.810> positive<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.380> coil<00:05:04.620> we<00:05:05.160> nip

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
that's the positive of the coil we nip

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.710 
that's the positive of the coil we nip
over<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.730> or<00:05:06.030> we<00:05:06.150> skip<00:05:06.360> over<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.540> the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
over to the or we skip over to the

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.670 
over to the or we skip over to the
negative<00:05:07.080> side<00:05:07.320> we<00:05:08.310> come<00:05:08.520> up<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:09.290> then<00:05:10.290> we<00:05:10.410> run

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
negative side we come up and then we run

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.270 
negative side we come up and then we run
to<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.400> normally<00:05:13.850> the<00:05:14.850> normally<00:05:15.360> open<00:05:15.919> of<00:05:16.919> the

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
to the normally the normally open of the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.130 
to the normally the normally open of the
other<00:05:17.460> side<00:05:17.820> remember<00:05:18.450> this<00:05:18.660> is<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.810> double

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
other side remember this is a double

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.620 
other side remember this is a double
pole<00:05:19.320> relay<00:05:19.680> so<00:05:20.640> there's<00:05:20.790> two<00:05:20.940> poles<00:05:21.240> in<00:05:21.450> there

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
pole relay so there's two poles in there

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.390 
pole relay so there's two poles in there
so<00:05:22.169> you've<00:05:22.260> got<00:05:22.380> two<00:05:22.560> relay<00:05:22.919> contacts

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
so you've got two relay contacts

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.850 
so you've got two relay contacts
basically<00:05:23.910> so<00:05:24.540> then<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:24.750> skip<00:05:24.990> over<00:05:25.110> from<00:05:25.620> the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
basically so then you skip over from the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.360 
basically so then you skip over from the
native<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.280> coil<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.330> normally<00:05:27.660> open<00:05:27.720> on

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
native the coil to the normally open on

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.890 
native the coil to the normally open on
the<00:05:29.370> other<00:05:29.400> side<00:05:30.000> of<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.210> relay<00:05:30.419> on<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.660> on

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
the other side of the relay on the on

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.370 
the other side of the relay on the on
the<00:05:31.110> other<00:05:31.140> contact<00:05:31.770> so<00:05:32.490> then<00:05:32.610> from<00:05:32.790> here<00:05:33.380> we

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
the other contact so then from here we

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.700 
the other contact so then from here we
then<00:05:34.560> run<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:35.040> the<00:05:35.250> negative<00:05:35.700> of<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:35.940> battery

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
then run to the negative of the battery

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.920 
then run to the negative of the battery
okay<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:38.010> that's<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.340> circuit<00:05:38.700> there<00:05:38.910> now<00:05:39.630> on

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
okay so that's the circuit there now on

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.060 
okay so that's the circuit there now on
the<00:05:40.140> common<00:05:40.729> which<00:05:41.729> is<00:05:41.760> this<00:05:42.030> one<00:05:42.740> you<00:05:43.740> go

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
the common which is this one you go

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.820 
the common which is this one you go
which<00:05:44.430> is<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.640> center<00:05:45.030> of<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.180> relay<00:05:45.510> I<00:05:45.830> say

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
which is the center of the relay I say

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.409 
which is the center of the relay I say
Center<00:05:47.280> we're<00:05:47.460> ignoring<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.940> two<00:05:48.090> bottom

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
Center we're ignoring the two bottom

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.080 
Center we're ignoring the two bottom
pins<00:05:48.660> on<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:48.870> relay<00:05:49.250> okay<00:05:50.280> so<00:05:50.880> we're<00:05:50.970> coming

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
pins on the relay okay so we're coming

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.640 
pins on the relay okay so we're coming
around<00:05:51.330> here<00:05:51.720> and<00:05:51.840> then<00:05:52.229> we're<00:05:52.380> down<00:05:52.470> to<00:05:52.530> the

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
around here and then we're down to the

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.000 
around here and then we're down to the
negative<00:05:53.190> of<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:54.390> rationing<00:05:54.960> I've<00:05:55.650> got<00:05:55.830> as<00:05:55.919> a

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
negative of the rationing I've got as a

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.700 
negative of the rationing I've got as a
roshni<00:05:56.370> it<00:05:56.460> could<00:05:56.580> be<00:05:56.669> any<00:05:56.910> device<00:05:57.240> and<00:05:58.050> it<00:05:58.560> can

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
roshni it could be any device and it can

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.250 
roshni it could be any device and it can
work<00:05:58.950> on<00:05:59.310> there<00:05:59.700> this<00:06:00.060> is<00:06:00.210> all<00:06:00.300> 12<00:06:00.600> volt<00:06:00.810> by<00:06:01.200> the

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
work on there this is all 12 volt by the

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.680 
work on there this is all 12 volt by the
way<00:06:01.470> this<00:06:01.830> whole<00:06:02.040> thing's<00:06:02.790> a<00:06:02.940> 12<00:06:03.210> volt<00:06:03.360> real<00:06:03.540> a

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
way this whole thing's a 12 volt real a

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.140 
way this whole thing's a 12 volt real a
12<00:06:04.200> volt<00:06:04.380> roshni<00:06:04.890> actually<00:06:05.700> no<00:06:05.790> it's<00:06:05.940> annoying

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
12 volt roshni actually no it's annoying

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.710 
12 volt roshni actually no it's annoying
to<00:06:06.240> 28

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
to 28

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.980 
to 28
roshni<00:06:07.020> as<00:06:07.560> you<00:06:07.740> can<00:06:07.860> see<00:06:08.040> there<00:06:08.479> so<00:06:09.479> yeah<00:06:09.660> so

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
roshni as you can see there so yeah so

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.689 
roshni as you can see there so yeah so
you<00:06:10.830> basically

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.090 

yeah<00:06:14.699> running<00:06:15.120> from<00:06:15.360> there<00:06:15.590> to<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.680> negative

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
yeah running from there to the negative

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.570 
yeah running from there to the negative
of<00:06:17.340> the<00:06:17.880> roshni<00:06:18.470> okay<00:06:19.470> and<00:06:19.860> that<00:06:20.130> is<00:06:20.370> basically

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
of the roshni okay and that is basically

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.540 
of the roshni okay and that is basically
a<00:06:21.620> how<00:06:22.620> latching<00:06:23.070> relay<00:06:23.340> is<00:06:23.460> set<00:06:23.699> up<00:06:24.110> I<00:06:25.550> will

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
a how latching relay is set up I will

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.460 
a how latching relay is set up I will
try<00:06:26.940> and<00:06:27.120> do<00:06:27.180> a<00:06:27.210> diagram<00:06:27.600> for<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:27.960> and<00:06:28.199> get<00:06:28.380> it

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
try and do a diagram for it and get it

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.340 
try and do a diagram for it and get it
up<00:06:28.590> on<00:06:29.370> to<00:06:29.880> the<00:06:30.360> video<00:06:30.720> if<00:06:31.260> that<00:06:31.500> is<00:06:31.710> possible

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
up on to the video if that is possible

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.050 
up on to the video if that is possible
that's<00:06:34.350> yeah<00:06:35.130> that's<00:06:35.370> pretty<00:06:35.490> much<00:06:35.610> it<00:06:35.699> so

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
that's yeah that's pretty much it so

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.240 
that's yeah that's pretty much it so
going<00:06:36.720> back<00:06:36.870> to<00:06:36.960> this<00:06:37.050> again<00:06:39.020> they<00:06:40.020> are<00:06:40.250> the

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
going back to this again they are the

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.550 
going back to this again they are the
connections<00:06:41.699> you<00:06:41.760> need<00:06:41.910> on<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.210> relay<00:06:42.570> kind

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
connections you need on the relay kind

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.620 
connections you need on the relay kind
of<00:06:43.650> narrative<00:06:44.070> it's<00:06:44.669> these<00:06:44.820> two<00:06:44.880> last<00:06:45.300> ones

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
of narrative it's these two last ones

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.659 
of narrative it's these two last ones
here<00:06:45.690> just<00:06:46.260> ignore<00:06:46.530> those<00:06:46.710> they<00:06:47.310> will<00:06:47.460> be<00:06:47.550> the

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
here just ignore those they will be the

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.460 
here just ignore those they will be the
normally<00:06:48.000> closed<00:06:48.240> connections<00:06:48.780> on<00:06:49.050> the<00:06:49.110> relay

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
normally closed connections on the relay

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.400 
normally closed connections on the relay
but<00:06:49.860> we're<00:06:49.979> not<00:06:50.070> using<00:06:50.250> any<00:06:50.430> of<00:06:50.580> those<00:06:50.729> so<00:06:51.720> so

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
but we're not using any of those so so

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.159 
but we're not using any of those so so
we<00:06:52.530> don't<00:06:52.680> need<00:06:52.800> them<00:06:53.720> so<00:06:54.720> that's<00:06:54.900> pretty<00:06:55.110> much

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
we don't need them so that's pretty much

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:56.060 
we don't need them so that's pretty much
it

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
it

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.190 
it
I'll<00:06:56.820> just<00:06:57.060> demonstrate<00:06:57.180> it<00:06:57.540> one<00:06:57.780> more<00:06:57.930> time

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200 
I'll just demonstrate it one more time

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:15.290 
I'll just demonstrate it one more time
