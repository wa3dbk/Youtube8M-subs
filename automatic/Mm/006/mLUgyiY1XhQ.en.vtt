00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi guys okay with you here to 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.879
 do a makeup tutorial or 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.010
 I decided to use this word had mac 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.290
 mac now launched several pallets in 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.630
 nine colors are the shadows do not size one 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.540
 small and there are four combinations 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.140
 different comes ready and I used it here 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.050
 I did not even stein has silver tones is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.750
 has a brown green month since it is a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.550
 wonderful work that I will use and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.740
 have shades of blue and I'm not going to use the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.560
 blue or else make this makeup half 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.050
 with a light touch of green almost 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 Can not you see half a silver like that and me? 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.010
 I really hope you like it 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.079
 the makeup is super easy to do then 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.090
 Come learn with me, I'll start. 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.610
 applying a first I will use this one of the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.860
 nice that it is transparent and I 'll apply 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.450
 it across my eyelid and it is also 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.579
 lower eyelashes because the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.230
 people will apply the shade there and I will 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.910
 spread with your fingers you can use a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.920
 Corrective if you want 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.930
 now with the smoking brush I go 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.780
 start applying the gray shade more 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.510
 clarinha that has it is opaque and I go 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.729
 apply my concave across my 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.650
 I send this shadow well a little bit 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.720
 Then I'm building several 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.820
 layers until I get the tone I want 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.040
 a little bit stronger and I apply one 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.950
 slightly above the concave and in the concave 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.110
 and I smoke them well with the brush with 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.850
 Come and go moves and now I'm going 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.979
 pick up a white pencil you can use 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.659
 pencil you want I'll pass 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.240
 under the eyebrow to be able to 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.970
 light is abrupt several uses quite 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.530
 this trick and I spread with the brush but 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.430
 you can also spread it with your finger if you 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.869
 you prefer 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.180
 then with the brush a little bit 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.369
 I'm going to get this 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.280
 gray that is a little darker and 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.200
 He's also Matt, what I'm going to do is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.899
 concentrate this color is exactly on the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.570
 well on the noble line and then I 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.520
 I get a smoking brush too and it vanishes. 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.070
 with reciprocating movements until this color 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 It is very natural and now with the brush 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.290
 apply the shadow I'll get this 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.670
 Silver shadow that the second shadow and I 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.130
 I'll apply in the corner on the first 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.200
 third of my eye in the corner and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.820
 also here in the corner to illuminate 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.520
 they will illuminate and put a 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.629
 little at the beginning of the eyelid 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.370
 start thinking I'll take the first 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.500
 shadow that is a white with enough 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 brightness and I apply for you 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.880
 in this tone now I'll get another initial 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.700
 and I'm going to get this 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.340
 color that is a grayish brown with 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.170
 and I'll apply it all over the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.590
 the movable eyelid leaving the corner 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.400
 external so I concentrate the color well 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.290
 then I give Pacor taps and fix well 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.120
 let the inner corner now make up 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.680
 very little to smoke 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.320
 We'll get the darkest shadow. 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.660
 which is a black with plenty of silver luster 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.180
 and I'm going to apply in this corner is 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.459
 rest in this outer corner and the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.709
 concept well the color and then with 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.180
 He left the brush I make it the fray 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.060
 from my concave 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.640
 it is quite light so without stones 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.410
 without concentrating too much color 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.209
 now I had to give I'll have 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.209
 catch a light shadow and I will apply 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.739
 above the pencil under the eyebrow 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.660
 and then I'll get this first color 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.420
 clear line with enough brightness and 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.340
 above now compensate for applying the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.920
 shadow I'll catch it right at the tip 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.050
 that the greenish brown shadow and I go 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.769
 apply to the lower lashes in 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.620
 the whole extension and compensate much less 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.100
 I got the black shadow, I only use it. 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.660
 half out and I also 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.250
 end of the eye 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.110
 now I will pass the eyeliner I chose a 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.120
 eyeliner but you can use 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.489
 the eyeliner you want I'll go 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.030
 make a dash a little bit or so thin 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.890
 and neither so thick and I'll do with a 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.440
 light pull on the end that I always 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.910
 I do not know what to do. 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.350
 my eye 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.470
 But you do the way you do. 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.570
 likes and then just get a beige pencil and 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.459
 will apply in the water line I will use 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.110
 I'm going to wear beige pencil because my eye is 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.700
 very small but if you prefer you 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.900
 You can also use a black pencil that goes 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.510
 look beautiful 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.760
 and to end this year I'll apply 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.519
 enough mask because mine they are 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.400
 so small they do not even appear in the video 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.709
 and then I caprice in the good mask ends 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.459
 the eye applied false eyelashes I used 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.500
 or naturalized 9 of the first kiss and then 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.690
 I did the skin normally I 'll show 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.380
