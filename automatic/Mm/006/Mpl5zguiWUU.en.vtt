her years she studied in mice even which
I<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.770> there<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> could<00:01:21.150> compare<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
I was there so I could compare the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.109 
I was there so I could compare the
difference<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> education<00:01:23.189> system<00:01:23.759> what

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
difference in the education system what

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.660 
difference in the education system what
they<00:01:24.270> follow<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:25.380> influenced<00:01:25.890> quite<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
they follow they influenced quite a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.630 
they follow they influenced quite a
practical<00:01:27.270> approach<00:01:27.950> quite<00:01:28.950> influenced<00:01:29.460> on

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
practical approach quite influenced on

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.450 
practical approach quite influenced on
reading<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.509> conceptual<00:01:31.320> value<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.950> good<00:01:32.250> as

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
reading the conceptual value is good as

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.420 
reading the conceptual value is good as
compared<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> some<00:01:33.869> different<00:01:34.200> school<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
compared to some different school I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.660 
compared to some different school I
don't<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.270> they're<00:01:36.420> rushing<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
don't think they're rushing in the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.679 
don't think they're rushing in the
beginning<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.540> generally

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
beginning because what we generally

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.160 
beginning because what we generally
smaller<00:01:40.170> class<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.700> class<00:01:42.420> per<00:01:42.810> student

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
smaller class one class per student

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.789 
smaller class one class per student
would<00:01:43.500> be

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
would be

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.709 
would be
what<00:01:44.799> not<00:01:45.039> without<00:01:45.340> any<00:01:45.520> concepts<00:01:46.060> but<00:01:46.659> I

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
what not without any concepts but I

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.630 
what not without any concepts but I
think<00:01:47.020> they<00:01:47.140> are<00:01:47.200> doing<00:01:47.409> it<00:01:47.590> very<00:01:47.740> gradually

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
think they are doing it very gradually

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.450 
think they are doing it very gradually
in<00:01:48.759> concept<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:49.450> that's<00:01:49.810> where<00:01:50.499> they<00:01:50.649> create<00:01:51.429> a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
in concept so that's where they create a

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.809 
in concept so that's where they create a
good<00:01:51.670> base<00:01:51.909> for<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> child<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:54.490> are<00:01:54.609> the<00:01:54.670> two

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
good base for a child what are the two

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.699 
good base for a child what are the two
things<00:01:55.060> that<00:01:55.359> you<00:01:55.479> really<00:01:55.509> liked<00:01:55.929> about<00:01:56.229> Delhi

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
things that you really liked about Delhi

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.399 
things that you really liked about Delhi
public<00:01:56.859> school<00:01:57.149> any<00:01:58.149> two<00:01:58.359> things<00:01:58.569> yeah<00:01:59.380> I

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
public school any two things yeah I

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.940 
public school any two things yeah I
think<00:01:59.560> they<00:02:00.219> give<00:02:00.369> a<00:02:00.399> good<00:02:00.609> base<00:02:00.909> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
think they give a good base and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.319 
think they give a good base and
influence<00:02:02.950> on<00:02:03.159> some<00:02:03.399> practical<00:02:03.880> aspects

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
influence on some practical aspects

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.779 
influence on some practical aspects
that's<00:02:05.170> more<00:02:05.439> important<00:02:05.950> for<00:02:06.130> any<00:02:06.369> child<00:02:06.640> to

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
that's more important for any child to

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.339 
that's more important for any child to
be<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.000> good<00:02:07.240> person<00:02:07.810> rather<00:02:08.440> good<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.580> studies

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
be a good person rather good in studies

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.539 
be a good person rather good in studies
so<00:02:11.349> how<00:02:11.470> likely<00:02:11.650> would<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:11.980> be<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.190> recommend

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
so how likely would you be to recommend

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.220 
so how likely would you be to recommend
Delhi<00:02:12.849> public<00:02:13.000> school<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.480> other<00:02:13.629> parents<00:02:13.840> as

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
Delhi public school to other parents as

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.780 
Delhi public school to other parents as
well<00:02:14.440> if<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.680> say<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.069> scale<00:02:15.310> from<00:02:15.519> one<00:02:15.760> to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
well if I say on a scale from one to

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.369 
well if I say on a scale from one to
five<00:02:16.090> bunnies<00:02:16.450> for<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:16.989> recommendation

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
five bunnies for this recommendation

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.960 
five bunnies for this recommendation
five<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.040> for<00:02:18.190> highly<00:02:18.310> recommended<00:02:18.879> she

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
five is for highly recommended she

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.610 
five is for highly recommended she
personally<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.420> think<00:02:19.660> every<00:02:19.989> school<00:02:20.049> is<00:02:20.410> fine

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
personally I think every school is fine

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.710 
personally I think every school is fine
is<00:02:20.890> like<00:02:21.280> we<00:02:21.610> should<00:02:21.790> not<00:02:21.940> compare<00:02:22.390> between

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
is like we should not compare between

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.479 
is like we should not compare between
the<00:02:23.019> students<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.799> between<00:02:23.860> our<00:02:24.129> children

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
the students and between our children

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.580 
the students and between our children
and<00:02:24.640> between<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.000> schools<00:02:25.269> it's<00:02:26.140> your<00:02:26.319> child

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
and between the schools it's your child

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.890 
and between the schools it's your child
could<00:02:27.519> get<00:02:27.670> an<00:02:27.790> opportunity<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.390> one<00:02:28.569> school

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
could get an opportunity in one school

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.449 
could get an opportunity in one school
and<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.200> could<00:02:29.379> not<00:02:29.500> get<00:02:29.650> another<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.310> does

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
and you could not get another that does

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.039 
and you could not get another that does
not<00:02:30.610> mean<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:30.849> other<00:02:31.120> school<00:02:31.480> was<00:02:31.660> too<00:02:31.870> good

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
not mean that other school was too good

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.869 
not mean that other school was too good
where<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.319> could<00:02:32.470> not<00:02:32.620> get<00:02:32.860> fit<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.819> I

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
where you could not get fit it so I

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.150 
where you could not get fit it so I
think<00:02:33.970> wherever<00:02:34.390> your<00:02:34.780> child<00:02:35.109> fits<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.859> that's

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
think wherever your child fits in that's

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.119 
think wherever your child fits in that's
important<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.209> then<00:02:37.810> wherever<00:02:38.410> he<00:02:38.620> fits<00:02:38.890> in

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
important and then wherever he fits in

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.049 
important and then wherever he fits in
you<00:02:39.760> should<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.090> happily<00:02:40.510> adapting
