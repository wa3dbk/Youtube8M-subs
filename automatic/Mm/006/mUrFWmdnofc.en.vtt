well people do don't might not know how
to<00:00:26.519> make<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> fountain<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.390> I'm<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.349> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
to make a fountain so I'm just going to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.160 
to make a fountain so I'm just going to
be<00:00:28.529> making<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.920> tutorial<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.269> mean

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
be making this tutorial so I'm I mean

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.709 
be making this tutorial so I'm I mean
these<00:00:31.439> are<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> main<00:00:31.920> three<00:00:32.579> types<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
these are the main three types of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.040 
these are the main three types of
functions<00:00:34.170> i<00:00:34.290> guess<00:00:34.500> i<00:00:34.680> mean<00:00:34.800> my<00:00:34.950> favorite<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
functions i guess i mean my favorite is

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.170 
functions i guess i mean my favorite is
medium<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.040> too<00:00:38.190> big<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:38.430> too<00:00:38.640> small<00:00:38.790> so

to be building that kind of shape if you
are<00:00:55.260> ok<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.850> first<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.030> all<00:00:57.090> start<00:00:57.840> make<00:00:58.050> sure

you have bucket of water a block and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.930 
you have bucket of water a block and
half<00:01:01.079> step<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.829> design<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> then

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
half step just for design and then

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.560 
half step just for design and then
wherever<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.359> want<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> place<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:05.570> weight

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.539 
guys might be wondering why I don't have
a<00:01:35.880> texture<00:01:36.329> pack<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.340> point

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
a texture pack because it's one point

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.780 
a texture pack because it's one point
two<00:01:38.670> point<00:01:38.820> four<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:41.630> couldn't<00:01:42.630> find<00:01:42.930> any

two point four and I couldn't find any

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.219 
two point four and I couldn't find any
texture<00:01:44.790> packs<00:01:44.970> are<00:01:45.210> compatible<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
texture packs are compatible with a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.460 
texture packs are compatible with a
equivalent<00:01:47.159> exchange<00:01:47.610> mod<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.290> I'm

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.219 
just go around it one around it and then
pour<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.920> water<00:02:08.310> over<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.000> then<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.869> will<00:02:10.050> do

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
pour the water over and then it will do

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.290 
pour the water over and then it will do
this<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.670> did<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.910> get<00:02:12.120> that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
this you know so did you get that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.309 
this you know so did you get that
basically<00:02:12.780> just

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
basically just

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.979 
basically just
go<00:02:13.620> few<00:02:14.040> up<00:02:14.189> however<00:02:15.060> much<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.390> want<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.719> and

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
go few up however much you want up and

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.619 
go few up however much you want up and
then<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.519> are<00:02:17.519> for<00:02:17.909> water<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.299> it<00:02:18.389> and<00:02:18.540> then

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
then you are for water of it and then

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.660 
then you are for water of it and then
cause<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.049> this<00:02:19.170> hole<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.650> doesn't<00:02:20.219> flow<00:02:20.579> out

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
cause of this hole it doesn't flow out

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.089 
cause of this hole it doesn't flow out
here<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.299> just<00:02:21.510> goes<00:02:21.629> straight<00:02:21.780> down<00:02:22.099> the

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
here it just goes straight down the

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.759 
here it just goes straight down the
honor<00:02:23.249> is<00:02:23.430> kind<00:02:23.639> of<00:02:23.760> random<00:02:23.879> but<00:02:24.389> yeah<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:25.290> and

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
honor is kind of random but yeah and and

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.890 
honor is kind of random but yeah and and
then<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.430> make<00:02:26.549> it<00:02:26.700> look<00:02:26.819> nicer<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.540> know<00:02:27.569> you
