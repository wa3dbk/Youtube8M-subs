00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In recent months people have been celebrating weddings more often.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And as it has suddenly come to be known this week

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
this pleasant statistics will be soon improved by them -

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
our Olympic champions in figure skating - Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It has been rumoured for a long time that Tanya and Maxim are a pair not only on the ice, but in life as well,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but the athletes were neither confirming nor denying it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And even when the news about their engagement leaked to the press on Tuesday

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the only answer was this brief comment:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
"Thanks for your congratulations, it's true that we're engaged, can't say anything in detail, it's too personal", Maxim wrote.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well, personal means personal, and of course we wouldn't be gossiping or discussing their private life,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but then suddenly Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov agreed to tell the story of their love

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
sincerely, and only for you - the audience of "Central Television".

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The Swiss town of Davos, which hosts the World Economic Forum each year,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
today, on St.Valentine's Day, welcomes our Olympic champions

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Early in the morning they made a romantic journey to the mountains

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and in the evening were walking about the ancient streets of Davos

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
How could we not ask them about the "fire and ice" of their relations?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
- We don't quarrel at all off the ice.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
On the ice, yes, we can argue sometimes, but in the everyday life it almost never happens...

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Even if there occurs any disagreement, it's very, very short...

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
- Tatiana, is it true?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
- Yes, it's absolutely true

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And now we are in a cosy Alpine restaurant.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Where else we can see our famous skaters in such an informal setting?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And they have things to celebrate, as they are going to have  wedding soon.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
- The proposal was a surprise for me, because I was so absorbed by the whole atmosphere...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
As a location for his proposal Maxim has chosen the Bali Island.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
- We all clanged glasses of champagne together, and then decided to jump to the swimming pool,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we all dived, and there Maxim swam to me, and said some lovely words to me,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and then I gave my answer...

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That Tatiana said "yes" to Maxim, at first only the closest people knew.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
- I'm so happy that he did it,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
so happy for Tanya, because they are so nice people...

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
As for the journalists, Volosozhar and Trankov never told them about their relations before.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
- I'm in general a bit reserved about talking of personal stuff,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and I don't like too much to talk about our feelings to everyone...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And only for the audience of "Central Television" they are making an exception for the first time.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
- We have got to thinking about ourselves as a family...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Tanya has begun to say about something "ours" instead of "mine" or "yours"...

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But it's not a secret any more, how can anybody not notice the ring on her finger?..

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
- I didn't know the proper size of the ring, though I was preparing...

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Maybe, he began to prepare even back in 2003, when they met on the ice for the first time?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Twelve years have passed since then. Wasn't it love at the first sight?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
- Well, it depends from which point to count...

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We didn't have anything like "rose and candy stage"...

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
They became a skating pair in 2010

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and not many people know that before that Maxim Trankov had even considered to retire.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
- Yes, to finish my career, or to go on...

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It was Tatiana who helped him to go on.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Year after year they were winning at the championships of Europe, of the World,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
until finally, they achieved the most important victory of their lives, the Olympic victory.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now the most important question is: what now?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Big sport or little kids?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
- Well, we have the Olympics 2018 to think about for now...

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and then, right after the Olympics, we can be ready to having kids

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
- Planning the children's rooms for the future already

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And that's we think is the most essential news to the fans of Max and Tanya.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It's three years till the next Olympics in South Korea

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
which means a new challenge for them both on and off the ice

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Thus, so to say, "o sport you are peace, o sport you are love".
