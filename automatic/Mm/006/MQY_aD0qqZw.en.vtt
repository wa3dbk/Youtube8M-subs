00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.970

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.250
 asks for so many requirements so you can 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.960
 inject it into most computers 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.730

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:52.610

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:52.610
 [Music] 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.649
 [Music] 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.890
 when the four have been downloaded 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
 I recommend you pass them all to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.490
 a folder once this is done 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.110
 we select all the parts already 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.510
 any file we give right click 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.200
 and extract here if we were to begin 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200
 decompress 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.620
 [Music] 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.750
 when they have finished we will appear 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.820
 this executable which we will execute 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.720
 as an administrator to not have any 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.720
 type of problems 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.270
 I want to remind you that this installation 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.340
 it was created entirely by me so if 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.460
 someone else is with this installer and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.880
 they will know that it is mine x must continue with 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.140
 the installation we will give to next 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.050
 We accept the terms and we give 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.300
 following 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.080
 [Music] 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.420
 now we press next again 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.510
 next suit me that option and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.540
 we go to next and finally we will give 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.640
 next xd the installation process 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.010
 it's something long it could last up to five 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.460
 minutes but this will depend on your with 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.460
 players 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.800
 [Music] 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.550
 now de palo let's play this option and 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.550
 let's finish 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.810
 in this way we would have this game 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.970
 completely complete and Spanish does not 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.330
 I show a gameplay because I really know 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.670

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.920
 multiplayer for this game can you 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.050
 do without any problem the game does not 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.770
 has no way or anything by the 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.110
 style so I'll leave you there xd 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.070
