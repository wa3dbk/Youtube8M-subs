00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.660
 vegas here with you cx tents today we talk 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.450
 of gambit because we own him 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.269
 seen some small spoiler of the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.429
 season 2 which we will comment together 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.470
 obviously next week because 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.180
 I think they are indeed almost certain 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.789
 that next week we will have this 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.180
 season 2 finally then why 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.849
 gambit the comment of this of this 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.250
 Saturday because some screenshots 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.560
 we noticed that gambit will be the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.570
 premium character needed to 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.630
 finishing the first picture is what I have 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.149
 understood it will be used to unlock the armor 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.239
 by iron fist as later in the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.700
 square 2 to unlock the armor of 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.280
 cyclops will serve to complete a series 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.050
 of missions including definitely playing 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.100
 therefore the prize mission is worthwhile 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.230
 spend i 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.379
 90 command points to buy gambit 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.079
 let's go and see them together then the 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.070
 passive gambit is only one who does 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.460
 call joker 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.860
 first the joker has the possibility 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.240
 to attack when a companion attack 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.340
 then a kind of is attacked 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.710
 coordinated cooperative defense attack 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.440
 exclusive to ken bits and this attack 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.210
 of provides kinetic charge we go to 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.880
 see what is charged and genetic the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.940
 first attack is a simple attack in 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.100
 melee melee and apply charge 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.500
 Kinetic it can publish 1 to 3 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.300
 we say randomly 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.670
 this genetic charge not only increases 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.020
 the possibility of inflicting blow 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.960
 critical but not consumed by hbo 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.509
 roulette therefore square combo attacks 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.920
 roulette does not consume kinetic charge e 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.210
 then below it says can be 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.840
 applied up to four times 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.520
 consequently attacking twice with 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.289
 this attack 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.959
 you are almost certain to apply four 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.039
 sometimes bills to see where it is wasted 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.920
 this kinetic practice that 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.350
 basically and all he knows 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.850
 gambit of particular a character of the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.610
 comics also pretty cute 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.390
 sympathetic is not the usual splinter killer 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.940
 or 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.410
 and put rays out of your eyes because I read 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.810
 the cards in fact the second attack e 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.880
 ace of spades consumes a charge 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.190
 kinetic to provide an extra shift 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.200
 so technically having four 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.690
 you can do loads and kinetics 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.480
 four attacks with ace of spades and a 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.410
 other with bills is not bad damage 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.390
 obviously low however it provides guard 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.640
 lowered then the defense is reduced by 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.850
 25 percent to the enemy that comes 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.290
 technically attacked you could 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.360
 attack all three with three charges 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.180
 kinetic and lower the defense at all 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.730
 and three and then use another attack 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.940
 the heart the third attack is practically 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.550
 the attack that most devastating the number 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.830
 of strokes and 3 and the possibility of blow 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.570
 critical and also quite high 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.890
 let's see what it does first consume 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.450
 all the charge and genetics for 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.459
 inflict extra damage so if you have 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.530
 four charges you want to destroy 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.660
 try the third attack inflicts 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.260
 of extra armini with targets with 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.150
 lowered guard so it comes by itself that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.670
 ace of spades and very useful because 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.290
 reduces the defense and in addition allows no 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.030
 only to do the most damage because of them 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.030
 companies reduced but do more damage because 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.799
 the third with the third attack because it does 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.840
 extra damage you see exploits guard 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.730
 lowered into more critical in italy then 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.340
 that of critical hits 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.150
 inflicts extra damage which is the thing 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.620
 in my opinion amabe gambit amab e 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.580
 real scale we have to see soon 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.879
 the asean nice thing 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.940
 if with the first boron lett we apply three 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:41.650
 charges for example the second round one 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.349
 charge we use to lower the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.030
 defense to an enemy and then we use 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.750
 boron read another time coming to 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.670
 four charges 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.560
 therefore the enemy will be with the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.780
 defense lowered us with four charges 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.549
 the much increased possibility of having 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.019
 to slice a critical hit like 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.280
 see here increases the possibility of 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.140
 inflict a blow that I say charge 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.180
 kinetic and sticking with 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.920
 that character we should take advantage of 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.180
 all three extra damage we go to 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.220
 see the third the fourth attack 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.900
 belcourt attack simply removes 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.459
 all reinforcements from the target so it is 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.290
 great 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.410
 inflicts lowered guard on everyone 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.410
 how many and extra damage with critical hits 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.600
 the damage is not high because in fact 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.190
 we are talking about an area attack but i 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.380
 there are four hits so there is a lot 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.570
 probability of hitting very very high 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.910
 and what about everything is based on this 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.450
 kinetic charge that actually can 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.870
 be activated even by counterattacking 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.220
 as we see in his passive good 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.990
 guys what to say are not there 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.260
 we can't talk about alternative costumes 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.110
 of the price of the various costumes or of 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.390
 what costume to take because in the end it is 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.440
 just a spy costume that among 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.390
 the other is very useful against 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.490
 strategists because he counterattacks with 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.130
 bills that provides kinetic lines 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.100
 the thing I can advise you are 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.460
 iso iso then simply how 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.010
 we see no need to increase vigor 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.810
 because it is very high the health is a 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.800
 a little little being a spy for 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.390
 activate his passive and that is his 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.310
 bonus must be attacked then me 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.980
 I would say to increase the defense a little bit 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.740
 and health because the illusion is a lot 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.860
 very high accuracy even then at 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.110
 maximum I would say health attack illusions 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.480
 but there is health attack defense or health 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.520
 attack and defense or health in defense and in 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.310
 this way you will have a character 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.020
 which can effectively attack and 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.080
 can also counterattack in a manner 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.510
 very effective without being destroyed 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.520
 from the attacks of well-born opponents with 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.120
 that's all next week if 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.810
 things are going as hicks and hopes 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.980
 we will comment on the second season 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.610
 finally and I remind you of 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.530
 eventually follow the channel since 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.000
 as soon as the second season comes out e 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.150
 put yourself on my channel for those who come out 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.120
 I hope the video with everyone instantly 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:12.280
 secrets tricks and if it was in 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:15.010
 English translations on what we do 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.420
 wait for season 2 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.310
 I remind you to put a nice I like to 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.140
 marvel avengers alliance titta that 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.090
 basically the best page of the 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.480
 world especially with regards to 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.880
 this game is very well equipped we have admin 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.930
 really active and competent 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.529
 above all very much as said 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.449
 therefore not active 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.109
 they miss anything from the news and 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:42.109
 especially in this period and what to say 

00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:42.109
 Hello
