absolutely nothing else I could have

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.399 
absolutely nothing else I could have
possibly<00:01:19.530> done<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.350> thought<00:01:22.350> maybe

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
possibly done really so I thought maybe

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.620 
possibly done really so I thought maybe
earthquake<00:01:23.039> my<00:01:23.189> miss<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.210> doesn't<00:01:24.509> happen

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

that way so I got to bring something in
now<00:01:28.350> myself<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.070> let's<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.640> feel

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.530 
so i go to a floatzel and i'm probably
going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.250> assume<00:02:17.580> i<00:02:17.880> mean<00:02:18.120> not<00:02:18.240> probably

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
going to assume i mean not probably

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.520 
going to assume i mean not probably
going<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.750> assume<00:02:18.840> i'm<00:02:18.990> assuming<00:02:19.260> he's

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
going to assume i'm assuming he's

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.080 
going to assume i'm assuming he's
probably<00:02:19.800> gonna<00:02:20.069> switch<00:02:20.430> thinking<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.910> got<00:02:21.060> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
probably gonna switch thinking I got a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.780 
probably gonna switch thinking I got a
nice<00:02:21.330> move<00:02:21.600> which<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.260> good<00:02:22.650> because<00:02:23.250> that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
nice move which is good because that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.660 
nice move which is good because that
gives<00:02:24.120> me<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> nice<00:02:24.480> bulk<00:02:24.780> up<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.670> so

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
gives me a nice bulk up that I like so

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.520 
gives me a nice bulk up that I like so
here<00:02:27.390> I'm<00:02:27.510> either<00:02:27.689> predicting<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> willow

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
here I'm either predicting the willow

retarded<00:03:36.799> I<00:03:37.799> could<00:03:38.609> go<00:03:38.760> with<00:03:38.790> an<00:03:38.970> ice<00:03:39.120> punch<00:03:39.329> or

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
retarded I could go with an ice punch or

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.720 
retarded I could go with an ice punch or
tbell<00:03:39.780> ice<00:03:40.109> punch<00:03:40.380> has<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.799> bulk<00:03:41.430> up<00:03:41.609> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
tbell ice punch has the bulk up the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.400 
tbell ice punch has the bulk up the
t-bolts<00:03:42.120> got<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.359> stab<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.079> more<00:03:43.260> base

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
t-bolts got the stab and the more base

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.800 
t-bolts got the stab and the more base
power<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.070> go<00:03:44.280> with<00:03:44.430> that<00:03:44.609> finishes<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.690> off

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
power so I go with that finishes it off

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.849 
power so I go with that finishes it off
and<00:03:47.209> brings<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.299> wheezing<00:03:48.569> back<00:03:48.720> in<00:03:48.959> this

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
and brings the wheezing back in this

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.479 
and brings the wheezing back in this
time<00:03:50.069> i<00:03:50.100> go<00:03:50.280> for<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.489> t-bolt<00:03:50.819> again<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:53.280> i<00:03:53.310> do

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
time i go for the t-bolt again so i do

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.180 
time i go for the t-bolt again so i do
that<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.359> doesn't<00:03:54.750> fully<00:03:54.959> stroke<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:55.980> it

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
that it doesn't fully stroke it but it

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.220 
that it doesn't fully stroke it but it
strokes<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.640> enough<00:03:56.880> i<00:03:57.030> guess<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.569> that<00:03:57.930> ends

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
strokes it enough i guess and that ends

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.630 
strokes it enough i guess and that ends
my<00:03:58.350> rampage<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:59.010> could<00:03:59.190> have<00:03:59.280> been<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.459> hell

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
my rampage that could have been a hell

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.819

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
all the special defense in the world so

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.440 
all the special defense in the world so
flint<00:04:22.350> or<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.530> won't<00:04:22.650> exactly<00:04:22.979> hurt<00:04:23.340> but<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:23.729> was

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
flint or I won't exactly hurt but I was

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.300 
flint or I won't exactly hurt but I was
mainly<00:04:24.690> just<00:04:24.900> going<00:04:25.139> forth<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.500> wake<00:04:25.650> up<00:04:25.860> that

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
mainly just going forth to wake up that

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.600 
mainly just going forth to wake up that
was<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.520> goal<00:04:27.200> so<00:04:28.200> I<00:04:28.500> also<00:04:29.039> thought<00:04:29.310> he<00:04:29.460> had

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
was the goal so I also thought he had

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.250 
was the goal so I also thought he had
coal<00:04:29.820> mine<00:04:30.090> but<00:04:30.389> I<00:04:30.419> guess<00:04:30.630> he<00:04:30.660> doesn't<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.229> that

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
coal mine but I guess he doesn't so that

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.070 
coal mine but I guess he doesn't so that
hurts<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.830> hurts<00:04:32.160> big<00:04:32.520> time<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:32.940> I'm<00:04:33.750> still

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
hurts that hurts big time and I'm still

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.460 
hurts that hurts big time and I'm still
waiting<00:04:34.350> for<00:04:34.470> him<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.620> wake<00:04:34.800> up<00:04:35.030> getting<00:04:36.030> estás

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.980 
waiting for him to wake up getting estás
I'm<00:04:37.470> still<00:04:37.830> waiting<00:04:38.070> for<00:04:38.100> him<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.310> wake<00:04:38.460> up<00:04:38.990> so

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
I'm still waiting for him to wake up so

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.450 
I'm still waiting for him to wake up so
I<00:04:40.289> don't<00:04:40.409> think<00:04:40.590> that's<00:04:40.830> going<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.070> work<00:04:41.130> out

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
I don't think that's going to work out

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.560 
I don't think that's going to work out
in<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.550> long<00:04:41.610> run<00:04:41.760> otherwise<00:04:42.150> I'm<00:04:42.390> going<00:04:42.479> to

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.020 
in the long run otherwise I'm going to
completely<00:04:42.930> lose<00:04:43.229> my<00:04:43.289> special<00:04:43.800> wall<00:04:44.010> for<00:04:44.310> it

I thought he was kidding he was like I

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.410 
I thought he was kidding he was like I
have<00:05:04.800> no<00:05:04.950> soft<00:05:05.220> boil<00:05:05.520> on<00:05:05.730> this<00:05:05.880> place<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.330> I

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
have no soft boil on this place and I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.790 
have no soft boil on this place and I
was<00:05:06.570> like<00:05:06.690> that's<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.350> know<00:05:07.470> he's<00:05:07.620> just

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
was like that's you know he's just

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.830 
was like that's you know he's just
kidding<00:05:07.950> blah<00:05:08.220> blah<00:05:08.460> so<00:05:08.760> that<00:05:08.910> all<00:05:09.060> you<00:05:09.720> know

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.390 
kidding blah blah so that all you know
assume<00:05:10.170> that<00:05:10.350> he<00:05:10.410> doesn't<00:05:10.620> enough<00:05:10.920> switch<00:05:11.190> and

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
assume that he doesn't enough switch and

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.880 
assume that he doesn't enough switch and
he'll<00:05:11.520> soft<00:05:11.730> boil<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.240> that'll<00:05:12.570> suck<00:05:12.780> but<00:05:13.620> I

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
he'll soft boil and that'll suck but I

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.710 
he'll soft boil and that'll suck but I
eventually<00:05:14.160> was<00:05:14.640> like<00:05:14.850> because<00:05:15.450> there<00:05:15.660> were

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
eventually was like because there were

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.970 
eventually was like because there were
three<00:05:15.960> turns<00:05:16.170> that<00:05:16.410> he<00:05:16.530> should<00:05:16.680> have<00:05:16.800> soft

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
three turns that he should have soft

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.830 
three turns that he should have soft
boiled<00:05:17.280> in<00:05:17.370> my<00:05:17.490> opinion<00:05:17.730> he<00:05:17.970> didn't<00:05:18.270> so<00:05:18.570> I

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
boiled in my opinion he didn't so I

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.020 
boiled in my opinion he didn't so I
should<00:05:19.710> have<00:05:19.800> talented<00:05:20.190> there<00:05:20.430> because<00:05:20.880> I

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
should have talented there because I

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.340 
should have talented there because I
knew<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.270> dragon<00:05:21.600> dance<00:05:21.780> was<00:05:21.960> ever<00:05:22.140> so

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.950 
obvious and I didn't so that really
sucks<00:05:25.260> and<00:05:25.590> that<00:05:25.620> was<00:05:26.580> I<00:05:26.820> mean<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:27.270> gave<00:05:27.930> a
