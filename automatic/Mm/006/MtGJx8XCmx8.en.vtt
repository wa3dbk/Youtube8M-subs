to what he's going to switch in fearing
the<00:01:08.760> hurricane<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.360> he<00:01:09.689> goes<00:01:09.810> into<00:01:10.020> Skarmory

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the hurricane so he goes into Skarmory

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
the hurricane so he goes into Skarmory
and<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> pretty<00:01:11.670> ample<00:01:12.090> opportunity

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and this is a pretty ample opportunity

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.149 
and this is a pretty ample opportunity
for<00:01:12.810> me<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.930> go<00:01:13.260> straight<00:01:13.439> into<00:01:13.590> politoed<00:01:13.979> get

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
for me to go straight into politoed get

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.460 
for me to go straight into politoed get
rain<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> threaten<00:01:16.110> skarmory

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
rain up and also to threaten skarmory

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.350 
rain up and also to threaten skarmory
directly<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.189> am<00:01:17.640> running<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.000> spex

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
directly because I am running a spex

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.210 
directly because I am running a spex
politoed<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.860> doing<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
politoed so it's going to be doing a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.710 
politoed so it's going to be doing a
hell<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.610> lot<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.790> damage<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.330> skarmory

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
hell of a lot of damage in skarmory

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.660 
hell of a lot of damage in skarmory
obviously<00:01:22.200> very<00:01:22.680> physically<00:01:23.130> defensive<00:01:23.580> but

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
obviously very physically defensive but

combat<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.700> now<00:02:24.210> I'm<00:02:24.330> threatening<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
combat and now I'm threatening with the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.260 
combat and now I'm threatening with the
earthquake<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.830> instead<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.520> doing<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.030> go

earthquake so instead of doing that I go

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.460 
earthquake so instead of doing that I go
for<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.420> hidden<00:02:27.570> power<00:02:27.780> rice<00:02:27.990> because

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
for the hidden power rice because

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.620 
for the hidden power rice because
logically<00:02:29.220> speaking<00:02:29.460> he<00:02:29.940> would<00:02:30.060> either<00:02:30.300> go

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
logically speaking he would either go

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.960 
logically speaking he would either go
into<00:02:30.660> skarmory<00:02:31.290> Orin<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.860> flygon<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.700> take<00:02:32.850> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
into skarmory Orin to flygon to take the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.760 
into skarmory Orin to flygon to take the
predicted<00:02:33.360> earthquakes<00:02:33.810> OHP<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.290> seemed<00:02:34.620> like

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
predicted earthquakes OHP I seemed like

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.290 
predicted earthquakes OHP I seemed like
the<00:02:34.890> best<00:02:35.040> thing<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.370> do<00:02:35.490> nice<00:02:36.060> little

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
the best thing to do nice little

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.790 
the best thing to do nice little
coverage<00:02:36.570> move<00:02:36.810> there<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.320> kind<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.530> helps

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
coverage move there and it kind of helps

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.140 
coverage move there and it kind of helps
me<00:02:37.890> out<00:02:37.950> because<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.580> take<00:02:38.640> skarmory

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
me out because I do get to take skarmory

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.760 
me out because I do get to take skarmory
out<00:02:39.270> means<00:02:39.900> he's<00:02:40.050> not<00:02:40.170> going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.350> set<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.560> any

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
out means he's not going to set up any

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.320 
out means he's not going to set up any
more<00:02:40.890> hazards<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.970> know<00:02:42.060> he's<00:02:42.180> not<00:02:42.270> going

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
more hazards and you know he's not going

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.820 
more hazards and you know he's not going
to<00:02:42.450> get<00:02:42.570> another<00:02:42.780> chance<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.200> rooster<00:02:43.650> later

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
to get another chance to rooster later

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.710 
to get another chance to rooster later
on<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.640> thing<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:45.000> kind<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.300> neutralized

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
on so the thing is kind of neutralized

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.560 
on so the thing is kind of neutralized
as<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.080> were<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.800> go<00:02:47.640> into<00:02:47.820> politoed<00:02:48.390> here

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
as it were so I go into politoed here

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.420 
as it were so I go into politoed here
not<00:02:49.110> really<00:02:49.530> knowing<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.040> cresselia

not really knowing what this cresselia

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.740 
not really knowing what this cresselia
wants<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.820> do<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.000> don't<00:02:51.330> know<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.660> going

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
wants to do I don't know if it's going

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.449 
wants to do I don't know if it's going
to<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> nice<00:02:52.110> beaming<00:02:52.500> variant<00:02:52.980> or<00:02:53.220> whether

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
to be a nice beaming variant or whether

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.740 
to be a nice beaming variant or whether
it's<00:02:53.610> going<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.790> try<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:53.970> setup<00:02:54.120> screens<00:02:54.540> or

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
it's going to try to setup screens or

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.780 
it's going to try to setup screens or
whatever<00:02:54.989> politoed<00:02:55.980> seems<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.370> good<00:02:56.640> death

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
whatever politoed seems like good death

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
me with a close combat and perhaps put

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.900

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
shot by the iron bull fling so if you're

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.560 
shot by the iron bull fling so if you're
ever<00:04:47.680> in<00:04:48.160> need<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:48.850> move<00:04:49.090> that's<00:04:49.330> better

ever in need of a move that's better

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.750 
ever in need of a move that's better
than<00:04:49.780> crunch<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.350> you<00:04:50.770> don't<00:04:50.950> really<00:04:51.130> need<00:04:51.400> to

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
than crunch and you don't really need to

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.580 
than crunch and you don't really need to
run<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.030> off<00:04:52.180> for<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.420> long<00:04:52.600> try<00:04:53.110> out<00:04:53.260> iron

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
run it off for that long try out iron

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.740 
run it off for that long try out iron
ball<00:04:53.800> fling<00:04:54.070> its<00:04:54.400> base<00:04:54.670> 130<00:04:55.120> power<00:04:55.450> it's

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
ball fling its base 130 power it's

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.200 
ball fling its base 130 power it's
pretty<00:04:56.020> cool<00:04:56.260> so<00:04:56.680> there<00:04:57.010> you<00:04:57.040> go<00:04:57.130> but<00:04:58.030> at<00:04:58.120> this

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
pretty cool so there you go but at this

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.970 
pretty cool so there you go but at this
point<00:04:58.420> he<00:04:58.720> just<00:04:58.990> has<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.110> rocky<00:04:59.410> on<00:04:59.650> left<00:04:59.830> i

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
point he just has to rocky on left i

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.100 
point he just has to rocky on left i
believe<00:05:00.250> so<00:05:00.460> i<00:05:00.669> can<00:05:01.000> safely<00:05:01.210> go<00:05:01.480> into<00:05:01.690> landris

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
believe so i can safely go into landris

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.250 
believe so i can safely go into landris
kill<00:05:02.919> him<00:05:03.040> with<00:05:03.190> an<00:05:03.310> earthquake<00:05:03.430> because<00:05:04.260> well

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
kill him with an earthquake because well

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.930 
kill him with an earthquake because well
that's<00:05:05.530> what<00:05:05.740> i<00:05:05.770> do<00:05:05.890> and<00:05:06.340> it<00:05:06.550> turns<00:05:06.760> out<00:05:06.880> that

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
that's what i do and it turns out that

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.580 
that's what i do and it turns out that
in<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.360> end<00:05:07.480> he<00:05:07.720> was<00:05:07.870> actually<00:05:08.020> scarfed

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
in the end he was actually scarfed

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.470 
in the end he was actually scarfed
because<00:05:09.040> he<00:05:09.190> asked<00:05:09.370> B's<00:05:09.580> my<00:05:09.760> Landorus<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.419> my

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
because he asked B's my Landorus and my

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.230 
because he asked B's my Landorus and my
landris<00:05:10.840> is<00:05:10.960> scarfed<00:05:11.320> as<00:05:11.410> well<00:05:11.590> so<00:05:12.220> there<00:05:13.120> you

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
landris is scarfed as well so there you

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.500 
landris is scarfed as well so there you
go<00:05:13.270> so<00:05:13.930> what<00:05:14.050> happens<00:05:14.440> uh<00:05:14.710> well<00:05:15.460> sometimes<00:05:16.090> I

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
go so what happens uh well sometimes I

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.560 
go so what happens uh well sometimes I
get<00:05:17.140> out<00:05:17.260> spread<00:05:17.560> by<00:05:18.130> things<00:05:18.850> which<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.360> didn't

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
get out spread by things which I didn't

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.730 
get out spread by things which I didn't
think<00:05:19.690> I<00:05:19.900> would<00:05:19.960> because<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.380> thought<00:05:20.500> he<00:05:20.650> was

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
think I would because I thought he was

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.290 
think I would because I thought he was
banded<00:05:21.160> this<00:05:21.280> whole<00:05:21.430> time<00:05:21.610> I<00:05:21.880> guess<00:05:22.210> I

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
banded this whole time I guess I

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.390 
banded this whole time I guess I
couldn't<00:05:22.540> really<00:05:22.660> tell<00:05:22.930> because<00:05:23.350> well<00:05:23.950> things

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
couldn't really tell because well things

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.580 
couldn't really tell because well things
and<00:05:24.700> such<00:05:24.880> but<00:05:25.210> I<00:05:25.450> guess<00:05:26.020> I<00:05:26.140> should<00:05:26.320> have<00:05:26.410> known

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
and such but I guess I should have known

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.800 
and such but I guess I should have known
oh<00:05:26.890> well<00:05:27.220> whatever<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.970> kill<00:05:28.210> them<00:05:28.360> all<00:05:28.480> corona

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
oh well whatever I kill them all corona

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.450 
oh well whatever I kill them all corona
with<00:05:28.960> an<00:05:29.050> earthquake<00:05:29.440> because<00:05:29.590> of<00:05:29.860> course<00:05:30.070> it

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460

is<00:05:30.820> sound<00:05:31.060> forced<00:05:31.450> boosted<00:05:31.960> and<00:05:32.140> it's<00:05:32.800> going

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
is sound forced boosted and it's going

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.920 
is sound forced boosted and it's going
to<00:05:32.979> clean<00:05:33.160> the<00:05:33.280> guy<00:05:33.400> out<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:34.060> there<00:05:34.780> you<00:05:34.870> go
