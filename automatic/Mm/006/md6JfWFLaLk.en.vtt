same time but in my in my opinion it's
only<00:00:58.710> useful<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.609> very<00:00:59.789> specific

2013<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.759> version<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
2013 this is a this is a version of the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
2013 this is a this is a version of the
surface<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.720> came<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:22.020> before<00:01:22.170> office<00:01:22.890> had

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
surface that came out before office had

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.590 
surface that came out before office had
shipped<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.970> preview<00:01:24.420> version

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
shipped and so it's a preview version

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.690 
shipped and so it's a preview version
but<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.049> seems<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.439> fully<00:01:25.860> functional<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
but it seems to be fully functional and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.880 
but it seems to be fully functional and
I<00:01:27.420> guess<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.259> plan<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.680> they're

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
I guess the the plan is that they're

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.859 
I guess the the plan is that they're
gonna<00:01:28.979> they're<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> push<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
gonna they're going to push out the the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.280 
gonna they're going to push out the the
RTM<00:01:31.350> version<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.040> available<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:33.290> when

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
RTM version when it's available so when

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.380 
RTM version when it's available so when
you<00:01:34.380> start<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.520> office<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> first

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you start up the office for the first

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.210 
you start up the office for the first
time<00:01:36.900> you're<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.590> new<00:01:37.799> start

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
time you're going to see this new start

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069 
time you're going to see this new start
page<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> apps<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
page and all of the apps have it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.990 
page and all of the apps have it
basically<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> side<00:01:41.369> here<00:01:41.729> they're

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
basically on the side here they're

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.940 
basically on the side here they're
showing<00:01:42.329> recent<00:01:42.930> documents<00:01:43.409> you've<00:01:43.530> used

showing recent documents you've used

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.310 
showing recent documents you've used
there's<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.030> an<00:01:45.180> option<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> open<00:01:46.140> other

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.500 
in a little bit of information here
opens<00:03:31.640> just<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.820> can<00:03:32.880> show<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.240> couple

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
opens just so I can show a couple

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.790 
opens just so I can show a couple
features

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.040 

so<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:42.850> you<00:03:42.910> can't<00:03:43.150> see<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.570> one<00:03:43.780> nice<00:03:44.020> thing

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
so if you can't see that one nice thing

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.350 
so if you can't see that one nice thing
too<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.710> can<00:03:44.800> actually<00:03:45.100> again<00:03:45.880> use<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
too is you can actually again use the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.260 
too is you can actually again use the
stretch<00:03:46.720> gesture<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.410> pinch<00:03:47.620> gesture<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.700> to

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
stretch gesture the pinch gesture to to

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.270 
stretch gesture the pinch gesture to to
zoom<00:03:49.570> in<00:03:49.720> on<00:03:49.810> things<00:03:50.080> so<00:03:50.440> I've<00:03:50.650> made<00:03:51.040> this

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
zoom in on things so I've made this

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.340 
zoom in on things so I've made this
bigger<00:03:51.910> here<00:03:52.180> for<00:03:52.390> a<00:03:52.420> second<00:03:52.870> just<00:03:53.050> so<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.230> can

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
bigger here for a second just so you can

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.880 
bigger here for a second just so you can
see<00:03:54.070> so<00:03:54.940> typing<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:55.960> cells<00:03:56.230> nothing<00:03:56.650> special

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
see so typing in cells nothing special

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.220 
see so typing in cells nothing special
there<00:03:57.190> also<00:03:57.640> supports<00:03:58.210> formulas<00:03:58.720> though<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.200> I

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
there also supports formulas though so I

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.750 
there also supports formulas though so I
can<00:03:59.530> do<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.910> times<00:04:01.780> let's<00:04:02.290> say<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.890> wanted<00:04:03.640> it

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
can do that times let's say I wanted it

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.410 
can do that times let's say I wanted it
to<00:04:03.880> be<00:04:04.030> 10%<00:04:04.450> of<00:04:05.020> whatever's<00:04:05.500> in<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.680> field

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
to be 10% of whatever's in that field

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.150 
to be 10% of whatever's in that field
and<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.690> don't<00:04:07.750> think<00:04:07.960> I<00:04:08.200> showed<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:08.680> yet<00:04:08.980> you

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
and I don't think I showed this yet you

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.730 
and I don't think I showed this yet you
can<00:04:09.280> actually<00:04:09.430> tap<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.420> hold<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:11.110> get<00:04:11.560> the

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
can actually tap and hold to get the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.890 
can actually tap and hold to get the
context<00:04:12.250> menu<00:04:12.490> to<00:04:12.520> show<00:04:12.640> up<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.240> then<00:04:13.630> I<00:04:13.690> can

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
context menu to show up and then I can

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.190 
context menu to show up and then I can
pick<00:04:14.080> copy<00:04:15.209> pick<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.390> cell<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.630> want<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.989> go<00:04:17.140> to

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
pick copy pick the cell I want to go to

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.690 
pick copy pick the cell I want to go to
and<00:04:17.530> if<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.650> want<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.860> make<00:04:17.980> it<00:04:18.100> go<00:04:18.130> multiple

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
and if I want to make it go multiple

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.670 
and if I want to make it go multiple
cells<00:04:18.910> these<00:04:19.209> little<00:04:19.540> these<00:04:20.140> little<00:04:20.170> circles

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
cells these little these little circles

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.300 
cells these little these little circles
here<00:04:21.160> allow<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.210> extend<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.530> selection

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
here allow you to extend the selection

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.280 
here allow you to extend the selection
area<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.940> so<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.450> can<00:04:25.630> pick<00:04:25.810> however<00:04:26.140> many

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
area and so I can pick however many

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.010 
area and so I can pick however many
cells<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.710> want<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.920> copy<00:04:27.100> it<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.780> tap<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:28.960> hold

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
cells I want to copy it to tap and hold

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.070 
cells I want to copy it to tap and hold
again<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.740> then<00:04:30.310> hit<00:04:31.180> paste<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:31.840> it's<00:04:31.960> going

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
again and then hit paste and it's going

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.220 
again and then hit paste and it's going
to<00:04:32.140> copy<00:04:32.290> that<00:04:32.530> formula<00:04:32.590> down<00:04:33.660> I'm<00:04:34.660> gonna<00:04:34.840> zoom

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
to copy that formula down I'm gonna zoom

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.650 
to copy that formula down I'm gonna zoom
out<00:04:35.440> or<00:04:35.770> zoom<00:04:35.860> out<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:36.910> little<00:04:37.120> bit<00:04:37.300> just<00:04:37.450> so<00:04:37.510> we

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
out or zoom out a little bit just so we

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.300 
out or zoom out a little bit just so we
have<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.810> little<00:04:37.930> bit<00:04:38.050> more<00:04:38.140> safe<00:04:38.470> surface<00:04:38.950> to

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
have a little bit more safe surface to

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.550 
have a little bit more safe surface to
show<00:04:39.730> and<00:04:40.210> now<00:04:40.810> I'm<00:04:40.930> going<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.140> select<00:04:41.290> the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
show and now I'm going to select the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.480 
show and now I'm going to select the
whole<00:04:41.710> table<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.900> then<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:43.990> can<00:04:44.140> do<00:04:44.320> insert<00:04:45.070> and

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
whole table and then I can do insert and

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.170 
whole table and then I can do insert and
then<00:04:45.910> let's<00:04:46.330> say<00:04:46.480> I<00:04:46.510> want<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.750> do<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.900> line<00:04:47.590> chart

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
then let's say I want to do a line chart

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.790 
then let's say I want to do a line chart
and<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.270> can<00:04:49.300> see<00:04:49.600> it's<00:04:49.810> created<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.500> chart

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
and you can see it's created the chart

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.820 
and you can see it's created the chart
for<00:04:51.040> me<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.520> can<00:04:51.820> now<00:04:51.970> expand<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.290> size<00:04:53.470> of<00:04:53.710> that

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
for me I can now expand the size of that

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.460 
for me I can now expand the size of that
so<00:04:54.100> it<00:04:54.190> fills<00:04:54.400> up<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.640> whole<00:04:54.790> page<00:04:55.470> so

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
so it fills up the whole page so

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.800 
so it fills up the whole page so
everything<00:04:57.250> everything<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:57.910> ever<00:04:57.940> use<00:04:58.390> seems

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
everything everything I ever use seems

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.050 
everything everything I ever use seems
to<00:04:58.960> be<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.320> these<00:04:59.500> apps<00:04:59.770> pivot<00:05:00.430> tables<00:05:00.820> you

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
to be in these apps pivot tables you

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.490 
to be in these apps pivot tables you
name<00:05:01.270> at<00:05:01.510> all<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.810> different<00:05:01.930> formatting

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.620 
name at all the different formatting
options<00:05:03.010> which<00:05:03.280> which<00:05:03.880> is<00:05:04.030> really<00:05:04.360> cool<00:05:04.600> for

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
options which which is really cool for

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.840 
options which which is really cool for
someone<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.140> uses<00:05:05.590> office<00:05:06.190> as<00:05:06.340> much<00:05:06.520> as<00:05:06.670> I<00:05:06.790> do

one difference between the earlier

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.200 
one difference between the earlier
version<00:05:20.800> is<00:05:20.980> that<00:05:21.190> they're<00:05:21.340> not<00:05:21.430> showing<00:05:21.970> the

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
version is that they're not showing the

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.450 
version is that they're not showing the
the<00:05:22.240> ribbon<00:05:22.870> by<00:05:23.200> default<00:05:23.710> but<00:05:24.100> it's<00:05:24.280> still

use this pin icon on the right-hand side

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.150 
use this pin icon on the right-hand side
to<00:05:31.390> make<00:05:31.540> it<00:05:31.690> stay<00:05:32.050> there<00:05:32.410> if<00:05:32.560> you<00:05:32.680> want<00:05:32.890> it<00:05:32.980> to

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
to make it stay there if you want it to

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.580 
to make it stay there if you want it to

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
but I like I like that it goes away if

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.110 
but I like I like that it goes away if
you're<00:05:36.070> finding<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.460> even<00:05:36.520> with<00:05:36.850> this

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
basically will maximize it and it even

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.470 
basically will maximize it and it even
gets<00:05:44.919> rid<00:05:45.100> of<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.250> menus<00:05:45.700> and<00:05:45.910> it<00:05:46.000> just<00:05:46.210> leaves

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
a command prompt well that's also going

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.670 
a command prompt well that's also going
to<00:06:45.650> show<00:06:45.830> up<00:06:45.949> on<00:06:46.130> the<00:06:46.219> desktop<00:06:46.669> so<00:06:47.680> basically

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
32 apps you can only install apps from

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.740 
32 apps you can only install apps from
the<00:07:03.169> Windows<00:07:03.289> Store<00:07:03.979> and<00:07:04.340> so<00:07:05.000> there's<00:07:05.419> a<00:07:05.479> bunch

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
the Windows Store and so there's a bunch

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.300 
the Windows Store and so there's a bunch
of<00:07:05.900> utilities<00:07:06.440> that<00:07:06.469> are<00:07:06.650> built<00:07:06.919> into<00:07:07.219> the

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
of utilities that are built into the

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.459 
of utilities that are built into the
operating<00:07:07.610> system<00:07:07.759> there's<00:07:08.449> the<00:07:08.719> office<00:07:09.020> apps

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
operating system there's the office apps

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.589 
operating system there's the office apps
but<00:07:10.130> you<00:07:10.279> can't<00:07:10.550> actually<00:07:10.819> install<00:07:11.150> any<00:07:11.569> other

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 
but you can't actually install any other

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:13.600 
but you can't actually install any other
every<00:07:12.469> other<00:07:12.590> app<00:07:12.830> you<00:07:12.979> install<00:07:13.340> from<00:07:13.550> the

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
every other app you install from the

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.309 
every other app you install from the
Microsoft<00:07:14.120> Store<00:07:14.360> is<00:07:14.509> going<00:07:14.659> to<00:07:14.719> be<00:07:14.840> a<00:07:14.870> modern

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 
Microsoft Store is going to be a modern

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:17.589 
Microsoft Store is going to be a modern
app<00:07:15.469> but<00:07:16.279> when<00:07:16.400> the<00:07:16.490> pro<00:07:16.699> version<00:07:16.729> comes<00:07:17.330> out<00:07:17.539> I

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 
app but when the pro version comes out I

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:20.019 
app but when the pro version comes out I
believe<00:07:17.810> that<00:07:18.169> restriction<00:07:18.650> is<00:07:19.069> lifted<00:07:19.610> it's

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:20.029 
believe that restriction is lifted it's

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:21.219 
believe that restriction is lifted it's
going<00:07:20.210> to<00:07:20.270> be<00:07:20.360> running<00:07:20.569> on<00:07:20.750> an<00:07:20.900> Intel

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:21.229 
going to be running on an Intel

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:23.019 
going to be running on an Intel
processor<00:07:21.440> and<00:07:22.099> so<00:07:22.219> you<00:07:22.310> can<00:07:22.460> run<00:07:22.639> pretty<00:07:22.940> much

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:23.029 
processor and so you can run pretty much

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:25.450 
processor and so you can run pretty much
anything<00:07:23.389> you<00:07:23.539> want<00:07:24.130> but<00:07:25.130> you<00:07:25.219> can<00:07:25.340> switch

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
anything you want but you can switch

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.370 
anything you want but you can switch
back<00:07:25.699> and<00:07:25.759> forth<00:07:25.969> you<00:07:26.419> can<00:07:26.569> either<00:07:27.020> use<00:07:27.229> the

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380 
back and forth you can either use the

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.809 
back and forth you can either use the
Windows<00:07:27.680> key<00:07:27.860> to<00:07:27.979> go<00:07:28.069> back<00:07:28.099> and<00:07:28.400> forth<00:07:28.639> between

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:28.819 
Windows key to go back and forth between

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:31.029 
Windows key to go back and forth between
them<00:07:29.240> there's<00:07:29.719> the<00:07:29.900> desktop<00:07:30.319> icon<00:07:30.560> that<00:07:30.979> you

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 
them there's the desktop icon that you

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.070 
them there's the desktop icon that you
can<00:07:31.099> take<00:07:31.340> a<00:07:31.370> look<00:07:31.669> copy<00:07:32.240> and<00:07:32.389> paste<00:07:32.750> works

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 
can take a look copy and paste works

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.890 
can take a look copy and paste works
between<00:07:33.380> the<00:07:34.009> different<00:07:34.430> versions<00:07:34.849> but<00:07:35.750> it's

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 
between the different versions but it's

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.510 
between the different versions but it's
something<00:07:36.139> that<00:07:36.259> might<00:07:36.440> just<00:07:37.069> sort<00:07:37.219> of<00:07:37.279> throw

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 
something that might just sort of throw

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.219 
something that might just sort of throw
you<00:07:37.580> for<00:07:37.880> a<00:07:37.909> little<00:07:38.029> bit<00:07:38.120> of<00:07:38.300> a<00:07:38.389> loop<00:07:38.900> when<00:07:39.110> you

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:39.229 
you for a little bit of a loop when you

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:41.649 
you for a little bit of a loop when you
first<00:07:39.620> take<00:07:39.919> a<00:07:39.949> look<00:07:40.159> at<00:07:40.370> it<00:07:40.550> for<00:07:41.389> me<00:07:41.449> as

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:41.659 
first take a look at it for me as

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:43.689 
first take a look at it for me as
someone<00:07:41.900> who's<00:07:42.020> into<00:07:42.349> technology<00:07:42.979> it<00:07:43.310> shows

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:43.699 
someone who's into technology it shows

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:45.430 
someone who's into technology it shows
me<00:07:43.940> a<00:07:43.969> whole<00:07:44.180> bunch<00:07:44.360> of<00:07:44.419> possibilities<00:07:44.630> this

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 
me a whole bunch of possibilities this

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.890 
me a whole bunch of possibilities this
this<00:07:46.190> is<00:07:46.310> sort<00:07:46.490> of<00:07:46.550> cool<00:07:46.819> that<00:07:47.090> it<00:07:47.210> can<00:07:47.360> it<00:07:47.840> can

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:47.900 
this is sort of cool that it can it can

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.240 
this is sort of cool that it can it can
run<00:07:48.169> all<00:07:48.319> these<00:07:48.440> different<00:07:48.770> apps<00:07:48.919> and<00:07:49.159> it

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.250 
run all these different apps and it

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.070 
run all these different apps and it
still<00:07:49.460> gives<00:07:49.699> me<00:07:49.819> some<00:07:50.090> of<00:07:50.180> those<00:07:50.300> those

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 
still gives me some of those those

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.080 
still gives me some of those those
features<00:07:51.590> that<00:07:51.800> I<00:07:51.860> like<00:07:52.219> on<00:07:52.460> the<00:07:52.580> desktop

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.090 
features that I like on the desktop

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.390 
features that I like on the desktop
especially<00:07:53.779> this<00:07:53.930> docking<00:07:54.469> application<00:07:55.130> side

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 
especially this docking application side

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.640 
especially this docking application side
by<00:07:55.610> side<00:07:55.960> that<00:07:56.960> is<00:07:57.110> something<00:07:57.469> that<00:07:57.620> I

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:57.650 
by side that is something that I

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.399 
by side that is something that I
actually<00:07:57.830> I<00:07:58.279> use<00:07:59.000> a<00:07:59.029> little<00:07:59.360> bit<00:07:59.479> still<00:07:59.810> and

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:00.409 
actually I use a little bit still and

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:01.990 
actually I use a little bit still and
like<00:08:00.740> I<00:08:00.830> said<00:08:00.889> there<00:08:01.279> is<00:08:01.400> something<00:08:01.610> similar

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 
like I said there is something similar

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.969 
like I said there is something similar
on<00:08:02.330> modern<00:08:02.870> apps<00:08:03.020> but<00:08:03.349> I'll<00:08:03.560> save<00:08:03.770> that<00:08:03.800> for

00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:03.979 
on modern apps but I'll save that for

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:07.930 
on modern apps but I'll save that for
the<00:08:04.190> next<00:08:04.250> video<00:08:04.639> so<00:08:05.089> stay<00:08:05.479> tuned
