00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 on our test track today 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.970
 we change the asphalt for the snow because 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.000
 this is the best way to test the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.269
 New toyota rav4 2014 with traction 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.269
 total 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.130
 contemporary sports design and 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.170
 sophisticated so can be defined 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.830
 externally the new generation of 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.830
 rap 4 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.600
 as you see the toyota rav4 has nothing 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.220
 what to do with the previous generations 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.260
 and is that Toyota has been careful because 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.730
 It is nothing less than two decades 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.770
 changes are evident both in the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.050
 frontal as in the rear incorporates 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.040
 also 18-inch wheels and 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.040
 darkened crystals 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.109
 exclusive details of pack 20 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.059
 anniversary that equips more headlights for 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.630
 xenon and trunk with opening and closing 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 electric 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.680
 but what has changed the most 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.410
 toyota engineers has been part 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.480
 back seen from that perspective the 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.020
 rack 4 looks like a new model of the 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.020
 Japanese brand 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.320
 inside it is much more versatile 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.760
 thanks to a cabin and a trunk with 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.770
 greater space with numerous 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.770
 compartments for storing objects 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.330
 but the great novelty is found in 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.030
 the arrival of the total attraction to a 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.710
 tremendously affordable price since 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.710
 part of the 27 thousand euros 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.530
 the version we are testing is a 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.660
 120 horses integrated as we say 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.800
 with all-wheel drive and see how it responds 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.800
 the best snow test 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.910
 no no 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.010
 this integrated driving system 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.440
 maximizes the attraction on any 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.390
 type of surface guarantees an advance 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.849
 Soft stable and controllable with 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.849
 independence of conditions 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.849
 climatological 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.030
 to 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.090
 also has the driving mode 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.099
 sport that makes you push 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.260
 consistent and that allows you to do it from 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.950
 safely avoiding any slip 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.950
 unexpected 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.720
 next to the steering rod 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.230
 we found a button that allows 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.120
 block the deal for 50% that 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.610
 yes as long as we circulate to a 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.610
 speed less than 40 kilometers hours 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.730
 i 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.590
 how do you see the total attraction of this rap 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.629
 4 works like a charm and 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.549
 Although that is a traction to the 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.250
 four wheels presumes you have some 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.760
 Consumptions contained 5.2 liters at 100 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.760
 km
