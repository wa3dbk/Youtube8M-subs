00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.990 
think that will help America's I think
that<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.200> will<00:01:32.290> educate<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:32.920> Americans<00:01:33.370> to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
that it will educate the Americans to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.140 
that it will educate the Americans to
what<00:01:34.210> goes<00:01:34.360> on<00:01:34.540> here<00:01:34.840> in<00:01:35.050> on<00:01:35.230> Cuba<00:01:35.620> and<00:01:36.070> on<00:01:36.970> the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
what goes on here in on Cuba and on the

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.500 
what goes on here in on Cuba and on the
island<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.990> think<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.530> people<00:01:39.250> will<00:01:39.520> will

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510

island and I think that people will will
learn<00:01:40.660> a<00:01:40.690> lot<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.170> it<00:01:41.560> would<00:01:41.710> be<00:01:41.830> beneficial

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
learn a lot and it would be beneficial

are<00:01:59.110> incredible<00:01:59.700> architecture<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.970> history

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
are incredible architecture the history

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.680 
are incredible architecture the history
and<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.540> think<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.140> embargo<00:02:03.970> is<00:02:04.970> only

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
and I think that the embargo is only

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.200 
and I think that the embargo is only
hurting<00:02:06.050> our<00:02:06.620> country<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.520> country<00:02:08.000> and

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
hurting our country and this country and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.860 
hurting our country and this country and
I<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.840> benefits<00:02:09.320> are<00:02:10.330> grand<00:02:11.330> for

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
I think that the benefits are grand for

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.600 
I think that the benefits are grand for
