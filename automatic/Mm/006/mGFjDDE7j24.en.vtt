wrap the tie around around at the back

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.149 
wrap the tie around around at the back
through<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.119> top

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.370 

through<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.970> top<00:01:28.180> again<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.990> across<00:01:31.990> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
through the top again and across the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.940 
through the top again and across the
front<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.240> have<00:01:34.420> your<00:01:34.509> basic<00:01:34.950> Windsor

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
front now you have your basic Windsor

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.940 
front now you have your basic Windsor
knot<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:38.110> half<00:01:38.380> windsor<00:01:38.650> knot<00:01:38.860> rather<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.380> this

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
knot or half windsor knot rather so this

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.680 
knot or half windsor knot rather so this
is<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.490> basis<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.149> where<00:01:43.360> you're<00:01:43.509> going<00:01:43.540> to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
is the basis of where you're going to

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.910 
is the basis of where you're going to
start<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:46.299> go<00:01:46.479> across<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:47.259> go<00:01:47.380> through<00:01:47.740> it

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
start you go across you go through it

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.060 
start you go across you go through it
across<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.759> go<00:01:48.909> through<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.390> top<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:50.740> your

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
across you go through the top with your

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.370 
across you go through the top with your
tie<00:01:51.340> now<00:01:51.909> with<00:01:52.119> with<00:01:52.479> if<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.869> were<00:01:52.990> if<00:01:53.140> we<00:01:53.170> were

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
tie now with with if it were if we were

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.410 
tie now with with if it were if we were
to<00:01:53.590> just<00:01:53.680> tie<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> regular<00:01:54.159> half<00:01:54.460> windsor<00:01:54.670> we

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
to just tie a regular half windsor we

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.550 
to just tie a regular half windsor we
would<00:01:55.539> go<00:01:55.690> through<00:01:56.759> here

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
would go through here

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.540 
would go through here
but<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.600> Dad<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.409> would<00:02:02.530> be<00:02:02.619> done<00:02:02.800> at<00:02:03.429> the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
but and Dad that would be done at the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.130 
but and Dad that would be done at the
end<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.789> it<00:02:03.880> but<00:02:04.270> what<00:02:04.450> we're<00:02:04.539> going<00:02:04.569> to<00:02:04.690> do<00:02:04.869> is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
end of it but what we're going to do is

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.779 
end of it but what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:05.350> going<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.500> go<00:02:05.679> through<00:02:06.280> here<00:02:08.459> twist<00:02:09.459> the

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
we're going to go through here twist the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.150 
we're going to go through here twist the
tie<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:11.500> go<00:02:11.709> up<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:14.319> big<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.739> nice<00:02:15.130> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
tie and go up the big this nice and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.300 
tie and go up the big this nice and
tight<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.569> leave<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.930> good<00:02:17.050> space<00:02:17.650> give<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.069> good

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
tight and leave a good space give a good

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.030 
tight and leave a good space give a good
leave<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> good<00:02:18.910> loop<00:02:19.090> for<00:02:19.299> here<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.890> we're

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
leave a good loop for here so we're

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:30.530 
leave a good loop for here so we're
going<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.250> twist<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.120> tie<00:02:23.760> go<00:02:24.760> up<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:27.160> around

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.050 

and<00:02:31.829> thus<00:02:32.829> you<00:02:33.010> have<00:02:33.160> your<00:02:33.280> basis<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.820> yours

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and thus you have your basis of yours

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.840 
and thus you have your basis of yours
you<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.480> start<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.079> your<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.640> your<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
you of the start of your for your the

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.650 
you of the start of your for your the
start<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.239> four<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.920> four<00:02:39.130> pieces<00:02:39.660> now

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660

up<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:30.480> there<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.530> go

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
up so there you go

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.610 
up so there you go
ah<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:33.450> could<00:03:33.599> adjust<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.319> it's<00:03:34.560> more

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
ah you could adjust it so that it's more

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.339 
ah you could adjust it so that it's more
of<00:03:35.299> more<00:03:36.769> symmetrical<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.110> shows<00:03:40.290> a

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
of more symmetrical so that it shows a

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.539 
of more symmetrical so that it shows a
property<00:03:41.090> but<00:03:42.090> essentially<00:03:43.250> there<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.400> go

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
property but essentially there you go

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.030 
property but essentially there you go
you've<00:03:45.540> got<00:03:45.810> yourself<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:47.160> true<00:03:47.400> love<00:03:47.640> not
