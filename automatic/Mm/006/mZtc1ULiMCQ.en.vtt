00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.720
 good people belezinha then this video that I'll show you with the 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.479
 that we do it to the peak and of a southern beggar of the cold and his adviser 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.859
 Remembering that 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.060
 this term is 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.069
 What is known about this benefit we have now 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:33.280
 separated from pedestrians being covered and textile marques left after 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.820
 we 3 people once 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.680
 took him from the arrest of baghdadi 3 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.729
 x 2 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.669
 no matter if it is 60 to 120 of 140 points can expect 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.370
 then accessing the sema website offers two types of 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.930
 on brent's day and two options right? 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.520
 through the pipe pcs 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.880
 by windows 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.480
 I think it's awful 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.469
 really 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.230
 a lot of people had trouble 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.330
 and the remix, at least we'll need the world a pen drive 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.030
 We're going to do a formatting of the team, it gets revolted. 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.990
 and he will and we will will have one will put the image of the world beautiful and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.250
 also from uol 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.410
 from the program 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.789
 delphin printing 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.990
 due to a request from the son and his adviser 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.310
 so the two programs to those there that look like in the folder 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.670
 It's sbt's for formatting. 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.040
 the clean place and without it in another image of the program 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.170
 of the programmed 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.870
 which leaves an advisor 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.870
 So I advise everyone to do the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 you can already I'll show you in the museum of the unconscious 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.830
 is arrested accused of 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.900
 and that's how you do not need to put another 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.280
 hd and another area to carry the inho to your you can do and the attendant nÃ© 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.620
 by the elderly that when you do it yesterday 10 through windows you can not 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.800
 do pdt 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.450
 in ccbb-sp things or the course windows vista 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.720
 the loaded housekeeper 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.100
 in them, right? 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.590
 so I need it this way and it had its way out to anyone who uses a notebook and sc 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.939
 I fear that this more correct way 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.939
 then it will be tested stone as said put pedro aznar 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:15.999
 no accident 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.319
 at first we look like the kibon here 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.739
 it's not that we're going to do formatting 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.729
 ef 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.729
 the fall left the plenary 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.019
 this puts the foot in the team 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.499
 I'm going to go pro 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.709
 Ala, just run 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.860
 I will accept 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.929
 no problems 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.929
 and then you choose the last option 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.069
 does not have this last option 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.979
 right put team option 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.189
 then you will choose the image that you 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.889
 in the one filed above you can let these two files europe download 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.399
 and from them the download link in the decision 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.989
 this chose 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.189
 selected 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.999
 Our team is exempt. 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.999
 there and clicked there 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.519
 had no box cocaine 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:16.859
 it's over 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.209
 just passing by is a task that was done wondering beauty by 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.559
 neighborhoods will format 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.529
 It has to be a pen drive that will be 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.669
 silver medal with the criminal mark then 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.429
 files 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.889
 important for you, right? 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.889
 so it's going to format that it will take a little bit 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.809
 while we're going 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.489
 having a chat 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.609
 How's family? 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.939
 and then if they are not 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.299
 the next years of you 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.039
 claiming that anyone who has used it on the network 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.749
 the abuses 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.749
 here is the list of absences that I told my father too 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.489
 no problem 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.570
 or to do normally it will already do or 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.179
 which leaves both 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.939
 in two of them in several 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.699
 need not do a management 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.319
 this is a myth at least not 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.119
 in these you are seeming until you are until these but have been obtained 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.900
 the agent has only 3 to 1 and returns from 13 and a 3x2 revolver does not need 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:27.610
 there it's over 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.050
 now just boot the boot is not 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.050
 configured and used for you gives a boat through 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.949
 by pen drive 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.569
 this you do not 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.330
 on Saturday you will have it on bios nÃ© 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
 It was not even for you, you're trying to score the goal. 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.780
 he was stoned to death by his cousin 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.389
 to abandon 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.770
 and ask someone more competent to do 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 Good, we already were in the butiquim 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.629
 today the selection enters the boot by the pen drive 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.639
 so he is going to load 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.409
 program that we put 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.220
 the linen that is programmed 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.499
 I can not say 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.960
 if you can see that it has two aces in raid 0 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.960
 keeping this in mind 3 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.539
 let's go 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.139
 thanks for the screen presence 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.860
 by the company and select the first option there 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.899
 do not be scared the moviegoers are born maltaca reigning 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.990
 you can rest easy to be done more 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.699
 but figure of you do 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.900
 do a lot of museums 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.889
 and it's not just here 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.889
 from what is understood what I want is more mobile of the state teresina 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.129
 but the program he will always put the movie himself 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.249
 there she 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:55.400
 the first to be appreciated bahia 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.139
 go of the key turkey 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.259
 through the Internet 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.800
 anyone who wants to configure something and has the option to configure 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.719
 for the reason I was here configure it hi-fi something too 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:07.499
 around 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:10.499
 in my case can not configure anything because I did not move apartment 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.520
 is set up with my provider huck username and password 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.529
 so there is no secret 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.379
 insomnia united molik 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:25.830
 access 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.819
 the attendant 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:31.839
 Are you going to stay there? 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.159
 of all flights 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.159
 the ssds you get plugged into the machine 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.509
 Where are you going to India? 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.580
 do not need to train and I'm happy 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.010
 my contract is with the firmware with 2 points 3 then I will sin 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:49.909
 and it will not do any good if it's going to show you how to make them one more 

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:53.639
 you will contact two-point three members simply will not 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.490
 do the upgrade 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.090
 but in the case of those who have a child read below 2 points 13 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.779
 he will normally do 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:03.229
 this cd room 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:05.610
 already has two points there 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.279
 remembering that they are in the network 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:10.489
 the scp and two attack with two points they also want to come back armed 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:17.429
 I went to anyone who had two counsels or some other 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:22.729
 he would appear for two by 3 to 0 but it would be his turn aside goodbye 

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:26.999
 set the goal again its low then put it back 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.110
 take the pen drive you put on the nightclub 

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:33.460
 and it was already late there 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.479
 in that same 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:36.869
 without despair 

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:40.009
 without difficulty 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:42.669
 no more does it think it does not have it right 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:47.120
 and I know that you feel that it ends in March before the same month of the segment 

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.719
 And I know if I avoid any 

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:50.210
 because god belongs 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.210
 this month the true feather that you will be able to use 

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:57.479
 several other times other people and everything else 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.889
 Good, and I know I am. 

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:03.160
 as everyone else is updating the advisor firmware to avoid any 

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:04.360
 problem 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.030
 already passed by everyone there was
