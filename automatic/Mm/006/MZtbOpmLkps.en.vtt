00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
about how difficult it is just to turn

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.620 
about how difficult it is just to turn
or<00:00:28.980> make<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> vehicle<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.970> drive<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
or make a vehicle that can drive and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.310 
or make a vehicle that can drive and
they're<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.650> difficult<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> at

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
they're really not that difficult so at

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.260 
they're really not that difficult so at
the<00:00:34.440> base<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> car<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.149> go

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the base you just have a car I can go

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.260 
the base you just have a car I can go
forwards<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.079> backwards<00:00:37.760> no<00:00:38.760> turning

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
forwards and backwards no turning

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.110 
forwards and backwards no turning
involved<00:00:39.750> even<00:00:40.140> though<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:41.670> want<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> turn

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
involved even though you want to turn

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.650 
involved even though you want to turn
though<00:00:43.070> what<00:00:44.070> I've<00:00:44.250> seen<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> lot<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.120> people<00:00:45.510> do

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
though what I've seen a lot of people do

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.229 
though what I've seen a lot of people do
is<00:00:46.079> they<00:00:46.140> fall<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.160> steering<00:00:47.760> hinge

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
is they fall for this steering hinge

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.630 
is they fall for this steering hinge
part<00:00:48.800> controls<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:49.950> left<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.460> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
part controls with left or right that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520 
part controls with left or right that
seems<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.539> should<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.899> able<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.140> turn<00:00:52.320> with

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
seems like I should be able to turn with

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
seems like I should be able to turn with
that<00:00:53.000> makes<00:00:54.000> sense

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that makes sense

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.250 
that makes sense
what<00:00:54.930> wheels<00:00:55.170> back<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.050> end<00:00:58.199> up

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
what wheels back on and what you end up

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.899 
what wheels back on and what you end up
getting<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.910> kind<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.239> action<00:01:03.379> which

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
getting is this kind of action which

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.740 
getting is this kind of action which
it's<00:01:05.909> not<00:01:06.680> very<00:01:07.680> Drive<00:01:08.159> II

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.930 

I<00:01:10.780> mean<00:01:11.380> I<00:01:11.590> might<00:01:11.740> get<00:01:11.830> a<00:01:11.890> little<00:01:11.980> better<00:01:12.640> if

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
I mean I might get a little better if

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.730 
I mean I might get a little better if
you<00:01:14.310> introduce<00:01:15.310> four-wheel<00:01:16.210> steering<00:01:19.740> might

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
you introduce four-wheel steering might

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.910 
you introduce four-wheel steering might
have<00:01:20.980> to<00:01:21.250> do<00:01:21.760> some<00:01:21.940> flipping<00:01:22.330> here<00:01:22.650> ya<00:01:23.650> know

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
have to do some flipping here ya know

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:33.540 
have to do some flipping here ya know
got<00:01:24.550> a<00:01:24.580> flip<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:31.420> flip<00:01:32.280> why<00:01:33.280> is<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.460> out

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
got a flip just flip why is it out

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:43.740 
got a flip just flip why is it out
flipping<00:01:35.100> rotate<00:01:37.230> no<00:01:38.230> maybe

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.109 

there<00:01:44.350> we<00:01:44.410> go

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
there we go

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.850 
there we go
now<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:48.220> should<00:01:48.369> have<00:01:48.460> proper<00:01:48.700> full<00:01:49.180> wheel<00:01:49.860> for

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
now we should have proper full wheel for

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.270 
now we should have proper full wheel for
a<00:01:50.890> little<00:01:51.070> Drive<00:01:51.280> steering<00:01:52.320> maybe<00:01:53.320> then<00:01:53.530> it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
a little Drive steering maybe then it

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.569 
a little Drive steering maybe then it
doesn't<00:01:54.640> poopsie<00:01:55.509> run<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.079> problem

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
doesn't poopsie run to that problem

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:04.520 
doesn't poopsie run to that problem
doesn't<00:01:57.579> work<00:01:57.729> great<00:01:59.310> she's<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.340> lot<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.909> play

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.469 

slides<00:02:05.530> around<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.070> lot<00:02:08.519> doesn't<00:02:09.519> turn<00:02:10.330> all

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
slides around a lot doesn't turn all

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.110 
slides around a lot doesn't turn all
that<00:02:10.599> wonderfully<00:02:11.430> that's<00:02:12.430> because<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:13.000> my

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
that wonderfully that's because in my

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.839 
that wonderfully that's because in my
opinion<00:02:13.239> that<00:02:14.110> steering<00:02:14.500> hinge<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:15.610> not

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
opinion that steering hinge it's not

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.380 
opinion that steering hinge it's not
meant<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.709> normal<00:02:17.709> car<00:02:17.980> steering<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:20.140> is

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
meant for normal car steering it is

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:33.900 
meant for normal car steering it is
meant<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:23.489> work<00:02:24.489> as<00:02:27.569> if<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.780> had<00:02:29.700> two<00:02:30.700> cars<00:02:32.910> so

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
meant to work as if you had two cars so

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.710 
meant to work as if you had two cars so
I'm<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.150> gonna<00:02:34.239> get<00:02:34.450> lazy<00:02:34.630> here<00:02:34.959> just

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
I'm just gonna get lazy here just

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.059 
I'm just gonna get lazy here just
pretend<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.989> whole<00:02:38.170> nother<00:02:38.530> car<00:02:38.890> back

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
pretend this is a whole nother car back

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:46.020 
pretend this is a whole nother car back
here<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:41.920> we<00:02:41.980> go<00:02:42.660> now<00:02:43.660> we've<00:02:43.930> got<00:02:45.030> steering

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
here there we go now we've got steering

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.180 
here there we go now we've got steering
the<00:02:46.959> way<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.380> hinge<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.769> supposed<00:02:48.069> to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
the way that this hinge is supposed to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.680 
the way that this hinge is supposed to
work<00:02:51.810> okay<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.019> still<00:02:53.859> that's<00:02:54.190> not<00:02:54.430> great

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
work okay but still that's not great

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.930 
work okay but still that's not great
kind<00:02:55.690> of<00:02:55.810> sucks<00:02:56.019> actually

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
kind of sucks actually

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.060 
kind of sucks actually
so<00:02:57.940> what<00:02:58.120> they<00:02:58.269> did<00:02:58.329> is<00:02:59.170> from<00:02:59.920> what<00:03:00.040> I

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
so what they did is from what I

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.890 
so what they did is from what I
understand<00:03:00.459> fairly<00:03:00.760> recently<00:03:01.060> out<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.480> this

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
understand fairly recently out of this

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.530 
understand fairly recently out of this
steering<00:03:02.500> block<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:06.130> gotta<00:03:06.280> flip<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:06.760> so

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
steering block and you gotta flip it so

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.900 
steering block and you gotta flip it so
it<00:03:07.660> works<00:03:07.780> logically<00:03:08.290> left<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.769> right<00:03:08.950> that's

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
it works logically left and right that's

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.729 
it works logically left and right that's
why<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.090> turn<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.450> car<00:03:10.690> left<00:03:10.930> turns<00:03:11.290> left

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
why I turn a car left turns left

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.900 
why I turn a car left turns left
when<00:03:11.859> I<00:03:11.890> press<00:03:12.040> right<00:03:12.250> trans<00:03:12.459> right<00:03:12.670> otherwise

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
when I press right trans right otherwise

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.140 
when I press right trans right otherwise
it<00:03:13.239> turns<00:03:13.690> reverse

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
it turns reverse

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.360 
it turns reverse
but<00:03:15.299> even<00:03:15.510> then<00:03:15.659> not<00:03:16.409> great<00:03:18.950> very<00:03:19.950> annoying<00:03:20.310> to

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
but even then not great very annoying to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.800 
but even then not great very annoying to
turn<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:21.110> end<00:03:22.110> up<00:03:22.319> doing<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.280> lot<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:23.810> you

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
turn I end up doing a lot of this you

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.690 
turn I end up doing a lot of this you
know<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:25.140> 50<00:03:25.980> point<00:03:26.189> turn<00:03:26.689> just<00:03:27.689> to<00:03:27.840> make<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:27.989> left

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
know a 50 point turn just to make a left

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.339 
know a 50 point turn just to make a left
and<00:03:29.700> even<00:03:29.909> if<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.269> put<00:03:30.299> one<00:03:30.629> to<00:03:30.689> the<00:03:30.780> rear<00:03:30.959> and

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
and even if you put one to the rear and

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.229 
and even if you put one to the rear and
double<00:03:31.650> their<00:03:31.739> speed<00:03:32.069> it's<00:03:32.430> still<00:03:32.640> not<00:03:32.760> great

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
double their speed it's still not great

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.179 
double their speed it's still not great
I<00:03:34.340> find<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.489> simplest<00:03:35.879> solution<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.750> best

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.189 
I find the simplest solution is the best

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:42.170 
I find the simplest solution is the best
in<00:03:38.189> this<00:03:38.400> case<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.480> tank<00:03:40.079> steering<00:03:41.180> giving

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
in this case it is tank steering giving

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.970 
in this case it is tank steering giving
yourself<00:03:42.599> independent<00:03:43.379> control<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:45.980> left

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
yourself independent control of the left

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.449 
yourself independent control of the left
wheels<00:03:47.310> on<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.459> right<00:03:47.609> wheels<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.329> now<00:03:49.430> when<00:03:50.430> I

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
wheels on the right wheels so now when I

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.550 
wheels on the right wheels so now when I
held<00:03:50.639> down<00:03:50.819> for<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:51.239> back<00:03:51.420> just<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.260> left

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
held down for the back just the left

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.979 
held down for the back just the left
side<00:03:52.799> goes<00:03:53.129> why<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.700> hold<00:03:53.909> left<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.540> right<00:03:54.720> just

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
side goes why I hold left and right just

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.410 
side goes why I hold left and right just
