brand right here and the center button

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.099 
brand right here and the center button
is<00:00:23.160> replaced<00:00:23.580> by<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> Petri<00:00:24.300> word<00:00:24.539> instead<00:00:25.050> of

the buttons as well as the analog

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.770 
the buttons as well as the analog
joysticks<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.160> pretty<00:00:35.940> much<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.300> same<00:00:36.540> as

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
joysticks here pretty much the same as

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.709 
joysticks here pretty much the same as
the<00:00:37.020> official<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.540> take

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the official one so you have to take

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.229 
the official one so you have to take
note<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.410> controller<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:42.059> right

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
note if this controller is just right

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.910 
note if this controller is just right
out<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> box<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.530> never

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
out of the box and you have never

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.170 
out of the box and you have never
connected<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.800> ps3<00:00:46.800> console<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:48.000> need

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
connected to your ps3 console you need

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.380 
connected to your ps3 console you need
to<00:00:48.300> synchronize<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.500> usage<00:00:50.120> for<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> very

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
to synchronize it for usage for the very

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.479 
to synchronize it for usage for the very
first<00:00:51.570> time<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.649> order<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> it's

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
first time and in order to that it's

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.000 
first time and in order to that it's
actually<00:00:53.879> quite<00:00:54.000> simple<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.960> take<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.500> USB
