here<00:02:58.960> that<00:02:59.080> bike<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:01.420> got<00:03:01.510> some<00:03:01.750> problems

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
here that bike it's got some problems

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.880 
here that bike it's got some problems
that's<00:03:03.370> probably<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:04.000> jetting<00:03:04.570> issue

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.350 

and<00:03:08.270> that's<00:03:09.270> partly<00:03:09.720> why<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:11.130> can't<00:03:11.430> get<00:03:11.760> up

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
and that's partly why you can't get up

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.450 
and that's partly why you can't get up
some<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.930> stuff<00:03:13.200> he's<00:03:13.440> trying<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.100> do<00:03:14.280> and

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
some of the stuff he's trying to do and

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.020 
some of the stuff he's trying to do and
the<00:03:14.520> bike<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:15.060> won't<00:03:15.330> behave<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the bike just won't behave and so I

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.280 
the bike just won't behave and so I
don't<00:03:18.330> know<00:03:18.420> he's<00:03:18.600> gonna<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.020> get<00:03:19.140> that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
don't know he's gonna have to get that

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.910 
don't know he's gonna have to get that
you<00:03:19.530> know<00:03:19.980> problem<00:03:20.790> solved<00:03:21.500> but<00:03:22.500> anyway<00:03:22.740> there

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
you know problem solved but anyway there

you know problem solved but anyway there
I<00:03:22.950> am<00:03:23.190> pulling<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.550> front<00:03:23.670> tire<00:03:23.970> helping<00:03:24.450> it

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
I am pulling the front tire helping it

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.960 
I am pulling the front tire helping it
out<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:26.060> where<00:03:27.060> are<00:03:27.360> we<00:03:27.600> now<00:03:28.140> oh<00:03:28.500> all<00:03:29.490> this<00:03:29.760> is

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.610 
know how I don't even know how far that
is<00:03:47.670> but<00:03:48.890> far<00:03:49.890> enough<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:51.360> know<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.540> do<00:03:52.440> some

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.260 
is but far enough to you know to do some
damage<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:55.440> know<00:03:55.680> I'm<00:03:55.950> an<00:03:56.670> idiot<00:03:56.910> and

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
damage so I you know I'm an idiot and

damage so I you know I'm an idiot and
still<00:03:57.900> riding<00:03:58.200> along<00:03:58.470> at<00:03:58.680> Tom<00:03:58.920> takes<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.700> trail

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
still riding along at Tom takes a trail

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.710 
still riding along at Tom takes a trail
right<00:04:00.239> above<00:04:01.489> and<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.820> have<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.300> pull<00:04:03.510> out<00:04:03.690> of

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
right above and so I have to pull out of

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.800 
right above and so I have to pull out of
here<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:05.150> we<00:04:06.150> are<00:04:06.180> continuing<00:04:06.989> on<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:08.810> where

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
here and we are continuing on and where

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.979 
here and we are continuing on and where
is<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.260> oh<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.070> great<00:04:11.340> hill<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:12.810> is

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
is this oh this is a great hill this is

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.380 
is this oh this is a great hill this is
a<00:04:13.019> awesome<00:04:13.350> hill<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:16.549> seriously<00:04:17.549> almost<00:04:17.760> all<00:04:18.209> it

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
a awesome hill I seriously almost all it

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.170 
a awesome hill I seriously almost all it
though<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.919> when<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:20.010> made<00:04:20.250> this<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:21.000> was

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
though that I when I made this it was

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.940 
though that I when I made this it was
very<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.600> was<00:04:21.810> like<00:04:22.019> okay<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:22.470> is<00:04:22.530> gonna<00:04:22.710> be<00:04:22.919> a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
very I was like okay this is gonna be a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.390 
very I was like okay this is gonna be a
tricky<00:04:23.310> one<00:04:23.720> but<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:25.020> guess<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.979> wasn't<00:04:26.130> hard

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
tricky one but I guess it wasn't hard

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.830 
tricky one but I guess it wasn't hard
enough<00:04:26.460> because<00:04:26.729> we<00:04:26.910> both<00:04:27.090> made<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.419> up<00:04:27.540> first

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
enough because we both made it up first

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.200 
enough because we both made it up first
try<00:04:28.110> so<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.830> don't<00:04:29.280> know<00:04:29.370> if<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.640> rethink<00:04:30.000> that

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
try so I don't know if to rethink that

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.100 
try so I don't know if to rethink that
one<00:04:30.390> make<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.750> little<00:04:30.900> bit<00:04:31.050> more<00:04:31.229> difficult

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
one make it a little bit more difficult

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.570 
one make it a little bit more difficult
and<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.500> here's<00:04:35.490> some<00:04:35.580> nasty<00:04:36.090> tree<00:04:36.750> crossings

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
and so here's some nasty tree crossings

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.040 
and so here's some nasty tree crossings
you<00:04:38.580> know<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:38.760> got<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.120> side<00:04:39.360> hilling<00:04:39.840> and

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
you know you got the side hilling and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.920 
you know you got the side hilling and
there's<00:04:40.169> some<00:04:40.320> slippery<00:04:41.010> branches<00:04:41.520> but<00:04:41.930> you

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
there's some slippery branches but you

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.409 
there's some slippery branches but you
know<00:04:43.050> we<00:04:43.350> get<00:04:43.500> over<00:04:43.800> that<00:04:43.919> no<00:04:44.729> issue<00:04:44.940> here's

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
know we get over that no issue here's

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:52.490 
know we get over that no issue here's
more<00:04:45.950> logs<00:04:46.950> on<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.520> ground<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:49.729> so<00:04:51.229> this<00:04:52.229> is

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
more logs on the ground and so this is

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.360 
more logs on the ground and so this is
this<00:04:53.250> part<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:54.410> don't<00:04:55.410> know<00:04:55.560> what<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:56.010> can<00:04:56.130> say

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
this part I don't know what you can say

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.710 
this part I don't know what you can say
about<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:58.520> but<00:04:59.520> anyway<00:04:59.729> here's<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.330> next

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
about it but anyway here's the next

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.360 
about it but anyway here's the next
section<00:05:01.620> right<00:05:02.250> here

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.610 

I'm<00:05:06.060> not<00:05:06.330> kidding<00:05:06.689> this<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:07.139> seriously

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
I'm not kidding this is seriously

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.950 
I'm not kidding this is seriously
terrible<00:05:08.610> it's<00:05:08.759> called<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.180> slippery<00:05:09.659> log

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
terrible it's called the slippery log

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.730 
terrible it's called the slippery log
and<00:05:10.379> that<00:05:11.780> part<00:05:12.780> right<00:05:12.930> there<00:05:13.199> we've<00:05:13.469> lost

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
and that part right there we've lost

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.709 
and that part right there we've lost
like<00:05:14.039> five<00:05:14.219> bikes<00:05:14.520> on<00:05:14.759> it<00:05:14.909> cuz<00:05:15.060> it's<00:05:15.270> just<00:05:15.330> so

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
like five bikes on it cuz it's just so

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.950 
like five bikes on it cuz it's just so
slippery<00:05:16.909> but<00:05:17.909> anyway<00:05:18.120> this<00:05:18.270> is<00:05:18.330> further<00:05:18.689> down

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
slippery but anyway this is further down

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.619 
slippery but anyway this is further down
and<00:05:20.300> this<00:05:21.300> log<00:05:21.569> is<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.840> pain<00:05:22.080> in<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.259> butt

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
and this log is a pain in the butt

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.230 
and this log is a pain in the butt
