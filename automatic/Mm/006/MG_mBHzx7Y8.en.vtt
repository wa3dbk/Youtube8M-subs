hundred<00:02:22.890> bucks<00:02:23.220> apiece<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.660> wondered<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.200> i

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
hundred bucks apiece and I wondered so i

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.750 
hundred bucks apiece and I wondered so i
came<00:02:25.470> home<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.920> i<00:02:26.010> started<00:02:26.250> looking<00:02:26.430> them<00:02:26.670> up

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760

came home and i started looking them up
on<00:02:26.940> ebay<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:28.140> realized<00:02:28.590> why<00:02:28.920> they're<00:02:29.670> going

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
on ebay and I realized why they're going

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.640 
on ebay and I realized why they're going
so<00:02:30.090> high<00:02:30.240> because<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.600> Carson<00:02:31.110> cities<00:02:31.440> are

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
so high because the Carson cities are

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.920 
so high because the Carson cities are
working<00:02:32.100> were<00:02:32.220> between<00:02:32.459> seven<00:02:32.910> hundred<00:02:33.209> to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
working were between seven hundred to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.740 
working were between seven hundred to
two<00:02:34.380> thousand<00:02:34.950> dollars<00:02:35.220> piece<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:35.970> was

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
two thousand dollars piece and that was

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.590 
two thousand dollars piece and that was
something<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.200> didn't<00:02:37.530> know<00:02:37.709> before<00:02:38.310> that

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
something that I didn't know before that

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.350 
something that I didn't know before that
so<00:02:39.600> it's<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.410> kind<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.800> hobby<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.370> me<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360
