00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
 we find ourselves for a video swell so 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.200
 for theirs to fish no too 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.080
 started with the traditional will not be there 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.840
 so with bells to draw the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.289
 fish by far so the pike the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.160
 pikeperch with carnivorous type on whistle 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.410
 pick pike so that also serves catch 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.410
 all kinds on neighborhoods 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:31.400
 europe has so colors perch 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.400
 so it shows well in high screams 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.370
 then this twist as if with the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.969
 fin so that is fine to do 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.969
 good vibrations 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.640
 then the spoon with a foam 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.219
 above red color so since the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.530
 next galas for the road he likes 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.820
 well then attack this type of egg 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.680
 so I added a spoon on it 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.480
 to make good vibrations so 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.480
 it's basically for ice cream 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.420
 the teaspoon so that serves for the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.420
 Pike fishing 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.819
 this reading I received was falling 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:20.340
 already mounted so points the pair next 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:27.000
 we have a growler so who has recently 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:33.810
 for ashes then this type of time 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.229
 with spoon then integrates the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.819
 gnaws 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.590
 so as I told you this is 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:43.020
 the instinct the project that attend ath 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.969
 then integrates we have decoys 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.229
 special ash so that are marked 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:55.439
 so above on the back and green as long as 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:01.069
 that's actually mind that then we soon 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:03.299
 when at 2 2 q rose who rebels to write 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.750
 so I can show you everything because 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.179
 it will be long then we have this type of 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 the time with the tail that curls or for 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.540
 do donuts branching j so we 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.129
 can cut there 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.859
 my party from there that's the trophy 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.950
 then theirs had fluo so for 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:25.310
 reminder those ci see also for the sao 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.079
 tomÃ© it's a blow to their perches 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.530
 then in the water is very clear at 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:34.910
 north we have the most blacks 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.980
 so really in others and stone 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.440
 like in the rivers and where so 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.880
 then we really have toddlers 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.430
 their really for the small perches 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:55.100
 our neon camps will be surprised by the whites 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:58.209
 So here I am taking more or less 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.050
 but predators with a white twist 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.380
 it's the best technique for 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.800
 meet the ladakh then special 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.860
 ashes 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:14.060
 so we make it to the young so here we go 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.540
 then I do not get a big one 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.540
 eurozone 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.600
 so they also work well for this 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.080
 What is that diced small 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.550
 screen 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:34.220
 I walk well also non violence 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.730
 then little blacks who go 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.120
 will be the gold palette so here but 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.120
 like this one 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.750
 that's back 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.090
 so theirs and 2.6 then we have the foot 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.170
 on the planet so with two tridents 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:09.690
 by printing there are double in which 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:14.970
 works well then I have pallets 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:22.800
 simple so be to go up to do 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:33.450
 mounting killing and was silent for our 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:35.880
 red so similar to that there I do not 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.480
 I have more than thank you for having 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.480
 watched a video
