00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 there live brambles in today's video I was there 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.940
 For you, a chat that you have 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.120
 enough for social networks and is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.610
 to explain more or less the same as 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.640
 Who and when do I reconcile the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.730
 blog the channel gives account of all the networks 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.279
 of my emails being answering 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.050
 you and all in the last year of teaching 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.130
 Average, that's what I'm going to give. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.279
 entrance exam 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.040
 so it's complicated supercomplicated here 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.010
 A little start to get crazy is just 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.989
 It's a joke, and also because I 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 I will not go back with a blog I'll start 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.600
 already explaining the blog as the fashion 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.730
 unfortunately will not go back to the blog anymore 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.590
 that he's going to stand there guarded off 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.629
 on account of all the content that he 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.850
 I brought over these four years 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.039
 He got active so he's going to stay there. 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.980
 they can still enter by daniel 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.809
 while fashion point with it will allow 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.750
 with all the content with everything the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.199
 people posted these four years and now 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.229
 to be born a new blog called laura 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.570
 grohmann it's time for europe a point 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.100
 as well and I bought the domain of 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 dot com dot br 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.070
 only it is not working yet 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.990
 because he is a problem but the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.330
 project for you that I'm adjusting 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.040
 I already called there to fix everything else. 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.009
 is a designer friend as you know 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.530
 beatriz feijoo also maybe giving super 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.900
 In this then lauro and bruno he comes with 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.939
 a new visual identity comes with a 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.159
 thing you did not see one more thing 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.290
 create a clearer thing where you already 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.930
 They'll go to the blog and I'll see your parents. 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.240
 posts will now see all posts 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.670
 same day as the main ones 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.130
 content that you always ask me for 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.369
 and here on the channel I can not talk 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.040
 I also like to write and show 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.600
 because here in the channel there are many 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.000
 times its march here for you right 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.700
 then show public photos do 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.100
 review everything you ask me here 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.009
 the channel can not do will be there 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.659
 on the blog then lauro maschmann asks 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.399
 with the blog because the blog ended 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.340
 stable in the last year of high school 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.500
 yea 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.929
 This I did the video starts with you 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.489
 They say I wanted to stop even on the ranch. 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.400
 fashion but I do not have a timeline 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.010
 due to the many requests from you and 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.660
 because also here on youtube 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.450
 I was missing that 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.910
 Because there are more things to know 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.540
 I still bring more content to you 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.489
 then blog will be a more personal place 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.190
 Where should you spend more photos of my day? 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.959
 on a trip for example here I do not 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.700
 I got to post photos for you. 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.000
 so I'll leave it at home here and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.220
 on the blog until the videos do not 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.920
 It's going to be something that is closer to 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.380
 You of course want to bring 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.060
 treat employees is helping me 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.000
 talking about other subjects as well. 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.209
 I do not dominate much what I do not understand 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.819
 right and everyone is betting 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.519
 super on the new blog a lot of people liked it 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.319
 many people came to talk laura also 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.569
 Good that you were able to continue with the 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.340
 blog because I was missing 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.379
 of that internet space that is the most 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.139
 next time I could always comment and 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.700
 you always answer because not old 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.500
 sister's name was like that too. 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.440
 Reply All Blog Posts 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.730
 I thought I'd answer everything then. 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.549
 It's also a space, but my 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.609
 You that I get back active there too 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.370
 Of course she will not be able to do 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.109
 Daily posts know but I'll try to give 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.220
 It's my best to reconcile everything. 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.380
 right 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.120
 The purpose of this video was to show 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.639
 for you as I am reconciling the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.000
 things to be channel or to record the 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.700
 videos is now writing the posts 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.700
 now as news and of course not 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.880
 forgetting also to study average to do 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.280
 oo eight to finish high school and 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.239
 also give the entrance exam as you 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.819
 I really want to make the gift and the already 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.769
 it's kind of a certain faculty we are 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.260
 I already talked to my parents in jazz. 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.590
 but we talked enough then I 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.049
 also be defined and now is 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.290
 do the enem is to focus on enem and also 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.659
 focus on her to finish high school 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.120
 past 70 for the fan has nothing with notes 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.859
 and such is good reconcile this much 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.140
 thing I know there's a lot of girl 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.969
 passing through it at that moment has this 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.260
 type is understood that the fifa passes 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.610
 I did not even feel it 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.460
 but I have a little difficulty 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.380
 to be able to reconcile all things 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.360
 but what I've been doing is like this 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.000
 light morning takes to school 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.680
 so I arrive from the afternoon I 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.020
 I made that determined for myself 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.360
 work on either the channel or 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.930
 whether it's blogging or recording videos 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.150
 editing is creating the content to be 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.909
 creating ideas come from the video of others 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.789
 Because it helps me a lot, it also brings 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:56.560
 more content for me such ideas and here 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.719
 is a community where each one spoke his 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.780
 opinion even if my theme is the 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:04.030
 even from Fulana but it will be different in 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.620
 the video only because each has its own 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.050
 agent in each has its own 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.390
 content that will pass your opinion 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.710
 is not formed so I see the video of the 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.690
 people also like to always be 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.880
 updated on the challenges to bring 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.880
 I drew more here for the channel for you 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.450
 It's more or less so in the afternoon 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.349
 reserve for this and at night, I try 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.849
 do my job 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.710
 the event is not an organism of mine 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.610
 profession of work does the job 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.650
 This morning tonight I'm going to do 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.750
 yesterday I will not let go the day before 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.370
 at the weekend i think he is 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.010
 more so far works the name that 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.320
 You see on television, my God, no. 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.139
 so everyone must be well past 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.840
 I do tonight except it's 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.360
 because that way I got more things 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.490
 understood then at night is the time of 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.990
 to study there and tauá that one time or another 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.750
 I do not mean instagram 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.610
 I'm there in the NEP in which the dollar is 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.190
 starting now with you by inep 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.800
 Also my pain is the one over there 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.260
 and it's more or less as soon as I can 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.820
 schedule my things 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.630
 You know, I think it's a fundamental tip. 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.640
 it's organization if you do not work 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.490
 have a blog for example working with 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.320
 something else outside or at home 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.060
 same office something like this 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.860
 this program is also 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.760
 all come out right if you study and 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.980
 works hard 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.900
 or if you do everything and have several others 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.060
 appointments or several other classes 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.650
 some courses like that 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.020
 so I think it's important to program 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:35.340
 because then you can reconcile everything 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:38.580
 and not looking for ideas and people 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.140
 in pink dating or thinking about dating 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.210
 I have to go out with the boyfriend as well. 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.330
 celebrate the special dates 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.160
 It's quite a thing but if you 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.080
 programming was what I said 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.930
 for you think the key word for 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.980
 Recording is the organization which then gives 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.260
 right 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.540
 well, that's it if you want to know 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.340
 laura anything else like that 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.410
 You would do as you do it. 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.570
 suggestions of videos is also concept 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.820
 open here for you to leave your 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.490
 suggestions, please comment below 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.550
 on the blog now write your comment 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.770
 left a message for me and I hope 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.120
 I really like that video have 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.400
 understood a little bit too 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.830
 because I 'm going to have a blog and like me 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.450
 I'm reconciling things but I think 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.870
 that we'll just a little bit later 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.580
 and at events and make the 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.610
 things do contains that you have a 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.770
 video has to be programmed and 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.960
 will have just people and 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.980
 you trust a lot to the 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.790
 your hand right then stayed we see in 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.790
 next media
