first of all it's safe

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.440

off ledges meaning that if you walk to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.160 
off ledges meaning that if you walk to
parts<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.830> sides<00:02:23.069> you'll<00:02:23.580> get<00:02:23.730> kayoed

also<00:02:25.170> due<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.470> its<00:02:25.620> rounded<00:02:26.129> nature<00:02:26.489> if<00:02:26.940> you

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
also due to its rounded nature if you

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.000 
also due to its rounded nature if you
jump<00:02:27.510> or<00:02:27.659> get<00:02:27.989> launched<00:02:28.379> near<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> edges

you'll<00:02:29.549> actually<00:02:29.909> fly<00:02:30.120> diagonally<00:02:31.040> now<00:02:32.040> let's

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
you'll actually fly diagonally now let's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.550 
you'll actually fly diagonally now let's
give<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.519> 3ds<00:02:33.000> version<00:02:33.120> some<00:02:33.569> love<00:02:33.750> there's<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
give the 3ds version some love there's a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.050 
give the 3ds version some love there's a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
lot less information on these stages

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.970 
lot less information on these stages
mostly<00:02:36.629> because<00:02:36.780> they<00:02:37.200> only<00:02:37.379> have<00:02:37.620> usually

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
mostly because they only have usually

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.220 
mostly because they only have usually
one<00:02:38.400> screen<00:02:38.790> shot<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.420> they<00:02:39.629> still<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:39.870> worth

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
one screen shot but they still are worth

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.890 
one screen shot but they still are worth
taking<00:02:40.440> note<00:02:40.879> starting<00:02:41.879> off<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.599> stage

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
taking note starting off is this stage
