think<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.080> High<00:01:49.410> one<00:01:49.680> Katy<00:01:49.920> maybe<00:01:50.190> -<00:01:50.370> Katy<00:01:50.580> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
think like High one Katy maybe - Katy I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.280 
think like High one Katy maybe - Katy I
don't<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:50.910> but<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.810> were<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.050> try

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
don't know but they were just like try

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.710 
don't know but they were just like try
hard<00:01:52.470> stats<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.250> yeah<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.850> I've<00:01:54.480> spent<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
hard stats but yeah so I've spent a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.570 
hard stats but yeah so I've spent a
little<00:01:54.840> bit<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.170> 1<00:01:55.350> V<00:01:55.530> 2<00:01:55.560> V<00:01:55.800> 2<00:01:56.220> in<00:01:56.370> this<00:01:56.550> I

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
little bit of a 1 V 2 V 2 in this I

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.010 
little bit of a 1 V 2 V 2 in this I
thought<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.940> was<00:01:57.030> kind<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.720> something

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
thought it was kind of something

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.170 
thought it was kind of something
different<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.410> lot<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> people<00:01:59.220> they<00:01:59.730> seemed<00:01:59.940> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
different a lot of people they seemed I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.460 
different a lot of people they seemed I
think<00:02:00.420> people<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> episodes<00:02:01.320> where

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
think people like the episodes where

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.830 
think people like the episodes where
there's<00:02:01.650> three<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.280> good<00:02:02.520> teams<00:02:02.760> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.750> it

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
there's three like good teams I think it

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.000 
there's three like good teams I think it
makes<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.230> little<00:02:04.320> bit<00:02:04.500> more<00:02:04.620> interesting

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
makes it a little bit more interesting

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.640 
makes it a little bit more interesting
and<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.550> also<00:02:05.700> kind<00:02:06.120> of<00:02:06.180> makes<00:02:06.900> it<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.290> lot

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
and it also kind of makes it a lot

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.650 
and it also kind of makes it a lot
harder<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.099> win<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.849> definitely<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.450> lot

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
harder to win it's it's definitely a lot

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.270 
harder to win it's it's definitely a lot
harder<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.050> win<00:02:10.200> when<00:02:10.739> there's<00:02:10.890> three<00:02:11.129> good

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
harder to win when there's three good

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.000 
harder to win when there's three good
teams<00:02:11.550> cuz<00:02:12.480> usually<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.530> know<00:02:13.620> when<00:02:13.739> it's<00:02:13.890> two

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
teams cuz usually you know when it's two

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.290 
teams cuz usually you know when it's two
good<00:02:14.129> teams<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.489> can<00:02:14.640> get<00:02:14.760> your<00:02:14.879> streaks<00:02:15.150> off

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
good teams you can get your streaks off

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.300 
good teams you can get your streaks off
the<00:02:15.420> random<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.870> stuff<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.280> doesn't

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the random and stuff but it doesn't

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.470 
the random and stuff but it doesn't
really<00:02:17.580> work<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.879> like<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.209> when<00:02:18.330> there's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
really work I like that when there's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.570 
really work I like that when there's
three<00:02:18.659> good<00:02:18.810> teams<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:20.069> don't<00:02:20.250> that's<00:02:20.340> one

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
three good teams so I don't that's one

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.949 
three good teams so I don't that's one
thing<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.940> I've<00:02:21.060> always<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.510> kind<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.810> don't

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
thing that I've always I kind of don't

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.920 
thing that I've always I kind of don't
like<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.379> because<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.680> kind<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:24.300> doesn't

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
like it because it kind of it doesn't

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.510 
like it because it kind of it doesn't
show<00:02:25.500> as<00:02:26.040> much<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> scale<00:02:28.340> or<00:02:29.340> it

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
show as much of like the scale or it

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.580 
show as much of like the scale or it
doesn't<00:02:29.700> determine<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.780> true<00:02:31.020> winner<00:02:31.230> is

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
doesn't determine a true winner is

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.550 
doesn't determine a true winner is
is<00:02:31.769> just<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.069> regular<00:02:32.400> one<00:02:32.550> because<00:02:33.379> so<00:02:34.379> many

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
is just a regular one because so many

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.869 
is just a regular one because so many
times<00:02:34.860> when<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.129> get<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.519> where<00:02:35.730> there's

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
times when I get like where there's

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.910 
times when I get like where there's
three<00:02:36.030> good<00:02:36.150> teams<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:36.540> there<00:02:36.690> ah<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.830> know

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
three good teams in there ah you know

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.320 
three good teams in there ah you know
one<00:02:38.129> team<00:02:38.280> will<00:02:38.430> be<00:02:38.459> on<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.670> hardpoint<00:02:39.030> and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
one team will be on the hardpoint and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.059 
one team will be on the hardpoint and
then<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> other<00:02:39.660> team<00:02:39.870> other<00:02:40.440> two<00:02:40.680> teams<00:02:40.890> are

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
then the other team other two teams are

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.640 
then the other team other two teams are
always<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.550> slaying<00:02:41.940> each<00:02:42.090> other<00:02:42.300> off

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
always just like slaying each other off

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.449 
always just like slaying each other off
before<00:02:43.650> they<00:02:43.739> can<00:02:43.890> even<00:02:44.010> get<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
before they can even get to the

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.580 
before they can even get to the
hardpoint<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:45.090> makes<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.390> III<00:02:45.599> makes<00:02:46.019> me<00:02:46.170> so

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
hardpoint it makes it III makes me so

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.350 
hardpoint it makes it III makes me so
mad<00:02:46.890> when<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.220> get<00:02:47.430> killed<00:02:47.730> when<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.060> get<00:02:48.209> killed

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
mad when I get killed when I get killed

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.330 
mad when I get killed when I get killed
by<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.599> a<00:02:48.629> random<00:02:49.110> team<00:02:49.410> or<00:02:49.650> something<00:02:49.950> when

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
by like a random team or something when

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.160 
by like a random team or something when
I'm<00:02:50.430> going<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.970> hill<00:02:51.239> oh<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.989> shit

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
I'm going to the hill oh that shit

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.930 
I'm going to the hill oh that shit
really<00:02:52.349> pisses<00:02:52.650> me<00:02:52.680> off<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.489> don't<00:02:53.819> know

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
really pisses me off so I don't know

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.009 
really pisses me off so I don't know
like<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.239> kind<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.480> takes<00:02:54.629> a<00:02:54.720> little<00:02:54.840> bit<00:02:54.959> away

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
like it kind of takes a little bit away

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.780 
like it kind of takes a little bit away
from<00:02:55.349> it<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:55.980> always<00:02:56.069> fun<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.519> makes<00:02:56.700> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
from it but it's always fun it makes it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.610 
from it but it's always fun it makes it
a<00:02:56.849> lot<00:02:57.000> harder<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.360> win<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.290> guess<00:02:58.440> that's

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
a lot harder to win so I guess that's

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.070 
a lot harder to win so I guess that's
more<00:02:58.799> entertaining<00:02:59.280> I'm<00:02:59.580> not<00:02:59.760> sure<00:02:59.940> as<00:03:00.750> far<00:03:00.959> as

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
more entertaining I'm not sure as far as

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.390 
more entertaining I'm not sure as far as
this<00:03:01.260> gameplay<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.709> think<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.010> started<00:03:02.280> out<00:03:02.340> with

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
this gameplay I think I started out with

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.430 
this gameplay I think I started out with
scorpion<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.330> for<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.569> first<00:03:03.750> VSAT<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
scorpion just for that first VSAT in the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.660 
scorpion just for that first VSAT in the
beginning<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.799> dropped<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.099> pretty<00:03:05.310> quick<00:03:05.430> visa

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
beginning I dropped a pretty quick visa

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.729 
beginning I dropped a pretty quick visa
in<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.940> beginning<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.540> then<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.410> switched<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
in the beginning and then I switched the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.620 
in the beginning and then I switched the
FAL<00:03:08.160> like<00:03:08.489> hardwired<00:03:08.910> class<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.420> rest<00:03:09.540> of

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
FAL like hardwired class for the rest of

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.690 
FAL like hardwired class for the rest of
the<00:03:09.720> game<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.230> also<00:03:11.069> kind<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.370> cut<00:03:11.579> this

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
kills non-lethal and I dropped like 4 or

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.089

5<00:04:38.039> besets<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.900> was<00:04:39.990> like<00:04:40.140> one<00:04:40.409> streak<00:04:40.950> in

5 besets that was like one streak in

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.350 
5 besets that was like one streak in
them<00:04:41.219> where<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.520> wasn't<00:04:41.669> like<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:41.940> middle<00:04:42.180> hard

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
them where I wasn't like the middle hard

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.610 
them where I wasn't like the middle hard
point<00:04:42.599> where<00:04:42.719> I<00:04:42.750> just<00:04:42.780> like<00:04:43.110> went<00:04:43.349> off<00:04:43.440> I

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
point where I just like went off I

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.649 
point where I just like went off I
dropped<00:04:43.830> like<00:04:43.979> back-to-back<00:04:44.550> b-sides<00:04:44.940> on<00:04:45.090> the

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
dropped like back-to-back b-sides on the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.779 
dropped like back-to-back b-sides on the
so<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.080> was<00:04:46.169> pretty<00:04:46.319> crazy<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:47.099> you<00:04:47.699> know<00:04:47.729> I

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
so that was pretty crazy and you know I

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:48.589 
so that was pretty crazy and you know I
dropped<00:04:47.939> that<00:04:48.030> one<00:04:48.210> in<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.330> beginning<00:04:48.389> I

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
dropped that one in the beginning I

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:49.790 
dropped that one in the beginning I
think<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:48.780> dropped<00:04:48.900> one<00:04:49.229> more<00:04:49.469> so<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.620> think<00:04:49.650> I

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
think I dropped one more so I think I

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.070 
think I dropped one more so I think I
dropped<00:04:49.919> four<00:04:50.219> in<00:04:51.180> total<00:04:51.389> maybe<00:04:51.659> I<00:04:51.780> could<00:04:51.990> be

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
dropped four in total maybe I could be

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.619 
dropped four in total maybe I could be
wrong<00:04:52.229> but<00:04:52.289> I<00:04:52.800> did<00:04:53.759> I<00:04:53.909> did<00:04:54.090> pretty<00:04:54.300> damn<00:04:54.539> well

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
wrong but I did I did pretty damn well

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.040 
wrong but I did I did pretty damn well
and<00:04:55.050> then<00:04:55.379> as<00:04:55.500> far<00:04:55.650> as<00:04:55.710> my<00:04:55.860> teammate<00:04:56.900> he<00:04:57.900> got

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
and then as far as my teammate he got

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.050 
and then as far as my teammate he got
like<00:04:58.199> 40<00:04:58.469> kills<00:04:58.710> but<00:04:58.979> he<00:04:59.400> only<00:04:59.580> got<00:04:59.729> like<00:04:59.879> I

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
like 40 kills but he only got like I

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.610 
like 40 kills but he only got like I
think<00:05:00.210> he<00:05:00.270> only<00:05:00.300> got<00:05:00.479> like<00:05:00.569> two<00:05:00.719> defends<00:05:01.469> like

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
think he only got like two defends like

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.809 
think he only got like two defends like
he<00:05:01.770> really<00:05:01.979> wasn't<00:05:02.189> helping<00:05:02.430> me<00:05:02.490> on<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.699> hill

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
he really wasn't helping me on the hill

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.689 
he really wasn't helping me on the hill
at<00:05:02.939> all<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.240> had<00:05:03.599> like<00:05:03.719> 15<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.289> think<00:05:04.650> 15<00:05:05.099> plus<00:05:05.430> I

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
at all I had like 15 I think 15 plus I

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:06.619 
at all I had like 15 I think 15 plus I
don't<00:05:05.969> know<00:05:06.030> something<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.330> that

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
don't know something like that

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.330 
don't know something like that

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.279 
so I was really just holding on the hill
by<00:05:08.430> myself<00:05:08.849> and<00:05:09.120> he<00:05:09.900> was<00:05:09.990> just<00:05:10.110> going<00:05:10.199> around

by myself and he was just going around

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.450 
by myself and he was just going around
killing<00:05:10.530> people<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:10.949> I<00:05:10.979> mean<00:05:11.189> I<00:05:11.250> get<00:05:11.430> that

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460
