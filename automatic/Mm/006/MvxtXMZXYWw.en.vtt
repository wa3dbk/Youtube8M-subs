 this morning we are going to go to the forest this 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.599
 place is amazing I never imagined 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.200
 that this place was so close to me 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:21.180
 home is very important to try to leave 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.180
 of the city that is capable of stress 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.660
 I did not know there were many forests 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.880

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.940
 the moments here was different because 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.760
 there was no slide we did not have to 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.910
 meet certain schedules this was nothing 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.860

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.500
