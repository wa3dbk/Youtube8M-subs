00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
of course we should kind of expect the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.720 
of course we should kind of expect the
same<00:01:01.410> performance<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:04.730> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
performance could I should be moving a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
performance could I should be moving a
little<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.380> better<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> iPhone<00:01:08.310> 5<00:01:08.550> when

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120

phones<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.140> can't<00:02:30.560> should<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.890> think

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.650 

you<00:02:39.430> see<00:02:39.580> it's<00:02:39.700> pretty<00:02:39.760> funny<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.210> drift

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
you see it's pretty funny to drift

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.820 
you see it's pretty funny to drift
around<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:43.510> will<00:02:43.660> be<00:02:43.780> kind<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.230> fun<00:02:44.290> also<00:02:44.680> to

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
around it will be kind of fun also to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.610 
around it will be kind of fun also to
crash<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.550> think<00:02:46.180> if<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.900> come<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.410> in

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
crash I think if you come to that in

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:56.490 
crash I think if you come to that in
this<00:02:47.860> game<00:02:48.100> seems<00:02:48.459> so<00:02:54.360> that's<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.450> time<00:02:55.690> try

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
this game seems so that's the time try

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.640 
this game seems so that's the time try
to<00:02:56.530> be<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:58.120> probably<00:02:58.420> can<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.260> then<00:03:02.500> you

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
to be it you probably can and then you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.949
