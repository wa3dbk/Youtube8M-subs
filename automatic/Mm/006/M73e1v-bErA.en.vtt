00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
it's been at the back of my mind for the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.010 
it's been at the back of my mind for the
last<00:00:06.220> four<00:00:07.220> or<00:00:07.250> five<00:00:07.400> years<00:00:07.790> about<00:00:08.180> the<00:00:08.660> the

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.020 
last four or five years about the the

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.320 
last four or five years about the the

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
kitchen and and you know where it is I

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.590 
kitchen and and you know where it is I

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
think it was time to do a big reverb not

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.090 
think it was time to do a big reverb not
just<00:00:14.840> a<00:00:14.990> touching<00:00:15.440> up<00:00:15.560> because<00:00:15.800> I've<00:00:15.920> been

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
just a touching up because I've been

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.279 
just a touching up because I've been
been<00:00:16.430> doing<00:00:16.670> touching<00:00:16.910> up<00:00:17.150> during<00:00:17.420> during<00:00:18.140> the

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
been doing touching up during during the

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.820 
been doing touching up during during the
last<00:00:18.470> sort<00:00:18.710> of<00:00:18.770> 18<00:00:19.760> years<00:00:20.060> or<00:00:20.269> 19<00:00:20.689> years<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:21.769> it

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
last sort of 18 years or 19 years so it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.859 
last sort of 18 years or 19 years so it
was<00:00:21.890> time<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.580> bite<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.910> bullet<00:00:22.999> and<00:00:23.210> really

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
was time to bite the bullet and really

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.679 
was time to bite the bullet and really
go<00:00:24.109> for<00:00:24.140> it<00:00:24.380> so<00:00:24.800> a<00:00:25.070> brand<00:00:25.369> new<00:00:25.609> pastry<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:26.539> I've

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
go for it so a brand new pastry so I've

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.450 
go for it so a brand new pastry so I've
moved<00:00:26.929> physically<00:00:27.529> moved<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:27.800> pastry<00:00:28.220> where

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
moved physically moved the pastry where

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.450 
moved physically moved the pastry where
it<00:00:29.329> was<00:00:29.509> from<00:00:29.989> where<00:00:30.140> it<00:00:30.230> was<00:00:30.289> before<00:00:30.349> to<00:00:31.189> a<00:00:31.220> new

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
it was from where it was before to a new

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.120 
it was from where it was before to a new
area<00:00:31.669> and<00:00:31.999> moved<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:33.020> pot<00:00:33.260> wash<00:00:33.440> as<00:00:33.650> well<00:00:33.829> to

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
area and moved the pot wash as well to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.670 
area and moved the pot wash as well to
another<00:00:34.610> place<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.000> just<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.690> two<00:00:36.260> sections

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
another place so just to two sections

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.729 
another place so just to two sections
has<00:00:37.370> changed<00:00:37.879> immensely<00:00:38.030> it's<00:00:38.870> given<00:00:39.170> me<00:00:39.199> more

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
has changed immensely it's given me more

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.009 
has changed immensely it's given me more
room<00:00:40.039> more<00:00:40.460> space<00:00:40.789> and<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.090> better<00:00:41.270> flow<00:00:41.539> also

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
room more space and a better flow also

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.459 
room more space and a better flow also
I've<00:00:42.710> removed<00:00:43.309> all<00:00:43.699> got<00:00:44.420> rid<00:00:44.600> of<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:45.170> tiny

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
I've removed all got rid of the tiny

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.009 
I've removed all got rid of the tiny
little<00:00:45.710> office<00:00:45.920> that<00:00:46.219> I<00:00:46.309> had<00:00:46.519> or<00:00:46.760> chef<00:00:47.120> had<00:00:47.359> but

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
little office that I had or chef had but

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.290 
little office that I had or chef had but
that<00:00:48.500> has<00:00:49.100> meant<00:00:49.370> that<00:00:49.429> there's<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:49.820> different

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
that has meant that there's a different

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.419 
that has meant that there's a different
flow<00:00:50.510> as<00:00:50.660> well<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.079> paths<00:00:51.320> I've<00:00:52.100> been<00:00:52.280> able

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
flow as well to the paths I've been able

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.250 
flow as well to the paths I've been able
to<00:00:52.730> increase<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.960> pass<00:00:54.170> size<00:00:55.570> threefold<00:00:56.570> so

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
to increase the pass size threefold so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.720 
to increase the pass size threefold so
it<00:00:57.350> means<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:57.679> we<00:00:57.769> can<00:00:57.920> dress<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.160> lot<00:00:58.429> more

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
it means that we can dress a lot more

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.410 
it means that we can dress a lot more
plates<00:00:59.120> on<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.690> pass<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:01.129> it<00:01:01.850> certainly

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
plates on the pass and it's it certainly

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.509 
plates on the pass and it's it certainly
improved<00:01:02.899> on<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.379> on<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.129> quality<00:01:04.489> of

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
improved on the on the quality of

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.570 
improved on the on the quality of
dressing<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.089> plate<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:05.510> I<00:01:05.540> feel<00:01:05.780> I've

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
dressing of the plate so I feel I've

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.149 
dressing of the plate so I feel I've
finally<00:01:07.580> succumbed<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.630> induction<00:01:09.500> I've<00:01:09.950> been

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
finally succumbed to induction I've been

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.399 
finally succumbed to induction I've been
a<00:01:10.189> huge<00:01:10.400> fan<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:10.729> induction<00:01:11.150> over<00:01:11.509> the<00:01:11.600> last<00:01:11.780> 10

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
a huge fan of induction over the last 10

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.929 
a huge fan of induction over the last 10
years<00:01:12.439> I<00:01:12.740> would<00:01:12.950> say<00:01:13.130> when<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.400> first<00:01:13.640> sort<00:01:13.880> of

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
years I would say when it first sort of

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.929 
years I would say when it first sort of
appeared<00:01:14.450> but<00:01:14.750> I<00:01:14.780> was<00:01:14.930> I<00:01:14.960> was<00:01:15.170> very<00:01:15.200> wary<00:01:15.619> of

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
appeared but I was I was very wary of

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.819 
appeared but I was I was very wary of
using<00:01:16.939> induction<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.470> professional

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
using induction in a professional

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.770 
using induction in a professional
kitchen<00:01:19.009> I<00:01:19.399> have<00:01:19.759> it<00:01:19.850> at<00:01:19.939> home<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.509> I'm<00:01:20.630> very

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
kitchen I have it at home and I'm very

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.469 
kitchen I have it at home and I'm very
very<00:01:20.990> happy<00:01:21.110> with<00:01:21.470> it<00:01:21.500> at<00:01:21.680> home<00:01:21.890> but<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:23.299> one

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
very happy with it at home but it's one

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.120 
very happy with it at home but it's one
thing<00:01:23.659> cooking<00:01:24.140> at<00:01:24.229> home<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:24.619> induction<00:01:24.860> and

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
thing cooking at home and induction and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.310 
thing cooking at home and induction and
cooking<00:01:25.850> in<00:01:25.939> a<00:01:26.000> professional<00:01:26.420> kitchen<00:01:26.630> on

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
cooking in a professional kitchen on

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.460 
cooking in a professional kitchen on
induction<00:01:27.680> but<00:01:28.250> now<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.939> know<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.259> was<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
induction but now I know that it was the

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.980 
induction but now I know that it was the
right<00:01:30.619> time<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:31.130> rational<00:01:31.850> ovens<00:01:32.450> put<00:01:32.659> in<00:01:32.780> and

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
right time to rational ovens put in and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.800 
right time to rational ovens put in and
and<00:01:33.979> now<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.189> they're<00:01:34.460> in<00:01:34.490> I'm<00:01:34.810> seriously

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
and now that they're in I'm seriously

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.990 
and now that they're in I'm seriously
thinking<00:01:36.409> why<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.710> heck<00:01:37.219> did<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.490> not<00:01:37.640> come<00:01:37.850> in

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
thinking why the heck did I not come in

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.209 
thinking why the heck did I not come in
before<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:38.540> mean<00:01:39.020> they<00:01:39.170> are<00:01:39.380> extraordinary

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
before I mean they are extraordinary

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.020 
before I mean they are extraordinary
they<00:01:40.670> are<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.149> good<00:01:41.479> from<00:01:42.380> full<00:01:42.710> steam<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.549> and

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
they are so good from full steam to and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.520 
they are so good from full steam to and
whatever<00:01:44.240> percentage<00:01:44.689> of<00:01:44.869> steam<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:45.140> want

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
whatever percentage of steam you want

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.300 
whatever percentage of steam you want
and<00:01:45.799> there<00:01:46.159> are<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.490> many<00:01:46.990> different<00:01:47.990> options

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
and there are so many different options

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.340 
and there are so many different options
let<00:01:49.310> alone<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:50.060> plain<00:01:50.299> convection<00:01:51.049> oven

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
let alone just a plain convection oven

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.940 
let alone just a plain convection oven
and<00:01:52.060> they<00:01:53.060> are<00:01:53.210> they're<00:01:53.960> just<00:01:54.140> brilliant<00:01:54.320> like
