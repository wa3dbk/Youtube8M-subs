again to slj comm 2009 in the tech world
anyway<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.460> think<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.240> will<00:00:09.389> be<00:00:09.630> characterized

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
anyway I think it will be characterized

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.759 
anyway I think it will be characterized
as<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.769> year<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.210> netbook<00:00:13.110> netbook

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
as the year of the netbook netbook

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.220 
as the year of the netbook netbook
seemed<00:00:14.280> pretty<00:00:14.460> scarce<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.059> 2008<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.049> then

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
seemed pretty scarce in 2008 and then

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.640 
seemed pretty scarce in 2008 and then
just<00:00:16.440> blew<00:00:17.400> up<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.940> 2009<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> sudden<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
just blew up in 2009 all of a sudden you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.650 
just blew up in 2009 all of a sudden you
saw<00:00:19.890> them<00:00:20.100> everywhere<00:00:20.730> new<00:00:21.090> ones<00:00:21.300> seemed<00:00:21.570> to

of<00:00:28.710> demands<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.570> 2010<00:00:31.349> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
of demands well know that it's 2010 I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.840 
of demands well know that it's 2010 I
think<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:31.830> safe<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.160> say<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
think it's safe to say that the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.479 
think it's safe to say that the
honeymoon<00:00:33.090> period<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.930> netbooks<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.890> sort<00:00:35.370> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
honeymoon period for netbooks is sort of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.819 
honeymoon period for netbooks is sort of
over<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:36.960> also<00:00:37.110> safe<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.469> say

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
over and I think it's also safe to say

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.950 
over and I think it's also safe to say
that<00:00:37.860> netbooks<00:00:38.610> worked<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.149> better<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.540> some

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
that netbooks worked out better for some

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.740 
that netbooks worked out better for some
than<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.440> did<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.920> others<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.879> did<00:00:42.510> hear<00:00:42.719> from

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
than they did for others I did hear from

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.709 
than they did for others I did hear from
a<00:00:43.020> lot<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.260> people<00:00:43.890> late<00:00:44.190> last<00:00:44.910> year<00:00:45.300> who<00:00:45.420> said

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
a lot of people late last year who said

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.830 
a lot of people late last year who said
things<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:47.160> know<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.550> bought<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> netbook

school and if you're a person who felt
similarly<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.210> might<00:01:09.510> want<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.229> investigate

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
similarly you might want to investigate

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.420

did not impair my ability one bed and I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.550 
did not impair my ability one bed and I
like<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.980> design<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.370> I'll<00:02:29.670> take<00:02:29.879> HP

like the design and I'll take HP

like the design and I'll take HP
afterward<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.799> that<00:02:32.269> you<00:02:33.269> might<00:02:33.389> be<00:02:33.569> asking

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
afterward on that you might be asking

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.949 
afterward on that you might be asking
how<00:02:34.230> did<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.829> get<00:02:35.159> it<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.909> slim<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:36.930> a

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
how did they get it so slim this is a

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.800 
how did they get it so slim this is a
really<00:02:37.530> slim<00:02:37.980> notebook<00:02:38.790> well<00:02:39.359> they<00:02:39.629> did<00:02:39.780> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
really slim notebook well they did a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.170 
really slim notebook well they did a
couple<00:02:40.139> things<00:02:40.349> one<00:02:40.859> thing<00:02:41.189> they<00:02:41.370> did<00:02:41.609> it<00:02:41.790> is

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
couple things one thing they did it is

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.110 
couple things one thing they did it is
taking<00:02:42.689> perhaps<00:02:43.079> a<00:02:43.260> cue<00:02:43.530> from<00:02:43.799> netbooks<00:02:44.549> there

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
taking perhaps a cue from netbooks there

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.360 
taking perhaps a cue from netbooks there
is<00:02:45.389> no<00:02:45.900> optical<00:02:46.799> drive<00:02:47.189> on<00:02:47.609> this<00:02:47.909> device<00:02:48.569> so<00:02:49.370> if

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
is no optical drive on this device so if

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.199 
is no optical drive on this device so if
you're<00:02:50.519> dependent<00:02:51.239> on<00:02:51.769> CDs<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:53.159> DVDs<00:02:53.220> you

you're dependent on CDs and DVDs you

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579

won't find them here I've been saying it
for<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> couple<00:02:56.849> years<00:02:57.239> now<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.450> think<00:02:57.659> optical

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
for a couple years now I think optical

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.129 
for a couple years now I think optical
