which<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> why<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.140> decided<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.559> send<00:00:34.829> out

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890

which is why I decided to send out
Kyogre<00:00:35.309> furs<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.730> dialga<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.719> actually<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
Kyogre furs and dialga is actually a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.930 
Kyogre furs and dialga is actually a
very<00:00:37.500> dangerous<00:00:37.620> Pokemon<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.700> runs<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
very dangerous Pokemon because it runs a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.970 
very dangerous Pokemon because it runs a
lot<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.180> good<00:00:39.210> mix<00:00:39.600> sets<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.469> guess<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.860> can

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
lot of good mix sets so I guess it can

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
lot of good mix sets so I guess it can
kind<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.430> compared<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.059> fortune<00:00:42.660> oh

little<00:01:26.250> bit<00:01:26.369> under<00:01:26.580> half<00:01:26.790> half<00:01:27.299> health<00:01:27.630> after

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
little bit under half half health after

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.530 
little bit under half half health after
leftovers<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.759> not<00:01:29.880> too<00:01:30.060> bad<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.390> main

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
leftovers so it's not too bad the main

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.789 
leftovers so it's not too bad the main
thing<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.750> wanted<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.290> pretty<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.590> just

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
thing I wanted to do is pretty much just

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.100 
thing I wanted to do is pretty much just
get<00:01:32.100> up<00:01:32.220> entry<00:01:32.549> hazards<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.750> kind<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> had

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
get up entry hazards and I kind of had

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.510 
get up entry hazards and I kind of had
to<00:01:34.140> let<00:01:34.380> ferrothorn<00:01:34.770> die<00:01:35.040> even<00:01:35.280> though<00:01:35.490> I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to let ferrothorn die even though I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
to let ferrothorn die even though I
probably<00:01:35.759> could<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.030> switched<00:01:36.270> into

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
probably could have switched into

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
probably could have switched into
Giratina<00:01:37.020> earlier<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> aura<00:01:37.890> sphere

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
Giratina earlier on the aura sphere

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.219 
Giratina earlier on the aura sphere
because<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.210> didn't<00:01:39.390> want<00:01:39.540> Giratina<00:01:39.990> to

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
because I really didn't want Giratina to

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.800 
because I really didn't want Giratina to
be<00:01:40.350> taking<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.400> possible<00:01:41.579> dragon<00:01:42.210> types<00:01:42.420> tab<00:01:42.600> if

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
be taking a possible dragon types tab if

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899 
be taking a possible dragon types tab if
he<00:01:42.899> decided<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.409> predict<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> switched<00:01:44.700> into

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
he decided to predict so I switched into

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.370 
he decided to predict so I switched into
Giratina<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.689> he's<00:01:45.840> actually<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> set

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
Giratina and he's actually going to set

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.630 
Giratina and he's actually going to set
up<00:01:46.470> rocks<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> switch<00:01:47.189> probably

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
up rocks on the switch probably

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
up rocks on the switch probably
predicting<00:01:48.000> me<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> switch<00:01:48.360> out<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.049> he's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
predicting me to switch out so he's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
predicting me to switch out so he's
going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> go<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.680> dragon<00:01:49.890> pulse<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.520> out

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
going to go for a dragon pulse as I out

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
going to go for a dragon pulse as I out
speed<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> go<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> Draco<00:01:51.869> meteor<00:01:52.110> so

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
speed and go for a Draco meteor so

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.080 
speed and go for a Draco meteor so
that's<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> ton<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.549> damage<00:01:53.729> it's

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that's going to do a ton of damage it's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.429 
that's going to do a ton of damage it's
not<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> quite<00:01:54.720> KO<00:01:54.990> me<00:01:55.229> actually

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
not going to quite KO me actually

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.709 
not going to quite KO me actually
because<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.369> really<00:01:56.939> bulky<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.600> see

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
because I'm really bulky as you can see

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.139 
because I'm really bulky as you can see
especially<00:01:57.960> since<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.770> origin<00:01:59.130> form<00:01:59.430> but

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
especially since this is origin form but

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.929 
especially since this is origin form but
I'm<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.790> did

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
I'm going to have to you see that it did

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.310 
I'm going to have to you see that it did
a<00:02:02.969> lot<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.149> damage<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.540> most<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> my<00:02:04.079> team

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
a lot of damage to most of my team

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.200 
a lot of damage to most of my team
members<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.100> had<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> lot<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> problems<00:02:06.090> with

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
members so I had a lot of problems with

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.210 
members so I had a lot of problems with
that<00:02:06.299> dialga<00:02:06.719> said<00:02:06.869> actually<00:02:07.140> probably<00:02:07.860> one

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
that dialga said actually probably one

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.589 
that dialga said actually probably one
of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> reasons<00:02:08.580> was<00:02:09.000> my<00:02:09.179> relative

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
of the reasons was my relative

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.960 
of the reasons was my relative
inexperience<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.379> ubers<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.610> moves

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
inexperience with ubers but that moves

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.040 
inexperience with ubers but that moves
it<00:02:12.150> was<00:02:12.300> really<00:02:12.510> threatening<00:02:12.780> for

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
it was really threatening for

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.780 
it was really threatening for
team<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.410> particular<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.490> he's<00:02:14.670> actually

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
team in particular so he's actually

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.340 
team in particular so he's actually
going<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.210> up<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> star<00:02:15.840> raptor<00:02:16.170> which

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
going to go up to a star raptor which

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.590 
going to go up to a star raptor which
was<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> pretty<00:02:16.770> unusual<00:02:17.100> unusual<00:02:17.730> choice<00:02:18.360> in

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
was a pretty unusual unusual choice in

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.540 
was a pretty unusual unusual choice in
new<00:02:18.720> Bruges<00:02:18.900> actually<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.310> going<00:02:20.460> to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
new Bruges actually so I'm just going to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.400 
new Bruges actually so I'm just going to
let<00:02:20.760> your<00:02:20.970> Tina<00:02:21.180> die<00:02:21.390> really<00:02:21.780> no<00:02:21.900> point<00:02:22.110> in

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
let your Tina die really no point in

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.350 
let your Tina die really no point in
switching<00:02:23.250> out<00:02:23.370> because<00:02:23.730> he<00:02:23.880> could<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.180> just

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
switching out because he could have just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.730 
switching out because he could have just
gone<00:02:24.390> for<00:02:24.660> an<00:02:24.720> attack<00:02:24.960> or<00:02:25.140> something<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.590> when

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
gone for an attack or something so when

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.440 
gone for an attack or something so when
I'm<00:02:25.830> at<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.220> low<00:02:26.490> really<00:02:27.120> wouldn't<00:02:27.360> have

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
I'm at that low really wouldn't have

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.790 
I'm at that low really wouldn't have
mattered<00:02:27.720> anyway<00:02:27.780> especially<00:02:28.200> since<00:02:28.620> he<00:02:28.680> has

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
mattered anyway especially since he has

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.620 
mattered anyway especially since he has
stealth<00:02:29.100> rock<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.030> he's<00:02:30.210> going<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.360> go<00:02:30.510> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
stealth rock up so he's going to go and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.090 
stealth rock up so he's going to go and
see<00:02:30.780> me<00:02:30.990> too<00:02:31.170> which<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.530> really<00:02:31.830> dangerous

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
see me too which is a really dangerous

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.980 
see me too which is a really dangerous
sweeper<00:02:32.730> very<00:02:33.060> high<00:02:33.210> special<00:02:33.630> attack<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
sweeper very high special attack and

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.810 
sweeper very high special attack and
speed<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.800> pretty<00:02:35.070> much<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.400> only<00:02:35.430> way<00:02:35.700> I'm

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
speed so pretty much the only way I'm

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.980 
speed so pretty much the only way I'm
going<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.090> able<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.330> take<00:02:36.570> care<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.870> it

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
going to be able to take care of it

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.510 
going to be able to take care of it
since<00:02:37.230> i<00:02:37.320> don't<00:02:37.380> have<00:02:37.560> giratina<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.280> shadow

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
since i don't have giratina to shadow

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.820 
since i don't have giratina to shadow
sneak<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.690> go<00:02:39.810> into<00:02:39.930> Kyogre<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.590> water

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
sneak it is to go into Kyogre and water

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.130 
sneak it is to go into Kyogre and water
spout<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.400> actually<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:42.060> run<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.270> scarf<00:02:42.690> Kyogre

spout I actually do run a scarf Kyogre

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.470 
spout I actually do run a scarf Kyogre

337 with stabbed in the rain boost so

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.460 
337 with stabbed in the rain boost so
it's<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.240> ton<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.510> health<00:02:54.750> I'm<00:02:54.930> not<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.080> quite

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
full but it's a pretty close so it does

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.350 
full but it's a pretty close so it does
a<00:02:58.530> ton<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.800> damage<00:02:58.980> as<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.490> see<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.180> he's

a ton of damage as you can see so he's

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.730

it's<00:03:05.910> really<00:03:06.120> good<00:03:06.240> because<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.990> can<00:03:07.110> actually

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
it's really good because it can actually

walk I ogre pretty much so as long as I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.300 
walk I ogre pretty much so as long as I
just<00:03:10.110> get<00:03:10.230> off<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.470> toxic<00:03:10.950> I'm<00:03:11.070> gonna<00:03:11.220> be

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
just get off that toxic I'm gonna be

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.160 
just get off that toxic I'm gonna be
able<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.610> stow<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:11.910> out<00:03:12.180> ice<00:03:12.600> beam<00:03:12.870> won't<00:03:13.050> do

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
able to stow it out ice beam won't do

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.360 
able to stow it out ice beam won't do
that<00:03:13.230> much<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.710> of<00:03:13.770> course<00:03:13.950> I'm<00:03:14.130> immune<00:03:14.340> to

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
that much and of course I'm immune to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.700 
that much and of course I'm immune to
thunder<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.120> even<00:03:15.390> water<00:03:15.660> stabs<00:03:16.080> because<00:03:16.530> of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
thunder and even water stabs because of

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.440 
thunder and even water stabs because of
storm<00:03:17.040> drain<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.760> those<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.000> only<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.360> to

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
storm drain so those are only going to

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.540 
storm drain so those are only going to
boost<00:03:18.660> my<00:03:18.870> special<00:03:19.320> attack<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.920> he<00:03:20.160> tries<00:03:20.400> to

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
boost my special attack that he tries to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.040 
boost my special attack that he tries to
hit<00:03:20.670> me<00:03:20.760> with<00:03:20.820> one<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.000> those<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:21.900> just

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
hit me with one of those so I'm just

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.390 
hit me with one of those so I'm just
gonna<00:03:22.170> go<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.620> toxic<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.160> thought<00:03:23.280> he

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
gonna go for the toxic I thought he

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.680 
gonna go for the toxic I thought he
might<00:03:23.520> have<00:03:23.610> switched<00:03:23.880> out<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:24.239> instead<00:03:24.510> he

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
might have switched out but instead he

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.930 
might have switched out but instead he
decides<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.170> stay<00:03:25.380> in<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.560> reveal<00:03:25.800> calm<00:03:26.070> mind<00:03:26.370> so

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
decides to stay in a reveal calm mind so

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.250 
decides to stay in a reveal calm mind so
I<00:03:26.970> was<00:03:27.120> thinking<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.660> might<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:27.930> be<00:03:28.110> one

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
I was thinking that it might just be one

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.560 
I was thinking that it might just be one
of<00:03:28.350> those<00:03:28.440> bulky<00:03:28.860> maybe<00:03:29.040> rest<00:03:29.340> talk<00:03:29.580> sets<00:03:29.940> but

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
of those bulky maybe rest talk sets but

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.000 
of those bulky maybe rest talk sets but
instead<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.050> just<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.260> calm<00:03:31.440> mind<00:03:31.590> set<00:03:31.860> which

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
instead it's just a calm mind set which

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.070 
instead it's just a calm mind set which
makes<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.400> considerably<00:03:32.760> easier<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.720> deal

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
makes it considerably easier to deal

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.960 
makes it considerably easier to deal
with<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:34.920> now<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.280> best<00:03:35.489> thing<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:35.730> can<00:03:35.790> do<00:03:35.940> is

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
with so now the best thing I can do is

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.430 
with so now the best thing I can do is
just<00:03:36.120> keep<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.570> gastrin<00:03:36.930> on<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.170> keep<00:03:37.260> using

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
just keep and gastrin on and keep using

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.110 
just keep and gastrin on and keep using
earth<00:03:37.650> power<00:03:37.860> over<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.370> over<00:03:38.459> again<00:03:38.640> because

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
earth power over and over again because

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.910 
earth power over and over again because
this<00:03:39.510> Kyogre<00:03:39.900> said<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:40.170> basically<00:03:40.620> going<00:03:40.830> to

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
this Kyogre said is basically going to

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.380 
this Kyogre said is basically going to
hit<00:03:41.160> every<00:03:41.340> single<00:03:41.730> other<00:03:41.760> member<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.239> my<00:03:42.360> team

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
for a pretty hard damage I sort of wish

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.250 
for a pretty hard damage I sort of wish
I<00:03:44.550> had<00:03:44.730> ferrothorn<00:03:45.180> still<00:03:45.510> around<00:03:45.780> because<00:03:46.140> I

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
I had ferrothorn still around because I

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.080 
I had ferrothorn still around because I
could<00:03:46.380> probably<00:03:46.530> hit<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.739> with<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.890> power<00:03:47.790> whip

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
could probably hit it with a power whip

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.640 
could probably hit it with a power whip
or<00:03:48.360> maybe<00:03:48.540> set<00:03:48.750> up<00:03:48.780> another<00:03:48.989> layover<00:03:49.260> spikes

gastro<00:04:03.510> don<00:04:03.630> is<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:04.020> hard<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.230> take<00:04:04.440> down

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
gastro don is really hard to take down

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.930 
gastro don is really hard to take down
so<00:04:05.190> he's<00:04:05.310> gonna<00:04:05.400> go<00:04:05.580> for<00:04:05.610> an<00:04:05.760> ice<00:04:05.820> cream

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
so he's gonna go for an ice cream

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.340 
so he's gonna go for an ice cream
actually<00:04:06.120> gets<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.450> free<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:06.840> our<00:04:06.959> first<00:04:07.080> i<00:04:07.260> was

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
actually gets a free so our first i was

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.830 
actually gets a free so our first i was
like<00:04:07.380> but<00:04:08.220> it's<00:04:08.520> ok<00:04:08.760> because<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.120> thought<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.720> out

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
like but it's ok because I thought I out

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.600 
like but it's ok because I thought I out
first<00:04:10.200> turn<00:04:10.440> which<00:04:10.650> was<00:04:10.830> really<00:04:11.040> lucky<00:04:11.250> for<00:04:11.370> me

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
first turn which was really lucky for me

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.340 
first turn which was really lucky for me
so<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.450> doesn't<00:04:12.540> really<00:04:12.780> matter<00:04:12.989> at<00:04:13.230> all

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
so it doesn't really matter at all

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.930 
so it doesn't really matter at all
although<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:14.040> was<00:04:14.130> kind<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.370> scary<00:04:14.489> when<00:04:14.820> it

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
although it was kind of scary when it

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.870 
although it was kind of scary when it
happens<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:16.200> I<00:04:16.590> estimated<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.190> his<00:04:17.370> Kyogre

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
happens and I estimated that his Kyogre

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.370 
happens and I estimated that his Kyogre
is<00:04:18.030> probably<00:04:18.299> gonna<00:04:18.419> be<00:04:18.480> dying<00:04:18.810> around<00:04:19.019> next

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
is probably gonna be dying around next

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.260 
is probably gonna be dying around next
turn<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.739> toxic<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.790> really<00:04:20.970> don't<00:04:21.030> want<00:04:21.210> to

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
turn to toxic and I really don't want to

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.730 
turn to toxic and I really don't want to
stay<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:21.479> with<00:04:21.600> my<00:04:21.720> gastro<00:04:22.140> Don<00:04:22.260> because<00:04:22.560> he

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
stay in with my gastro Don because he

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.020 
stay in with my gastro Don because he
could<00:04:22.860> potentially<00:04:23.370> set<00:04:23.580> up<00:04:23.669> on<00:04:23.760> me<00:04:23.880> with

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
could potentially set up on me with

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.909 
could potentially set up on me with
Rayquaza<00:04:24.510> if<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.229> don't<00:04:25.410> get<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.530> burn<00:04:25.740> with

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
Rayquaza if I don't get a burn with

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.240 
Rayquaza if I don't get a burn with
skull

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
skull

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.470 
skull
and<00:04:26.520> that's<00:04:26.850> going<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.030> be<00:04:27.090> really<00:04:27.240> dangerous

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
and that's going to be really dangerous

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.300 
and that's going to be really dangerous
for<00:04:27.930> my<00:04:28.080> remaining<00:04:28.440> Pokemon<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.070> I'm<00:04:29.130> going<00:04:29.250> to

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
for my remaining Pokemon so I'm going to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.680 
for my remaining Pokemon so I'm going to
switch<00:04:29.490> out<00:04:29.640> into<00:04:29.910> Kyogre<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.450> take<00:04:30.600> the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
switch out into Kyogre to take the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.600 
switch out into Kyogre to take the
predicted<00:04:31.170> ice<00:04:31.320> beam<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:32.280> do<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.430> manage

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
predicted ice beam and I do you manage

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.280 
predicted ice beam and I do you manage
to<00:04:32.850> take<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.120> really<00:04:33.390> well<00:04:33.540> because<00:04:33.750> Kyogre

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
to take that really well because Kyogre

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.140 
to take that really well because Kyogre
is<00:04:34.410> very<00:04:34.590> much<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.800> bulky<00:04:35.190> Pokemon<00:04:35.610> despite<00:04:36.030> the

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
is very much a bulky Pokemon despite the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.520 
is very much a bulky Pokemon despite the
fact<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.600> has<00:04:36.690> really<00:04:36.900> high<00:04:37.080> special

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
fact that it has really high special

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.040 
fact that it has really high special
attack<00:04:37.770> as<00:04:37.920> well<00:04:38.160> it<00:04:38.670> actually<00:04:38.820> hits<00:04:39.120> 438<00:04:39.870> with

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
attack as well it actually hits 438 with

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.840 
attack as well it actually hits 438 with
my<00:04:40.200> spread<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:40.770> that<00:04:40.920> is<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.220> maximum<00:04:41.400> by<00:04:41.790> the

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
my spread so that is the maximum by the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.700 
my spread so that is the maximum by the
way<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:42.780> looks<00:04:42.930> like<00:04:42.990> my<00:04:43.200> prediction<00:04:43.590> was

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
way so it looks like my prediction was

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.530 
way so it looks like my prediction was
correct<00:04:43.770> or<00:04:44.160> calculations<00:04:44.880> at<00:04:45.030> least<00:04:45.210> because

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
correct or calculations at least because

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.390 
correct or calculations at least because
he<00:04:45.630> does<00:04:45.810> die<00:04:46.020> out<00:04:46.170> to<00:04:46.410> toxic<00:04:46.920> at<00:04:47.040> this<00:04:47.160> point

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
he does die out to toxic at this point

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.310 
he does die out to toxic at this point
which<00:04:47.550> is<00:04:47.580> really<00:04:47.880> good<00:04:48.060> actually<00:04:48.810> sends<00:04:49.230> out

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
which is really good actually sends out

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.230 
which is really good actually sends out
his<00:04:49.350> Rayquaza<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.310> as<00:04:50.670> I've<00:04:50.820> said<00:04:50.850> it's<00:04:51.150> going

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
his Rayquaza and as I've said it's going

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.370 
his Rayquaza and as I've said it's going
to<00:04:51.300> be<00:04:51.420> pretty<00:04:51.510> dangerous<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:52.140> I<00:04:52.170> can't

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
to be pretty dangerous and I can't

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.020 
to be pretty dangerous and I can't
afford<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.680> let<00:04:52.920> it<00:04:53.070> have<00:04:53.250> an<00:04:53.370> opportunity<00:04:53.670> to

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
afford to let it have an opportunity to

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.270 
afford to let it have an opportunity to
set<00:04:54.480> up<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:55.140> I'm<00:04:55.350> just<00:04:55.470> gonna<00:04:55.560> have<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.950> stay

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
set up so I'm just gonna have to stay

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.190 
set up so I'm just gonna have to stay
into<00:04:56.730> extreme<00:04:57.360> speed<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:57.840> finish<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.110> off

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
into extreme speed and finish it off

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.110 
into extreme speed and finish it off
with<00:04:58.230> ice<00:04:58.500> beam<00:04:58.770> luckily<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.550> have<00:04:59.640> enough<00:04:59.850> bulk

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
with ice beam luckily I have enough bulk

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.580 
with ice beam luckily I have enough bulk
to<00:05:00.300> finish<00:05:00.570> them<00:05:00.690> off<00:05:00.810> with<00:05:00.960> ice<00:05:01.110> beam<00:05:01.350> even

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
to finish them off with ice beam even

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.140 
to finish them off with ice beam even
after<00:05:01.830> that<00:05:01.950> live<00:05:02.190> for<00:05:02.400> boosted<00:05:02.790> extreme

after that live for boosted extreme

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.760 
after that live for boosted extreme
speed<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:03.870> can<00:05:03.990> see<00:05:04.140> here<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.410> that

extra HP investment that I'm running in
v's<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.230> going<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.530> be<00:05:07.590> pretty<00:05:07.770> useful<00:05:07.950> because

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
v's is going to be pretty useful because

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.610 
v's is going to be pretty useful because
I<00:05:08.520> do<00:05:08.580> manage<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:08.940> survive<00:05:09.300> that<00:05:09.660> narrowly<00:05:10.050> so

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
I do manage to survive that narrowly so

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.930 
I do manage to survive that narrowly so
he's<00:05:10.740> going<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:10.919> go<00:05:11.010> out<00:05:11.040> into<00:05:11.310> his<00:05:11.460> Infernape

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
he's going to go out into his Infernape

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.310 
he's going to go out into his Infernape
now<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.419> suspect<00:05:12.630> that<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:13.050> will<00:05:13.140> probably

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
now and I suspect that it will probably

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.870 
now and I suspect that it will probably
finish<00:05:13.530> me<00:05:13.740> off<00:05:13.770> with<00:05:13.890> a<00:05:14.070> mock<00:05:14.250> punch<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:14.850> I

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
finish me off with a mock punch so I

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.850 
finish me off with a mock punch so I
just<00:05:15.120> decided<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.720> stay<00:05:16.050> in<00:05:16.080> not<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.740> let

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
just decided to stay in not to let

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.680 
just decided to stay in not to let
anything<00:05:17.070> else<00:05:17.310> take<00:05:17.460> damage<00:05:17.669> actually<00:05:18.540> gets

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
anything else take damage actually gets

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.360 
anything else take damage actually gets
a<00:05:18.780> crit<00:05:19.140> though<00:05:19.320> so<00:05:19.560> I'm<00:05:19.710> pretty<00:05:19.860> glad<00:05:20.040> that<00:05:20.160> I

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
a crit though so I'm pretty glad that I

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.500 
a crit though so I'm pretty glad that I
didn't<00:05:20.610> have<00:05:20.700> anything<00:05:20.910> else<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.210> take<00:05:21.330> that

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
crypt so at this point I'm just going to

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.850 
crypt so at this point I'm just going to
go<00:05:23.250> into<00:05:23.460> lugia<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.210> this<00:05:24.720> is<00:05:24.840> a<00:05:24.870> sub<00:05:25.200> reset<00:05:25.650> if

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
go into lugia and this is a sub reset if

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.930 
go into lugia and this is a sub reset if
you've<00:05:25.980> ever<00:05:26.100> played<00:05:26.280> with<00:05:26.490> submarines

Abydos and fortune know you then you can

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.650 
Abydos and fortune know you then you can
you<00:05:29.430> pretty<00:05:29.640> much<00:05:29.669> know<00:05:29.970> how<00:05:30.120> effective<00:05:30.570> this

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
you pretty much know how effective this

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.180 
you pretty much know how effective this
set<00:05:30.870> can<00:05:30.990> be<00:05:31.050> I'd<00:05:31.410> say<00:05:31.620> it's<00:05:31.740> actually<00:05:32.010> better

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
set can be I'd say it's actually better

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.610 
set can be I'd say it's actually better
in<00:05:32.430> ubers<00:05:32.760> so<00:05:33.390> I'm<00:05:33.540> just<00:05:33.720> going<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:34.020> roost<00:05:34.440> off

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
in ubers so I'm just going to roost off

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.110 
in ubers so I'm just going to roost off
the<00:05:34.740> damage<00:05:34.919> from<00:05:35.190> Stealth<00:05:35.490> Rock<00:05:35.640> while<00:05:36.030> he

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
goes to his star Raptor no intimidate so

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.469 
goes to his star Raptor no intimidate so
that<00:05:38.370> means<00:05:38.550> he<00:05:38.640> has<00:05:38.760> reckless<00:05:39.180> as<00:05:39.330> his

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
that means he has reckless as his

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.150 
that means he has reckless as his
ability<00:05:39.930> which<00:05:40.320> means<00:05:40.530> he's<00:05:40.650> gonna<00:05:40.740> do<00:05:40.919> it<00:05:41.040> be

lugia<00:05:43.470> is<00:05:43.650> extremely<00:05:44.340> bulky<00:05:44.729> it's<00:05:44.970> probably

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
lugia is extremely bulky it's probably

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.000 
lugia is extremely bulky it's probably
one<00:05:45.390> of<00:05:45.419> the<00:05:45.540> best<00:05:45.690> walls<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.140> movers<00:05:46.410> so<00:05:46.919> I'm

one of the best walls and movers so I'm

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.050

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
going to be able to take that pretty

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.400 
going to be able to take that pretty
well<00:05:48.210> with<00:05:48.510> a<00:05:48.540> little<00:05:48.810> bit<00:05:48.990> over<00:05:49.200> a<00:05:49.229> half

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
well with a little bit over a half

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.050 
well with a little bit over a half
health<00:05:49.650> remaining<00:05:50.100> so<00:05:50.520> I'm<00:05:50.610> just<00:05:50.729> gonna<00:05:50.850> go

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
health remaining so I'm just gonna go

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.640 
health remaining so I'm just gonna go
for<00:05:51.240> that<00:05:51.270> dragon<00:05:51.810> tail<00:05:51.960> because<00:05:52.169> it's<00:05:52.500> a

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
for that dragon tail because it's a

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.990 
for that dragon tail because it's a
pretty<00:05:52.890> good<00:05:53.040> facing<00:05:53.400> move<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:53.729> it<00:05:53.790> lets<00:05:53.940> me

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
pretty good facing move and it lets me

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.640 
pretty good facing move and it lets me
rack<00:05:54.270> up<00:05:54.419> some<00:05:54.450> more<00:05:54.630> entry<00:05:54.960> hazard<00:05:55.290> damage

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
rack up some more entry hazard damage

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.469 
rack up some more entry hazard damage
and<00:05:55.890> that<00:05:56.400> pretty<00:05:56.580> much<00:05:56.669> means<00:05:56.940> that<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.240> next

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
and that pretty much means that the next

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:58.880 
and that pretty much means that the next
time<00:05:57.600> sir<00:05:57.780> Raptor<00:05:58.110> switches<00:05:58.500> in<00:05:58.620> he's<00:05:58.770> going

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
time sir Raptor switches in he's going

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.740 
time sir Raptor switches in he's going
to<00:05:58.950> be<00:05:59.070> dead<00:05:59.610> anyway<00:05:59.910> so<00:06:00.030> he's<00:06:00.450> not<00:06:00.570> going<00:06:00.630> to

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
to be dead anyway so he's not going to

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.990 
to be dead anyway so he's not going to
be<00:06:00.810> able<00:06:00.900> to<00:06:01.200> come<00:06:01.350> in<00:06:01.470> another<00:06:01.650> time<00:06:01.950> and<00:06:02.669> his

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
be able to come in another time and his

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.159 
be able to come in another time and his
Infernape<00:06:03.390> is<00:06:03.510> just<00:06:03.690> going<00:06:03.780> to<00:06:03.870> go<00:06:03.960> for<00:06:04.140> a

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
Infernape is just going to go for a

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.480 
Infernape is just going to go for a
flare<00:06:04.440> blitz<00:06:04.620> I<00:06:04.890> thought<00:06:05.040> it'd<00:06:05.190> be<00:06:05.220> safe<00:06:05.460> to

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
flare blitz I thought it'd be safe to

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.219 
flare blitz I thought it'd be safe to
stay<00:06:05.790> in<00:06:05.940> because<00:06:06.240> since<00:06:06.720> he<00:06:06.810> switched<00:06:07.080> out

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
stay in because since he switched out

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.750 
stay in because since he switched out
last<00:06:07.470> time<00:06:07.590> I<00:06:07.710> presumed<00:06:08.340> that<00:06:08.430> means<00:06:08.640> he

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
last time I presumed that means he

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.430 
last time I presumed that means he
doesn't<00:06:08.850> have<00:06:09.120> stone<00:06:09.419> edge<00:06:09.630> so<00:06:10.229> I'm<00:06:10.290> just

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
doesn't have stone edge so I'm just

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.840 
doesn't have stone edge so I'm just
going<00:06:10.560> to<00:06:10.620> go<00:06:10.680> for<00:06:10.890> another<00:06:10.950> dragon<00:06:11.490> tail<00:06:11.640> and

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
going to go for another dragon tail and

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.790 
going to go for another dragon tail and
that<00:06:11.940> open<00:06:12.180> infernape<00:06:12.720> into<00:06:13.080> KO<00:06:13.320> range<00:06:13.590> for

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
that open infernape into KO range for

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.950 
that open infernape into KO range for
entry<00:06:14.010> hazards<00:06:14.310> as<00:06:14.460> well<00:06:14.700> so<00:06:15.240> staraptor<00:06:15.540> comes

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
entry hazards as well so staraptor comes

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.420 
entry hazards as well so staraptor comes
in<00:06:16.110> dices<00:06:16.560> stealth<00:06:16.800> rock<00:06:17.010> which<00:06:17.160> is<00:06:17.190> pretty

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
in dices stealth rock which is pretty

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.190 
in dices stealth rock which is pretty
good<00:06:17.520> next<00:06:18.150> tournament<00:06:18.479> infernape<00:06:18.870> comes<00:06:19.080> in

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
good next tournament infernape comes in

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.600 
good next tournament infernape comes in
I<00:06:19.320> do<00:06:19.380> have<00:06:19.560> stealth<00:06:19.860> rock<00:06:20.040> in<00:06:20.130> one<00:06:20.310> layer<00:06:20.490> of

I do have stealth rock in one layer of

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.460 
I do have stealth rock in one layer of
spikes<00:06:20.910> up<00:06:21.150> so<00:06:21.510> that<00:06:21.630> means<00:06:21.660> infernape<00:06:22.260> is<00:06:22.350> us

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
spikes up so that means infernape is us

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.409 
spikes up so that means infernape is us
going<00:06:22.680> to<00:06:22.740> be<00:06:22.800> going<00:06:22.979> down<00:06:23.280> right<00:06:23.550> now<00:06:23.610> so<00:06:24.270> that
