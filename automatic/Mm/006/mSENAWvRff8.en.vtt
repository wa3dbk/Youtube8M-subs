 It looks like a printer screen key 9 Home screen 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.700

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:31.620
 It's probably not at first 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.620
 I think I need some time to adjust. 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.350

 Of course, Windows and Mac in the house is a little more flexible than a laptop. 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.580
 It looks like it's still too much. 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.200
 But as I said before, it's like simple document work or an outdoor cafe. 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.030
 To do this, 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.400

 For to understand enough ratings highs 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:04.970
 So let 's check it out. 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.870
 Once I play the video, check it once in the body to see if it works properly. 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.220
 I will surely 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:15.650
 Oh, before that, before the test and waterproof test, 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.209

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.220
 You do not have to . 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.360
 The other part is stuck with no problem. 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.360
 Once you hear the play 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.560
 But I will be heavy 4 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:50.050
 I can confirm that it works properly even if I put it in water now. 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.340
 But being a security waterproof guys coming 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.680
