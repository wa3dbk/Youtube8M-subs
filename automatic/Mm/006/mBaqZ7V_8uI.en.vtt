sides with some double-sided tape and
then<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:40.520> use<00:01:40.759> another<00:01:41.329> cutter<00:01:41.630> part<00:01:41.960> there

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
half and rounded the corners so you

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.780 
half and rounded the corners so you
