 I have decided to bring and make available 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.670
 You're right, I did the texture. 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.100

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.229
 by good hit functions 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.009

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.530

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.450

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.090
 conferring air with which the arc is such 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.130
 particle here when you throw the bow 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.110

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.700
 very beautiful and very easy to recognize 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.950
 It's right, let's continue here in our 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.079
 area you can be watching here 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.060

 You can see they're all from 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.180
 hunger because I miss the most 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.910
 then I think it's according to the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.440
 kind of texture that short and here are 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.200

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.790
 easy to be recognized no 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.070
 similar to another's right is O 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.050
 very easy to recognize even here 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.030
 are the armors also made from scratch 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.519

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.440

 color more flagged that I put a 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.069

 What do you fucking hate and is there? 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.630

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.669
 You can see that. It's okay. 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.570
 Softly then it will not disturb anything

 It's tnt that I think it's not much. 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.690
 No one needs much 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.880

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.190
