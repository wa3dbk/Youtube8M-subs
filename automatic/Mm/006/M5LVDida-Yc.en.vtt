00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.390
 with the band that has meteoric rise 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.990

 we arrived yesterday just to come to the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.110
 radio we walk a little bit of silver 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.810
 what they thought a square cut the day 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.670
 accompany this process 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.880

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.880
 energies 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.150
 first to all 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.180

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.340
 how long does the look actually 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.460
 our first public touch was the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.280
 December 15 last year so 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.120
 we started 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.460
 does very little but with a 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.370
 incredible impact over 700,000 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.510
 visits this video for example video and 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.610
 theme for those who are listening 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.890
 on the radio those who now listen in 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.479
 radio can be added on the internet to radio 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.500
 on tv dotcom you can see them live 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.500
 to the Malaysian guys 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.130
 ace 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.170
 and living has an important data of 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.750
 where they are born a little bit that if 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.000
 you asked there but one always has 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.220
 someone seen an inspiring muse the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.070
 client boys were inspired by someone 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.660
 to to make this kind of 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.600
 music that has a samba base 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:01.710
