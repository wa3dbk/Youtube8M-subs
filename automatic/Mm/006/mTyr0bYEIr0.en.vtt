00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.220
 background on facebook and on my website I 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.260

 to see Peru we have 8 although girls 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.150
 then let's start with our 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.120
 eyes and you need your prebase of shadows and 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.960
 this is from medex bites and although it 's 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.960
 this all clarito diffuses very well 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.840
 on the skin you have to apply it on the part 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 from above and in the bottom part after 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.890
 let's take some external umbrellas 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.760
 a like that vanilla type and then we want 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.900
 another one as well as the pink gold and 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:31.300
 let's apply it here in the basin here 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.300
 already after that we go with the rose 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.640
 It's beautiful golden brown and we 're going to apply it 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.619
 in almond ok and now let's do 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.290
 something different the place that we are going to use 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.659
 I will use the mouse as a shadow 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.920
 this is the blush now I'm going to apply it 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.399
 on the eyelid to give it that little touch 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.659
 I want it to look like more harder 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:00.380
 more pink myth and we go to the champagne 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.670
 we want to illuminate here below in the part 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.190
 from below starting with that rosita and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.680
 let's go with the rumor 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.140
 we also apply it and now we're going to 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.240
 do something different let's take can 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.370
 to be a pencil this something that slips 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.370
 well according to the angel line as if I'm going 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.480
 to use this and you are going to take a brush to 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.990
 the eyebrow but that is synthetic so that 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.840
 you can use him here with him 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.830
 cream eyeliner and let's make up 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.780
 the inside part of the same top 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.600
 and well you can see how the line of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.580
 my eyes looks darker and that's what 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.250
 that we want we do not want that much much 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.250
 delineated and here sticky eyelashes 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.420
 let's apply the black eyeliner and 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.150
 after what was left we are not going to 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.610
 apply more let's put it down here and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.730
 now let's take a shade gray and 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.360
 is and with this we are going to apply it 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.260
 nothing else in the corner 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.880
 now we blur again and I wanted 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.880
 add this distillate that are the 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.240
 magnificent numbers in the kit in then 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:20.430
 nothing more here in the center in the past 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:24.000
 very nice and now we are going to subtract the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.200
 tab from the base and we go with the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.200
 mascara too 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.230
 pretty lashes and we're going to 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.230
 apply the tabs below but 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.230
 only 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.030
 then we are going to apply a bit of 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.210
 bronzer that is what attracts me and 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:48.790
 I'm using this one called miami 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:51.250
 glow and then we use the blush that 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.440
 we had previously used and 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.770
 it will give a touch anything else here 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.040
 well where we smile and finally I bring 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.460
 two labials this one is more mathew than they see 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.410
 the color is called classic but 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.070
 I also have this one called pink 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.250
 suter that I bring a few are about 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.020
 Glitters to give as well as 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.510
 so that the lips look like this means 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.790
 hydrated but that I do not have hair no 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.769

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.940
