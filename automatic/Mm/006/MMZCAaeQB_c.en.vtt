a hand it's quite clear and magnified

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.410 
a hand it's quite clear and magnified
view<00:00:42.420> let's<00:00:43.260> bring<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> around<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.980> way<00:00:47.420> as

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
view let's bring it around this way as

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.049 
view let's bring it around this way as
we<00:00:48.690> move<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.550> bones<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
we move it we can see the bones of the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.290 
we move it we can see the bones of the
hand<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> wrist<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:53.059> also<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.149> can

hand and the wrist and also we can

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.639 
hand and the wrist and also we can
rotate<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.780> around<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
rotate it around and get it more of a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
rotate it around and get it more of a
three-dimensional<00:00:56.539> 360-degree<00:00:57.539> view<00:00:57.809> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
what's going on in the hand as we back

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.139 
what's going on in the hand as we back
off<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> little<00:01:01.680> bit<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.789> see<00:01:02.969> how<00:01:03.120> our

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
off a little bit you can see how our

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.939 
off a little bit you can see how our
fingers<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.750> doing<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.320> diagnose

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
fingers are doing we can diagnose

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.880 
fingers are doing we can diagnose
fractures<00:01:05.640> dislocations<00:01:06.890> instability

things<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:09.830> on<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> side<00:01:11.700> view<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.030> can

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
things like that on the side view we can

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
things like that on the side view we can
also<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.990> how<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> bones<00:01:13.619> move<00:01:14.010> together<00:01:14.400> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
also see how the bones move together and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.690 
also see how the bones move together and
it's<00:01:15.500> quite<00:01:16.500> fascinating<00:01:17.189> how<00:01:17.280> all<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> bones

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it's quite fascinating how all the bones

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.120 
it's quite fascinating how all the bones
of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.939> hand<00:01:18.180> move<00:01:18.420> together<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:19.130> one

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
of the hand move together in one

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.149 
of the hand move together in one
direction<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.790> another

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
direction or another

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.280 
direction or another
sometimes<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.400> x-rays<00:01:24.000> we'll<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:25.049> won't<00:01:25.200> be

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
sometimes on x-rays we'll we won't be

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.899 
sometimes on x-rays we'll we won't be
able<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.650> things<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.460> getting<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
able to see things and just getting a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.460 
able to see things and just getting a
slightly<00:01:27.270> different<00:01:27.509> view<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.290> help

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
slightly different view can really help

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.670 
slightly different view can really help
us<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:29.610> diagnosing<00:01:30.570> things<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.439> view

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
us in diagnosing things and on this view

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.840 
us in diagnosing things and on this view
she's<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.040> we're<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.280> even<00:01:32.490> taking<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
she's not we're not even taking a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.160 
she's not we're not even taking a
picture<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.150> her<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.810> play<00:01:33.990> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
picture of her but we can just play this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.170 
picture of her but we can just play this
back<00:01:34.409> over<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.950> over<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.520> an<00:01:35.610> idea<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> how

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
back over and over to get an idea of how

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.080 
back over and over to get an idea of how
things<00:01:36.509> are<00:01:36.720> moving<00:01:36.979> in<00:01:37.979> surgery<00:01:38.579> when<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.909> use
