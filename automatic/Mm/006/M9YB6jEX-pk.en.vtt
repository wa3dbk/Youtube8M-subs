having<00:01:44.369> humans<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.409> hope

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
having humans in it so I really hope

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.289 
having humans in it so I really hope
they<00:01:46.740> don't<00:01:46.890> go<00:01:46.979> into<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.520> stereotypical

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
right right Oh besides this isn't even

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460

an<00:02:11.819> official<00:02:12.150> trailer<00:02:12.510> we'll<00:02:12.750> probably<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
an official trailer we'll probably get a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.840 
an official trailer we'll probably get a
one<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> month<00:02:13.890> or<00:02:14.040> two<00:02:14.160> before<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.460> movie<00:02:14.790> is

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
one a month or two before the movie is

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.100 
one a month or two before the movie is
released<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.450> we'll<00:02:15.600> have<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.840> better<00:02:15.990> idea

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
released so we'll have a better idea

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.140 
released so we'll have a better idea
what's<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.800> happen<00:02:17.100> now<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:17.970> are<00:02:18.030> just

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
what's going to happen now here are just

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.520 
what's going to happen now here are just
some<00:02:18.300> things<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.690> would<00:02:18.810> either<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:18.960> expecting

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
some things I would either be expecting

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.440 
some things I would either be expecting
or<00:02:19.710> hoping<00:02:19.740> not<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> see<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:20.670> movie<00:02:21.000> also

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
or hoping not to see in this movie also

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.000 
or hoping not to see in this movie also
some<00:02:22.020> things<00:02:22.200> from<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.380> first<00:02:22.620> flick<00:02:22.830> that

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
some things from the first flick that

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.350 
some things from the first flick that
may<00:02:23.250> or<00:02:23.340> may<00:02:23.460> not<00:02:23.490> make<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.790> second<00:02:24.060> appearance

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
may or may not make a second appearance

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.180 
may or may not make a second appearance
so<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.380> has<00:02:25.530> nothing<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
so this has nothing to do with the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.650 
so this has nothing to do with the
trailer<00:02:26.490> itself<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.570> overall

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
trailer itself but just the overall

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.710 
trailer itself but just the overall
concept<00:02:28.050> first<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:29.220> sunset<00:02:29.760> shimmer<00:02:29.790> has<00:02:30.510> she

concept first up sunset shimmer has she
truly<00:02:31.050> been<00:02:31.170> redeemed<00:02:31.470> will<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:31.950> see<00:02:32.130> her<00:02:32.280> as

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
truly been redeemed will we see her as
