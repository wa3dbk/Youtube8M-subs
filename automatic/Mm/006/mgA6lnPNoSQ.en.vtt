00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:13.950
 This time sec elevator is Koyo Co., Ltd. in Sapporo and Stirling for household use 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.950
 Jointly developed the engine generator 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:25.259
 This generator generates 1 kilowatt of electricity and about 60 soils in a row every hour . 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.259
 can do 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:39.910
 The cost of producing electricity in the fuel we use kerosene is very and about 10 yen per 1 kilowatt economy 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.910
 Efficient and efficient system 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:56.010
 Since Stirling engine is a conceptual organization utilizing external heat 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:05.059
 Besides kerosene waste and rice husk 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:05.059
 We can generate electricity with various heat sources such as woody biomass natural gas thinning materials 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:20.050
 The newly developed kerosene generator will generate approximately 24 kilowatts a day 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:26.650
 Is possible and does not depend on five factors such as weather 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:28.270
 Provides stable electricity for 24 hours by using it in combination with a battery or other storage device 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.310
 Can be 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 It can also be used as a household emergency power source by storing electricity . 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:50.050
 At the same time , of course, the large hot water that is generated at the same time is used for washing and bathing etc. 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:52.380
 It can be used in many ways such as warm air heaters and road heating greenhouses for agriculture. 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.380
 I will 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:03.780
 sec Elevator is the world's first unique demonstration of the functionality and safety of this generator 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.960
 Commercialized generator 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:12.720
 co2 reduction and waste treatment 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.959
 We want to aim for further social contribution by providing low cost energy 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.959
 I will
