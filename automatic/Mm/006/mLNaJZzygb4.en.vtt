does the taxi ride of the future feel

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.490 
does the taxi ride of the future feel
like<00:00:15.730> I<00:00:15.969> headed<00:00:16.720> out<00:00:16.840> onto<00:00:16.990> the<00:00:17.170> German

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
like I headed out onto the German

Autobahn for the drive of my life it's
not<00:00:20.350> difficult<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.859> use<00:00:20.949> either<00:00:21.340> all<00:00:22.029> you<00:00:22.269> have

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
not difficult to use either all you have

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.670 
not difficult to use either all you have
to<00:00:22.510> do<00:00:22.600> is<00:00:22.720> push<00:00:22.930> the<00:00:23.050> two<00:00:23.199> buttons<00:00:23.529> on<00:00:23.650> the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
to do is push the two buttons on the

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.500 
to do is push the two buttons on the
steering<00:00:23.800> wheel<00:00:24.099> and<00:00:24.400> then<00:00:24.640> the<00:00:24.730> a7<00:00:25.240> s<00:00:25.300> brain

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
steering wheel and then the a7 s brain

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.589 
steering wheel and then the a7 s brain
takes<00:00:25.840> over<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:27.099> we<00:00:27.250> just<00:00:27.490> entered<00:00:27.970> piloting

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
takes over so we just entered piloting

towards the - its Sun rating up to 80
miles<00:00:34.300> an<00:00:34.540> hour<00:00:34.720> and<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:36.130> very<00:00:36.880> very<00:00:37.210> simple

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
miles an hour and it's very very simple

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.500 
miles an hour and it's very very simple
it's<00:00:37.900> easy<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:39.250> indicating<00:00:39.820> for<00:00:40.000> itself<00:00:40.240> now

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
it's easy it's indicating for itself now

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.650 
it's easy it's indicating for itself now
we<00:00:40.540> just<00:00:40.930> changed<00:00:41.500> lanes<00:00:42.480> accelerating<00:00:43.480> back

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
we just changed lanes accelerating back

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.470 
we just changed lanes accelerating back
up<00:00:43.840> towards<00:00:44.230> 80<00:00:44.380> miles<00:00:44.740> an<00:00:44.860> hour<00:00:45.040> it's<00:00:45.790> very

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
up towards 80 miles an hour it's very

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.370 
up towards 80 miles an hour it's very
weird<00:00:46.900> but<00:00:47.410> very<00:00:47.830> cool<00:00:48.130> as<00:00:48.430> well<00:00:49.080> as<00:00:50.080> you<00:00:50.230> can

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
weird but very cool as well as you can

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.160 
weird but very cool as well as you can
see<00:00:50.650> just<00:00:51.070> relaxed<00:00:51.760> behind<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.150> wheel<00:00:52.360> it's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
see just relaxed behind the wheel it's

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.800 
see just relaxed behind the wheel it's
making<00:00:53.620> small<00:00:54.040> corrections<00:00:54.790> to<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.270> steering

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
making small corrections to the steering

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.600 
making small corrections to the steering
and<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.050> brakes<00:00:56.110> and<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.650> accelerators<00:00:57.400> are

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
and the brakes and the accelerators are

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.190 
and the brakes and the accelerators are
moving<00:00:57.880> along<00:00:57.970> just<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.750> keep<00:00:58.900> it<00:00:59.080> in<00:00:59.170> check

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
moving along just to keep it in check

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.259 
moving along just to keep it in check
but<00:00:59.950> it<00:01:00.010> feels<00:01:00.190> just<00:01:00.370> like<00:01:00.790> in<00:01:00.940> normal<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.540> seven

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
but it feels just like in normal a seven

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.580 
but it feels just like in normal a seven
at<00:01:04.269> first<00:01:04.510> it<00:01:04.690> was<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.809> bit<00:01:04.870> nerve-wracking

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
at first it was a bit nerve-wracking

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.890 
at first it was a bit nerve-wracking
letting<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.920> car<00:01:06.130> take<00:01:06.400> control<00:01:06.760> but<00:01:07.630> I<00:01:07.660> soon

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
letting the car take control but I soon

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.750 
letting the car take control but I soon
learned<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.290> trust<00:01:08.470> my<00:01:08.680> virtual<00:01:09.130> chauffeur

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
learned to trust my virtual chauffeur

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.730 
learned to trust my virtual chauffeur
which<00:01:10.090> meant<00:01:10.330> I<00:01:10.420> could<00:01:10.570> make<00:01:10.780> some<00:01:10.960> notes<00:01:11.200> have

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
which meant I could make some notes have

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.110 
which meant I could make some notes have
a<00:01:11.770> drink<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.250> even<00:01:12.970> send<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.270> text<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.790> just

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
a drink and even send a text so just

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.580 
a drink and even send a text so just
learn<00:01:16.360> them<00:01:16.540> we're<00:01:16.660> coming<00:01:16.840> up<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.200> truck

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
learn them we're coming up to a truck

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.100 
learn them we're coming up to a truck
slowed<00:01:18.190> down<00:01:18.430> slightly<00:01:18.730> but<00:01:19.060> took<00:01:19.780> stock<00:01:20.050> of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
slowed down slightly but took stock of

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.660 
slowed down slightly but took stock of
its<00:01:20.380> surroundings<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:20.980> then<00:01:21.070> pulled<00:01:21.370> out<00:01:21.490> and

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
its surroundings and then pulled out and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.030 
its surroundings and then pulled out and
we're<00:01:21.760> accelerating<00:01:22.030> past<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.780> lorry<00:01:23.410> now

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
we're accelerating past the lorry now

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.880 
we're accelerating past the lorry now
but<00:01:25.550> is<00:01:26.090> weird

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.609 

put<00:01:30.400> it<00:01:30.490> back<00:01:30.610> in

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.550 

so<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.490> had<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.929> pull<00:01:36.929> off<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> motorway

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
so we just had to pull off the motorway

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.880 
so we just had to pull off the motorway
and<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.750> regain<00:01:40.109> manual<00:01:40.500> control

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
and you can just regain manual control

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
and you can just regain manual control
by<00:01:41.130> either<00:01:41.399> pushing<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> two<00:01:42.149> buttons<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
by either pushing the two buttons on the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
by either pushing the two buttons on the
steering<00:01:42.810> wheel<00:01:43.140> or<00:01:43.590> pushing<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
steering wheel or pushing the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.190 
steering wheel or pushing the
accelerator<00:01:45.090> pedal<00:01:45.240> turning<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.929> steering

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
accelerator pedal turning the steering

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.319 
accelerator pedal turning the steering
and<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.549> hands<00:01:48.240> over<00:01:48.569> control<00:01:48.600> back<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.319> you

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
and just hands over control back to you

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.639 
and just hands over control back to you
at<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> moment<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.899> system<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
at the moment this system is just a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
at the moment this system is just a
working<00:01:52.950> prototype<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> already<00:01:53.880> reckons

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
working prototype but I already reckons

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
working prototype but I already reckons
the<00:01:54.420> tech<00:01:54.630> could<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.899> ready<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.200> sale<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.560> just

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
the tech could be ready for sale in just

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.559 
the tech could be ready for sale in just
two<00:01:56.039> years<00:01:56.069> but<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.359> problem

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
two years but there is one problem
