00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
the best ways to do that is to keep wax

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.310 
the best ways to do that is to keep wax
in<00:00:15.940> your<00:00:15.969> skis

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.460 

number<00:00:22.320> two<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:23.939> more<00:00:24.150> wax<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.660> your<00:00:24.840> base<00:00:25.020> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
number two the more wax in your base the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.470 
number two the more wax in your base the
faster<00:00:25.920> your<00:00:26.039> scheme<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.000> I'd<00:00:27.210> really

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
faster your scheme so I'd really

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.650 
faster your scheme so I'd really
encourage<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.259> try<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.890> wax<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.610> as<00:00:30.390> much

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
encourage you to try to wax as as much

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170 
encourage you to try to wax as as much
as<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.930> can<00:00:31.369> preferably<00:00:32.369> every<00:00:32.730> time<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.030> go

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
and let them sit this will make for a

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.560 
and let them sit this will make for a

remember this is a fairly soft supple

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.160 
remember this is a fairly soft supple
and<00:01:34.260> fragile<00:01:34.950> material<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.940> treat<00:01:36.870> it<00:01:36.990> with

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and fragile material so treat it with

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.310 
and fragile material so treat it with
pristine<00:01:38.040> snow<00:01:38.580> or<00:01:39.030> treated<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.720> pristine

pristine snow or treated to pristine

pristine snow or treated to pristine
snow<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.610> bases<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.240> reward<00:01:43.230> you<00:01:43.590> for

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
snow and your bases will reward you for

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.060 
snow and your bases will reward you for
that<00:01:44.010> effort

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.300 

as<00:01:47.130> an<00:01:47.940> aside<00:01:48.409> get<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.650> habit<00:01:50.010> of<00:01:50.100> brushing
