like<00:07:47.840> to<00:07:47.930> listen<00:07:48.050> to<00:07:48.199> a<00:07:48.320> Christmas<00:07:48.830> album<00:07:48.949> in

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 
like to listen to a Christmas album in

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.490 
like to listen to a Christmas album in
its<00:07:49.430> entirety<00:07:49.850> and<00:07:50.090> that's<00:07:50.419> not<00:07:50.900> always<00:07:51.139> easy

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:51.500 
its entirety and that's not always easy

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.379 
its entirety and that's not always easy
because<00:07:51.830> not<00:07:52.130> all<00:07:52.400> Christmas<00:07:52.850> albums<00:07:53.210> have

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:53.389 
because not all Christmas albums have

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:55.330 
because not all Christmas albums have
recognizable<00:07:54.169> songs

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:55.340 
recognizable songs

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.730
