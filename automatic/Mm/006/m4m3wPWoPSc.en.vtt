00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.140
 1 

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.700
 Say much 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.810
 I'll finish it and hit it 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.830
 Such Dorotani. Edge I cormorant shy 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.850
 I need to paint in that way 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.250
 Or, that is to retire in this game Boo 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.720
 Book 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.230
 Or mouth Kojima-san Ne Ja you doing press unreasonable to help you 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.070
 Do not use left over Choroi words Nante help in the time of the top 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.070
 After 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:43.010
 It's a rocky face, but it 's an opponent who can handle it with a power of 89% that doesn't affect batting. 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.010
 Anyway 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.640
 Time is good 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.120
 Need to bandage a woman 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 a hey it 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:03.050
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:05.960
 Let me tell you one good thing The first ball is straight to the outlaw 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.790
 I aim for the ball 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.550
 If you win, it's only one ball 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.550
 But mother Anta as soon as you do not strike or strike 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.070
 Also close 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.070
 I came out with a bandage on the right 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.040
 Why can I say beginners are outlaws 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.150
 Cap body white examination 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.630
 Bandage castle shines well in deep match of fence 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.630
 I wonder if today 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.500
 I had an extreme close stance that covered Kashima base 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.090
 Why not each 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.880
 Here 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.890
 Draw straight through caching 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.920
 Taichung against any small boat 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.980
 It is only Setoguchi that I believe 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.370
 April I 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.370
 me 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.210
 Oh 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.440
 It is a whistling effect 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.760
 ame 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.760
 Goodbye included 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.650
 me 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.890
 what is it 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.360
 Oh there is such experiment 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.520
 Where it was shot 50 shots a radius of 10cm to the master of shooting 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:45.450
 I was totally fired 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:47.240
 Then I hit the same point at a point where I spend hundreds of millions of dollars at a distance of 1 meter from the window. 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.690
 I tried 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.220
 What happened 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.570
 Way 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:59.000
 One meter away the result of the connection or the connection 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:04.000
 We have caught an average of 7 centimeters to the other side of the situation 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.640
 ua For the fish, the elbow of the small island was that point 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.350
 Mr. Kojima's right sugar 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.410
 Catcher is trying to throw to it also Tomozaka It has requested the straight Inhai 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.410
 The 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:21.860
 The opponent is a batter representing the ball world 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.350
 If something happens to hit your injured right elbow 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:30.510
 It do what no I guess would be I retire Kojima 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:34.760
 It is a great fear to kill the life of a good- named batter with his own ball 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.760
 I do not want to break the point of everyone
