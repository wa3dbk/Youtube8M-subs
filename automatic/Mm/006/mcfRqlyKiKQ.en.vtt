fancy<00:04:07.590> with<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.920> Aces<00:04:08.370> sometimes<00:04:08.820> they

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
fancy with the Aces sometimes they

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.880 
fancy with the Aces sometimes they
customize<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.660> Aces<00:04:09.930> individually<00:04:10.500> but

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
customize the Aces individually but

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.650 
customize the Aces individually but
personally<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> like<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.910> look<00:04:12.060> at<00:04:12.209> these<00:04:12.300> cards

I<00:04:12.780> like<00:04:13.050> when<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.440> numbers<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.580> whatnot<00:04:14.850> are

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
I like when the numbers and whatnot are

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.970 
I like when the numbers and whatnot are
shrunk<00:04:15.330> down<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:16.200> think<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.590> one<00:04:16.799> looks

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.250 
shrunk down and I think this one looks
great<00:04:17.310> as<00:04:17.489> well<00:04:17.520> alright<00:04:18.330> so<00:04:18.720> nothing<00:04:19.230> really
