00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello to all the magnificent like me of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.069
 We are with mobile phones up front 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.490
 our new google nexus 5 that that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.110
 as soon as we arrive what interests us 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.670
 immediately understand how it actually is 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.230
 this screens is not these days 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.680
 done so much that talk more about this 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.960
 screen the screen is good and a screen 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.300
 poor from 350 euros so can not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.900
 certainly be put on a par with other tops 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.939
 of range 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 what I want to offer is to show 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.660
 with your eyes you will decide 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.369
 finally a comparison with a real top 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.910
 range and not with the usual phones that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.380
 see you around in the other videos 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.030
 so here it is our nexus 5 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:50.640
 as soon as you arrive you are updating your view 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:52.710
 from above is the reflection seen from the side e 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.460
 various angles because it really is 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.710
 important 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.360
 the visual angles because if I want 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.640
 bring your head and look at your cell phone 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.070
 on the side I 'll see it well no it's something that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.030
 everyone wonders is really important 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.900
 so this is the front view 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 I have to face that I sincerely 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.890
 I think I don't use the rai instead of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.659
 I usually use a lot to carry 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.400
 more or less inclined to this corner of 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.630
 visual and how you can see this 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.939
 viewing angle as it worsens 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.040
 drastically the vision of the angle of 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.570
 visual the green robot is no longer 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.540
 green is no longer green here is so green 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.220
 and here it is no longer green by pressing this 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.509
 viewing angle 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.189
 when cell phones I usually watch it 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.960
 I have to do a little like that and I can barely manage it 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.649
 see in my green really a thing 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.299
 incredible but what counts there 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.399
 really cares to compare is the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.869
 viewing angle next to a real one 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.259
 top of the range we want to compare it with 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.259
 In fact, the nokia 60 minds to rate 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.320
 meanwhile the brightness of the display very much 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.659
 brighter and her much brighter 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.750
 defined our nokia 60 minds and 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.780
 in addition also the viewed viewing angle 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.390
 I put it this way except for the reflections on 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.450
 what you see sees the colors 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.470
 perfectly equal to before 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.470
 I do not see changes in brightness 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.580
 the situation certainly is all different and 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.569
 better in nokia sun trenti then for 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.519
 all the people who are still 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.830
 waiting for the nexus 5 and which I read in 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.510
 various forums are going to refuse 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.370
 just before reopening it second 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.940
 me is the most appropriate choice after having 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.690
 spent 350 euros or 399 euros plus 10 of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.549
 shipping I would definitely cancel 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.530
 the order and refusing the package seems to me 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.680
 the most appropriate choice is to judge yourself 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.680
 themselves
