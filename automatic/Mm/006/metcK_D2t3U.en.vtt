so<00:00:55.920> people<00:00:56.399> call<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.670> different<00:00:56.699> ways<00:00:57.180> such<00:00:58.079> as

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
so people call it different ways such as

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.790 
so people call it different ways such as
push<00:00:58.739> po<00:00:58.980> technique<00:00:59.690> open<00:01:00.690> closed<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.260> down-up

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
push po technique open closed or down-up

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.609 
push po technique open closed or down-up
technique<00:01:03.199> basically<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.439> combination

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
technique basically it's a combination

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.910 
technique basically it's a combination
of<00:01:05.070> two<00:01:05.280> movements<00:01:06.170> first<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.710> need<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of two movements first of all we need to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
of two movements first of all we need to
find<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> sweet<00:01:08.580> spot<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.090> stick<00:01:09.299> just

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
find the sweet spot of the stick just

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.200 
find the sweet spot of the stick just
like<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> molar<00:01:10.020> motion<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> first

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
like the molar motion so the first

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.270 
like the molar motion so the first
movement<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.320> pull<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.740> stick<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.159> your

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
movement you pull they stick with your

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.960 
movement you pull they stick with your
fingers<00:01:14.670> pushing<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.509> tongue<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:16.549> like<00:01:17.549> this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
fingers pushing your tongue up like this

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.100 
fingers pushing your tongue up like this
the<00:01:18.900> second<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:20.340> push<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.630> your

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the second one you push down with your

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.960 
the second one you push down with your
tongue

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
tongue

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.539 
tongue
relaxing<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.000> fingers<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
relaxing your fingers so that's the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.060 
relaxing your fingers so that's the
combination<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.360> movements<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.950> you're

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
combination of movements and you're

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
combination of movements and you're
doing<00:01:29.310> there<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:30.479> looks<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
doing there it looks like this so you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:44.749 
doing there it looks like this so you
can<00:01:33.990> start<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.500> slow<00:01:43.220> practice<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.460> really

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
can start really slow practice it really

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.179 
can start really slow practice it really
slow<00:01:44.970> first<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
slow first and then you can do the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:56.770 
slow first and then you can do the
fastest<00:01:47.610> one

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.649 

for<00:01:57.780> plain<00:01:58.020> Samba<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.710> found<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.119> start

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
for plain Samba I found that if we start

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.289 
for plain Samba I found that if we start
the<00:02:00.720> technique<00:02:01.140> upside<00:02:01.590> down<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.460> looks<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.060> lot

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the technique upside down it looks a lot

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.030 
the technique upside down it looks a lot
better<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.140> works<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.890> lot<00:02:04.979> better

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
better and it works a lot better

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.690 
better and it works a lot better
actually<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:06.180> when<00:02:06.710> we<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.740> playing<00:02:08.130> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
actually because when we are playing the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.250 
actually because when we are playing the
accent<00:02:09.330> notes<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.319> upbeats<00:02:11.630> like<00:02:12.630> this<00:02:12.900> if

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
accent notes on the upbeats like this if

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.130 
accent notes on the upbeats like this if
we're<00:02:13.530> playing<00:02:17.180> you'll<00:02:18.180> hear<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> exit<00:02:18.930> nodes

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
we're playing you'll hear the exit nodes

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.900 
we're playing you'll hear the exit nodes
are<00:02:19.440> when<00:02:19.680> you're<00:02:19.800> going<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.250> pull<00:02:20.790> your

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
are when you're going to pull your

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.970 
are when you're going to pull your
fingers<00:02:21.360> because<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.989> have<00:02:22.140> more<00:02:22.319> power<00:02:22.590> on

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
fingers because we have more power on

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.100 
fingers because we have more power on
offering<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.880> our<00:02:24.239> fingers<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.690> we<00:02:24.870> have

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
offering it on our fingers that we have

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.800 
offering it on our fingers that we have
on<00:02:25.290> our<00:02:25.530> tongue<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:27.150> you're<00:02:27.330> dope<00:02:27.510> this

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
on our tongue and if you're dope this

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.070 
on our tongue and if you're dope this
way<00:02:29.720> 1<00:02:30.720> 2<00:02:30.959> 3<00:02:31.769> 4<00:02:32.400> you'll<00:02:32.580> feel<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.209> exon<00:02:33.510> zone<00:02:33.750> on

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
way 1 2 3 4 you'll feel the exon zone on

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.009 
way 1 2 3 4 you'll feel the exon zone on
what<00:02:34.590> an<00:02:34.830> end<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.519> if<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.360> do<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.600> opposite

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
what an end and if you do the opposite

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.680 
what an end and if you do the opposite
way<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.560> way<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.709> do<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
way the way I do it

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:47.960 
way the way I do it
1<00:02:39.690> 2<00:02:40.170> 3<00:02:40.440> 4<00:02:41.340> -<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:46.500> feel<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.220> swing<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
1 2 3 4 - you feel that the swing the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.120 
1 2 3 4 - you feel that the swing the
Samba<00:02:48.330> swing<00:02:48.600> comes<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.010> little

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
Samba swing comes a little a little

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.809 
Samba swing comes a little a little
easier<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> get<00:02:51.930> dissemble<00:02:52.560> swing<00:02:52.830> we're

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
easier so to get dissemble swing we're

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.610 
easier so to get dissemble swing we're
going<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.060> start<00:02:54.269> upside<00:02:54.690> down<00:02:54.900> I'm<00:02:55.440> gonna

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
going to start upside down I'm gonna

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:11.090 
going to start upside down I'm gonna
play<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.010> really<00:02:56.370> slow<00:02:56.580> first<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.920> can

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
play is really slow first so you can

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.430 
play is really slow first so you can
feel<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.910> open<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.720> hi-hat

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
feel that you can open the the hi-hat

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.229 
feel that you can open the the hi-hat
with<00:03:13.620> your<00:03:14.519> leg<00:03:16.310> from<00:03:17.310> day<00:03:17.519> on<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> upbeats

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
with your leg from day on the upbeats

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.490 
with your leg from day on the upbeats
and<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.870> feels<00:03:19.170> more<00:03:19.530> like<00:03:19.590> Brazilian<00:03:20.280> music

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
and that feels more like Brazilian music

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.380 
and that feels more like Brazilian music
using<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.620> tempering<00:03:23.010> patter<00:03:23.250> together<00:03:23.850> with

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
using the tempering patter together with

00:03:24.390 --> 00:04:02.600 
using the tempering patter together with
the<00:03:24.570> way<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.350> technique

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.670
