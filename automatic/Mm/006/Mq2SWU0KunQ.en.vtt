00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 and then four we go in two weeks 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.160
 things of nerves the fingers for winds 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.530
 nor policemen 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.400
 I think victories always give 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.679
 trust that is you can never disconnect 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.720
 a match with the previous one and ccoo because 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.510
 It is next 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.700
 I think that today the team has been good 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.690
 my respects to block what they were 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.130
 the debut is 4 plus 4 more I do not like 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.689
 highlight but 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.629
 I think that ulises and zeballos can be 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.220
 I'm just sharing myself again very well 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.800
 are taking advantage of what are the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.660
 opportunities that they give them because they have 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.940
 that quality because they have that potential 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.820
 and so growing up is when I express 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.769
 I want it to be is it is clear that 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.899
 this may very well be the future of 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.300
 team of saints you have to be calm there 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.010
 to keep working but the truth is 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.899
 that we do things this way with 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.120
 this motherhood with this enthusiasm with 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.000
 this same intensity I think that 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.670
 also with quality games is a lot 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.310
 better form it like that then I think it has 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.340
 been good we needed to win to 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.229
 be able to be in this 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.109
 with illusions in this competition that 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.540
 we always had them from the beginning is true 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:19.350
 that has not gone as we wanted 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 there we are 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.930
 to play to win to catch what gives you the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.630
 build homes the breath 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.630
 then win and play badly 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.880
 Well, it has another cycle of work 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.369
 comes now in the Friday game but 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.590
 already with this victory and previous against 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.590
 chivas sum encouraged the team too 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.290
 no doubt that this is the work that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.020
 does on the court is done with another 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.220
 trust the joy the humility that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.770
 comes for work is different 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.960
 this is why we work in that clear sense 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.180
 that there are times when things do not go 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.550
 good and you have 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.990
 that know how to work also under those 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.280
 moments but now 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.899
 let's hope it 's a moment of stress 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.060
 time 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.790
 and that we can have all of them 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.920
 values ​​that also 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.019
 and has also recovered lost points 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.019
 of the last key and that hurts 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.180
 we want to lament and we have as I said 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.860
 here 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.319
 a prize for the match 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:40.880
 add 7 then we have to go with everything 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.990
 will play next Wednesday 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.990
 that figure more 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.000
 that we are already focused 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.170
 good evening this he showed here with 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.910
 the inmate of the game that you want 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.380
 apply on Friday against a very team 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.420
 powerful 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.670
 and they are different situations are 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.350
 different competences of the team 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.720
 I will also go to the court 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.080
 It will also be very stylish but what 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.460
 we can take advantage of here are are the 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.590
 words that I said in there or 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.870
 with one plays with that intensity with that 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.510
 quality with that company ability 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.610
 collective do not all get to run and 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.800
 when wanting to be an active part of the party 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.840
 and what is the quality potential 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.150
 individual that we have in there 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.090
 it is also noted in a more 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.480
 and that's easy but we hope 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.480
 we can 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.420
 I'm enjoying very much like to 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.530
 tell it 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.870
 a very recurring change but after 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.660
 have an alternative in the friend have 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.760
 outgoing replacement entries 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.560
 on a par with the other values ​​that today 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.050
 we ask them and others who do not 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.910
 as the second or third time they are 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.430
 earning a lot for me 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.130
 in this passion they do not have the quality 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.030
 next to these two features is 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.720
 something very important in football 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.140
 it is something we can not lose 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.900
 like so much europe 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.570
 and also by just at the end then 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.590
 it touched me ulises place of beginning and it has 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.709
 done very well 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.880
 where they happen necessary as they are 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.310
 important are the ones that are clear 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.310
 peoples can not 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.310
 two
