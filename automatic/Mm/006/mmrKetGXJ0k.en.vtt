tablets running with an AMD to mosh over
here<00:00:13.880> at<00:00:14.059> the<00:00:14.509> computex<00:00:15.259> 2013<00:00:15.640> and<00:00:16.640> over<00:00:17.390> here

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
here at the computex 2013 and over here

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.650 
here at the computex 2013 and over here
we<00:00:17.630> have<00:00:17.660> a<00:00:17.810> 10-inch<00:00:18.380> tab<00:00:18.680> from<00:00:19.040> the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
we have a 10-inch tab from the

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.240 
we have a 10-inch tab from the
manufacturer<00:00:20.660> kwanzaa<00:00:21.259> so<00:00:21.560> of<00:00:21.800> course<00:00:21.860> it's

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
manufacturer kwanzaa so of course it's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.300 
manufacturer kwanzaa so of course it's
not<00:00:22.369> a<00:00:22.610> tab<00:00:23.419> you<00:00:23.630> will<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:24.320> can<00:00:24.500> buy<00:00:24.739> them<00:00:25.009> in

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
not a tab you will you can buy them in

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.179 
not a tab you will you can buy them in
the<00:00:25.460> next<00:00:25.730> time<00:00:25.939> but<00:00:26.720> it<00:00:27.169> is<00:00:27.500> really

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
the next time but it is really

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.060 
the next time but it is really
interesting<00:00:28.820> to<00:00:29.029> see<00:00:29.300> what<00:00:29.960> will<00:00:30.529> come<00:00:30.559> up

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
interesting to see what will come up

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.729 
interesting to see what will come up
with<00:00:31.369> AMG<00:00:31.880> technology<00:00:32.660> here<00:00:32.899> inside<00:00:33.200> so<00:00:33.710> you

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
with AMG technology here inside so you

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.220 
with AMG technology here inside so you
can<00:00:33.829> see<00:00:34.040> as<00:00:34.280> a<00:00:34.309> processor<00:00:35.030> we<00:00:35.149> have<00:00:35.239> an<00:00:35.360> AMD<00:00:35.690> a

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
can see as a processor we have an AMD a

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.720 
can see as a processor we have an AMD a
4<00:00:37.360> 1200<00:00:38.360> with<00:00:38.600> a<00:00:38.840> Radian<00:00:39.440> graphics<00:00:39.950> running

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
4 1200 with a Radian graphics running

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.470 
4 1200 with a Radian graphics running
with<00:00:40.940> 1<00:00:41.210> gigahertz<00:00:41.540> 2<00:00:42.320> gigs<00:00:42.530> of<00:00:42.650> ram<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.480> we

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
with 1 gigahertz 2 gigs of ram and we

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.050 
with 1 gigahertz 2 gigs of ram and we
have<00:00:44.630> over<00:00:45.140> here<00:00:45.410> at<00:00:45.590> full<00:00:45.830> touch<00:00:46.370> supported

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
have over here at full touch supported

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.750 
have over here at full touch supported
with<00:00:47.180> 10<00:00:47.420> touch<00:00:47.630> points<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.760> graphics

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
with 10 touch points so the graphics

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.090 
with 10 touch points so the graphics
card<00:00:49.940> will<00:00:50.150> be<00:00:50.180> an<00:00:50.329> AMD<00:00:50.630> radeon<00:00:51.170> HD<00:00:51.490> 8180<00:00:52.490> and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
card will be an AMD radeon HD 8180 and

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.150 
card will be an AMD radeon HD 8180 and
the<00:00:55.100> display<00:00:55.520> is<00:00:55.579> 10<00:00:55.850> inch<00:00:56.090> with<00:00:56.780> an<00:00:57.140> full<00:00:57.739> HD

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
the display is 10 inch with an full HD

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.889 
the display is 10 inch with an full HD
resolution<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.970> 1920<00:00:59.690> x<00:00:59.810> 1080<00:01:00.020> pixels<00:01:01.570> so<00:01:02.570> over

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels so over

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.109 
resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels so over
here<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.320> there's<00:01:03.710> 3d<00:01:04.579> max<00:01:04.759> so<00:01:04.939> I<00:01:04.970> think

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
here and there's 3d max so I think

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.520 
here and there's 3d max so I think
that's<00:01:05.960> low<00:01:06.380> just<00:01:06.829> load<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.280> see<00:01:07.549> what

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
that's low just load and see what

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.510 
that's low just load and see what
graphics

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
graphics

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.969 
graphics
we'll<00:01:10.880> look<00:01:11.060> like<00:01:11.329> so<00:01:11.719> while<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:12.590> will<00:01:12.740> load

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
we'll look like so while it will load

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.580 
we'll look like so while it will load
you<00:01:13.189> we<00:01:13.520> will<00:01:13.700> have<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:13.909> look<00:01:14.179> at<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.929> ports<00:01:15.320> so

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
you we will have a look at the ports so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.249 
you we will have a look at the ports so
you<00:01:15.649> can<00:01:15.859> see<00:01:16.070> with<00:01:16.689> what's<00:01:17.689> that<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:18.170> looks

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
you can see with what's that it looks

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.889 
you can see with what's that it looks
like<00:01:18.619> a<00:01:18.649> sim<00:01:18.979> card<00:01:19.009> slot<00:01:19.579> and<00:01:19.689> microSD<00:01:20.689> card

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
like a sim card slot and microSD card

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.730 
like a sim card slot and microSD card
slot<00:01:21.009> when<00:01:22.009> all<00:01:22.130> your<00:01:22.310> board<00:01:22.520> micro-hdmi<00:01:23.740> over

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
slot when all your board micro-hdmi over

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.419 
slot when all your board micro-hdmi over
here<00:01:25.039> there<00:01:25.340> is<00:01:26.020> but<00:01:27.020> it's<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.619> USB<00:01:27.860> 3.0

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
here there is but it's this and USB 3.0

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.910 
here there is but it's this and USB 3.0
port<00:01:28.789> and<00:01:29.000> also<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.450> volume<00:01:29.899> button<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:30.469> what

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
port and also a volume button and what

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.279 
port and also a volume button and what
is<00:01:31.069> this<00:01:31.310> looks<00:01:32.119> like<00:01:32.299> yeah<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.780> DC<00:01:33.079> and<00:01:33.200> of

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
is this looks like yeah the DC and of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.919 
is this looks like yeah the DC and of
course<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.369> over<00:01:35.119> here<00:01:35.149> you<00:01:35.329> can<00:01:35.569> see<00:01:35.750> we<00:01:35.899> have

course so over here you can see we have

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.090 
course so over here you can see we have
all<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.920> tests<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.670> 3d<00:01:38.149> mark<00:01:38.390> let's<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:39.350> run

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
all the tests of 3d mark let's just run

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.940 
all the tests of 3d mark let's just run
ice<00:01:40.340> storm<00:01:40.700> let's<00:01:41.509> have<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.869> look<00:01:42.140> how<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:42.709> will

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
ice storm let's have a look how it will

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.520 
ice storm let's have a look how it will
run<00:01:43.340> on<00:01:43.579> this<00:01:44.030> AMD<00:01:44.959> tablet<00:01:45.470> with<00:01:46.280> Tomas<00:01:47.530> so

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
run on this AMD tablet with Tomas so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.229 
run on this AMD tablet with Tomas so
this<00:01:48.709> is<00:01:48.739> the<00:01:48.860> graphics<00:01:49.280> test<00:01:49.520> one<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.939> course

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:50.239 
this is the graphics test one of course

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.109 
this is the graphics test one of course
um<00:01:50.420> don't<00:01:51.049> worry<00:01:51.289> we<00:01:51.530> won't<00:01:51.860> run<00:01:52.159> all<00:01:52.849> the

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
um don't worry we won't run all the

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.919 
um don't worry we won't run all the
tests<00:01:53.569> just<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:54.439> little<00:01:54.860> demo<00:01:55.610> over<00:01:56.000> here<00:01:56.239> to

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
tests just a little demo over here to

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.550 
tests just a little demo over here to
see<00:01:57.140> how<00:01:57.319> it<00:01:57.530> will<00:01:57.739> look

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.490 

sions<00:02:02.340> running<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> 44<00:02:03.750> frames<00:02:04.229> per

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
sions running with a 44 frames per

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980 
sions running with a 44 frames per
second<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.430> looks<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.689> great

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
second and it looks really really great

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.340 
second and it looks really really great
to<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.560> honest

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.140 

so<00:02:12.860> as<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:12.980> can<00:02:13.070> see<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.370> have<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.490> lot<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.790> power

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
so as you can see we have a lot of power

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.510 
so as you can see we have a lot of power
on<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.660> chap<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.890> even<00:02:16.160> play<00:02:16.280> games

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.699 

so<00:02:20.520> let's<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.240> out<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:21.959> how<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.500> that

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
so let's get out of this how is that

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.130 
so let's get out of this how is that
