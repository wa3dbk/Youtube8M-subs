00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
comfortable to wear on their own I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.939 
comfortable to wear on their own I
really<00:05:16.869> have<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.020> put<00:05:17.229> a<00:05:17.259> lipstick<00:05:17.680> or<00:05:17.889> gloss

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
really have to put a lipstick or gloss

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.980

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
that that's negative but i think that

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:23.790 
that that's negative but i think that
the<00:05:22.599> positives<00:05:23.050> outweigh<00:05:23.289> the<00:05:23.409> negatives

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
the positives outweigh the negatives

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.439 
the positives outweigh the negatives
worth<00:05:23.949> where<00:05:24.249> these<00:05:24.399> are<00:05:24.459> concerned<00:05:24.969> so<00:05:25.300> that
