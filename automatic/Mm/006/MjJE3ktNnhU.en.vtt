00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.620
 If there is not much of a book marks the playbook is the first tablet from Rim 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.609
 but it looks like his customers are with 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.609
 at the bottom of the communication 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.019
 backside is completely empty except room 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.019
 the top has a number of buttons 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.380
 let it be and the marke 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.759
 that is striking when the coninck looks short 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.729
 is that there is an HDMI output 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.620
 and of course unique films b 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.030
 and then another 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 special dock connector 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.360
 and everything happens with it 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.640
 because of this 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.530
 three to four meters above 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.830
 of course 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.830
 the debate and then to bad weather 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 the construction of the playbook extra fine actually 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.890
 counter this 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 with a cross-section fencer are insurance of tablet 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 on the small side 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.670
 Really your personal preference the fire department easily asked him a question 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.570
 poor one 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.570
 keyboard from there also turned out to be pretty good 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.720
 it's pretty big 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.890
 can be nice on type of course it is not perfect on a tablet anyway 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.700
 bah it's just 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.690
 on screen keyboard of course and that always works less than really well 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.870
 born 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 such a short time that is still a bit behind on internet booking 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.080
 but of temporary shortages especially if you manage against tuttosport 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 fine 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.250
 what especially to 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.250
 special gameplay makes the device interface 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.840
 we stand 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 he doesn't really have a hamstring 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.510
 yes actually all evans that are open 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.120
 as you can see 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.610
 it's just an ordinary man 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.460
 you can also be the writer 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.460
 in my opinion, to move screens up there 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 and there are all your items divided into three categories 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.479
 the striker who goes after works a lot with gestures from the side of the tram apple 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.099
 strength all good 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.099
 psion program opens he switched with your finger 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.069
 you come 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.189
 home screen say 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.189
 chimay boost indicates exclusion 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.619
 this way you can easily keep an overview of which programs are open 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.889
 and also on 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.849
 yes easy multitasking 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:49.959
 you can 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.959
 just leave things open 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.529
 especially of a strong one 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.449
 or just sit as standard 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.959
 therefore bad from 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.189
 everyone just goes on 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.469
 name 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.469
 who can take care of their offspring 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.119
 and then he passes tel 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:35.959
 he will stay normal 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.559
 but you are 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:39.339
 it works well then 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:40.619
 can you meet each other 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.249
 and by playing the flash video here 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.549
 and check something else there 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.340
 and that works on it all very quickly the stations of a tablet are hands 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:51.829
 good 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.829
 then you can also process in which 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.889
 but yes, therefore, the referee nato 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.889
 leo kirch also really enjoys the multitasking and the interface of the facts 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.659
 its competitors 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.659
 it also stands really big unique point of the playbook 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.589
 class of the tablet to fine 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.029
 that of our website 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.009
 I see everything from running smoothly 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.099
 open his video 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.860
 just bring a few with iron on 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.719
 and a little later 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:58.719
 but everything continues to work well as you see 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.460
 the only thing the buffer 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.699
 then you see that 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.699
 that's a smooth run 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.719
 single boxes support flash names 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:36.089
 proved even though it can be a big advantage over the Schutskamp trends 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.900
 contemporary twist cap 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.940
 she doesn't have it 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.940
 and the playbook has the cebs casino 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.980
 to 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.000
 a one problem that the gaal playbook has its real estate will be resolved 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.219
 his by that time also got in the netherlands 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.219
 new application is not a name this year 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.069
 what they do not work of the year was a black betty linked to the 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.419
 Breehoek naturally go retarded 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.089
 Not everyone who has a playbook has four years if you also have good food 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.309
 It also takes a moment to use the credit card if you don't have it 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:28.029
 have a blackberry phone 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.029
 but that will be laid out also left on post 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.460
 you can see 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.460
 shabaneh writes very institution 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.279
 whether or not you agree to one 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.330
 just in enschede 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.729
 after two days it all works very well too 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.080
 After all in all it says that there are many cases 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.490
 in itself it is a strong wind nothing changes 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.569
 his name device 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.629
 on the small side 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:02.919
 but 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.310
 especially if you are poor if you go with camels and days after using the wk 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.900
 of the blackberry 4 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.860
 definitely worth considering
