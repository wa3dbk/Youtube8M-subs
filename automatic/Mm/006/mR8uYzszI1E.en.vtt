 in an artist how was that your 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.880
 Mom, I've tricked you into auditions 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.530
 then it is that the truth I have 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.230
 battled many years I met a lot 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.270
 people and I was promised many things what 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.400
 The more they invited me, they had me bye bye 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.970
 that is, I earn or I spent from my 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.100
 money to go open the concert or 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.720
 accompany them to be I like it I like it 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.160
 I wanted to throw the rag and say 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.019
 it was because then for the same reason 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.150
 lies and in that a scope 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.489
 supposedly go to meet half 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.080
 tan juarez and I fell asleep at 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.430
 get there I woke up and look at me 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.010
 I was a hetero that said auditions 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.670
 for I have talent 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.680
 83 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.900
 to see how far I've come so you 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.040
 you deserve your mom knows what she does 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.580
 I'm proud of what you did 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.580
 Really 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.170
 I'm very nervous I have not eaten anything 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:19.200
 and for the solís colonel to tell me 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.970
 the truth that yes the truth that yes the 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.040
 true that if not just because it is of use 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.770
 because apart from that I never met him 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.330
 I knew him when he had already pasted what is 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.380
 what he most admires so far of the record 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.380
 He is very humble 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.969
 The first thing I remember is the unity 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:42.219
 from jaime because we are not going with that person 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.219
 to which you are afraid of sticking 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.569
 but I 've been watching jaime 

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:52.439

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.839
 they will participate, I have talent and 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.849

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.050
 I want God to help him so that 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.050
