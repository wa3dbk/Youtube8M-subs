from Dorothy Perkins I think that stores
in<00:02:01.229> great<00:02:01.500> ones<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.069> getting<00:02:02.429> work<00:02:02.729> clothes

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
in great ones of getting work clothes

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.999 
in great ones of getting work clothes
because<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.990> really<00:02:04.200> nice<00:02:04.440> dresses

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
because they have really nice dresses

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.830 
because they have really nice dresses
and<00:02:05.310> sometimes<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.270> come<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.630> matching

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and sometimes they come with matching

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.469 
and sometimes they come with matching
suits<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.519> very<00:02:08.820> very<00:02:09.149> work

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
suits so this is very very work

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.690 
suits so this is very very work
appropriate<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> sense<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.769> it's<00:02:11.039> very

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
appropriate in the sense that it's very

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.479
