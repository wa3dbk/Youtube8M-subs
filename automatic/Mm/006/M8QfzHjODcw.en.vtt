00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.620
 very good to all welcome to me 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.140
 channel welcome to a new video of 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.490
 fifa 16 where I want to show you some 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.500
 players that have been seen in the 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.870
 beta and I think they can be players 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.730
 perfect to be those first 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.050
 players that we sign up to help us 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.820
 earn our first coins and 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.980
 our first matches and what about 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.179
 everything is very cheap before you start 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.529
 with the video talk a little about these 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.849
 players tell you that if you want to see more 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.220
 videos like this before the 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.329
 game let's like to leave a like and 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.880
 also that I'm going to leave a comment 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.019
 telling me which players are going to be the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.519
 first you are going to try to sign 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.990
 you who think they can be 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.880
 cheap and they're going to give a good 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.110
 performance so let's go started a 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.940
 little the three players the first of 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.130
 they will be paco alcácer player 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.690
 valència spanish player and what to notice 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.980
 in an image that I have seen that the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.540
 images of the players you are going to see 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.400
 that I have seen the flag in the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.110
 description in case you want to see the image 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.990
 that you see it's true that I've seen it 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.620
 look at the rhythm statistics 81 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.000
 80 of 76 dribble shot and 72 of physical 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.560
 if the letter of 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.260
 alcácer I think it can be a player 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.090
 perfect ideal to be the first 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.280
 front that we sign that costs us in 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.780
 around 400 coins and that marks us 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.920
 many goals perhaps the most player 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.840
 fast but 80 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.460
 because it's ideal for you to be the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.020
 first player to miss us very little 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.640
 the goals that we scored all 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.590
 occasions that we have and that give us 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.509
 many parties and many coins for 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.240
 that we can arrive testing players and 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.369
 that we can form a decent team 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.190
 The sooner the better player, if he continues 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.110
 with the same as for 15 you will have 4 of 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.060
 bad leg and 3 skills but still 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 I think it can be very good and that 80 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.350
 can go very well and also as 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.759
 I say I think that for the 400 coins what 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.979
 we will be able to sign because it is gold 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.190
 bright next the player cobach and 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.300
 that the center of the inter of Milan is 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.789
 usually my videos two years ago 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.159
 weeks or so I climbed a team of frank 15 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.630
 where I taught you everything were all 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.490
 players every Thursday team 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.409
 it was from the inter de milan and this player 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.270
 precisely at kovacic I tried it and what 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.530
 I put as an offensive midfielder and I 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.450
 quite liked it I think the only thing 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.159
 missed a bit was shot but still 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.420
 it was pretty good and the statistics 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.549
 they are very similar so I think it is 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.049
 a favor as a payment to do this 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.610
 it will be a little more expensive because apparently 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.429
 it will be golden gold brilliant but I 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.470
 I think that for about 700 800 coins what 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.570
 we will be able to sign and fix 81 of 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.620
 64 shooting rhythm that's what 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.409
 I say maybe I fail 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.450
 because if I had more than 70 shooting already 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.180
 I would not be a cheap player I think three 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.280
 problems has 82 of pass and 85 of 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.870
 dribble and also on top he had four 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.760
 skills and four bullet leg 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.159
 so if it goes on like this I think it's a 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.390
 very very good game to put it on my 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.340
 offensive center in one of our 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.989
 first teams and finally I bring you 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.549
 to benedetto a player that I have not 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.170
 seen play never but surely some 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.090
 of you have seen it because you are 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.220
 Argentines because if the reality 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.959
 Mexican for some of that and I 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.840
 I remember that this player has a lower 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.190
 of more over 15 that I do not get to 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.840
 try because the truth is that I do not 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.450
 it attracted a lot of attention but when 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.970
 seen this letter from benneteau fra 16 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.650
 spare a player very very good for 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.690
 the goal that I want to teach you in 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.040
 this video cheap players and that we 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.390
 give a great performance at the beginning of 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.319
 game or even throughout the game 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.599
 with 85 pace 74 shot 75 dribble 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.640
 and 72 of physical I think that it is a game 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.200
 also very very good and also the league 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.180
 Mexican as it is not usually a league very 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.010
 I think I can be a player who 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.200
 nothing more match a few days already 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.519
 have a discard price so it was 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.900
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.550

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.140

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.610
 as I have done some comment before 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.230
 telling me that other creative players 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.520
 that are going to be cheap they are going to have 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.290
 good statistics and that they will give a 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.460
 good performance for your players that 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.900
 let's try to be at the beginning of the 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.070
