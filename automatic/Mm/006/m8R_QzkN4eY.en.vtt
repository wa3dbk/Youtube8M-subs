probably can't get it but we're just

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.219 
probably can't get it but we're just
going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> try<00:01:47.579> probably<00:01:48.420> test<00:01:48.689> our<00:01:48.869> luck<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
going to try probably test our luck to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.840 
going to try probably test our luck to
see<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> opportunity<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.549> do

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
see if we have the opportunity to do

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.090 
see if we have the opportunity to do
that<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.299> an<00:01:51.420> opportunity<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:53.329> using<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
that or an opportunity to get it using a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.679 
that or an opportunity to get it using a
flame<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.700> sea<00:01:57.200> dragon<00:01:59.240> alright<00:02:00.240> let's

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
flame and a sea dragon alright let's

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.440 
flame and a sea dragon alright let's
just<00:02:00.930> test<00:02:01.200> our<00:02:01.439> luck<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:02.040> something<00:02:02.640> here

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
just test our luck with something here

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.550 
just test our luck with something here
like<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:05.689> because<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:06.990> relatively

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
like this I because it's relatively

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.010 
like this I because it's relatively
quick<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> think<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> relatively

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
quick I I think this is a relatively

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.760 
quick I I think this is a relatively
quick<00:02:11.270> breeding<00:02:12.270> time<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.200> get<00:02:13.440> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
quick breeding time so if we get it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.230 
quick breeding time so if we get it
then<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.100> probably<00:02:14.340> gonna<00:02:14.580> be<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.730> long<00:02:15.000> green
