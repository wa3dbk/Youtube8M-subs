think<00:00:53.770> they<00:00:53.860> were<00:00:53.950> about<00:00:54.130> to<00:00:54.190> consider<00:00:54.640> the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
think they were about to consider the

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.480 
think they were about to consider the
merits<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:56.040> Warrington<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:57.190> where<00:00:57.310> they<00:00:57.460> are

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
merits of Warrington and where they are

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.210 
merits of Warrington and where they are
and<00:00:58.210> then<00:00:58.390> all's<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:59.079> can<00:00:59.710> only<00:00:59.829> choose<00:00:59.890> two

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
and then all's you can only choose two

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.569 
and then all's you can only choose two
teams<00:01:00.489> so<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:02.260> know<00:01:02.380> this<00:01:02.560> it's<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:03.040> 50-50

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
teams so you know this it's a 50-50

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.120 
teams so you know this it's a 50-50
chance<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.210> know<00:01:04.329> the<00:01:04.479> is<00:01:05.469> headlines<00:01:05.859> its

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
chance and you know the is headlines its

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.319 
chance and you know the is headlines its
big<00:01:06.310> headlines<00:01:06.609> if<00:01:06.759> they're<00:01:06.850> all<00:01:06.939> choosers

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
big headlines if they're all choosers

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:08.520

but<00:01:08.619> at<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:08.859> same<00:01:09.039> time<00:01:09.249> I<00:01:09.520> don't<00:01:09.999> think<00:01:10.179> it

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
but at the same time I don't think it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.730 
but at the same time I don't think it
was<00:01:10.299> quite<00:01:10.509> just<00:01:10.749> draw<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:10.960> joy<00:01:11.289> out<00:01:11.319> to<00:01:11.619> have

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
was quite just draw the joy out to have

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.200 
was quite just draw the joy out to have
that<00:01:11.950> so<00:01:12.100> we're<00:01:12.219> always<00:01:12.340> going<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.609> choose<00:01:12.789> we

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
that so we're always going to choose we

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
one's been sure we've to progress

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.719

through<00:02:02.229> against<00:02:03.009> Catalans<00:02:03.340> we<00:02:03.459> had<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.609> come

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
through against Catalans we had to come

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.370

again<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.630> still<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.930> been<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.050> toughness

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
again and I still have been a toughness

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.960 
again and I still have been a toughness
it<00:02:47.530> was<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.709> good<00:02:47.890> playoff<00:02:48.190> performance<00:02:48.820> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
it was a good playoff performance and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.240 
it was a good playoff performance and
one<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.540> will<00:02:50.260> prepare<00:02:50.680> us<00:02:50.709> well<00:02:50.980> for<00:02:51.010> this

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
one that will prepare us well for this

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.620 
one that will prepare us well for this
we<00:02:51.430> coming<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:51.910> that's<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.180> way<00:02:52.300> it'll<00:02:52.450> be<00:02:52.600> I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
we coming and that's the way it'll be I

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.000 
we coming and that's the way it'll be I
think<00:02:52.840> it'll<00:02:52.959> be<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.110> tough<00:02:53.350> playoff<00:02:53.680> match

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
think it'll be a tough playoff match
