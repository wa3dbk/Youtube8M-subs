the mandolin swing can be used either

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.040 
the mandolin swing can be used either
directly<00:01:08.650> on<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.890> working<00:01:09.220> surface<00:01:09.250> or<00:01:10.050> above

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.219 

firstly<00:01:17.549> here's<00:01:18.240> how<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> adjust<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.990> cutting

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
firstly here's how to adjust the cutting

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.240 
firstly here's how to adjust the cutting
thickness<00:01:19.650> using<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.130> support<00:01:20.490> upper<00:01:20.820> plate

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
thickness using the support upper plate

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
thickness using the support upper plate
after<00:01:23.250> unlocking<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> tightening<00:01:24.540> knobs<00:01:24.720> on

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
after unlocking the tightening knobs on

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.280 
after unlocking the tightening knobs on
the<00:01:25.020> side<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.440> mandoline<00:01:25.860> swing<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:28.260> can

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the side of the mandoline swing you can

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.749 
the side of the mandoline swing you can
adjust<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> height<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> plate<00:01:29.550> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
adjust the height of the plate and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.810 
adjust the height of the plate and
therefore<00:01:30.240> also<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.840> cutting<00:01:31.170> thickness<00:01:31.820> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
therefore also the cutting thickness the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.940 
therefore also the cutting thickness the
support<00:01:33.240> plate<00:01:33.479> lever<00:01:33.720> helps<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.499 

then<00:01:37.950> lock<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.700> plate<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.060> place<00:01:39.300> by

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
then lock the plate in place by

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.130 
then lock the plate in place by
tightening<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.350> knobs<00:01:41.690> in<00:01:42.690> order<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
tightening the two knobs in order to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.499 
tightening the two knobs in order to
define<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.680> parallel<00:01:44.100> cuts<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:45.030> cut<00:01:45.210> slices

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
define the parallel cuts to cut slices

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.430 
define the parallel cuts to cut slices
or<00:01:45.780> crinkles<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:48.690> have<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.050> double

or crinkles you have one double

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.520 
or crinkles you have one double
horizontal<00:01:50.070> blade<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.550> one<00:01:50.759> straight<00:01:51.119> side

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530
