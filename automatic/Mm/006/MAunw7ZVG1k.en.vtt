around<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:07.500> windshield<00:00:07.799> with<00:00:08.130> bare<00:00:08.340> metal

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
around this windshield with bare metal

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.930 
around this windshield with bare metal
foil<00:00:09.290> it's<00:00:10.290> actual<00:00:10.800> metal<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.400> if<00:00:11.490> Candell

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
foil it's actual metal and if Candell

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.930 
foil it's actual metal and if Candell
blade<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.480> need<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> new<00:00:13.019> sharp<00:00:13.320> blade<00:00:13.940> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
blade so you need a new sharp blade the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.430 
blade so you need a new sharp blade the
first<00:00:15.240> cut<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> piece<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.960> foil<00:00:16.230> with

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
first cut a piece of the foil with

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.029 
first cut a piece of the foil with
scissors<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:18.020> use<00:00:19.020> tweezers<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.529> remove<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
scissors and use tweezers to remove the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.029

foil<00:00:20.430> from<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.420> paper<00:00:21.630> backing<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:25.859> we're

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
foil from the paper backing so we're

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.519 
foil from the paper backing so we're
starting<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> section<00:00:27.170> below<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
starting with the section below the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.970 
starting with the section below the
windshield<00:00:28.949> we'll<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.519> four<00:00:29.760> sections

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
windshield we'll do it in four sections

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.400 
windshield we'll do it in four sections
and<00:00:31.980> got<00:00:32.880> plenty<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.390> overlap<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.260> we'll

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and got plenty of overlap here so we'll

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.780 
and got plenty of overlap here so we'll
stick<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.860> piece<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:37.280> just<00:00:38.280> press<00:00:38.550> on

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the foil to have it stick next we'll

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.799 
the foil to have it stick next we'll
take<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.530> cotton<00:00:43.829> swab<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.579> we'll<00:00:45.570> start

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
take a cotton swab and we'll start

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.979 
take a cotton swab and we'll start
rubbing<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> foil<00:00:46.649> onto<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.280> model<00:00:53.750> if<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
rubbing the foil onto the model if the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
rubbing the foil onto the model if the
foil<00:00:55.230> lifts<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.860> press<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> back<00:00:56.399> down

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
foil lifts up just press it back down

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.150 
foil lifts up just press it back down
not<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> big<00:00:57.420> deal<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> keep<00:01:01.559> pressing<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
not a big deal so keep pressing with the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.000 
not a big deal so keep pressing with the
swab<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.760> work<00:01:02.910> along<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.270> length<00:01:03.830> of<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
swab and work along the length of the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:15.050 
swab and work along the length of the
strip

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.310 

so<00:01:16.060> just<00:01:16.270> keep<00:01:16.420> working<00:01:16.570> along<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.020> length

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
so just keep working along the length

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.389 
so just keep working along the length
until<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.860> entire<00:01:18.780> piece<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:20.020> trim<00:01:20.399> is

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
until the entire piece of trim is

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:35.789 
until the entire piece of trim is
covered<00:01:33.840> okay<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.170> once<00:01:35.350> it's<00:01:35.560> nice<00:01:35.740> and

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
covered okay and once it's nice and

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.800 
covered okay and once it's nice and
stuck<00:01:36.399> down<00:01:36.580> there<00:01:36.610> with<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.119> swab<00:01:37.360> next

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
stuck down there with the swab next

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.980 
stuck down there with the swab next
we'll<00:01:37.929> take<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.170> toothpick<00:01:39.149> and<00:01:40.149> so<00:01:40.539> what<00:01:40.899> we

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
we'll take a toothpick and so what we

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.450 
we'll take a toothpick and so what we
want<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.170> do<00:01:41.289> with<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.500> toothpick<00:01:41.950> is<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.280> work

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
want to do with the toothpick is to work

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.779 
want to do with the toothpick is to work
the<00:01:42.640> foil<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.979> separation<00:01:45.610> line

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
the foil into the separation line

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.669 
the foil into the separation line
between<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.299> trim<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.860> hood<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:50.619> the

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
between the trim and the hood now the

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.949 
between the trim and the hood now the
foil<00:01:51.009> is<00:01:51.159> pretty<00:01:51.399> pretty<00:01:51.880> malleable<00:01:52.209> so<00:01:52.720> we'll

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
foil is pretty pretty malleable so we'll

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.199 
foil is pretty pretty malleable so we'll
stick<00:01:53.289> down<00:01:53.590> into<00:01:53.920> every<00:01:54.789> nook<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.090> cranny

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
stick down into every nook and cranny

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.020 
stick down into every nook and cranny
and<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:55.929> use<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.319> toothpick<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.220> press

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
and so just use that toothpick to press

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:18.350 
and so just use that toothpick to press
it<00:01:58.179> down<00:01:58.299> as<00:01:58.569> much<00:01:58.720> as<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:58.990> can

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.940 

okay<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.630> once<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.110> nice<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.530> stuck<00:02:21.010> there

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
okay and once it's nice and stuck there

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.320 
okay and once it's nice and stuck there
we're<00:02:23.950> going<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.220> use<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.459> sharp<00:02:24.730> blade<00:02:25.030> to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
we're going to use that sharp blade to

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.339 
we're going to use that sharp blade to
trim<00:02:26.140> away<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> excess<00:02:26.770> foil<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.750> start<00:02:29.230> at

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
trim away the excess foil so start at

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:36.809 
trim away the excess foil so start at
one<00:02:29.530> end<00:02:33.900> make<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.930> cut<00:02:35.230> using<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.860> model

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
one end make a cut using the model

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.750 
one end make a cut using the model
itself<00:02:37.090> as<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> guide<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.290> blade<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.640> you

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
itself as a guide for the blade and you

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.920 
itself as a guide for the blade and you
don't<00:02:42.880> want<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.060> use<00:02:43.150> too<00:02:43.180> much<00:02:43.390> pressure<00:02:43.690> and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
don't want to use too much pressure and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.570 
don't want to use too much pressure and
actually<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.560> won't<00:02:44.680> need<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.040> because

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
actually you won't need to because

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.740 
actually you won't need to because
you're<00:02:46.300> using<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.599> sharp<00:02:46.870> blade<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.390> just<00:02:49.600> use

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
you're using a sharp blade so just use

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.809 
you're using a sharp blade so just use
the<00:02:49.900> sharpness<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.500> blade<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.250> model

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
the sharpness of the blade and the model

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.330 
the sharpness of the blade and the model
as<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:52.000> guide<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.239> cut<00:02:52.840> very<00:02:53.830> close<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
as a guide to cut very close to the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.820 
as a guide to cut very close to the
model<00:02:55.830> just<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:58.530> once<00:02:59.530> you've<00:02:59.650> got<00:02:59.799> a

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
model just like this once you've got a

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.360 
model just like this once you've got a
little<00:03:00.130> bit<00:03:00.280> cut<00:03:00.580> it<00:03:00.850> helps<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.239> hold<00:03:01.390> one<00:03:01.660> end

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
little bit cut it helps to hold one end

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.740 
little bit cut it helps to hold one end
just<00:03:03.370> run<00:03:03.640> your<00:03:03.790> plate<00:03:04.000> lightly<00:03:06.420> along<00:03:07.420> the

just run your plate lightly along the
length<00:03:07.989> here<00:03:09.390> just<00:03:10.390> like<00:03:10.569> this

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
inside of the trim piece so we cut on

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.690 
inside of the trim piece so we cut on
the<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.799> windshield<00:03:30.069> side<00:03:30.430> now<00:03:30.549> we're

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
the on the windshield side now we're

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:39.420

going to cut on the hood side and again

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.770 
going to cut on the hood side and again
you<00:03:39.549> don't<00:03:39.670> need<00:03:39.909> a<00:03:39.940> lot<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.150> pressure<00:03:40.390> here

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
you don't need a lot of pressure here

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.569 
you don't need a lot of pressure here
you<00:03:40.959> have<00:03:41.319> used<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.650> toothpick<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:42.099> push<00:03:42.430> the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
you have used a toothpick to push the

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.780 
you have used a toothpick to push the
foil<00:03:42.849> down<00:03:43.060> into<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.540> line<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:45.519> should<00:03:45.700> be

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
foil down into that line so it should be

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.339 
foil down into that line so it should be
very<00:03:46.000> obvious<00:03:46.090> where<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.569> cut<00:03:46.780> then<00:03:47.019> just<00:03:47.200> use

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
very obvious where to cut then just use

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:56.190 
very obvious where to cut then just use
that<00:03:48.120> sharp<00:03:49.120> blade<00:03:54.510> slowly<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.750> gently<00:03:55.840> pull

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
that sharp blade slowly and gently pull

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:07.650 
that sharp blade slowly and gently pull
it<00:03:56.230> along<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:56.590> line

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.300 

and<00:04:08.660> then<00:04:08.840> once<00:04:09.080> that's<00:04:09.320> done<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:10.100> should<00:04:10.130> be

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
and then once that's done you should be

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.670 
and then once that's done you should be
able<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.580> peel<00:04:10.820> away<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.120> excess<00:04:11.540> foil<00:04:11.870> just

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
able to peel away the excess foil just

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.440 
able to peel away the excess foil just
peel<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.010> back<00:04:13.130> on<00:04:13.370> itself<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.240> should

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
peel it back on itself and it should

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:22.480 
peel it back on itself and it should
come<00:04:14.630> away<00:04:14.780> quite<00:04:15.170> nicely<00:04:21.070> now<00:04:22.070> get<00:04:22.340> back

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
come away quite nicely now get back

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.120 
come away quite nicely now get back
there<00:04:22.730> with<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.910> toothpick<00:04:23.180> at<00:04:23.570> 30<00:04:24.130> here's

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130
