the thing that I feel really genuinely
strongly<00:07:12.990> about<00:07:13.170> and<00:07:13.530> you<00:07:14.400> know<00:07:14.430> that's<00:07:14.940> the

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.090 
strongly about and you know that's the

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.800 
strongly about and you know that's the

thing they put in the game but I believe

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:26.960 
thing they put in the game but I believe
the<00:07:19.050> term<00:07:19.080> is<00:07:19.380> a<00:07:22.580> jingoistic<00:07:24.950> proto<00:07:25.950> fascism<00:07:26.760> I

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
the term is a jingoistic proto fascism I

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.970 
the term is a jingoistic proto fascism I
think<00:07:27.600> it's<00:07:27.690> the<00:07:27.750> term<00:07:27.960> i<00:07:28.200> took<00:07:28.440> a<00:07:28.530> film<00:07:28.770> class
