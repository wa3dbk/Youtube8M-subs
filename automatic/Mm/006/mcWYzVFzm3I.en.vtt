when<00:00:00.750> we're<00:00:00.960> replacing<00:00:01.260> our<00:00:01.620> chain<00:00:01.829> rings

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
when we're replacing our chain rings

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.130 
when we're replacing our chain rings
after<00:00:02.280> we've<00:00:02.689> removed<00:00:03.689> them<00:00:04.549> it's<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.700> few

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
after we've removed them it's a few

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.379 
after we've removed them it's a few
little<00:00:07.140> things<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.859> are<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.519> know<00:00:08.670> don't

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
little things that are you know don't

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.860 
little things that are you know don't
necessarily<00:00:10.110> come<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.349> mind<00:00:10.559> one<00:00:11.250> thing<00:00:11.460> is

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
necessarily come to mind one thing is

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.870 
necessarily come to mind one thing is
it's<00:00:12.870> great<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.530> have<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.099> right<00:00:14.280> tools<00:00:14.580> an

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
it's great to have the right tools an

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.390 
it's great to have the right tools an
Allen<00:00:15.719> wrench<00:00:15.750> that's<00:00:16.230> got<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> nice<00:00:17.100> long

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
Allen wrench that's got a nice long

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.310 
Allen wrench that's got a nice long
handle<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:17.970> can<00:00:18.150> get<00:00:18.240> some<00:00:18.390> leverage<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
handle so you can get some leverage it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.720 
handle so you can get some leverage it
also<00:00:19.439> helps<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:19.890> breaking<00:00:20.160> them<00:00:20.279> loose<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
also helps for breaking them loose and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.540 
also helps for breaking them loose and
then<00:00:21.510> your<00:00:21.630> special<00:00:22.080> chainring<00:00:22.760> tool<00:00:23.760> which

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
then your special chainring tool which

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
then your special chainring tool which
holds<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.789> nut<00:00:28.039> that<00:00:29.039> holds<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.970> large<00:00:30.359> and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
holds the nut that holds the large and

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
holds the nut that holds the large and
middle<00:00:30.750> chain<00:00:30.900> rings<00:00:31.140> pretty<00:00:31.769> securely<00:00:32.160> so

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
middle chain rings pretty securely so

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.340 
middle chain rings pretty securely so
you<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.700> something<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.090> purchase<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.660> when

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
you have something to purchase on when

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
you have something to purchase on when
you're<00:00:34.469> trying<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.890> tighten<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.640> loosen<00:00:35.670> them

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you're trying to tighten or loosen them

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.410 
you're trying to tighten or loosen them
because<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.930> some<00:00:37.079> applications<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
because for some applications for the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
because for some applications for the
width<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.750> some<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.590> these<00:00:40.680> chain<00:00:40.950> ring

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
width of some of these chain ring

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520 
width of some of these chain ring
spiders<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.930> slightly<00:00:43.230> different

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
spiders it can be slightly different

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.459 
spiders it can be slightly different
from<00:00:44.129> spider<00:00:44.760> spider<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.930> things<00:00:46.260> don't

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
from spider spider so things don't

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.660 
from spider spider so things don't
always<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:47.100> together<00:00:47.430> smoothly<00:00:47.960> when<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.230> are

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.000 

putting<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.690> new<00:00:55.079> small<00:00:55.590> chain<00:00:55.829> ring

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
putting you know a new small chain ring

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
putting you know a new small chain ring
on<00:00:56.360> normally<00:00:57.360> we'd<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.870> bolts<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
on normally we'd have all the bolts and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.709 
on normally we'd have all the bolts and
obviously<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.090> want<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> torque<00:01:00.480> them

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
obviously and you want to torque them

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.420 
obviously and you want to torque them
evenly<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.530> you'd<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.070> star<00:01:02.399> pattern

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
evenly so you'd do it in a star pattern

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
evenly so you'd do it in a star pattern
and<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.090> goes<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.300> almost<00:01:03.899> any<00:01:04.170> multiple

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and this goes for almost any multiple

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.789 
and this goes for almost any multiple

hard<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.210> break<00:01:57.329> bond<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.770> does<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
hard to break bond and what this does is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.639 
hard to break bond and what this does is
by<00:01:59.520> creating<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.149> bond<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.930> nothing<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.500> get

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
by creating a bond that nothing can get

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.399 
by creating a bond that nothing can get
through<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:03.479> keeps<00:02:03.780> things<00:02:03.990> from<00:02:04.079> corroding

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
through it keeps things from corroding

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.350 
through it keeps things from corroding
and<00:02:04.770> also<00:02:05.009> keeps<00:02:05.189> things<00:02:05.399> from<00:02:05.640> vibrational

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360

there it takes a lot of a lot of

patience doing this so I've got it to a

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.349 
patience doing this so I've got it to a

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
fairly good torque and just like when

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.610 
fairly good torque and just like when
we're<00:02:48.480> putting<00:02:48.569> on<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.840> small<00:02:49.079> ring<00:02:49.260> bolts<00:02:49.530> we

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
we're putting on the small ring bolts we

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.080 
we're putting on the small ring bolts we
want<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.040> one<00:02:51.000> two<00:02:51.599> three<00:02:52.590> four<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.459> on

want to do one two three four and on
this<00:02:54.299> specific<00:02:54.599> crank<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.470> fifth<00:02:55.769> bolts

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
this specific crank the fifth bolts

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.300 
this specific crank the fifth bolts
hidden<00:02:56.459> back<00:02:56.790> here<00:02:56.819> so<00:02:57.750> five<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.950> we<00:02:59.069> want<00:02:59.250> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
hidden back here so five and we want to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.839 
hidden back here so five and we want to
do<00:02:59.459> them<00:02:59.670> in<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:01.620> pattern<00:03:01.890> evenly<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.700> bring

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
do them in a pattern evenly to bring

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.380 
do them in a pattern evenly to bring
them<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.090> torque<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.959> we<00:03:04.319> don't<00:03:05.390> put

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
them up to torque so that we don't put

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.970 
them up to torque so that we don't put
anything<00:03:06.629> on<00:03:06.780> sideways<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.470> allows<00:03:07.650> things<00:03:07.829> to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
anything on sideways it allows things to

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.289 
anything on sideways it allows things to
get<00:03:08.129> crooked<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.609> we<00:03:08.670> want<00:03:08.849> everything<00:03:09.120> to

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
get crooked so we want everything to

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.449 
get crooked so we want everything to
stay<00:03:09.329> aligned<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:10.799> it's<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.159> simple

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
stay aligned so then it's a simple

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.849 
stay aligned so then it's a simple
matter<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:12.019> bolting<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.319> crank<00:03:13.560> arm<00:03:13.650> back

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
matter of bolting to the crank arm back
