00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
out for like the design you want to take

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.200 
out for like the design you want to take
your<00:02:18.790> stapler<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.620> my<00:02:20.980> design<00:02:21.490> looks

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
your stapler this is my design looks

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.920 
your stapler this is my design looks
pretty<00:02:22.510> cool<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.090> take<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.870> if

pretty cool I like it so you take so if

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.370 
pretty cool I like it so you take so if
they're<00:02:26.200> about<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.560> same<00:02:26.800> size<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.380> my

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
they're about the same size like this my

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.120 
they're about the same size like this my
other<00:02:29.620> ones<00:02:29.890> thicker<00:02:30.690> stronger<00:02:31.740> this<00:02:32.740> so<00:02:32.950> nice

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
other ones thicker stronger this so nice

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.510 
other ones thicker stronger this so nice
like<00:02:33.340> Lana<00:02:33.940> make<00:02:34.240> this<00:02:34.390> one<00:02:34.630> more<00:02:35.250> which<00:02:36.250> has

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
like Lana make this one more which has

like Lana make this one more which has
more<00:02:36.820> pop<00:02:38.490> can<00:02:39.490> I<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.760> some<00:02:39.970> pot<00:02:40.240> there<00:02:40.860> you

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
more pop can I have some pot there you

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.420 
more pop can I have some pot there you
just<00:02:42.070> want<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.450> staple<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:44.260> enforce<00:02:44.710> it<00:02:47.430> so

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
just want to staple it to enforce it so

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.970 
just want to staple it to enforce it so
just<00:02:49.210> make<00:02:49.480> two<00:02:49.960> staples<00:02:50.260> right<00:02:50.800> there

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
just make two staples right there

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.540 
just make two staples right there
are<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.700> going<00:02:52.879> to<00:02:53.000> do<00:02:53.530> symmetry<00:02:54.530> same<00:02:55.280> thing

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
are you going to do symmetry same thing

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.510 
are you going to do symmetry same thing
on<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.090> other<00:02:56.120> side

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.520 

and<00:03:01.110> then<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.690> middle<00:03:04.900> put<00:03:05.380> an<00:03:05.470> X<00:03:05.740> maybe

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
and then in the middle put an X maybe

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.290 
and then in the middle put an X maybe
interlining<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.890> staples<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.370> looks<00:03:12.550> kind

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
interlining to staples so it looks kind

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.960 
interlining to staples so it looks kind
of<00:03:13.390> like<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.870> make<00:03:14.860> sure<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.280> flatten<00:03:15.850> out

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
of like and make sure you flatten out

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.100 
of like and make sure you flatten out
the<00:03:16.000> staples<00:03:16.420> like<00:03:17.100> my<00:03:18.100> banging<00:03:18.700> on<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.970> table

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
the staples like my banging on the table

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.100 
the staples like my banging on the table
with<00:03:20.110> your<00:03:20.290> sting<00:03:21.190> face<00:03:21.520> down<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.930> may

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
with your sting face down and you may

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.530 
with your sting face down and you may
want<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.470> look<00:03:23.620> at<00:03:23.770> like<00:03:23.950> this<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:25.510> looks

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
want to look at like this that looks

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.780 
want to look at like this that looks
like<00:03:25.870> right<00:03:26.020> now<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.370> want<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.580> staple

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
like right now and you want to staple

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:36.890 
like right now and you want to staple
the<00:03:28.000> tail<00:03:28.530> better<00:03:29.530> grip

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:48.350 

like<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:39.140> I'm<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.439> the<00:03:40.650> other<00:03:40.680> side
