 We distribute by making gentle 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.740
 circular movements remembering 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.909

 area of ​​the nose where they accumulate 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.689
 impurities and blackheads on the

 the area of the attraction 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.240
 of the distribution we remove

 immediately with dry cotton 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.580

 very soft and avoiding training 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.590
 of folds while we apply emulsion 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.930
 cucumbers or other product the 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.960
 distribution in the center towards

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:36.499
 points front nose both cheekbones and 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.780
 chin the distribution is as we saw 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:41.389
 for the function of cucumbers from the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.599
 center outward with movements 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.540
 linear and ascending avoiding form 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.780
 folds in one's own 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.780

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.080
 the diurnal and nocturnal routines are 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.640
 interchangeable since both the 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.980
 evolution of cucumbers like cream 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.769
 humectant and with glycolic acid can 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.900
 used day and night however 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.269
 it is advisable in the way that 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.519
 we saw already that the emulsion of cucumbers is 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.349
 as an ideal foundation cream 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.019
 and the acid moisturizer 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.930
 glycolic is an exfoliating cream more 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.479
 recommended for night use we continue 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.479

 We start by applying emulsion of 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.430

 as with a column the cake is ideal 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.790
 when we want to treat oily skin or

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.580
 on a gauze and joining its four 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.580
 extremes 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.380

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.310
 circulars without pressing or subtracting 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.759

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.460
 leaving the skin luminous and without graphite 

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:40.179
 After polishing we let it act for 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.639
 10 minutes and remove with sponge 

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:45.669
