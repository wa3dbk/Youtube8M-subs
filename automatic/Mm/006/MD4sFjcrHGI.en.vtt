00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 let's go around the world 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.529
 Around the world on moto2 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.630
 miquel wild will search all over the 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 planet the trail of the explorers 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.920
 less known 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.960
 and difficulties 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.000
 and adventure 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.000
 and beauty windows already 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:42.610
 and it looks pretty good and over there 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.430
 you see a fucking day the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.610
 bigger so you have to wear the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.040
 rain suit and etc. etcetera and not 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.190
 we got off of what the bike has 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.300
 that there is no body 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.370
 cool and you do not care if it rains to the thunder 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.420
 organizes that the bike is different very 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.820
 different 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.670
 on a motorcycle you also have to take care of 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.689
 maintenance I could not go to the circle 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.939
 Arctic polar because it had no cover 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.580
 is that these have made more than 10,000 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:23.799
 kilometers from here with support 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.799
 soldier and with a wheel in conditions 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.509
 but in his return to the world miguel no 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.619
 he has only traveled by motorcycle has also 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.040
 flown and sailed but see my eyes 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.800
 helicopters 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.060
 and a crazy idea has occurred to me but 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.060
 I think it can work 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.540
 let's see if they give us a spin on 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.400
 helicopter can be pretty good 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.600
 I hope the guy knows what he does but 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.820
 it's cool for me this is like the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.620
 because he's the typical pilot for 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.410
 lack of everything that was blind to 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:00.540
 bourbon whiskey and that to which it is 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.640
 synonym of wild nature and remoteness 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.560
 but many do not know that there too 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.410
 There is a trace of Spain 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.960
 Valdez city ​​with Spanish name more 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.630
 north of the planet founded by sailors in 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.670
 the 18th century mikel embarks to see it 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.920
 like them today we are going to sail those waters 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.200
 and let's see glaciers let's see what 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.950
 same that other explorers saw as 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.060
 moving away bad thorn or city sabador 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.060
 the Bay 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.940
 alarmed by the presence of Russians the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.190
 Spanish navigators explored the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.040
 cold waters of alaska 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.540
 the leridano fidalgo founded this port 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.030
 calling him in honor of the minister of 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.930
 carlos third antonio valdez 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.930
 fernandez bazán 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.319
 but mikel travels by motorcycle and that's why 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.510
 you want to arrive by road 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.510
 this is laughter son highway 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.510
 and this is the crossing this road takes 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.230
 Valdez and get anywhere else 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.230
 so far it has cost me a lot 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.180
 but we are almost in valdez but 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.980
 near his destination they tell him that of the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.360
 old Spanish city there is only the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.360
 name after an earthquake 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:41.140
 and I do not care if there's nothing left of the dream 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.760
 It has a Spanish name and that's what I 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.300
 He has come to look for you after crossing Europe 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.240
 Africa Asia and America 18 months in the 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.250
 path that has made him a nomad 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.350
 a nomad who sometimes runs out 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.720
 words but that will never stop 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.720
 write the diary of your own life 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.370
 They are 50 km to reach the city of 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:14.960
 Valdez but in reality I do not care anymore 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:19.840
 for me this is ballet 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.840
 it's the end of this that I wanted to get
