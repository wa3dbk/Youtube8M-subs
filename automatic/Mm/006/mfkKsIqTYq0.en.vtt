00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello everyone so I'm back 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.130
 today in a video with the site 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.379
 mrs audrey what you've heard before 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.620
 speak in my opinion on youtube which is 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.599
 a site of handbags and shoes 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.860
 so I got a handbag and two 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.690
 pairs of shoes that I spoke to you 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.910
 just ap since as you know I 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.410
 am a big fan of shoes and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.359
 I wanted to test a little bit 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
 their hot sure since the rain are 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.560
 really very affordable are at 2 990 a 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 about thirty euros 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.970
 in addition they took out the shoes of 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.470
 autumn winter and I saw a lot of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.660
 fathers who are superb and so 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.010
 do not hesitate to go do a little 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.000
 turn we never know maybe you 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.739
 find your happiness 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 in any case the deliveries end the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.149
 delivery is offered in relay point to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 from 9 euros 90 purchases so that's 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.980
 it's rather a good thing 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.520
 thing 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.489
 otherwise the shipping costs are at the price of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.379
 3.90 in relay point or 6 euros 90 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.739
 by colissimo against signature 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.660
 so here it is rather not bad 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.250
 high level because quality price ratio I 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.480
 find it pretty good so I'm going 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.539
 show that you have the handbag 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.519
 since I'm fine, I got it 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.760
 in a big box very well protected 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.040
 I was very pleasantly surprised 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.210
 it was very very well protected so the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.189
 handbag and is protected in a 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.720
 big redhead like that too so that 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.710
 that's fine for the store that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 I know that I like to change 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 handbag during summer or winter 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.860
 so I like when it's good 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.479
 protected so as they have a wii or this 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.460
 so that's rather it's rather not 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.810
 badly for for a jet of water at the bottom of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.840
 the cabinet or in a closet background 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.220
 and the purse looks like this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.200
 site it is super nice except that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.420
 for this winter he'll be great 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.050
 because it's black with gold 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.260
 he looks pretty stupid 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.570
 as we can see there are shots to 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.670
 each end of the bag 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.870
 so it's a little effect effect 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.060
 crocro here it is black black varnish you 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.430
 have the little golden details that are 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.810
 super nice city and it's very solid 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.060
 very solid closure we can not put 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.030
 bad things inside so 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.520
 so here and the inside of the bag and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.680
 like this so it's a flower pattern 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.530
 you have a lot of pockets there are 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.880
 three and you 're going to the bottom the hip of 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.410
 bag so it can still serve 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.360
 but me if personally I find 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.560
 what are these kind packs of his class get 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.560
 best wears early childhood I'm going 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.240
 get there I find it more attractive so 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.900
 So here are really two 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.190
 pockets inside there are there the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.450
 small like crazy back 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.270
 keys and phone 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.460
 there a small pocket closed and 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.470
 middle you have a big pouch 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.610
 closed and large large spaces 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.150
 to change a lot of things to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.950
 interior 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.040
 so that's really pretty good 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.080
 so I'll put the link of the bag in 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.090
 information bar if I find it on 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.640
 on the site but in any case it is 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.970
 really pretty and and that's it I think 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.650
 for this winter it is a beautiful sand 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.130
 for for this lends as many races 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.530
 this winter 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.850
 so that's tottenham full of others who 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.800
 are super pretty so I invite you to 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.540
 go see if you are a fan of bags 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.739
 by hand 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.970
 then I will go to the shoes 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.600
 in the as you know I am a 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.800
 big fan 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.650
 two pairs of shoes 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.020
 unfortunately I am between 2 35 and 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.610
 2 36 years old so the 30th if I tell you I 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.290
 advise you if you put on 36 of 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.670
 you hurry departure wait too much 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.739
 long on the pearl 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.570
 because there is often only one that 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.370
 reserve so that's what is a pity 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.720
 with the 36 but it's the same in store 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.750
 he often commits one or two 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.900
 pairs so 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.810
 so I got a pearl so we got them 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.830
 gets in a box 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.350
 she's like this so here's the same 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.380
 suffered a super well protected we do not have 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.340
 there's no problem with that and to do 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.570
 that I received and so here it is 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.660
 it's very very colorful because it was 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:52.830
 for this summer so with the wedge heel 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.550
 in imitation wood a little bit and you 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.350
 have the shoe that with a super nice 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.959
 motive when I know that I love them this 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:05.160
 pattern to someone a little black pants a 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.470
 little high white stockings or or purple like 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.620
 this I think it's super pretty 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.060
 the only downside that I found at 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.560
 this pair of shoes is at 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.269
 imitation heel level 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.049
 wood like these can how one 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.880
 can see he was hurt the wrong thing what 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.230
 but otherwise we have to wear it 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.790
 not see they are very very well they 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.770
 are super comfortable throw wearing 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.970
 already a few times so they are great 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.340
 comfortable they are very good at 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.500
 feet is what I liked it's this 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.360
 small elastic that is found in the bottom of 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.800
 the biggest shoe I've got you 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.090
 tell me I have a little foot and it's true 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.190
 that sometimes I do not fit in the 36 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.270
 is this one worth me so I'm 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.770
 really happy 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.990
 and that's it changes a little bit of 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.880
 pairs of shoes that I have in my 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.850
 wardrobe 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.419
 so here for celsino I am very 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.760
 content 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.979
 Then I received another pair of 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.900
 shoes that I was literally 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.570
