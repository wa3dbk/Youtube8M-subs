00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.470
 good morning, all I have the pleasure of 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.930
 present you a particular a car 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.449
 the first of a series today more than 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.510
 five cars they have with the letter 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:47.129
 coupÃ© to quick stop a device of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.920
 important safety to protect 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.559
 the operator in case of emergency from the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.440
 chain that today is still the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.489
 danger more course per operator than one 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:04.690
 chainsaw traditionally there is the brake 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.690
 front for kickback and protection with 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.619
 the left hand instead when I have to 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.289
 because I slip because there is an emergency 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.399
 I also have to leave my right hand 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:20.830
 with this text automatically the 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.310
 chain brake is activated and the chain is 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.149
 firm and nothing but a mechanism 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.960
 that has the same chain brake action that 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.810
 also use the parade hand in front for 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.569
 that the performances are the same 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.910
 there is only the advantage that when I 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:46.619
 during work I have to move the car 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:51.459
 the brake does not trigger as soon as you let up 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:54.869
 the accelerator the brake is activated and the 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.869
 chain stops
