00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
to join up and play monster hunter

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.530 
to join up and play monster hunter
together<00:02:52.849> which<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.209> wouldn't<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.510> been

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.210 
together which you wouldn't have been
able<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.900> do<00:02:53.989> otherwise<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:54.980> think<00:02:55.040> it's

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
able to do otherwise so I think it's

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.619 
able to do otherwise so I think it's
really<00:02:55.430> good<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.730> Nintendo's<00:02:56.209> doing<00:02:56.480> those
