on<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.550> floor<00:00:24.970> one<00:00:25.449> of<00:00:25.539> the<00:00:25.600> issues<00:00:26.050> with

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
on the floor one of the issues with

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.490 
on the floor one of the issues with
cages<00:00:26.890> like<00:00:27.039> this<00:00:27.310> is<00:00:27.519> these<00:00:28.359> sidewalls<00:00:28.869> these

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
cages like this is these sidewalls these

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.150 
cages like this is these sidewalls these
are<00:00:29.650> one<00:00:29.859> inch<00:00:30.070> by<00:00:30.340> two<00:00:30.400> inch<00:00:30.640> wire<00:00:32.100> now<00:00:33.100> the

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
are one inch by two inch wire now the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.910 
are one inch by two inch wire now the
problem<00:00:33.550> with<00:00:33.640> that<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:34.030> baby<00:00:34.600> kits<00:00:34.930> can<00:00:35.680> crawl

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
problem with that is baby kits can crawl

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.500 
problem with that is baby kits can crawl
off<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.250> wire<00:00:36.430> in<00:00:36.610> through<00:00:36.760> these<00:00:36.850> holes<00:00:36.940> I've

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
off the wire in through these holes I've

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.060 
off the wire in through these holes I've
lost<00:00:37.690> four<00:00:37.930> kits<00:00:38.140> over<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.440> past<00:00:38.650> two<00:00:38.830> years

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
lost four kits over the past two years

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.860 
lost four kits over the past two years
from<00:00:39.610> crawling<00:00:39.850> through<00:00:40.120> these<00:00:40.269> holes<00:00:40.449> after

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
from crawling through these holes after

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.479 
from crawling through these holes after
they<00:00:40.960> were<00:00:41.019> dropped<00:00:41.229> on<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.559> wire<00:00:41.739> so<00:00:42.370> this

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
they were dropped on the wire so this

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.890 
they were dropped on the wire so this
wasn't<00:00:42.699> a<00:00:42.850> deficiency<00:00:43.299> with<00:00:43.570> these<00:00:43.690> cages

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
wasn't a deficiency with these cages

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.299 
wasn't a deficiency with these cages
that<00:00:44.170> I<00:00:44.199> thought<00:00:44.440> about<00:00:44.559> when<00:00:44.799> I<00:00:44.830> bought<00:00:45.100> them

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
that I thought about when I bought them

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.460 
that I thought about when I bought them
nor<00:00:45.970> wasn't<00:00:46.239> one<00:00:46.330> that<00:00:46.449> I<00:00:46.510> thought<00:00:46.720> about<00:00:46.839> when

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
nor wasn't one that I thought about when

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.619 
nor wasn't one that I thought about when
I<00:00:47.530> was<00:00:47.559> looking<00:00:48.010> for<00:00:48.190> cages<00:00:48.549> initially<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:49.600> I

I was looking for cages initially so I

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:50.759 
I was looking for cages initially so I

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
of this half inch by one of stuff left

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.580 
of this half inch by one of stuff left
over<00:01:09.910> from<00:01:10.210> big<00:01:10.540> grow<00:01:10.780> out<00:01:10.900> cage<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.350> made<00:01:11.560> a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
over from big grow out cage I made a

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.430 
over from big grow out cage I made a
couple<00:01:11.890> years<00:01:12.130> ago<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.720> I'm<00:01:13.720> gonna<00:01:13.870> use<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.290> on

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
couple years ago and I'm gonna use it on

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.500 
couple years ago and I'm gonna use it on
this<00:01:14.740> cage<00:01:15.040> right<00:01:15.250> now<00:01:15.310> just<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.210> create<00:01:16.480> a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
this cage right now just to create a

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.060 
this cage right now just to create a
barrier<00:01:16.930> so<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.260> kids<00:01:17.440> can't<00:01:17.680> crawl<00:01:17.920> through

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
barrier so the kids can't crawl through

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.680 
barrier so the kids can't crawl through
it<00:01:18.190> if<00:01:18.280> they<00:01:18.370> get<00:01:18.490> dropped<00:01:18.670> on<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.970> wire<00:01:19.150> so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
it if they get dropped on the wire so

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.000 
it if they get dropped on the wire so
the<00:01:19.810> important<00:01:20.170> thing<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.350> remember<00:01:20.650> is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
the important thing to remember is

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.730 
the important thing to remember is
coverage<00:01:21.910> and<00:01:22.420> I<00:01:22.630> want<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.870> cover<00:01:23.050> 2<00:01:23.350> inches

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
coverage and I want to cover 2 inches

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.680 
coverage and I want to cover 2 inches
just<00:01:24.280> in<00:01:24.400> case<00:01:24.580> they<00:01:24.730> pile<00:01:24.940> up<00:01:25.180> on<00:01:25.300> each<00:01:25.450> other

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
just in case they pile up on each other

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.870 
just in case they pile up on each other
I've<00:01:26.230> never<00:01:26.500> seen<00:01:26.770> him<00:01:26.890> do<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.070> but<00:01:27.760> you

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
I've never seen him do that but you

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.670 
I've never seen him do that but you
never<00:01:28.030> know<00:01:28.240> she<00:01:28.450> may<00:01:28.870> also<00:01:29.080> pull<00:01:29.410> all<00:01:29.530> the

never know she may also pull all the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.830 
never know she may also pull all the
bedding<00:01:29.860> out<00:01:30.160> of<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.430> nest<00:01:30.640> box<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.240> create<00:01:31.780> a

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
bedding out of the nest box and create a

to the first floor so if I were to go to
go<00:02:21.239> up<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.870> would<00:02:22.050> block<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.739> door<00:02:22.890> from
