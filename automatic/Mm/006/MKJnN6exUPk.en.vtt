like not as amazing buildings as I would
have<00:00:25.740> liked<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.099> though<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.210> honest

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
have liked to though to be very honest

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.779 
have liked to though to be very honest
of<00:00:27.779> course<00:00:27.840> your<00:00:28.320> town<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.189> your<00:00:29.429> average

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of course your town is you your average

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.150 
of course your town is you your average
town<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.300> not<00:00:30.449> full<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.869> nice<00:00:31.050> buildings<00:00:31.560> quite

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
town is not full of nice buildings quite

town is not full of nice buildings quite
the<00:00:32.189> contrary<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.300> most<00:00:34.230> cities<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
the contrary I think most cities I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.610 
the contrary I think most cities I
mostly<00:00:36.090> exists<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> very<00:00:36.899> ugly<00:00:37.260> buildings

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
mostly exists out of very ugly buildings

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
mostly exists out of very ugly buildings
especially<00:00:37.739> outside<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.910> downtown<00:00:39.030> area<00:00:39.629> but

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
especially outside the downtown area but

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
especially outside the downtown area but
at<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.649> point<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.129> felt<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.550> hmm<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
at this point I just felt like hmm I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.240 
at this point I just felt like hmm I
need<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:42.930> wear<00:00:43.079> something<00:00:43.649> over<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:44.040> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
need some wear something over here I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
need some wear something over here I
have<00:00:44.280> no<00:00:44.610> clue<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.120> could<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
have no clue what this could be like a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.500 
have no clue what this could be like a
little<00:00:46.649> office<00:00:47.039> something<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.730> something

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
little office something as something

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.760 
little office something as something
like<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.930> doesn't<00:00:48.960> really<00:00:49.320> look<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
like that it doesn't really look like a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.830 
like that it doesn't really look like a
house<00:00:50.039> anyway<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.600> get

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
house anyway it's not like I really get

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.040 
house anyway it's not like I really get
houses<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.469> downtown<00:00:52.890> area<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:54.149> it's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
houses in this downtown area but it's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.720 
houses in this downtown area but it's
not<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.500> bad<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.980> at<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.309> point<00:00:56.520> i

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
not all that bad and at this point i

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.490 
not all that bad and at this point i
figured<00:00:57.420> i<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.719> try<00:00:57.840> making<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.289> look

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
figured i would try making it look

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.200 
figured i would try making it look
better<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.250> beams<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> roof<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
better with these beams on the roof and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
better with these beams on the roof and
i<00:01:00.960> guess<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.320> kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.620> worked<00:01:01.829> out<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.280> then

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
i guess that kind of worked out but then

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.039 
i guess that kind of worked out but then
I<00:01:02.760> felt<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.359> were<00:01:03.449> too<00:01:03.629> many<00:01:03.780> beams

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
I felt like there were too many beams

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.640 
I felt like there were too many beams
and<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.949> decided<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.489> go<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.650> I

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and I just decided to go with this and I

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.880 
and I just decided to go with this and I
think<00:01:08.100> at<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.430> point<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.360> felt<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:09.960> mmm

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
think at this point I just felt like mmm

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
think at this point I just felt like mmm
i<00:01:11.040> want<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> add<00:01:11.640> something<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.510> building

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
i want to add something to this building

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.870 
i want to add something to this building
like<00:01:13.049> little<00:01:13.619> arcs<00:01:14.010> little<00:01:14.400> details<00:01:14.760> that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
like little arcs little details that

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
like little arcs little details that
make<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> look<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.600> better<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.619> just

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
make it look a bit better but it just

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.890 
make it look a bit better but it just
nothing<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.880> worked<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.540> i<00:01:18.570> went<00:01:18.780> with

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
nothing really worked out so i went with

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.530 
nothing really worked out so i went with
a<00:01:19.140> chimney<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> end<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.299> that's<00:01:21.299> pretty

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
a chimney in the end and that's pretty

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.570 
a chimney in the end and that's pretty
much<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.020> building<00:01:22.409> now<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.130> point<00:01:23.340> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
much that building now at this point I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.460 
much that building now at this point I
felt<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.259> any

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
felt like I don't want to have any

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
felt like I don't want to have any
buildings<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.070> side<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.390> want<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
buildings on that side because I want to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.090 
buildings on that side because I want to
have<00:01:27.840> something<00:01:28.140> from<00:01:28.530> which<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
have something from which you have a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.249 
have something from which you have a
really<00:01:29.430> nice<00:01:29.640> view<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> city<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.630> those

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
really nice view of the city and those

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.380 
really nice view of the city and those
buildings<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.979> front<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> road<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.210> so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390

buildings in front of the road there so
I<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.710> thought<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> myself<00:01:35.159> well<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.700> might<00:01:35.880> as

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
I just thought to myself well I might as

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.609 
I just thought to myself well I might as
well<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.299> might<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.720> well<00:01:36.869> make<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.170> park

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
well I might as well make a little park

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
well I might as well make a little park
with<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> fountain<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> middle<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.329> some

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
with a fountain in the middle with some

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.020 
with a fountain in the middle with some
nice<00:01:39.630> trees<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> stuff<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.030> I'm

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
nice trees and stuff like that so I'm

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
nice trees and stuff like that so I'm
just<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.020> guess<00:01:43.189> with<00:01:44.189> nice

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
just going for that I guess with nice

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.639 
just going for that I guess with nice
paths<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.049> realized<00:01:46.470> I'm

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
paths like that and then I realized I'm

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.080 
paths like that and then I realized I'm
not<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> path<00:01:47.610> leaning<00:01:48.060> there

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
not going to have a path leaning there

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.149 
not going to have a path leaning there
anyway<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.259> I'm<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.950> those

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
anyway so I'm just going to have those

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.130 
anyway so I'm just going to have those
couple<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> parts<00:01:50.880> also<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.899> probably

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
couple of parts also this is probably

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.030 
couple of parts also this is probably
going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.860> um<00:01:53.130> well<00:01:54.560> yeah<00:01:55.560> probably

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
going to be the um well yeah probably

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.069 
going to be the um well yeah probably
i'm<00:01:56.310> not<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:57.000> continue<00:01:57.840> with

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
i'm not going to actually continue with

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.270 
i'm not going to actually continue with
the<00:01:58.200> town<00:01:58.409> over<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:58.799> i'm<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the town over there i'm just going to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.030 
the town over there i'm just going to
make<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> forest<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.619> some<00:02:01.619> road<00:02:01.829> with

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
make a forest there and some road with

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.350 
make a forest there and some road with
something<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.520> i<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:03.000> i'm<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.270> to

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
something but i don't think i'm going to

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.410 
something but i don't think i'm going to
continue<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.409> into<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.920> direction<00:02:05.420> now

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
continue with it into that direction now

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.210 
continue with it into that direction now
of<00:02:06.570> course<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.140> all<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.290> i<00:02:07.560> love<00:02:07.829> flowers

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
of course as you all know i love flowers

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.969 
of course as you all know i love flowers
so<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:08.940> point<00:02:09.149> i<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.390> went<00:02:09.840> crazy<00:02:10.649> with

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
so at this point i just went crazy with

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.440 
so at this point i just went crazy with
all<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.250> flowers<00:02:11.580> because<00:02:11.910> they're<00:02:12.090> they're

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
all the flowers because they're they're

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.640 
all the flowers because they're they're
awesome<00:02:12.599> and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
awesome and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.229 
awesome and
I<00:02:13.890> also<00:02:14.099> felt<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.549> adding<00:02:14.909> some<00:02:15.060> hedges

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
I also felt like adding some hedges

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.789 
I also felt like adding some hedges
because<00:02:15.629> they're<00:02:15.780> cool<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.230> kind<00:02:16.739> of

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
because they're cool and that kind of

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.649 
because they're cool and that kind of
worked<00:02:16.980> out<00:02:17.159> and<00:02:17.400> then<00:02:17.909> I<00:02:18.000> wanted<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.360> little

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
worked out and then I wanted a little

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.240 
worked out and then I wanted a little
Bush<00:02:18.840> over<00:02:19.049> there<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.439> couldn't<00:02:19.920> really<00:02:20.069> find

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
Bush over there but couldn't really find

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.830 
Bush over there but couldn't really find
anything<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:20.879> just<00:02:21.030> decided<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.599> go<00:02:21.750> with

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
anything so I just decided to go with

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.470 
anything so I just decided to go with
that<00:02:22.049> thing<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.709> end<00:02:22.829> and<00:02:23.120> at<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.269> point

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that thing in the end and at this point

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.809 
that thing in the end and at this point
and<00:02:24.720> whoa<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> weird<00:02:25.799> skip<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.310> that

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
and whoa that was a weird skip and that

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.250 
and whoa that was a weird skip and that
well<00:02:27.000> now<00:02:27.209> i'm<00:02:27.420> actually<00:02:27.659> going<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.079> build<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
well now i'm actually going to build a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.979 
well now i'm actually going to build a
skyscraper<00:02:28.470> though<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.189> i<00:02:29.909> might<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.870> do

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
skyscraper though and i might want to do

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.420 
skyscraper though and i might want to do
some<00:02:31.170> explaining<00:02:31.439> about<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.829> skyscraper

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
some explaining about the skyscraper

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.979 
some explaining about the skyscraper
because<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:32.879> you<00:02:33.000> might<00:02:33.150> see<00:02:33.359> it's<00:02:33.569> kind<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
because as you might see it's kind of a

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.289 
because as you might see it's kind of a
weird<00:02:34.019> shape<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.069> idea<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.489> basically<00:02:35.819> it

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
weird shape the idea is basically it

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.449 
weird shape the idea is basically it
consists<00:02:36.900> out<00:02:37.049> of<00:02:37.230> two<00:02:37.439> squares<00:02:37.590> which

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
consists out of two squares which

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.369 
consists out of two squares which
obviously<00:02:38.879> one<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.269> them<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.629> kind<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.959> more

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
obviously one of them is kind of more

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.110 
obviously one of them is kind of more
like<00:02:40.439> a<00:02:40.560> diamond<00:02:40.859> one<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.400> them<00:02:41.549> is<00:02:41.640> diagonal

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
like a diamond one of them is diagonal

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.670 
like a diamond one of them is diagonal
and<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.299> other<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.629> just<00:02:42.870> straight<00:02:43.170> so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and the other one is just straight so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.440 
and the other one is just straight so
they<00:02:43.829> kind<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.129> intersect<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.939> one<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.299> them

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
they kind of intersect and one of them

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.849 
they kind of intersect and one of them
is<00:02:45.510> made<00:02:45.720> out<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.900> glass<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.530> other<00:02:46.680> one

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
is made out of glass and the other one

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.649 
is made out of glass and the other one
is<00:02:46.889> made<00:02:47.129> out<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> bricks<00:02:47.609> and<00:02:47.819> does<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
is made out of bricks and does have the

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.809 
is made out of bricks and does have the
normal<00:02:48.840> windows<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.500> then<00:02:50.099> at<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.489> end<00:02:50.519> I

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
normal windows and then at the end I

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.160 
normal windows and then at the end I
want<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.120> create<00:02:51.269> some<00:02:51.569> kind<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.989> special

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
want to create some kind of a special

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.720 
want to create some kind of a special
spire<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:52.920> you'll<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.340> at<00:02:53.489> some<00:02:53.700> point

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
spire but you'll see that at some point

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.729 
spire but you'll see that at some point
and<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.510> might<00:02:54.750> think<00:02:55.019> well<00:02:55.200> that's<00:02:55.349> not<00:02:55.560> very

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
and I might think well that's not very

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.710 
and I might think well that's not very
high<00:02:56.010> well<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.579> point<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.909> doing<00:02:57.329> this<00:02:57.480> is

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
high well the point of doing this is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.599 
high well the point of doing this is
just<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.049> make<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.409> base<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.920> then<00:02:59.040> copy<00:02:59.310> paste

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
just to make a base and then copy paste

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.089 
just to make a base and then copy paste
it<00:02:59.819> like<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.750> create<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.139> large<00:03:01.500> tower<00:03:01.799> and

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
it like this to create a large tower and

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.069 
it like this to create a large tower and
at<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.609> point<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:03.060> felt<00:03:03.239> pretty<00:03:03.480> safe<00:03:03.840> with

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
at this point I felt pretty safe with

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.319 
at this point I felt pretty safe with
the<00:03:04.230> height<00:03:04.439> of<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.340> just<00:03:05.700> decided<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> add

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
the height of it so just decided to add

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.270 
the height of it so just decided to add
a<00:03:06.359> cornice<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.900> start<00:03:07.470> work<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:07.920> spire

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
a cornice and start work on the spire

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.940 
a cornice and start work on the spire
and<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:09.180> love<00:03:09.510> doing<00:03:09.689> spires<00:03:10.109> for<00:03:10.439> for

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
and I love doing spires for for

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.069 
and I love doing spires for for
skyscrapers<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:12.090> only<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.540> only<00:03:12.720> thing<00:03:12.930> to

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
skyscrapers the only the only thing to

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.259 
skyscrapers the only the only thing to
it<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.680> fact<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.010> sometimes<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:15.090> just

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
it is the fact that sometimes you just

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.940 
it is the fact that sometimes you just
end<00:03:15.510> up<00:03:15.569> with<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> spire<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.409> really<00:03:16.739> love

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
end up with a spire that you really love

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.979 
end up with a spire that you really love
like<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.639> this<00:03:17.760> case<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:18.209> really<00:03:18.449> like<00:03:18.629> it<00:03:18.810> and

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
like in this case I really like it and

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.140 
like in this case I really like it and
sometimes<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.769> get<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.459> just<00:03:20.699> end<00:03:20.819> up<00:03:20.910> with<00:03:21.120> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
sometimes you get you just end up with a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.849 
sometimes you get you just end up with a
really<00:03:21.359> ugly<00:03:21.569> spire<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.199> hate<00:03:22.379> it<00:03:22.560> when

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
really ugly spire and I hate it when

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.530 
really ugly spire and I hate it when
that<00:03:22.889> happens<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.819> thankfully<00:03:24.329> I<00:03:24.359> actually

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
that happens but thankfully I actually

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.839 
that happens but thankfully I actually
like<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.019> one<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.410> well<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.370> spire<00:03:26.639> is

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
like this one and well the spire is

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.339 
like this one and well the spire is
actually<00:03:27.209> where<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.510> hair-pulling<00:03:27.750> begins

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
actually where the hair-pulling begins

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.509 
actually where the hair-pulling begins
because<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:28.949> combine<00:03:29.129> all<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
because you have to combine all the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.789 
because you have to combine all the
little<00:03:29.760> diagonal<00:03:30.329> pieces<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.440> turns<00:03:31.620> into

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
little diagonal pieces and it turns into

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.399 
little diagonal pieces and it turns into
one<00:03:32.040> big<00:03:32.220> chicks<00:03:32.459> or<00:03:32.699> and<00:03:33.019> have<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.139> make<00:03:34.290> that

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
one big chicks or and have to make that

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.170 
one big chicks or and have to make that
spire<00:03:34.709> but<00:03:34.949> at<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.430> point<00:03:35.639> you<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:35.940> really

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
spire but at this point you can really

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.089 
spire but at this point you can really
see<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:36.629> shape<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.139> building<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:37.919> just

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
see the shape of the building and I just

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.890 
see the shape of the building and I just
kind<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.340> looks<00:03:38.549> at<00:03:38.699> it<00:03:38.819> and<00:03:38.849> I<00:03:39.269> felt<00:03:39.750> pretty

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
kind of looks at it and I felt pretty

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.539 
kind of looks at it and I felt pretty
content<00:03:40.379> with<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.040> I'm<00:03:41.159> just<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.519> just

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
content with it so I'm just I just

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.210 
content with it so I'm just I just
decided<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.239> go<00:03:42.840> with<00:03:42.959> this<00:03:43.139> I<00:03:43.349> just<00:03:43.979> really

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
decided to go with this I just really

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.860 
decided to go with this I just really
like<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.519> idea<00:03:44.549> of<00:03:44.879> the<00:03:45.000> glass<00:03:45.299> coming<00:03:45.690> out

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
like the idea of the glass coming out

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.689 
like the idea of the glass coming out
and<00:03:46.109> just<00:03:46.500> being<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.769> little<00:03:46.799> bit<00:03:47.190> higher<00:03:47.459> and

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
and just being a little bit higher and

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.149 
and just being a little bit higher and
then<00:03:48.239> having<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.629> diagonal<00:03:49.229> thing<00:03:49.709> on<00:03:49.949> top

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
then having that diagonal thing on top

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.000 
then having that diagonal thing on top
of<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.940> kind<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.389> reminds<00:03:51.840> me<00:03:51.989> well<00:03:52.440> this

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
of it it kind of reminds me well this

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.129 
of it it kind of reminds me well this
building<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.459> actually<00:03:53.729> not<00:03:54.389> really<00:03:54.449> based<00:03:54.930> on

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
building is actually not really based on

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.719 
building is actually not really based on
any<00:03:55.379> building<00:03:55.769> in<00:03:55.799> real<00:03:56.040> life<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.579> was

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
any building in real life but it was

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:01.219 
any building in real life but it was
inspired<00:03:57.269> by<00:03:57.979> one<00:03:58.979> canada<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.609> london<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.269> the

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
inspired by one canada in london and the

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.009 
inspired by one canada in london and the
message<00:04:02.159> to<00:04:02.250> him<00:04:02.340> in<00:04:02.639> frankfurt<00:04:03.599> so<00:04:03.870> that's

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
message to him in frankfurt so that's

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.619 
message to him in frankfurt so that's
pretty<00:04:04.260> cool<00:04:04.699> of<00:04:05.699> course<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.150> does<00:04:06.299> have<00:04:06.449> that

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
pretty cool of course it does have that

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.159 
pretty cool of course it does have that
little<00:04:07.169> well<00:04:08.209> well<00:04:09.209> it's<00:04:09.419> it's<00:04:09.629> a<00:04:09.750> ruse<00:04:09.930> pie

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
little well well it's it's a ruse pie

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.349 
little well well it's it's a ruse pie
that's<00:04:10.409> not<00:04:10.650> like<00:04:10.889> many<00:04:11.430> spires<00:04:11.760> it's<00:04:12.060> very

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
that's not like many spires it's very

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.069 
that's not like many spires it's very
straight<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.900> diagonal<00:04:13.530> in<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.680> sense<00:04:13.919> and<00:04:14.190> I

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
straight and diagonal in a sense and I

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.210 
straight and diagonal in a sense and I
actually<00:04:16.079> thought<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.590> calling<00:04:16.949> this<00:04:17.159> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
actually thought of calling this the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.710 
actually thought of calling this the
prison<00:04:17.699> but<00:04:17.909> I'm<00:04:18.060> still<00:04:18.269> not<00:04:18.389> really<00:04:18.449> sure

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
prison but I'm still not really sure

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.039 
prison but I'm still not really sure
about<00:04:19.019> doing<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.470> but<00:04:20.630> yeah<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:21.779> is<00:04:21.840> also

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
about doing that but yeah this is also

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.690 
about doing that but yeah this is also
one<00:04:22.409> of<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.620> hair-pulling<00:04:22.860> parts<00:04:23.460> where<00:04:23.610> you

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
one of the hair-pulling parts where you

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.310 
one of the hair-pulling parts where you
have<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.969> add<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.330> all<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.570> little<00:04:24.930> frames

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
have to add in all the little frames

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.530 
have to add in all the little frames
because<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:26.010> course<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.639> don't<00:04:26.729> want<00:04:26.969> to<00:04:27.060> have

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
because of course you don't want to have

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.770 
because of course you don't want to have
lose<00:04:28.350> glass<00:04:28.860> fame<00:04:29.160> but<00:04:29.670> at<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:29.970> point<00:04:30.330> the

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
lose glass fame but at that point the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.930 
lose glass fame but at that point the
tower<00:04:31.200> is<00:04:31.320> pretty<00:04:31.830> much<00:04:32.010> finished<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:32.730> I

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
tower is pretty much finished so I

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.180 
tower is pretty much finished so I
decided<00:04:33.390> to<00:04:33.510> just<00:04:33.840> create<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.350> little<00:04:34.830> entrance

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
decided to just create a little entrance

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.670 
decided to just create a little entrance
area<00:04:35.430> with<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.200> neoclassical<00:04:37.200> entrance

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
area with a neoclassical entrance

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.910 
area with a neoclassical entrance

thingamajig because i love neoclassical
and<00:04:41.450> it's<00:04:42.450> not<00:04:42.600> going<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.900> be<00:04:43.020> too<00:04:43.170> big<00:04:43.410> it's

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
not really going to be like a tower that

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.690 
not really going to be like a tower that
stands<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.290> middle<00:04:46.350> of<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.770> pretty<00:04:47.430> large

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
stands in the middle of a pretty large

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.310 
stands in the middle of a pretty large
building<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.360> is<00:04:48.570> going<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.840> be<00:04:48.930> this<00:04:49.110> one

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
work on the rest of the surrounding is

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.830 
work on the rest of the surrounding is
just<00:04:52.950> going<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.100> be<00:04:53.160> trees<00:04:53.940> or<00:04:54.210> grass<00:04:54.240> or

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
just going to be trees or grass or

just going to be trees or grass or
something<00:04:55.170> like<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.320> I<00:04:55.620> don't<00:04:55.830> know<00:04:55.920> exactly

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
something like that I don't know exactly

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.760 
something like that I don't know exactly
but<00:04:56.720> yeah<00:04:57.720> I<00:04:57.750> really<00:04:58.080> like<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.350> look<00:04:58.470> of<00:04:58.590> this

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
but yeah I really like the look of this

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
and of course this entrance area is

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.800 
and of course this entrance area is
going<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.620> be<00:05:01.710> very<00:05:02.310> straightforward<00:05:03.240> just<00:05:03.600> as

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
going to be very straightforward just as

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.770 
going to be very straightforward just as
simple<00:05:04.220> classic<00:05:05.220> well<00:05:05.850> when<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.300> even<00:05:06.570> call

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
simple classic well when you even call

simple classic well when you even call
those<00:05:06.930> things<00:05:07.200> it's<00:05:07.380> kind<00:05:07.590> of<00:05:07.650> like<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.860> like<00:05:08.400> a

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
those things it's kind of like a like a

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.060

Greek<00:05:08.700> temple<00:05:08.880> in<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.180> sense<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.980> at<00:05:10.980> that

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
Greek temple in the sense and at that

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
that large beam because it was kind of

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.490 
that large beam because it was kind of
sticking<00:05:15.330> through<00:05:15.570> them<00:05:15.780> through<00:05:16.230> the<00:05:16.320> door

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500

windows<00:05:23.250> from<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.700> main<00:05:23.850> street<00:05:24.090> set<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:24.480> I

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
windows from the main street set and I

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.700 
windows from the main street set and I
really<00:05:24.870> have<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.080> watch<00:05:25.200> out<00:05:25.410> with<00:05:25.560> that

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
really have to watch out with that

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
because I'm almost over using those

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.420 
because I'm almost over using those
things<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.170> don't<00:05:28.470> want<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.770> over<00:05:29.010> use<00:05:29.130> any

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
things and I don't want to over use any

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.250 
things and I don't want to over use any
set<00:05:29.700> but<00:05:30.210> it's<00:05:30.360> just<00:05:30.570> that<00:05:30.720> those<00:05:30.900> windows

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
set but it's just that those windows

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.230 
set but it's just that those windows
goes<00:05:31.500> so<00:05:31.830> well<00:05:31.860> with<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.430> entire<00:05:32.760> classical

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
goes so well with the entire classical

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.330 
goes so well with the entire classical
theme<00:05:33.420> ale<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:33.750> have<00:05:33.870> had<00:05:34.020> going<00:05:34.260> on<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.680> they

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
windows that that have a war connected

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.210 
windows that that have a war connected
to<00:05:44.700> them<00:05:44.850> but<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.150> don't<00:05:45.240> want<00:05:45.720> that<00:05:45.840> of<00:05:45.990> course

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
to them but I don't want that of course

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.390 
to them but I don't want that of course
