 despite specialization in operation remains the training goal of the Allrounder 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.239
 With diversity in the curriculum the school tries to achieve this 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.009
 a media designer should be able to do everything the companies are looking for but often already in 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.799
 The education specialist the school is doing its utmost to make this possible 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.979
 compensate

 and now si big fire in one of the room high school 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.189
 please just let us know what makes this call so special 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.239
 yes I think that is the wide range of activities in the 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.149
 Training content is what makes the job so interesting and then of course 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:59.139
 the country 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.430
 Simply driving the pulse of the media is in the midst of these media teams 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.849
 This is certainly still a second factor coming to citizens 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.840
 of course I ask myself now and the audience at home, too 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.100
 whether you can accommodate them many areas the view only the three goes 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.549
 that at all 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.159
 Strictly speaking, no if you make the claim next to the areas 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.379
 Depth does not work in three years 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:24.039
 but what is going well in three years is this entire range of 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.840
 Basic knowledge to cover 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.570
 When to simply then make in the experience certain injuries too 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.520
 and this is also reflected in practice, the training and good foundation 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.659
 afterwards you have to qualify and then afterwards into one 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.340
 certain direction deepened progress 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.340
 and what role does he play with exactly the vocational school without training 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.689
 yes, yes 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.020
 Of course, we should of course do what all vocational schools do 

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:52.770
 have to be in dual education system the 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.430
 is responsible for teaching the theoretical foundations in practice 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.639
 Of course, here we are 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.719
 bring together the trainees from very different areas 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.599
 in the classes and that we work with projects and with practical 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.620
 Exercises can balance a lot what the sole proprietorship is not 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.779
 can afford 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.789
 The tree has now been introduced to Bützow Mitchell 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.860
 Do not make direct impact Qatar for example, short Cameron build 

00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:19.559
 about this detour 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:23.169
 There were two decades of training or volunteer percent 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.490
 had this education 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.559
 On advantages she has but also disadvantages when it is very strong on it 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.699
 Percent of which was dependent on who trains so it is really very tight only 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.919
 learned what the instructor could teach 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.819
 and with the emergence of private television in the 90s 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.689
 the market has grown very rapidly at first and on those growing 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.199
 You also have to react to the market with new specialists and that's where it came from 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.810
 actually just in time for the qualified broadband 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.849
 Training was offered 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:52.790
 APA 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.370
 That's a very good transition in Berlin for a while now 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.439
 we introduce someone 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.540
 who has already completed his education 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.260
 and now here to introduce his new movie wants to look the same 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.740
 exclusive now 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.879
 officially progressing hard when we win now
