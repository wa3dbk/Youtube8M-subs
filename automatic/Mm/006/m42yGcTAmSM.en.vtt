00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
it is I'll probably do a tutorial on it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.160 
it is I'll probably do a tutorial on it
and<00:02:23.340> some<00:02:23.880> point<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.330> show<00:02:24.570> people<00:02:24.810> how

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
and some point just to show people how

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.880 
and some point just to show people how
it<00:02:25.320> works

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
it works

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.230

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
I've been doing but sometimes it works

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.050 
I've been doing but sometimes it works
sometimes<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.390> aren't<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.080> depends

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
sometimes it aren't it just depends

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.060 
sometimes it aren't it just depends
because<00:02:48.060> sometimes<00:02:48.810> sometimes<00:02:49.710> it's<00:02:49.890> not

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
because sometimes sometimes it's not
