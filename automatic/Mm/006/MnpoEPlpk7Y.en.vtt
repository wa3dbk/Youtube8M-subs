00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
 michelin the best way to move forward 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.849
 we continue in Argentina in this octave 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.619
 stage with differentiated specials for 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.599
 cars and motorcycles there is no 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.390
 technical difficulties the problem is the 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.730
 mileage and heavy rains the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.950
 cars should have traveled 470 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.860
 kilometers of special to end with 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.500
 a link of 380 kilometers between jumps 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.480
 and Tucuman in Argentina but the special 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.850
 has been reduced by half because 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.860
 the clues are impracticable since nancy 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.230
 haiti nasser al-attiyah are with 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.850
 elbow only 10 seconds separate them 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.560
 stefan peta monzer is left something 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.230
 lagged until the moment when nasser 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.190
 al-attiyah makes a slight mistake 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.050
 clueless by the numerous footprints 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.870
 different from the photos in the kilometer 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.420
 118 the Qatari stands still on two o'clock 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.520
 three minutes the special ends in 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.800
 flooded piste the plentiful 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.630
 rains have overflowed the rivers and 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.370
 finally it's jagland seagate who 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.100
 better get out of the way with four minutes 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.940
 of advantage over Newfoundland 5 over robby 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.100
 gordon and 12 on stéphane peterhansel 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.110
 but after reaching the first four the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.080
 organizers decide to neutralize the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.940
 race at the height of kilometer 86 by 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.020
 what the general classification is very 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.030
 uncertain 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.160
 logically stéphane peterhansel should 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.080
 keep the head of the general but 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.910
 Commissioners must still validate the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.910
 differences and they will do it on this night 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.500
 in bikes also the special one has been 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.560
 cropped with a link of 280 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.660
 kilometers unfortunately how was 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.000
 to expect the winner of Friday kart 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.470
 Caselli has many difficulties 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.320
 Caselli who is not an expert in navigation 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.120
 the sections of 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.040
 Mark eat to teach him how to read a 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.040
 road book have not worked 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.710
 anyway the runners are a 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.040
 little distracted everyone is wrong about 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.290
 kilometer 118 road except gonçálves 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.480
 and Rodriguez who have relied on the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.310
 road book but a few more kilometers 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.310
 late Rodriguez also deviates 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.069
 finally everything is in the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.810
 correct path and it's joan barreda board 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.060
 who is imposed for the third time in this 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.330
 dakar in front of the slovak ivan already 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.700
 that if the French david casteu olive 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.920
 It arrives with 37 minutes late on 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.990
 joan barreda board and especially with 14 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.209
 minutes of delay over david casteau 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.160
 of his first pursuer a French 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.380
 replaces another Frenchman in the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.080
 general david who studies ahead of 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.420
 Ruben Faria Olive is 16 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.280
 minutes and cyril de pay who receives a 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.390
 24-hour sanction is 24 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.390
 minutes of punishment
