00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
exactly the same all of them are exactly

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
exactly the same all of them are exactly
the<00:01:18.810> same<00:01:18.950> obviously<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.369> minor

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the same obviously get a little minor

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
the same obviously get a little minor
changes<00:01:21.210> till<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.540> make<00:01:21.689> them<00:01:21.900> more<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.409> know

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
changes till it make them more you know

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.480 
changes till it make them more you know
modern<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.350> then<00:01:25.350> they're<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.280> same

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
modern and then they're just the same

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
modern and then they're just the same
but<00:01:27.030> anyway<00:01:27.360> shouldn't<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.170> compare<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
but anyway shouldn't really compare a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.090 
but anyway shouldn't really compare a
phone<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> car<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.630> know<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> don't<00:01:31.100> so

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.219 
let's go to the avenged we're not too
far<00:01:35.189> away<00:01:35.580> from<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.090> actually<00:01:36.659> expected

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
far away from it now actually expected

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.320 
far away from it now actually expected
it<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> be<00:01:37.470> quite<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.920> longer<00:01:38.369> lot<00:01:38.700> longer<00:01:39.030> but

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
it to be quite a longer lot longer but

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.190 
it to be quite a longer lot longer but

everywhere

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.010 
everywhere
bloody<00:02:05.290> annoying<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:08.970> yeah<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.450> map<00:02:10.840> is

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
bloody annoying right yeah this map is

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.840 
bloody annoying right yeah this map is
really<00:02:11.500> tiny<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.350> think<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:15.160> get<00:02:15.310> round<00:02:15.610> it

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
really tiny it I think to get round it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.660 
really tiny it I think to get round it
low<00:02:16.570> around<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.380> world<00:02:17.590> track<00:02:17.920> that's<00:02:18.160> 14

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
low around the world track that's 14

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.290 
low around the world track that's 14
miles<00:02:19.000> i<00:02:19.209> believe<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.250> takes<00:02:21.430> 14<00:02:21.940> miles<00:02:22.150> to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
miles i believe so it takes 14 miles to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.530 
miles i believe so it takes 14 miles to
get<00:02:22.390> round<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.990> 14<00:02:23.380> miles<00:02:23.590> takes<00:02:23.920> maybe

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
get round and the 14 miles takes maybe

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.940 
get round and the 14 miles takes maybe
3-4<00:02:25.540> minutes<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.420> that's<00:02:29.170> not<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.470> long<00:02:29.680> enough

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
3-4 minutes and that's not a long enough

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.670 
3-4 minutes and that's not a long enough
