00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
monkey glitch in I guess it's just a

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.820

zombie<00:00:08.370> right<00:00:09.150> one<00:00:09.480> alright<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.710> got

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
zombie right one alright so what you got

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.799 
zombie right one alright so what you got
to<00:00:10.920> do<00:00:11.010> getting<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.880> monkeys<00:00:12.210> obviously<00:00:12.660> that

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
to do getting the monkeys obviously that

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.780 
to do getting the monkeys obviously that
would<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> unlimited<00:00:13.650> money<00:00:14.099> glitch<00:00:14.130> it

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
would be the unlimited money glitch it

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.420 
would be the unlimited money glitch it
would<00:00:14.910> be<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> point<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:16.080> right<00:00:16.980> now<00:00:17.100> I

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
would be the point and right now I

all you gonna do is throw a grenade and
you're<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.619> walk<00:00:31.769> over<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.309> press<00:00:32.640> l<00:00:32.820> too

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
you're going to walk over it press l too

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.060 
you're going to walk over it press l too
don't<00:00:33.030> press<00:00:33.719> r2<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.170> pick<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.710> press<00:00:34.920> l

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
don't press r2 to pick it up the press l

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.310 
don't press r2 to pick it up the press l
to<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> button<00:00:36.780> opposite<00:00:37.230> of

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
to that would be the button opposite of

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.040 
to that would be the button opposite of
our<00:00:37.440> two<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.860> left<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.600> yeah

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
our two to the left of it and yeah

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.840 
our two to the left of it and yeah
that's<00:00:40.440> that's<00:00:40.649> basically<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.430> amounts

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that's that's basically what it amounts

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.310 
that's that's basically what it amounts
to it's<00:00:42.329> probably<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.660> easiest<00:00:42.930> glitch<00:00:43.170> I've

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
to it's probably the easiest glitch I've

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.520 
to it's probably the easiest glitch I've
ever<00:00:43.440> done<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.739> my<00:00:43.770> life<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.370> actually<00:00:45.530> yeah

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
ever done in my life and actually yeah

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
ever done in my life and actually yeah
yeah<00:00:47.039> yeah<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.460> can't<00:00:47.760> think<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.940> an<00:00:48.000> easier

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
yeah yeah I can't think of an easier

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.940 
yeah yeah I can't think of an easier
glitch<00:00:48.450> jumping<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> corners<00:00:49.860> pretty

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
glitch jumping in the corners pretty

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
glitch jumping in the corners pretty
easy<00:00:50.219> but<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.550> easier<00:00:50.660> look<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.780> that

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
easy but this is easier look at that

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
easy but this is easier look at that
look<00:00:52.140> how<00:00:52.199> many<00:00:52.440> grenade<00:00:52.710> look<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.879> get

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
look how many grenade look you get

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.319 
look how many grenade look you get
basically<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.930> eight<00:00:55.280> monkeys

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
basically you can have eight monkeys

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.760 
basically you can have eight monkeys
right<00:00:57.329> when<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.680> get

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
right when you get it so if you get

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.340 
right when you get it so if you get
monkeys<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.510> enemy

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
monkeys you can get them and enemy

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.599 
monkeys you can get them and enemy
that's<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.649> easy<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.890> guess<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.190> seven<00:01:02.489> not

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that's so easy I guess that's seven not

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
that's so easy I guess that's seven not
eight<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> whatever<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:04.559> every

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
eight but so whatever and then every

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
eight but so whatever and then every
every<00:01:05.369> time<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.610> spawned<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.030> new<00:01:06.150> round

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
every time you spawned on a new round

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.960 
every time you spawned on a new round
you<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.990> there's<00:01:07.200> two<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.970> that's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you get to so there's two more that's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 
you get to so there's two more that's
relatively<00:01:09.510> easy<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.350> save<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.799> three

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
relatively easy to do so save your three

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
relatively easy to do so save your three
like<00:01:11.250> throw<00:01:12.000> three<00:01:12.210> when<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.390> need<00:01:12.570> them<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
like throw three when you need them and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
like throw three when you need them and
then<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.140> those<00:01:13.290> extra<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:14.790> going

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
then you have those extra for I'm going

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.640 
then you have those extra for I'm going
to<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.330> into<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> pack<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> punch<00:01:16.439> room

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
to do is I go into the pack a punch room

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.960 
to do is I go into the pack a punch room
