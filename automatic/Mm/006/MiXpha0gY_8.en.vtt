00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
 introducing dota 2 of course it's a game 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.920
 needs no introduction and part of them 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.490
 there will be a lot of miss different and go and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.410

 let's take a deeper climb 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.390
 the first takes a lot of time 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.800
 yes and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.690
 It does not occur in the first place in 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.000
 a person who has been looking at dota for a long time 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.190
 do not know whether to start playing and say 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 honestly it's not so it's very sure 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.790
 that this graph of the right hands does not burn 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 of time in general and how it goes 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.170
 match he sees an average of 40 45 minutes and not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.690

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.309
 this is an improvement in the output but it is not 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.699
 consumes a lot of time only if 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.699
