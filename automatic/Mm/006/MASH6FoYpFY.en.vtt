00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.730 
because it actually allows me to attack
more<00:03:11.180> often<00:03:11.570> if<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:12.320> don't<00:03:12.440> know<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.620> make

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
more often if I don't know that make

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.070 
more often if I don't know that make
sense<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.070> guys<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.400> basically<00:03:13.610> put

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
sense to you guys but I basically put

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.270 
sense to you guys but I basically put
the<00:03:15.080> wall<00:03:15.260> breakers<00:03:15.620> been<00:03:15.770> getting<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.100> each

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
the wall breakers been getting of each

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.920 
the wall breakers been getting of each
of<00:03:16.430> my<00:03:16.520> barracks<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.150> I've<00:03:17.240> 8<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.510> 12<00:03:17.720> every

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
of my barracks so I've 8 to 12 every

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.840 
of my barracks so I've 8 to 12 every
time<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:18.140> raid<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.620> then<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.160> put<00:03:19.459> of<00:03:19.580> course

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
time I raid and then I put of course

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.610 
time I raid and then I put of course
half<00:03:20.180> my<00:03:20.360> barracks<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.810> goblins<00:03:21.290> half<00:03:21.470> my

half my barracks and goblins half my
barracks<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.040> archers<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.610> then<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.180> just

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
barracks and archers and then I just

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.050 
barracks and archers and then I just
make<00:03:23.600> two<00:03:24.020> golems<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:25.130> whenever<00:03:25.520> the<00:03:25.760> golems

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
make two golems and whenever the golems

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.370 
make two golems and whenever the golems

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
do actually build look at this by the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.430 
do actually build look at this by the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.610 
way I have a lava hound the clan castle
completely<00:03:31.160> useless<00:03:31.790> guys<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:33.290> whatever

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
completely useless guys but whatever

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.440 
completely useless guys but whatever
pretty<00:03:34.310> funny<00:03:34.550> though<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:34.940> don't<00:03:35.090> really<00:03:35.270> care

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
pretty funny though I don't really care

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.940 
pretty funny though I don't really care
what<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.660> get<00:03:35.780> my<00:03:35.900> clan<00:03:36.110> castle<00:03:36.320> I<00:03:36.500> just<00:03:36.739> don't

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
what I get my clan castle I just don't

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.190 
what I get my clan castle I just don't
care<00:03:37.130> I'll<00:03:37.850> win<00:03:38.180> either<00:03:38.360> way<00:03:38.510> whether<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:38.989> have

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
care I'll win either way whether I have

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.170 
care I'll win either way whether I have
anything<00:03:39.470> or<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:39.830> know<00:03:40.100> whatever<00:03:40.370> isolate

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
anything or you know whatever isolate

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.760 
anything or you know whatever isolate
dropping<00:03:41.600> it<00:03:41.690> just<00:03:41.900> for<00:03:42.020> the<00:03:42.050> distraction<00:03:42.380> but

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
dropping it just for the distraction but

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.770 
dropping it just for the distraction but
I<00:03:42.830> way<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.430> as<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:43.760> was<00:03:43.790> saying<00:03:43.910> back<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.690> the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
I way so as I was saying back to the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.300 
I way so as I was saying back to the
golems<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.470> reason<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.739> do<00:03:45.800> is<00:03:45.950> because<00:03:45.980> they

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
golems the reason I do is because they

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.160 
golems the reason I do is because they
do<00:03:46.370> build<00:03:46.820> occasionally<00:03:47.630> so<00:03:47.780> like<00:03:47.900> every

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
do build occasionally so like every

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.010 
do build occasionally so like every
other<00:03:48.320> rate<00:03:48.650> or<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:49.010> i<00:03:49.220> will<00:03:50.060> have<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.600> double

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
other rate or so i will have the double

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.250 
other rate or so i will have the double
golems<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:52.250> allows<00:03:52.489> for<00:03:53.000> me<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.420> have<00:03:54.080> my

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
golems and that allows for me to have my

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.800 
golems and that allows for me to have my
troops<00:03:54.500> build<00:03:54.770> even<00:03:55.130> faster<00:03:55.700> on<00:03:55.850> boost<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:56.780> i

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
troops build even faster on boost so i

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.000 
troops build even faster on boost so i
don't<00:03:57.020> know<00:03:57.170> if<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.260> makes<00:03:57.500> sense<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.860> you

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
don't know if that makes sense to you

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.710 
don't know if that makes sense to you
but<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.310> takes<00:03:58.430> up<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.640> 60<00:03:58.910> spots<00:03:59.209> that<00:03:59.540> would

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
but it takes up to 60 spots that would

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.090 
but it takes up to 60 spots that would
have<00:03:59.840> taken<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.080> couple<00:04:00.230> minutes<00:04:00.440> even<00:04:00.980> I'm

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
have taken a couple minutes even I'm

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.610 
have taken a couple minutes even I'm
boost<00:04:01.340> for<00:04:01.520> archers<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:01.880> goblins<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.420> build

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
boost for archers and goblins to build

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.810 
boost for archers and goblins to build
so<00:04:03.620> it's<00:04:03.770> not<00:04:03.890> every<00:04:04.160> rate<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.489> have<00:04:04.640> them

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
so it's not every rate that I have them

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.810 
so it's not every rate that I have them
but<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.270> lot<00:04:05.540> of<00:04:05.750> raids<00:04:06.050> I<00:04:06.230> do<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.820> it's

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
but a lot of raids I do and it's

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.890 
but a lot of raids I do and it's
basically<00:04:08.239> whatever<00:04:08.480> i'm<00:04:08.600> waiting<00:04:08.780> for<00:04:08.810> my

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
basically whatever i'm waiting for my

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.540 
basically whatever i'm waiting for my
spells<00:04:09.260> that<00:04:09.590> i<00:04:09.650> actually<00:04:09.830> get<00:04:10.130> stuck<00:04:10.400> with<00:04:10.519> it

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
spells that i actually get stuck with it

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.670 
spells that i actually get stuck with it
but<00:04:10.730> now<00:04:10.850> that<00:04:10.880> i'm<00:04:11.120> farming<00:04:11.390> i<00:04:11.690> rarely<00:04:12.350> wait

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
but now that i'm farming i rarely wait

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.440 
but now that i'm farming i rarely wait
for<00:04:12.860> spells<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:13.340> it's<00:04:13.489> really<00:04:13.730> fun<00:04:14.150> actually

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
for spells and it's really fun actually

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.310 
for spells and it's really fun actually
and<00:04:15.130> yeah<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:17.030> we're<00:04:17.570> gonna<00:04:17.690> continue<00:04:17.900> long
