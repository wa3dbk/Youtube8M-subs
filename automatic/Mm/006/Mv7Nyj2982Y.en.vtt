it doesn't actually break when you do
damage<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.469> things<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.280> extra

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
damage on things so you can get extra

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.240

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
cast out and everything I'm not going to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.209 
cast out and everything I'm not going to
also<00:00:59.489> use<00:00:59.870> various<00:01:00.870> things<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.199> use<00:01:01.590> dag<00:01:01.890> use

generally all of this right here so
you're<00:01:08.280> looking<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.580> six<00:01:08.909> points<00:01:09.299> since<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you're looking at six points since a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.060 
you're looking at six points since a
song<00:01:09.840> craft<00:01:10.140> that's<00:01:10.409> about<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:10.979> probably

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
song craft that's about it I'm probably

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.039 
song craft that's about it I'm probably
just<00:01:11.250> gonna<00:01:11.430> use<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:11.970> also<00:01:12.240> mix<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
just gonna use that you can also mix and

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.810 
just gonna use that you can also mix and
match<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.439> change<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.580> good

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
match and change it which is good

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149 
match and change it which is good
because<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:15.720> less<00:01:15.900> no<00:01:16.409> less<00:01:16.650> gold<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
because there's less no less gold to

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.190 
because there's less no less gold to
spend<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.700> actually<00:01:18.030> switching<00:01:18.450> classes<00:01:18.689> back

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
spend on actually switching classes back

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
spend on actually switching classes back
in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> four<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.790> want

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
in the four if you can just if you want

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.550 
in the four if you can just if you want
to<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.810> something<00:01:21.990> different<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to go for something different if you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
to go for something different if you
want<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> go<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.220> maybe<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.330> bit<00:01:24.540> CC

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
want to go for maybe a little bit CC

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.420 
want to go for maybe a little bit CC
break<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> lot<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> type<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.009> stuff<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.310> can

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
break and a lot of type of stuff you can

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.499 
break and a lot of type of stuff you can
go<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.330> more

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
go out of that you want to go more

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.330 
go out of that you want to go more
support<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.320> go<00:01:28.500> out<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.189> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
support you can go out of that just you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
support you can go out of that just you
just<00:01:29.880> basically<00:01:30.119> don't<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> change<00:01:31.439> out

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
just basically don't have to change out

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
just basically don't have to change out
have<00:01:31.799> anything<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.549> good<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.030> just

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
have anything really good which just

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.730 
have anything really good which just
saves<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.689> gold<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.140> long<00:01:34.290> run<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
saves your gold in the long run if you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.130 
saves your gold in the long run if you
care<00:01:34.950> about<00:01:35.070> those<00:01:35.369> sort<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> things<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.210> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
care about those sort of things and I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140 
care about those sort of things and I
went<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> actually<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.939> this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
went in and I want to actually have this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.640 
went in and I want to actually have this
decrease<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.720> cast<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.500> together

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
decrease of cast time to go together

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.140 
decrease of cast time to go together
with<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> decrease<00:01:41.369> over<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> have

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
with the decrease over here so you have

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
like they made it so that going deep

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.020 
like they made it so that going deep
into<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.439> damage<00:01:58.860> tree<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.369> actually<00:01:59.820> better

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
into a damage tree is actually better

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.940 
into a damage tree is actually better
compared<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> way<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.079> used<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.409> before<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
compared the way it used to before it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.590 
compared the way it used to before it
was<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.610> go<00:02:02.790> out<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:03.119> other<00:02:03.270> trees

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
was like you can go out with other trees

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.179 
was like you can go out with other trees
and<00:02:03.899> then<00:02:04.020> mitchum<00:02:04.469> match<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.829> put<00:02:05.009> things

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
and then mitchum match to put things

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.760 
and then mitchum match to put things
together<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.719> more<00:02:07.049> it's<00:02:07.500> better

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
together but now it's more it's better

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.809 
together but now it's more it's better
actually

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
