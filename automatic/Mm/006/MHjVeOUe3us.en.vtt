00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720 

I

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.409 

when<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.910> want<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.540> add<00:00:07.280> decimals<00:00:08.280> what<00:00:09.210> you

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:09.419 
when you want to add decimals what you

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.039 
when you want to add decimals what you
have<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.690> do<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.410> first<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.549> all<00:00:11.900> locate<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
have to do is first of all locate the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.000 
have to do is first of all locate the
decimal<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.769> both<00:00:14.129> of<00:00:14.400> your<00:00:15.030> numbers<00:00:15.980> line<00:00:16.980> up

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
decimal in both of your numbers line up

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.450 
decimal in both of your numbers line up
the<00:00:17.310> decimals<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.060> then<00:00:18.990> we'll<00:00:19.230> app<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.160> in

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the decimals and then we'll app so in

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.109 
the decimals and then we'll app so in
the<00:00:20.820> problem<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.420> five<00:00:21.689> tenths<00:00:22.109> plus<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the problem of five tenths plus one and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.470 
the problem of five tenths plus one and
thirty<00:00:24.839> six<00:00:25.170> hundredths<00:00:25.859> I've<00:00:26.009> got<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
thirty six hundredths I've got the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.950 
thirty six hundredths I've got the
decimal<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.560> five<00:00:29.119> goes<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.630> front

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
decimal on the five goes right in front

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.310 
decimal on the five goes right in front
and<00:00:31.550> that<00:00:32.550> means<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.120> decimal<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.079> one

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and that means the decimal on the one

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.790 
and that means the decimal on the one
and<00:00:34.670> 3601<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:36.800> then<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.120> 3600<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:40.020> noticing

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and 3601 and then the 3600 now noticing

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.549 
and 3601 and then the 3600 now noticing
that<00:00:41.100> i<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.730> two<00:00:42.239> places<00:00:42.539> on<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> bottom<00:00:43.410> and

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that i have two places on the bottom and

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.139 
that i have two places on the bottom and
only<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.610> place<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.449> top<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:46.399> always<00:00:47.399> put

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
only one place on the top I always put

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.049 
only one place on the top I always put
in<00:00:48.420> my<00:00:48.629> zero<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> make<00:00:50.160> sure<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> have

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
in my zero just to make sure that I have

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720 
in my zero just to make sure that I have
everything<00:00:51.090> lined<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.960> properly<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.859> then<00:00:52.949> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
everything lined up properly and then I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.389 
everything lined up properly and then I
just<00:00:54.030> add<00:00:54.210> 0<00:00:54.600> plus<00:00:54.930> 6<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.410> 0<00:00:55.789> 5<00:00:56.789> plus<00:00:57.210> 3<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.780> 8<00:00:58.399> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
just add 0 plus 6 is 0 5 plus 3 is 8 the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.580 
just add 0 plus 6 is 0 5 plus 3 is 8 the
decimal<00:00:59.940> drops<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:01.199> you're<00:01:01.350> doing

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
decimal drops down when you're doing

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.009 
decimal drops down when you're doing
your<00:01:01.620> addition<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.340> subtraction<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.750> have

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
your addition and subtraction and I have

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.090 
your addition and subtraction and I have
the<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.590> so<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.460> answer<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.850> 1<00:01:06.240> +<00:01:06.860> 86<00:01:07.860> hundreds

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
the one so my answer is 1 + 86 hundreds

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.830 
the one so my answer is 1 + 86 hundreds
if<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:12.020> more<00:01:13.020> than<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.500> or<00:01:13.830> two<00:01:14.840> decimals

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
if I have more than one or two decimals

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.560 
if I have more than one or two decimals
that<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.140> adding<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.549> rule<00:01:17.790> stays<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.329> same

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that I'm adding the rule stays the same

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.830 
that I'm adding the rule stays the same
I'm<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.890> locate<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> decimal<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.420> each

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I'm going to locate the decimal on each

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.289 
I'm going to locate the decimal on each
number<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.920> notice<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> five<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.180> two

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
number now notice on the five and two

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.960 
number now notice on the five and two
counts<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> decimals<00:01:25.259> visible<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
counts the decimals visible on the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
counts the decimals visible on the
seventy<00:01:27.540> four<00:01:27.810> hundredths<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> decimals

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
seventy four hundredths the decimals

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.030 
seventy four hundredths the decimals
visible<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.079> three<00:01:31.079> there's<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
visible on the three there's not a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
visible on the three there's not a
visible<00:01:32.640> decimal<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> locate

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
visible decimal so I have to locate

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.219 
visible decimal so I have to locate
where<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.310> decimals<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.149> I<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:37.020> two

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
where the decimals that I have two

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.350 
where the decimals that I have two
choices<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.220> put<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.549> at<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> beginning<00:01:39.240> or

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
choices I can put it at the beginning or

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.590 
choices I can put it at the beginning or
I<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:40.229> put<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.710> end<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
I can put it at the end now think of a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.679 
I can put it at the end now think of a
sentence<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> period<00:01:44.280> where<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.450> put

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
sentence with a period where do you put

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.310 
sentence with a period where do you put
the<00:01:45.840> period<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.469> the<00:01:46.500> sentence<00:01:47.119> at<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.390> end<00:01:48.570> so

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the period on the sentence at the end so

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.280 
the period on the sentence at the end so
where<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> put<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.939> decimal

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
where are you going to put the decimal

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.399 
where are you going to put the decimal
at<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.619> end<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.520> when<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.820> line<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:54.630> it's

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
at the end so when I line this up it's

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.980 
at the end so when I line this up it's
going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.890> three<00:01:56.159> with<00:01:57.000> my<00:01:57.240> decimal<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
going to be three with my decimal at the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.990 
going to be three with my decimal at the
end<00:01:58.399> the<00:02:00.140> 7400<00:02:01.140> again<00:02:01.829> lining<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:02.969> your

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
end the 7400 again lining up your

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.500 
end the 7400 again lining up your
decimals<00:02:04.070> gives<00:02:05.070> me<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.350> 5m

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
decimals gives me that and then the 5m

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.140 
decimals gives me that and then the 5m
two<00:02:09.510> tenths<00:02:09.890> okay<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.070> here<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> when<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:11.970> can

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
two tenths okay now here is when you can

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.600 
two tenths okay now here is when you can
really<00:02:12.540> see

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
really see

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.700 
really see
that<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.940> definitely<00:02:14.390> want<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.050> add<00:02:15.320> some

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
that you definitely want to add some

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.560 
that you definitely want to add some
zeros<00:02:16.070> in<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.550> have<00:02:17.270> two<00:02:17.570> places<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.700> 7400

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
zeros in I have two places on the 7400

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.820 
zeros in I have two places on the 7400
so<00:02:21.170> I'm<00:02:21.260> going<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.440> add<00:02:21.620> 10<00:02:22.310> on<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.630> two<00:02:24.170> to

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
so I'm going to add 10 on to the two to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.220 
so I'm going to add 10 on to the two to
make<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.220> 20<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.790> I'm<00:02:26.390> going<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.840> add<00:02:26.990> two

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
make it a 20 and I'm going to add two

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.330 
make it a 20 and I'm going to add two
zeros<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:29.510> which<00:02:30.050> then<00:02:30.380> gives<00:02:30.650> me<00:02:30.920> two

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
zeros here which then gives me two

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.540 
zeros here which then gives me two
places<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:32.090> places<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.780> places<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.470> lot<00:02:34.130> of

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
places to places to places a lot of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.120 
places to places to places a lot of
people<00:02:34.880> don't<00:02:35.150> like<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:36.830> it's

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
people don't like to see that so it's

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.030 
people don't like to see that so it's
okay<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.760> put<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.970> zero<00:02:38.300> in<00:02:38.540> there<00:02:38.780> also<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.500> now

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
okay to put a zero in there also and now

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.310 
okay to put a zero in there also and now
you<00:02:40.100> can<00:02:40.459> see<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:40.910> got<00:02:41.120> three<00:02:41.570> numbers<00:02:41.720> three

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
you can see I got three numbers three

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.970 
you can see I got three numbers three
numbers<00:02:42.650> three<00:02:43.340> numbers<00:02:43.959> one<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:44.990> when<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.590> start

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
numbers three numbers one I when I start

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.340 
numbers three numbers one I when I start
adding<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.670> just<00:02:47.300> get<00:02:47.510> 0<00:02:48.050> plus<00:02:48.350> 4<00:02:48.650> plus<00:02:48.860> 0<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.940> 4<00:02:50.350> 7

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
adding I just get 0 plus 4 plus 0 is 4 7

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.430 
adding I just get 0 plus 4 plus 0 is 4 7
plus<00:02:51.590> 2<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.220> nine<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.570> decimal<00:02:54.140> drops

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
plus 2 is nine the decimal drops

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.190 
plus 2 is nine the decimal drops
straight<00:02:54.830> down<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.760> then<00:02:56.420> three<00:02:56.690> plus<00:02:56.959> five

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
straight down and then three plus five

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.670 
straight down and then three plus five
is<00:02:57.530> eight<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.760> my<00:02:58.910> answer<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.360> eight<00:02:59.750> in<00:03:00.050> ninety

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
is eight so my answer is eight in ninety

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.790 
is eight so my answer is eight in ninety
four<00:03:00.950> hundredths<00:03:02.110> now<00:03:03.110> let's<00:03:03.320> think<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.709> a

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
four hundredths now let's think of a

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.990 
four hundredths now let's think of a
story<00:03:04.040> problem<00:03:05.080> Jack<00:03:06.080> had<00:03:06.470> seven<00:03:07.370> dollars<00:03:07.760> and

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
story problem Jack had seven dollars and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.090 
story problem Jack had seven dollars and
43<00:03:08.840> cents<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.440> his<00:03:09.770> pocket<00:03:10.250> money<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.900> what<00:03:12.890> we

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
43 cents in his pocket money is what we

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.060 
43 cents in his pocket money is what we
like<00:03:13.340> about<00:03:13.370> decimals<00:03:13.970> is<00:03:14.720> because<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.500> feel

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
like about decimals is because we feel

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.340 
like about decimals is because we feel
very<00:03:16.100> comfortable<00:03:16.580> with<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.270> so<00:03:17.810> I'm<00:03:18.080> going<00:03:18.110> to

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
very comfortable with it so I'm going to

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.050 
very comfortable with it so I'm going to
put<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:19.160> seven<00:03:19.970> dollars<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.980> 43<00:03:21.980> cents<00:03:22.310> in

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
put the seven dollars and 43 cents in

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.210 
put the seven dollars and 43 cents in
the<00:03:24.250> pocket<00:03:25.250> his<00:03:26.120> sister<00:03:26.840> gave<00:03:27.140> him<00:03:27.470> four

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
the pocket his sister gave him four

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.270 
the pocket his sister gave him four
dollars<00:03:28.820> more<00:03:29.200> can't<00:03:30.200> remember<00:03:30.380> on<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:30.950> four

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
dollars more can't remember on the four

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.050 
dollars more can't remember on the four
it<00:03:31.820> doesn't<00:03:32.780> have<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:32.989> decimal<00:03:33.459> visible<00:03:34.459> so

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
it doesn't have a decimal visible so

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.300 
it doesn't have a decimal visible so
you're<00:03:35.540> going<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.810> put<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.110> at<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.290> end<00:03:36.440> so

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
you're going to put it at the end so

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.280 
you're going to put it at the end so
it's<00:03:37.489> four<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:39.190> I've<00:03:40.190> got<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.430> decimal<00:03:40.880> point

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
it's four and I've got a decimal point

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.979 
it's four and I've got a decimal point
then<00:03:42.290> he<00:03:42.920> found<00:03:43.750> 55<00:03:44.750> cents<00:03:45.709> in<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:46.130> phone<00:03:46.430> booth

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
then he found 55 cents in a phone booth

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.460 
then he found 55 cents in a phone booth
55<00:03:47.989> cents<00:03:48.590> means<00:03:48.950> I'm<00:03:49.250> no<00:03:49.730> dollars<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.600> I<00:03:51.230> have

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
everything lined up and this is again a

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.819 
everything lined up and this is again a
nice<00:04:11.269> problem<00:04:11.630> I<00:04:11.930> don't<00:04:11.989> have<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.470> do<00:04:12.620> any

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
nice problem I don't have to do any

and four plus five is your nine the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.310 
and four plus five is your nine the
death<00:04:21.739> will<00:04:22.010> drop<00:04:22.220> straight<00:04:22.580> down<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.479> then<00:04:24.289> I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
death will drop straight down and then I

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.670 
death will drop straight down and then I
add<00:04:24.710> my

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
add my

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.909

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
seven and it's dollars so it's eleven
