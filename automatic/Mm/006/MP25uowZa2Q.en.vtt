00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.190
 I welcome comrades gamers who do not like 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.350
 turtles turtles love everything well here 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.070
 only games on them somehow still not 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.290
 succeeded 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.510
 but there was one successful under the heading 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.180
 video game but all the rest 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.080
 or rollers sending shading there battle nexus 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.540
 and so on 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.520
 In short, nothing steep here and this time 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.800
 miracle did not happen and so wanted at all 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.410
 turtles themselves have so many different 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.140
 versions of cartoons comic that I have long 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.420
 I do not understand them anymore but I think everything 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.820
 we love exactly those turtles with 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.820
 cartoon exactly with the intro 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.410
 but the game out of shadows is done by 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.930
 tv series from nickelodeon where turtles 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.560
 look not quite like me 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.659
 wanted to 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.960
 Well, who knows how many people like it ? 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.509
 We begin to learn the plot playing for April 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.600
 which is more like any 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.729
 sorry lara croft but we will consider 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.159
 I have not seen this further in our 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.290
 favorite sewage turtles notice 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.720
 suspicious bank activity around 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.350
 new york and we go to first 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.929
 the task 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.570
 and the game is literally a little bit 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:34.360
 cut-scenes on the engine that smoothly 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.729
 go to the drawn static comics 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.190
 the developers apparently correctly decided that 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.920
 facial expressions will look disgusting on 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.679
 local engine which is probably older 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.490
 than the turtles themselves okay agro background 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.420
 later who will be the main villain 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.909
 shredder kuk ёpta 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.190
 yes this is a spoiler though unless someone 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.800
 doubted this tin can again 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.270
 by the way famous 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.219
 biting robe dog, too, will 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.570
 combat system is the only bright 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.880
 the spot of the game is here with weapons kicked 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.280
 counterattack and jump to the figs of different 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.709
 combo receptions as well as acquaintances 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.900
 batman counterattacks who are here 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.269
 really looks nice and even 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.549
 spectacular turtles know how to throw 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.579
 shuriken and even use the environment 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.470
 in battle with enemies 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.720
 especially nice looking super blows 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.660
 there are three stripes that are filled 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.209
 as successful combo and still typing 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.609
 clamp a specific number 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.400
 the button and the bug holds especially 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:42.459
 cool alternative hit by rafael me 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.470
 I didn’t like it so much that I fight 1 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.290
 an hour and a half is really interesting and 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.380
 looks good even on this graphic 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.910
 The 80s, the more there is a split-screen and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.340
 cooperative for four 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.170
 you can play turtles just like in 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.940
 childhood only now without mom's 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.560
 scarf 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.450
 Well, turtle necessarily 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.000
 comment it all fun 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.330
 pizza jokes maybe they are not 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.060
 too bad 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.700
 here's a tablecloth for someone filmed stock 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.320
 if you play yourself at any time 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.020
 switch between turtles and sometimes 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.540
 even arrange stealth and choke 's 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.390
 on the sly back but despite all this 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.300
 by the middle of the game it becomes easy 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.220
 unbearably boring and monotonous can 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.220
 right during the fight drink some tea 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:51.890
 watch YouTube or even something 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.320
 more interesting especially depressing locations 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.590
 all industrial style new york 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.350
 street sewer metro factories and stuff 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.660
 other stuff just boxes of rooms and 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.760
 there were nowhere for designers 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.910
 roam though they are not very much and 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.940
 if they wanted for four chapters of the game and not 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.480
 bother to draw the whole 1 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.739
 imagine a normal boss and 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.030
 where the rest are not delivered 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.010
 strongly recommend to subscribe to

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.580
 the last thing else can somehow deliver 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.430
 pleasure is headquarter with 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.710
 turtles headquarters in the sewer here 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.760
 pump over the bug because they get 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.400
 battle experience 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.229
 look at donatell's workshop there he 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.990
 in any one makes some new 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.590
 lotion but the most interesting mode 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.350
 arcades 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.419
 it allows you to get rid of locations a bit 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.970
 changed in good old mode 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.610
 platformer you can remember let's say 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.440
 manhattan project on dendy me alone 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.290
 this mode seemed the most normal 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.350
 what is in this game but now it 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.419
 whose majesty grafon is not here if 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.700
 I said something about splinter graphics 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.979
 cell or lost planet 3 then take my 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.930
 words back compared to them 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.710
 turtles look like poor 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.050
 relatives 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.690
 it feels like the picture was done 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.090
 mentally retarded konsolschiki collecting 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.340
 their cubes and triangles because 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.130
 sometimes developers have enough conscience 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.620
 show characters in close up 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:39.380
 a particularly nervous heart attack can happen 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:43.760
 didn't like everything cool everyone killed their 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.890
 Ellada shame to bring all beloved
