00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.250 
myocardial infarction commonly referred
to<00:00:06.590> as<00:00:06.859> heart<00:00:07.340> attack<00:00:07.700> is<00:00:07.970> the<00:00:08.690> sudden<00:00:08.990> death

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
to as heart attack is the sudden death

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.560 
to as heart attack is the sudden death
of<00:00:09.470> part<00:00:09.860> of<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.099> heart<00:00:10.370> muscle<00:00:10.580> due<00:00:11.120> to<00:00:11.330> loss

of part of the heart muscle due to loss
of<00:00:11.600> blood<00:00:12.140> flow<00:00:12.820> this<00:00:13.820> occurs<00:00:14.390> when<00:00:14.780> one<00:00:14.960> of

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
of blood flow this occurs when one of

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.890 
of blood flow this occurs when one of
the<00:00:15.260> coronary<00:00:15.769> arteries<00:00:16.279> the<00:00:17.119> arteries<00:00:17.510> that

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
the coronary arteries the arteries that

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.460 
the coronary arteries the arteries that
supply<00:00:18.320> blood<00:00:18.349> to<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:18.980> heart<00:00:19.220> is<00:00:19.580> blocked<00:00:20.470> the

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
supply blood to the heart is blocked the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.170 
supply blood to the heart is blocked the
blockage<00:00:21.949> is<00:00:22.130> commonly<00:00:22.699> due<00:00:22.940> to

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
blockage is commonly due to

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.350 
blockage is commonly due to
atherosclerosis<00:00:24.699> cholesterol<00:00:25.699> plaques<00:00:26.029> or

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
atherosclerosis cholesterol plaques or

fat deposits on the wall of blood

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.319 
fat deposits on the wall of blood
vessels<00:00:28.970> as<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:30.619> plaque<00:00:30.890> builds<00:00:31.400> up<00:00:31.580> the

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
vessels as the plaque builds up the

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.869 
vessels as the plaque builds up the
vessel<00:00:32.780> becomes<00:00:33.170> narrow<00:00:33.699> restricting<00:00:34.699> blood

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879
