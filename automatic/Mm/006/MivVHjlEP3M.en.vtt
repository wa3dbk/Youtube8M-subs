00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.539 
so you can use soil based potting mixes
with<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.540> system<00:01:33.960> too<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
check the pH of your nutrient solution

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.380 
check the pH of your nutrient solution
5.5<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.750> 6.5<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.100> desired<00:01:44.430> range<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:45.270> I've

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
5.5 to 6.5 is the desired range now I've

5.5 to 6.5 is the desired range now I've
got<00:01:45.680> 6.2<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.340> we're<00:01:47.880> good<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.240> water<00:01:49.229> them

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
got 6.2 so we're good to go water them

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
got 6.2 so we're good to go water them
in<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> nutrient<00:01:50.280> solution<00:01:50.479> one<00:01:51.479> by<00:01:51.689> one

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
in with the nutrient solution one by one

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.130 
in with the nutrient solution one by one
and<00:01:52.520> hopefully<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:54.420> should<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.720> some<00:01:54.899> much

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and hopefully we should have some much

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.889 
and hopefully we should have some much
happier<00:01:55.500> plants<00:01:55.920> soon<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:57.390> really<00:01:57.719> clever

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
happier plants soon the really clever

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.600 
happier plants soon the really clever
part<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> auto<00:01:58.560> pod<00:01:58.770> system<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.310> called

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
part of the auto pod system is called

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.179 
part of the auto pod system is called
the<00:01:59.790> aquavalve<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.290> blue<00:02:01.649> float<00:02:01.950> valve

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the aquavalve it's that blue float valve

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.679 
the aquavalve it's that blue float valve
that<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.090> controls<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
that you can see that controls the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.389 
that you can see that controls the
amount<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> water<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.439> each<00:02:04.770> plant<00:02:05.100> receives

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
amount of water that each plant receives

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.910 
amount of water that each plant receives
allowing<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.479> dry<00:02:06.630> periods<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.409> well<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.770> wet

allowing for dry periods as well as wet

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.960 
allowing for dry periods as well as wet
so<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.759> plants<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.539> thrive<00:02:10.730> obviously<00:02:11.730> we

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
so the plants really thrive obviously we

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.220 
so the plants really thrive obviously we
need<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.239> connect<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.660> twelve<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> half

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
first few weeks while the plants get

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.199 
first few weeks while the plants get
established<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.889> then<00:02:53.069> after<00:02:53.549> that<00:02:53.670> all<00:02:54.180> I

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
have to do is keep the reservoir topped

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.500 
have to do is keep the reservoir topped
up<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.519> plants<00:02:56.790> will<00:02:56.819> be<00:02:56.909> fed<00:02:57.180> via<00:02:57.329> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
up and the plants will be fed via the
