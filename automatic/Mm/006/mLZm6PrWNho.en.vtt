00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.749 
top of the foil and you're on bring the
hair<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.860> obviously<00:01:41.280> you're<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
hair so obviously you're not going to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
hair so obviously you're not going to
take<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> root<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.560> going

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
take it to the root so you're just going

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.670 
take it to the root so you're just going
to<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.310> halfway<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.360> lay<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> foil

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
to do it halfway so I lay it on the foil

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.190

and<00:01:47.009> do<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.430> halfway<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.000> then<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.540> start

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and do it halfway and then I just start

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.889 
and do it halfway and then I just start
just<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.729> know<00:01:50.850> painting<00:01:51.420> my<00:01:51.450> color

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
closure so we're going to repeat the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.930 
closure so we're going to repeat the
same<00:02:38.380> process<00:02:38.950> you're<00:02:39.160> just<00:02:39.340> gonna<00:02:39.519> flip<00:02:39.790> it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.479 
same process you're just gonna flip it
over<00:02:40.200> do<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.470> side<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.190> then<00:02:42.280> you're<00:02:42.459> just

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
over do one side and then you're just

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.759 
over do one side and then you're just
going<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.090> do<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.570> other<00:02:43.780> side<00:02:44.080> it's<00:02:44.320> really

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
going to do the other side it's really

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.949 
going to do the other side it's really
not<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:44.980> hard<00:02:45.430> guys<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:46.030> very<00:02:46.450> very<00:02:46.870> simple

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
not that hard guys it's very very simple

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.060 
not that hard guys it's very very simple
I<00:02:47.560> would<00:02:48.040> leave<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.400> in<00:02:48.670> for<00:02:48.850> about<00:02:49.530> 25<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.830> 30

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
I would leave it in for about 25 to 30

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.490 
I would leave it in for about 25 to 30
minutes<00:02:51.310> or<00:02:51.910> basically<00:02:52.660> until<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.290> color

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
minutes or basically until the color

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.620

shortest bundle I'm gonna do all three

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.940 
shortest bundle I'm gonna do all three
bundles<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.420> for<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.140> shortest<00:03:47.440> bundle<00:03:47.799> I'm

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
bundles and for the shortest bundle I'm

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.870

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
apart and then I just do each side this

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.060 
apart and then I just do each side this
way<00:04:30.870> you're<00:04:31.200> getting<00:04:31.350> through<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.919> whole

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
way you're getting through the whole

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.950 
way you're getting through the whole
bundle<00:04:32.310> these<00:04:32.580> bundles<00:04:32.820> are<00:04:33.120> very<00:04:33.300> thick<00:04:33.660> so

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
bundle these bundles are very thick so

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960 
bundle these bundles are very thick so
you<00:04:34.380> want<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.710> make<00:04:34.740> sure<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.070> cover<00:04:35.340> all<00:04:35.490> the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
you want to make sure you cover all the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.850 
you want to make sure you cover all the
hair<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.390> you<00:04:36.690> want<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.960> try<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.350> match<00:04:37.590> each

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
hair and you want to try and match each

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.920 
hair and you want to try and match each
side<00:04:38.160> its<00:04:38.400> best<00:04:38.700> possible<00:04:39.030> as<00:04:39.419> you<00:04:39.600> did<00:04:39.780> the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
side its best possible as you did the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.320 
side its best possible as you did the
other<00:04:39.960> side<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.700> make<00:04:41.910> sure<00:04:41.940> you're

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
other side so just make sure you're

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.090 
other side so just make sure you're
paying<00:04:42.750> attention<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.500> where<00:04:43.650> you're<00:04:43.710> putting

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
paying attention to where you're putting

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.730 
paying attention to where you're putting
your<00:04:44.310> color<00:04:44.970> because<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.480> don't<00:04:45.750> want<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:46.440> to

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
your color because you don't want it to

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.110 
your color because you don't want it to
be<00:04:46.919> like<00:04:47.280> lopsided<00:04:47.940> color<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:49.200> makes<00:04:49.410> sense

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
be like lopsided color that makes sense

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.090 
be like lopsided color that makes sense
so<00:04:51.120> yeah<00:04:51.300> I'm<00:04:51.510> doing<00:04:51.690> this<00:04:52.020> basically<00:04:52.950> with<00:04:53.070> a

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
so yeah I'm doing this basically with a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.740 
so yeah I'm doing this basically with a
third<00:04:53.370> but<00:04:53.669> well<00:04:53.820> this<00:04:53.940> is<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.150> second<00:04:54.540> bundle

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
third but well this is a second bundle

bundle<00:05:03.090> up<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.530> rubber<00:05:04.830> band<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.400> I'm

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
bundle up to the rubber band and I'm

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.159 
bundle up to the rubber band and I'm
doing<00:05:05.669> this<00:05:05.880> because<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.419> hair<00:05:06.600> starting<00:05:07.050> to

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
doing this because the hair starting to

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.340 
doing this because the hair starting to
get<00:05:07.320> longer<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:09.000> want<00:05:09.479> my<00:05:09.600> color<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.080> almost

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
be at the root of the bundle because the

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.200 
be at the root of the bundle because the
hair<00:05:12.690> is<00:05:12.870> so<00:05:13.290> long<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:14.340> don't<00:05:14.520> want<00:05:14.700> any<00:05:14.850> gaps

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.190 
this is just going to bring out a
reddish<00:05:38.190> brown<00:05:38.430> tone<00:05:38.790> to<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.120> hair<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.540> then
