00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello here is the occasion and I do 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.820
 my first video and show you 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:18.589
 Assassin's creed 3 all montages or 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.839
 stop and here he is already the first one 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:24.319
 the chemical everyone but the assassin's 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:31.460
 creed 3 has played the alternative 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:33.950
 casinos donald of course the next in 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.990
 the order is the achilles 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.820
 original montur who is this with three 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.190
 must have played who knows eight left 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:50.660
 is 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:59.140
 and she looks and looks pretty 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:05.269
 the bombs out here and the next one 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:07.640
 is the captains and the form of the stock 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.329
 so from here must also have a list 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.289
 with mock which is a ship, and 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:17.179
 this montur looks like you 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.100
 maybe already recognized so stop 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.069
 one has captains uniform already 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.350
 seen the water stands and the find 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:29.350
 I also really cool 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.350
 Yes 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.499
 oh yes and also tell me where I am from 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:42.789
 So I think that gets you off 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:47.890
 sequence six i do not think 5 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.890
 You get this montur if you all 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:02:01.009
 challenges in this task 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:06.530
 it made here from the home it 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:09.649
 So there are in short on the map 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.660
 you see a task there is a little 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.720
 then house violently on the map 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.739
 Look at a house and that 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:25.160
 tasks have to do all then stop 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:32.690
 comes the end of the next montur is 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:39.700
 the captain kit and do this montur 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.700
 you get when you all limp 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.730
 these goblets get you just have to 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.709
 talk to each other and then she sees 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.919
 serves on the karl this chalice 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.590
 he is just collecting and if you all 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:03:00.470
 then you have a special one 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.489
 mission and that would have to do 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.849
 he has a total of three missions and if 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.590
 you 've made the three then come 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.230
 a fourth I believe 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.510
 At the end we get this wall 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:21.019
 the next one is the et on tour of 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.010
 Assassin's creed you can 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.690
 actually at 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:31.050
 Pulling it for free is actually 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.910
 very simple and already quite funny 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:41.920
 that you walk around here with the motto 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:42.910
 so the next one is the galleon gak 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.270
 gear 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.870
 You get that when you feather all 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:04:04.480
 I did not find it now 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:06.640
 so nice not so special 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.020
 this motto is the captive motto 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.760
 you get that when you leave the 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.550
 come out of prison you are 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.890
 any sequence since the prison 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.250
 and if you came out then 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:23.140
 Of course you get this montur times 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:28.710
 again so uninteresting so and the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:34.330
 Next one is like the next one 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:36.220
 the nature of the colonial assassin 's 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.990
 maybe really cool too 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.820
 is really cool and up there at the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.400
 cap is a sign of it as you 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.900
 maybe you see and yes they were 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.010
 actually already all the montages and 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.510
 maybe now has it yourself 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.820
 noticed here is a montage I left 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.690
 but do not know how to get this 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.550
 So I do not even know if there 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:08.050
 If you can, you can get one 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:11.190
 wisst writes my comments and that 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:16.470
