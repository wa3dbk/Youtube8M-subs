00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.590
 The hole seems to me a new camera 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.590
 grinst of pandora arrived 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.689
 at zeus it is gate of the macro menzer 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.919
 do not be tempted by your very own 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.919
 the outside deceived friends 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.700
 it goes with the deadliest of the 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.620
 daily on 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.390
 a bit much worse skill about 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.930
 gives gates electric attacks 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930
 considerably more 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.300
 even maybe something is yours 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.890
 firstly noticed if kate an opponent 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.960
 kills arises through his death 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.960
 massive electric current around it 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.910
 second , gates opponents want a shock 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.519
 he suffers damage, he burns 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.199
 be plugged and third, the two 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.020
 The above properties are pretty 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.120
 cool 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.760
 but one of gates has great weapons 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.760
 I'm not even worth the tramp 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.580
 this hovering fighter can be his 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.940
 opponents with all kinds of deadly ones 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.830
 techniques are trafficking his explosives 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.910
 corratec, for example, can be anyone 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.200
 unhappy ones near 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.180
 liquefy 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.410
 The meeting can also be the shields of his 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.030
 repair Allied 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.130
 and honestly what would be one 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.330
 fighting robot without a rich laser 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.330
 sets his victims on fire 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.920
 magical but also without poison trap 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.700
 Cage a real challenge for 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.820
 every opponent 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.740
 see clearly enough skill in a dream 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.520
 for those of us who are not so 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.140
 with the aim of having enough 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.540
 next to it a ball has gone nowhere 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.030
 bounce off their goal yet meet and 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.970
 such a cozy home experience one 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.010
 find opponents 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.570
 is not that wonderful if we are 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.280
 Now you are worried that such a 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.479
 makes skill games too easy 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.619
 the most difficult ones though 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:12.810
 most attentive skill not yet anarchy 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.760
 I'll explain it once he has an opponent 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.940
 Kill or fight or magazine now 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.440
 he gets a pack archive 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.880
 each of these pack expensive 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.930
 but harm reduces yours 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.520
 accuracy 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.680
 That does not sound dramatic at first 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.500
 but you can fight hundreds in one 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.150
 to pack such a home 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.270
 after a while you share monstrous 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.280
 extra damage 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.140
 Of course, expensive precision suffers very much 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:43.010
 strong but if you hit an opponent 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.220
 then he realizes that and how he realizes it 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.440
 yes, that's not nearly all 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.540
 skills of money whether you are your opponents 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.460
 destroying shock with anarchy or 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.420
 with a giant robot to one not 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:03:01.630
 Melting Cage is a fighter 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.630
 and now liquefies some faces
