00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.980
 the spider comic 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.280
 it's disgusting but if the monster of 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.860
 that you will love is my favorite that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.650
 I was having a great time watching 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.340
 Daniel's comic collection up 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.309

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.080
 Sidereal space is about a spider 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.300
 normal that becomes a spider 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.780
 mutant of sidereal space after 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.059
 to be reached by a cosmic ray that I 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 I was not sure I hear a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.050
 story about a mutant spider of 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.000
 outer space 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.840

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.720
 a meteor fell on top 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.090
 but I think that something else fell 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.110
 cosmic ray 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.770

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.060
 I'm already home, my colleague, I have to 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.060

 and you have had a good time 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.740
 fell tried to convince himself that it was only 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.120
 a little spider but he could not forget the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.120
 comic by daniele 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.159

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.569

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.800

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.800
 spider hanging around the sofa 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.340

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.709
 I wanted to play but I was scared 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.470
 find a spider in the boots or even 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.709
 worse a mutant spider of space 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.709
 sidereal 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.590
 I'm sorry mom I have to go to 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.590
 pains 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.200
 I have my hands stained with a marker 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.100
 thank goodness the marker goes with 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.389
 water go wash them well with soap 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.389
 I see you when I come back from running 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.310
 What's wrong with you, I'm not going to wash your 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:49.200
 hands fired because because there are 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.480
 a spider 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.150
 but it is a very tiny spider and 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.060
 harmless you do not have to have him 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.330
 fear you do not know that it is not a spider 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.440
 sidereal space mutant a spider 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.969
 mutant of outer space as well as the 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.099
 of the convict Daniel 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:10.949
 you know that comics count 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.369
 invented stories truthfully they are not 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.369
 real 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.500
 let's go spider I'll take you out and 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.689
 then event also after washing 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.219
 there's something I want to show you 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.229
 It is very normal that there are spiders in 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:34.280
 breast plants but they are totally 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:38.400
 Harmless besides interesting looks 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:43.520
 that's how garden spiders are going to see 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.520
 if we find a sheet here there is a 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.310
 today look is a daddy long legs and 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.940
 long legs 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.100
 right here he does not have legs so 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.890
 long not as long as those of the spider in 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.810
 the clear comic that no spiders of 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.330
 they are usually tiny, you are 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.629
 much bigger than them 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.120
 you do not know about spiders good help 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:13.310
 Protect the plants have eight legs and 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.310
 they make fantastic cobwebs 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:20.349
 I've only made a spider and although to me 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.560
 it gives a little bit of disgust what do you say no 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:26.050
 they are so afraid that I do not suppose 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.180
 they do not look at all like the spider of 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.759
 committee daniel you mean the spider 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.699
 mutant of sidereal space 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:36.879
 you must not believe that everything you read or 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:38.889
 not everything you see but still 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:42.460
 you have the comic I would love to throw a 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:44.020
 clear look I love comics 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.599
 as long as you remember that the stories 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:50.400
 they are not true they are very funny 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:52.889
 then the eight legs of our spider 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.300
 mutant got trapped in a mucus 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.300
 giant in space 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.810
 here and I no longer scared the 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.020
 spiders not even to space 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.020
 sidereal
