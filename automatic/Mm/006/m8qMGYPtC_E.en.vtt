00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:09.530
 I have the hairs and a lot of those things 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.220
 Yes, many of my colleagues are right 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.560
 of parana have abandoned if as well as 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.340
 they listened to them I tell them of series left the 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.420
 weekend and can not tell them to get together 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.190
 today to the park and can not tell them of 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.930
 dig up corpses to fill them with 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.070
 drugs and send them in a submarine to 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.070
 Kenya and they can not 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.670
 When I have holidays, you give 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.980
 end when they have a vacation 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.600
 playing blue I remember as if I had 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.570
 been yesterday when we were all one 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.760
 secondary school taking 8 subjects each 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.550
 one and wondering who was going to 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 finish down a bridge first that 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.940
 time 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.510
 and I do not have a choice 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.270
 I can only laugh at them because 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.890
 nothing to study six hours per day 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.900
 I have colleagues who are called 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.240
 engineering and as a partner where mind and 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.400
 a rebellious born I escape to my faculty 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.930
 take theirs that already live the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.970
 limit was once I went to the faculty 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.790
 of the engineering video the case is that the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.890
 guys had four hours of calculations if 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.660
 then they had three more hours of physics 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.090
 so if you feel that you have a 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.920
 shit reframes you most seriously in 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.810
 reality and they were always means are worth 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.520
 the numbers I'm very distracted in 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.140
 Literature always from him was wind is 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.140
 further back write my name and everything 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.259
 well let's see the pros of high school 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.570
 good in the secondary ones you have your 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.970
 mates who is the girl or the boy 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.619
 that you like that goes to your class and you 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.210
 love to see them in class for more than 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.250
 do not despair good teachers 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.740
 you like them and teachers Koreas 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.869
 the trip of graduates is something sacred l 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.759
 in the round of your recess friends or 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.670
 be that time to eat bills with 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.079
 a soda and you drop the student the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.579
 true that that's the round is the 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.560
 Required levels of the best things 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.270
 that has life so this one for 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.130
 can talks good three anecdotes from 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.539
 every day and crying with laughter I maybe 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.600
 I'm going to also but the truth every time 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.630
 I went like I was not doing anything and ate a biopsy 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.370
 now I do not assure you to fall 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.380

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.630
 will start to follow with your friends the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.370
 school you do the sport that you like and 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.810
 you love him with all your soul and the day of 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.030
 tomorrow thank you you're going to be a tennis player 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.420
 professional and you end up making videos 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.420
 in Youtube 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.090
 and the festivities of 15 their 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.070
 compañeritas stop being compañeras 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.590
 to become partners that are 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.840
 recontra good and do not give you ball because 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.850
 she is 15 years old and not the girls of 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.850
 15 years like the biggest guys 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.900
 with back of high school has 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.430
 matters that you say are put to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.989
 teach this power directly and 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.400
 it really is a brainshot if I 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.900
 do you want to complicate reality for me 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.540
 teaches sectors that moment that no longer 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.760
 use excuse me sir deny what happens if 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.319
 as a young fachero but before in 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.590
 house had to solve an equation that 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.790
 Yes, the new law of Julian was approved 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.680
 he eats it so he writes down if he 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.970
 speed of 90 kilometers per hour or 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.950
 either hate or 0 or not really we're going 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.709
 to use in our ranks or not 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.109
 I do not know that teacher module 11 that does not 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.939
 what they teach is studying for example and 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.459
 realize that it would not be so bad to be a 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.930
 kitchen or a piano imagine for a 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.209
 second that I have to translate that 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.900
 this book that is in English at 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.870
 Castilian not and there is not the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.389
 piano and I say look what 's there so 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.760
 quiet everything sucked egg did not 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.090
 moves does not heat anything of looks 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.830
 curtain exactly the same and I say 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.970
 why god because it's not like that 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.520
 curtain why 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.770
 executive by parents will not be a task that 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.630
 challenges in winter that it is summer and 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.850
 in summer you want that winter sum 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.070
 more hours because you do not do well in school 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.380
 It takes more hours because you can get 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.510
 like more hours because clothes are better 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.060
 it takes more hours for rain because it 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.790
 they burned the milanesas in the faculty 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.530
 well let's talk about the cons of 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.500
 the faculty will you tell me that a 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.960
 you come to speak you thief to go to the 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.850
 faculty sofía faculty grafía 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.380
 psychology of social communication and 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.410
 is going on time cases that when 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.970
 cool you always see and did not know the 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.920
 teachers did not even know your name 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.300
 it is attention and study 150 people 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.950
 You also have to take out three 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.080
 tons of photocopies 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.080
 these are photocopies that they never read 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.260
 It is typical of the hoods that you 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.540
 together with your friends towards jobs 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.400
 practical and you did not have at work but 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.930
 they had talking about life and trying 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.370
 there was not a tourism company to 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.200
 become millionaires and not have to touch 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.780
 a funky book I never careless and another 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.690
 good thing in high school all the 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.210
 all fallers all all to 18 are 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.010
 macheros later with the faculty 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.410
 they begin to spend the hours of bad sleep 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.120
 they begin to charge many bills to 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.770
 take a lot more than some you earn 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.820
 much and that is good and pro 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.820
 the faculty are 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.599
 production the other of the faculty as 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.970
 first pause 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.590
 the people to the common one is very good 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.419
 relationship there is very good and because 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.379
 it's both time with people and the truth 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.379
 it is expensive to learn 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.190
 it does not matter that I always have to 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.260
 lose I know maybe I do a 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.729
 dismissal but it would be more disappointing 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.169
 do not do anything at least you have to be 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.940
 sacrificing in something and for more than you 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.590
 carry seven commodities keep selling 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.240
 that's a clear example that 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.919
 persevere and you will triumph the question is a 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.650
 clear example of the third liter phrase no 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.470
 it does not always come first that it runs more 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.139
 fast if you do not keep running them so 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.030
 less in a faculty still questions the 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.070
 school and keep reading a lot because the 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.050
 only way that the government or the 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.720
 people from above do not dominate us so 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.039
 easily reading by reading books and that 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.470
 nothing are safe now I do not think that 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.150
 have liked it so you already know back 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.100
 for those who need me to stay 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.470
 many thanks 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:31.900
 rest these tools and 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:35.970
 if before to question what I have here 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.970
 is that I fell without end
