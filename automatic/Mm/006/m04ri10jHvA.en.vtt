make a real simple shape using some of
the<00:00:08.700> tools<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.269> engrave<00:00:09.540> lab<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.530> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
the tools and engrave lab this is the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.560 
the tools and engrave lab this is the
shape<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.400> want<00:00:11.460> I've<00:00:12.030> already<00:00:12.360> measured

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
shape that I want I've already measured

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.959 
shape that I want I've already measured
this<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.380> be<00:00:13.500> approximately<00:00:14.130> one<00:00:14.340> inch<00:00:14.549> across

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
this to be approximately one inch across

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.040 
this to be approximately one inch across
and<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.570> inch<00:00:15.750> high<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.699> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.940> about<00:00:18.480> 1/8

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
and one inch high and this is about 1/8

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.099 
and one inch high and this is about 1/8
of<00:00:19.260> an<00:00:19.410> inch<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.279> want<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.609> produce<00:00:21.109> so

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
of an inch is what we want to produce so

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870

and then once once I have this rectangle

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.340 
and then once once I have this rectangle
I<00:00:49.820> really<00:00:50.120> didn't<00:00:50.330> care<00:00:50.510> about<00:00:50.630> the<00:00:50.930> length<00:00:51.140> of

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
I really didn't care about the length of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.870 
I really didn't care about the length of
it<00:00:51.500> I'm<00:00:51.740> gonna<00:00:51.920> double-click<00:00:52.460> on<00:00:52.730> the

to do is I'm going to take a rectangle
and<00:01:12.530> just<00:01:12.740> draw<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:12.979> box<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.750> I'm<00:01:14.900> going<00:01:15.020> to

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
and just draw a box and I'm going to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.700 
and just draw a box and I'm going to
make<00:01:15.200> sure<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.800> top<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:18.050> Y

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
make sure that the top of this the the Y

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.830 
make sure that the top of this the the Y
dimensions<00:01:19.310> at<00:01:19.460> exactly<00:01:19.940> two<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.540> the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
dimensions at exactly two and the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.499 
dimensions at exactly two and the
centers<00:01:21.200> at<00:01:21.380> 3.5<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:23.090> I'm<00:01:23.180> going<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.360> take

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
centers at 3.5 then I'm going to take

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.180 
centers at 3.5 then I'm going to take
the<00:01:23.660> top<00:01:23.899> of<00:01:24.140> this<00:01:24.320> one<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.710> make<00:01:24.830> sure<00:01:24.860> that

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
the top of this one and make sure that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.340 
the top of this one and make sure that
the<00:01:25.340> why<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.550> that<00:01:25.790> exactly<00:01:26.119> three<00:01:26.780> inches<00:01:26.810> I

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
the why is that exactly three inches I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.139 
the why is that exactly three inches I
really<00:01:27.770> don't<00:01:27.950> care<00:01:28.040> what<00:01:28.580> size<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
really don't care what size the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.060 
really don't care what size the
rectangle<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:29.840> because<00:01:30.259> I'm<00:01:30.440> cutting<00:01:30.920> this

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
rectangle is because I'm cutting this

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.570 
rectangle is because I'm cutting this
away<00:01:31.430> from<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:32.420> shape<00:01:32.690> so<00:01:33.649> I<00:01:33.680> select<00:01:34.160> both<00:01:34.220> of

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
away from this shape so I select both of

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.990 
away from this shape so I select both of
them

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.169 
gonna do is I usually like using the
engrave<00:02:04.459> create<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.390> tool<00:02:05.660> path<00:02:05.959> female<00:02:06.709> and<00:02:07.179> I

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
engrave create a tool path female and I

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.580 
engrave create a tool path female and I
know<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.360> want<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.929> be<00:02:09.050> an<00:02:09.140> eighth<00:02:09.289> of<00:02:09.440> an

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
know I want it to be an eighth of an

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.320 
know I want it to be an eighth of an
inch<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:09.979> experimented<00:02:10.490> with<00:02:10.700> us<00:02:11.000> already

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
inch and I experimented with us already

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.390 
inch and I experimented with us already
so<00:02:11.510> that's<00:02:11.900> why<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> quarter<00:02:13.280> inch

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
so that's why I have a quarter inch

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.470 
so that's why I have a quarter inch
cutter<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.380> I'm<00:02:15.380> gonna<00:02:15.560> give<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:16.040> color<00:02:16.520> p25

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
cutter and I'm gonna give it a color p25

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.660 
cutter and I'm gonna give it a color p25
because<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.380> quarter<00:02:18.680> inch<00:02:18.830> make<00:02:19.520> sure

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
because it's a quarter inch make sure

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.970 
because it's a quarter inch make sure
that<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.000> depth<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.480> zero<00:02:20.780> or<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.410> offset

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
that the depth is zero or that offset

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.000 
that the depth is zero or that offset
will<00:02:22.190> not<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.670> exactly<00:02:23.150> what<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.890> what<00:02:24.890> you

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.610 
will not be exactly what you what you
want<00:02:25.280> because<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.990> conical<00:02:26.990> shape<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
want because of the conical shape of the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.610 
want because of the conical shape of the
cutter<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.459> I'm<00:02:28.520> going<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.700> click<00:02:28.880> on<00:02:29.000> okay<00:02:29.620> so

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
cutter so I'm going to click on okay so

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.220 
cutter so I'm going to click on okay so
here's<00:02:30.860> what<00:02:31.069> I've<00:02:31.190> created<00:02:31.480> now<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.200> a

here's what I've created now this is a

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.140 
here's what I've created now this is a
tool<00:02:33.530> path<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.220> don't<00:02:34.280> want<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:34.940> tool

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
tool path and I don't want it a tool

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.089 
tool path and I don't want it a tool
path<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.690> I'm<00:02:35.780> gonna<00:02:35.900> go<00:02:36.080> under<00:02:36.349> here<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.800> break

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
path so I'm gonna go under here to break

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.309 
path so I'm gonna go under here to break
path<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:37.849> it's<00:02:38.000> no<00:02:38.150> longer<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.569> tool<00:02:38.810> path<00:02:39.020> i

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
path so it's no longer a tool path i

well<00:04:12.620> maybe<00:04:12.919> I'm<00:04:13.069> going<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.280> use<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.430> 20<00:04:13.910> cutter

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
well maybe I'm going to use a 20 cutter

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.379 
well maybe I'm going to use a 20 cutter
and<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.379> can<00:04:15.560> see<00:04:15.769> this<00:04:15.950> has<00:04:16.160> got<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.340> 48<00:04:17.000> degree

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
and I can see this has got a 48 degree

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.259 
and I can see this has got a 48 degree
included<00:04:17.900> angle<00:04:18.289> and<00:04:18.609> you<00:04:19.609> have<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.910> set<00:04:20.120> the

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
included angle and you have to set the

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.909 
included angle and you have to set the
depth<00:04:20.539> and<00:04:20.780> make<00:04:20.900> sure<00:04:21.079> that<00:04:21.289> you're<00:04:21.440> probably

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
depth and make sure that you're probably

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.140 
depth and make sure that you're probably
on<00:04:22.310> one<00:04:22.580> pass<00:04:22.820> if<00:04:23.120> it's<00:04:23.270> plastic<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.729> let's

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
on one pass if it's plastic so and let's

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.600 
on one pass if it's plastic so and let's
say<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:27.139> profiling<00:04:27.620> tool<00:04:28.010> that<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.370> have

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
say that the profiling tool that I have

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.520 
say that the profiling tool that I have
is<00:04:28.760> in<00:04:28.849> a<00:04:28.910> 30<00:04:29.210> so<00:04:29.449> I'm<00:04:29.539> gonna<00:04:29.660> double<00:04:30.020> click<00:04:30.169> or

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
is in a 30 so I'm gonna double click or

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.250 
is in a 30 so I'm gonna double click or
just<00:04:30.889> click<00:04:31.160> here<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:32.510> can<00:04:32.539> see<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.870> don't<00:04:32.990> have

I'll backspace and put 30 in here for
the<00:04:44.630> name<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.490> go<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.699> angle<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.360> change

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
the name and go to the angle and change

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.150 
the name and go to the angle and change
that<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:47.900> 15<00:04:48.530> since

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
that to 15 since

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.450 
that to 15 since
half<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:50.050> included<00:04:51.050> angle<00:04:51.410> now<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.250> have<00:04:52.370> to

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
half the included angle now you have to

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.490 
half the included angle now you have to
click<00:04:52.700> on<00:04:52.850> change<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:53.870> can<00:04:54.020> see<00:04:54.200> that<00:04:54.350> it

changed and then say ok so now it's a
thirty<00:04:56.900> degree<00:04:57.110> angle

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
thirty degree angle

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.580 
thirty degree angle
and<00:04:58.330> since<00:04:59.330> it's<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.600> twenty<00:04:59.960> cutter<00:05:00.230> I'm<00:05:00.470> going

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
and since it's a twenty cutter I'm going

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.510 
and since it's a twenty cutter I'm going
to<00:05:00.680> make<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.310> color<00:05:01.970> P<00:05:02.270> twenty<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:03.160> say<00:05:04.160> ok

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
a blue color so this is my tool path in

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.080 
a blue color so this is my tool path in
