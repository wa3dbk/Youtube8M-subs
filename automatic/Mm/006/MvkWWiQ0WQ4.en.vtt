here<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.509> webpage<00:00:17.420> played<00:00:18.420> around<00:00:18.630> with

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
here on this webpage played around with

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.410 
here on this webpage played around with
a<00:00:18.840> bit<00:00:19.050> race<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.439> see<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.859> possible<00:00:20.420> and

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
a bit race to see what was possible and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.040 
a bit race to see what was possible and
he<00:00:21.510> pushed<00:00:21.750> up<00:00:22.100> 1080p30<00:00:23.100> from<00:00:24.090> around<00:00:24.300> 12

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
he pushed up 1080p30 from around 12

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.429 
he pushed up 1080p30 from around 12
megabits<00:00:25.380> per<00:00:25.619> second<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.160> 30<00:00:27.260> and<00:00:28.260> then

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
megabits per second up to 30 and then

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.929 
megabits per second up to 30 and then
since<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:28.949> people<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.369> been<00:00:29.460> playing<00:00:29.849> with

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
since then people have been playing with

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.269 
since then people have been playing with
other<00:00:30.150> frequent<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.840> not<00:00:31.740> frequencies

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
other frequent and not frequencies

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.760 
other frequent and not frequencies
resolutions<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.090> well<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.570> bitrate<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
resolutions as well and bitrate so the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.729 
resolutions as well and bitrate so the
first<00:00:38.040> thing<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.989> come<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.559> this

um<00:02:37.130> but<00:02:38.130> for<00:02:38.340> now<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.850> think<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.870> just<00:02:39.960> worth

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
um but for now I think it's just worth

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.120 
um but for now I think it's just worth
focusing<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.480> bit<00:02:42.480> rate<00:02:42.660> increases<00:02:43.260> so

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
focusing on the bit rate increases so

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.200 
focusing on the bit rate increases so
we've<00:02:44.220> come<00:02:44.370> down<00:02:44.400> into<00:02:44.730> number<00:02:45.000> nine

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
we've come down into number nine

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.360 
we've come down into number nine
see<00:02:45.660> that's<00:02:45.840> 1080p<00:02:46.500> fifty<00:02:46.980> or<00:02:47.070> sixty<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.670> know

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
see that's 1080p fifty or sixty I know

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.180 
see that's 1080p fifty or sixty I know
whether<00:02:50.370> you've<00:02:50.550> chosen<00:02:50.820> pal<00:02:51.150> or<00:02:51.330> ntsc<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:53.130> we

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
whether you've chosen pal or ntsc so we

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.590 
whether you've chosen pal or ntsc so we
come<00:02:53.370> down<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.700> man<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.940> see<00:02:54.480> it's

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
come down to the man I see it's

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.490 
come down to the man I see it's
currently<00:02:54.780> at<00:02:54.960> 25<00:02:55.650> megabits<00:02:56.580> per<00:02:56.700> second<00:02:57.180> and

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
currently at 25 megabits per second and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.680 
currently at 25 megabits per second and
and<00:02:58.500> he's<00:02:59.100> cranked<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.790> up<00:02:59.910> in<00:03:00.120> his<00:03:00.270> firm<00:03:00.540> way

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
and he's cranked it up in his firm way

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.250 
and he's cranked it up in his firm way
up<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.930> 35<00:03:01.380> now<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.220> can<00:03:02.400> play<00:03:02.550> with<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:03.260> to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
up to 35 now I can play with this to

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.720 
up to 35 now I can play with this to
whatever<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.710> want<00:03:04.890> really<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.580> go

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
whatever you want really you can go

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.650 
whatever you want really you can go
crazy<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.830> do<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.340> aware<00:03:08.580> that

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
crazy but you do have to be aware that

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.750 
crazy but you do have to be aware that
increases<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:10.260> load<00:03:10.440> quite<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> lot<00:03:11.100> on<00:03:11.130> on<00:03:11.520> the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
increases the load quite a lot on on the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.720 
increases the load quite a lot on on the
CPU<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.330> Umbrella<00:03:12.720> chip<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.610> therefore<00:03:14.610> I'll

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
CPU the Umbrella chip and therefore I'll

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.320 
CPU the Umbrella chip and therefore I'll
increase<00:03:15.090> heat<00:03:15.360> quite<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> lot<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.310> think<00:03:17.310> 35<00:03:18.000> is

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
increase heat quite a lot I think 35 is

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.130 
increase heat quite a lot I think 35 is
quite<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> nice<00:03:18.830> number<00:03:19.860> Oh<00:03:20.040> tiny<00:03:20.820> sixty<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:22.110> I

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
quite a nice number Oh tiny sixty but I

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.100 
quite a nice number Oh tiny sixty but I
find<00:03:22.470> all<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.800> person's<00:03:23.220> values<00:03:23.640> very<00:03:23.850> good

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.680 

they're<00:03:28.110> very<00:03:28.500> balanced<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.000> video

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
they're very balanced and and the video

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.520 
they're very balanced and and the video
quality<00:03:30.870> looks<00:03:31.290> really<00:03:31.590> good<00:03:31.710> so<00:03:32.150> what<00:03:33.150> we<00:03:33.270> do

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
quality looks really good so what we do

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.170 
quality looks really good so what we do
let's<00:03:34.530> take<00:03:34.770> this<00:03:34.890> one<00:03:34.950> here<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.340> 1080p<00:03:35.730> 50

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
let's take this one here in a 1080p 50

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.900 
let's take this one here in a 1080p 50
or<00:03:36.300> 60<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:37.410> we<00:03:37.590> go<00:03:37.800> into<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:40.010> click<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.220> fill

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
or 60 as we go into this click it fill

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.630 
or 60 as we go into this click it fill
it<00:03:42.030> up<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:43.770> then<00:03:43.830> just<00:03:44.040> enter<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.520> new

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
it up and then just enter the new

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.720 
it up and then just enter the new
bitrate<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.120> we<00:03:45.209> want<00:03:46.280> go<00:03:47.280> through<00:03:47.310> lighten

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
bitrate that we want go through lighten

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.110 
bitrate that we want go through lighten
up<00:03:47.990> so<00:03:48.990> you<00:03:49.740> can<00:03:49.980> see<00:03:50.130> yeah<00:03:50.280> there's<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.550> one<00:03:50.790> two

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
up so you can see yeah there's a one two

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.420 
up so you can see yeah there's a one two
and<00:03:51.330> three<00:03:51.750> next<00:03:51.990> at<00:03:52.200> eighteen<00:03:52.620> fifty<00:03:53.010> sixty

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
and three next at eighteen fifty sixty

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.970 
and three next at eighteen fifty sixty
one<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.360> then<00:03:54.720> when<00:03:55.020> you<00:03:55.110> select<00:03:55.260> high<00:03:55.590> video

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
one is then when you select high video

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.850 
one is then when you select high video
quality<00:03:56.190> me<00:03:56.610> up<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:57.630> his<00:03:57.810> medium<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.380> three<00:03:58.770> is

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
quality me up to his medium and three is

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.730 
quality me up to his medium and three is
low<00:03:59.070> so<00:03:59.700> low<00:03:59.970> is<00:04:00.150> 12<00:04:00.450> 15<00:04:01.290> 20<00:04:01.530> 5<00:04:01.650> etc<00:04:01.830> um<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:04.620> yeah
