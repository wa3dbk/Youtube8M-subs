00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.200
 so we proceed to the pattern 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.590
 simple option that I offer 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.500
 for those who do not have sewing skills 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.140
 either already forgotten maybe well or for 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.680
 reduce costs in time for those 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.699
 who can do it too 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:31.199
 use take ready dress 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:35.430
 small for a year from one to three 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.860
 what we do we take the cloth fold 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.420
 in half so that we have formed here 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.290
 fold and from this and from this side we take 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:55.039
 Platychko herself fold it too 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:01:03.109
 half rovnenko and apply to the fold 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:06.060
 we put it like that fold fold dress 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:11.159
 we do not circle only one half 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.630
 dress in this case I turned 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.560
 backrest 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:24.529
 in half we will not be platyshko 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.529
 on the neck 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.079
 there 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.079
 q necks will be better 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.460
 hangers would 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:44.119
 if you have sleeves 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.920
 you fold them up to the seam and circle it 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.579
 to the place where we have 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.579
 the seam 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:02.310
 so circled now we finish a little bit 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.590
 with allowance miserable so that we have on 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.240
 The bigger size was why 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.730
 that when you tie the mesh 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.090
 also add length slightly 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.950
 three centimeters more 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.740
 then it has a little property 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.980
 pick up that is to say a little bit 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.920
 so always do the pattern on the size 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:36.920
 can be two more or do not be afraid 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.810
 so in the same way you do 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.920
 the front part of the dress after 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.870
 here you circled 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.410
 you need to chart here by centimeter q 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:57.150
 can be on the floor a centimeter to allow 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:02.130
 for seam here and here also now when 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.670
 you and I are folding before the dress 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.340
 got we need to have our back 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.530
 part 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.010
 the necks were not visible as a rule 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.440
 the dress has fasteners here I am here too 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:22.769
 completed the fastener we stretch it and 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:26.670
 like this we fold so that we can see 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:31.250
 front only to front 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:35.250
 neckline 5 fold in half 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:40.700
 before and in the same way we apply to 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:46.110
 another in type another fold look 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.860
 so that we have the same level in 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.860
 practically 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:57.530
 so and just as well 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.530
 circle 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.130
 here 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.090
 dress bend again sleeves 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:23.940
 if they are, if not, then simply 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:23.940
 we will be open to the poor 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:39.530
 after that we remove sweep our 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:45.220
 the seams and we get with you here 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:48.710
 here is the pattern behind here and the patterns and 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.460
 definitely painted this 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.650
 loop to when the child 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.139
 dress crying to the head with us 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.820
 prolazila that is, they did the fastener 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.800
 so after we did 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.800
 our pattern start knitting 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 items
