00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.250
 the subscription or others who do not find us 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.050
 they can't be like they were already 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.720
 done and especially at a time 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.890
 so that he is not very happy 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.490
 but we are all very confident about the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.250
 future 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.610
 tonight there will be the new jersey that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.390
 now in a while you will see that he remembers the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.530
 old shirt that of 91 when 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.260
 Inter won the UEFA Cup and then 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.260
 we hope it is a good omen 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 and I too have the subscription as you want 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.500
 because I am confident that the company 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.199
 surely it will do anything to give it to you 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.600
 the chance to go back to being 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.510
 have fun being protagonists because 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.879
 we need all the fans because 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.240
 we all know that when the stadium 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.130
 full and full of fans of the la 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.810

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.780

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.240

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.829
 still managed to bring large 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.140
 results, however, missing a match in the 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:22.060
 life you have to believe in it completely not 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.060
 you never know, however, beyond this 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.140
 admire this I am much like you 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.780
 I am very confident for the next one 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.590
 year I'm sure he had a team 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:45.180
 very competitive here told me mike 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.460
 he said he will do anything they seem to me 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.940

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.890
 help improve our team 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.590
