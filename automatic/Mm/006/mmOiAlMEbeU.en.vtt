actually is that the it's a little bit

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.270 
actually is that the it's a little bit
tough<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.619> actually<00:01:49.829> detach

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
tough to do but you can actually detach

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.010 
tough to do but you can actually detach
the<00:01:50.729> headphone<00:01:51.000> from<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> cable<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> reason

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the headphone from the cable the reason

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.410 
the headphone from the cable the reason
that<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.409> being<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.939> that<00:01:53.939> there<00:01:54.270> is

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that for that being is that there is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.520 
that for that being is that there is
actually<00:01:54.720> two<00:01:54.780> different<00:01:54.869> cables<00:01:55.380> there's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
actually two different cables there's

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.959 
actually two different cables there's
one<00:01:55.740> here<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> microphone<00:01:56.579> built-in

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
one here with the microphone built-in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.120 
one here with the microphone built-in
and<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> headphone<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.229> remote<00:01:58.829> control

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and the headphone and the remote control

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.530 
and the headphone and the remote control
and<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.729> there's<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.119> another<00:02:00.329> one

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and then there's going to be another one

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.700 
and then there's going to be another one
inside<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:01.079> case<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.500> I'll<00:02:01.590> show

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
inside the little case that I'll show

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.139 
inside the little case that I'll show
you<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.920> second<00:02:02.219> here<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.640> going

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
you in a second here that's just going

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.270 
you in a second here that's just going
to<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.439> braided<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.590> not<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.100> any

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
and then give it a second so that it

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.570 
and then give it a second so that it
actually<00:04:43.640> can<00:04:44.350> fill<00:04:45.350> up<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.830> then<00:04:46.370> once

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.890 
actually can fill up and then once
that's<00:04:46.730> in<00:04:46.910> there<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.540> nice<00:04:47.690> thing<00:04:47.720> about

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
that's in there the nice thing about

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.450 
that's in there the nice thing about
these<00:04:48.140> is<00:04:48.200> that<00:04:48.380> they're<00:04:48.620> also<00:04:48.770> kind<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.130> sound

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
these is that they're also kind of sound

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.250 
these is that they're also kind of sound
isolating<00:04:49.940> so<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:50.540> kind<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.780> keeps<00:04:50.930> everything

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
isolating so it kind of keeps everything

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.230 
isolating so it kind of keeps everything
inside<00:04:51.730> doesn't<00:04:52.730> allow<00:04:52.880> for<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.120> lot<00:04:53.150> of

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
inside doesn't allow for a lot of

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.180 
inside doesn't allow for a lot of
ambient<00:04:53.540> noise<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.930> know<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.410> lot<00:04:54.890> of<00:04:54.920> times<00:04:55.100> i

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
ambient noise I know a lot of times i

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.160 
ambient noise I know a lot of times i
usually<00:04:55.520> like<00:04:55.880> these<00:04:56.090> on<00:04:56.240> airplanes<00:04:56.720> or<00:04:56.990> bus

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
usually like these on airplanes or bus

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.410 
usually like these on airplanes or bus
rides<00:04:57.440> that<00:04:58.220> way<00:04:58.370> kind<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.670> acts<00:04:58.940> like<00:04:59.090> sound

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
rides that way kind of acts like sound

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.760 
rides that way kind of acts like sound
isolation<00:04:59.810> you<00:05:00.050> don't<00:05:00.200> really<00:05:00.320> hear<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.560> lot<00:05:00.710> of

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
isolation you don't really hear a lot of

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
mean once it fills up there feels nice

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.560 
mean once it fills up there feels nice
and<00:05:04.550> comfortable<00:05:06.820> here<00:05:07.820> plug<00:05:08.210> it<00:05:08.330> into<00:05:08.420> my
