00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
paint with a direct approach which means

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
paint with a direct approach which means
that<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:28.230> aiming<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.220> dark<00:00:29.820> colors

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
that I'm aiming to get the dark colors

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
that I'm aiming to get the dark colors
on<00:00:30.359> first<00:00:31.080> time<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.619> I'm<00:00:31.710> not<00:00:31.859> having<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> build

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
on first time so I'm not having to build

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:47.720 
on first time so I'm not having to build
up<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.550> series<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> glazes<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:46.489> way<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.640> I'm

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
up a series of glazes the way that I'm

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.790 
up a series of glazes the way that I'm
painting<00:00:48.030> holding<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> brush<00:00:49.020> quite<00:00:49.530> far

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
painting holding the brush quite far

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.590 
painting holding the brush quite far
back<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.160> handle<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.210> these<00:00:51.329> are<00:00:51.480> I'm

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
back on the handle and these are I'm

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.069 
back on the handle and these are I'm
sacrificing<00:00:52.440> accuracy<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.160> speed<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.660> can

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
sacrificing accuracy for speed so I can

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.160 
sacrificing accuracy for speed so I can
get<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> shapes<00:00:55.739> painted<00:00:56.250> quickly<00:00:56.750> but<00:00:57.750> not

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
get the shapes painted quickly but not

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.560 
get the shapes painted quickly but not
with<00:00:58.469> too<00:00:59.460> much<00:00:59.609> accuracy<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.300> actually

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
with too much accuracy and that actually

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.470 
with too much accuracy and that actually
suits<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> effect<00:01:01.410> I'm<00:01:01.559> after

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.510 

what<00:01:07.080> I'm<00:01:07.200> trying<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.800> fuse<00:01:08.190> together

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
what I'm trying to do is fuse together

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
what I'm trying to do is fuse together
shapes<00:01:08.970> which<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.390> same<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.870> similar<00:01:10.170> in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
shapes which are the same or similar in

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
shapes which are the same or similar in
tone<00:01:12.230> I'm<00:01:13.230> trying<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.190> make<00:01:14.370> sure<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.910> shape

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
tone I'm trying to make sure the shape

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.590 
tone I'm trying to make sure the shape
is<00:01:15.480> always<00:01:16.140> slightly<00:01:16.920> varying<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
is always slightly varying and the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200 
is always slightly varying and the
colors<00:01:18.930> slightly<00:01:19.110> varying<00:01:19.620> with<00:01:19.800> it<00:01:20.150> try<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
colors slightly varying with it try to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.640 
colors slightly varying with it try to
keep<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.690> silhouette<00:01:22.050> interesting<00:01:22.500> because

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
keep the silhouette interesting because

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.650 
keep the silhouette interesting because
why<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.010> brush<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.580> darting<00:01:24.060> about<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.510> this

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
why the brush is darting about in this

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:42.410 
why the brush is darting about in this
fashion<00:01:40.100> my<00:01:41.100> paintings<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.730> going<00:01:41.910> from<00:01:42.090> dark

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
fashion my paintings are going from dark

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.010 
fashion my paintings are going from dark
to<00:01:42.510> light

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

fusing shapes together on the paper wet
up<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.270> wet<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:46.020> need<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.290> use<00:01:46.380> bags<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:47.010> paint

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
up to wet you need to use bags of paint

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.820 
up to wet you need to use bags of paint
bags<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.150> water<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.780> you've<00:01:49.170> really<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
bags of water and you've really got to

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.650 
bags of water and you've really got to
have<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> bit<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> guts<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.730> if<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.030> paint<00:01:51.510> is
