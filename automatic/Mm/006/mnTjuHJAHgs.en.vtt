00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
really amazing results but the key is

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.890 
really amazing results but the key is
not<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.520> flat<00:02:31.760> too<00:02:31.940> fast<00:02:32.210> because<00:02:32.480> if<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.660> fly

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
not to flat too fast because if you fly

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.330 
not to flat too fast because if you fly
it<00:02:32.960> around<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.470> crazy<00:02:33.650> person

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
it around like a crazy person

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.650 
it around like a crazy person
people<00:02:34.640> know<00:02:34.850> straight<00:02:35.150> away<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
people know straight away that it's a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.630 
people know straight away that it's a
drone<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.410> it's<00:02:36.560> all<00:02:36.680> about<00:02:36.710> producing<00:02:37.250> nice

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
drone so it's all about producing nice

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.340 
drone so it's all about producing nice
fluid<00:02:38.120> movements<00:02:38.690> that's<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.470> key

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.160 

you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.960 

this<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.319> an<00:02:50.440> obvious<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.520> make<00:02:51.730> sure<00:02:51.760> you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
this is an obvious one but make sure you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.930 
this is an obvious one but make sure you
don't<00:02:52.120> fly<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.540> terrible<00:02:53.019> windy<00:02:53.410> conditions

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
don't fly in terrible windy conditions

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.720 
don't fly in terrible windy conditions
it<00:02:54.940> can<00:02:55.060> be<00:02:55.209> really<00:02:55.450> dangerous<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:56.730> things

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
it can be really dangerous and things

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.759 
it can be really dangerous and things
can<00:02:57.879> go<00:02:58.030> nasty<00:02:58.420> quite<00:02:58.629> quickly<00:02:58.870> make<00:02:59.560> sure<00:02:59.709> you

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
can go nasty quite quickly make sure you

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.869 
can go nasty quite quickly make sure you
check<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.040> weather<00:03:00.190> before<00:03:00.280> you're<00:03:00.580> planning

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
check the weather before you're planning

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.490 
check the weather before you're planning
a<00:03:00.940> shoot<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.420> if<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.200> don't<00:03:02.349> feel

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
a shoot and if you don't feel

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.320 
a shoot and if you don't feel
comfortable<00:03:02.680> about<00:03:03.069> flying<00:03:03.459> in<00:03:03.670> those<00:03:03.790> really

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
comfortable about flying in those really

comfortable about flying in those really
windy<00:03:04.569> conditions<00:03:04.959> don't<00:03:05.620> do<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.890> there's<00:03:06.160> no

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
windy conditions don't do it there's no

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.589 
windy conditions don't do it there's no
need<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.880> make<00:03:07.150> sure<00:03:07.300> you're<00:03:07.450> always

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
need to just make sure you're always

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.410 
need to just make sure you're always
safe<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.580> then<00:03:09.580> you'll<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.910> lot<00:03:10.090> more<00:03:10.239> fun

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
safe and then you'll have a lot more fun

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.820 
safe and then you'll have a lot more fun
and<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.630> won't<00:03:10.810> have<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.019> worry<00:03:11.230> about<00:03:11.349> things

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
and you won't have to worry about things

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:24.250 
and you won't have to worry about things
going<00:03:12.130> wrong

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.350 

another<00:03:24.980> really<00:03:25.220> good<00:03:25.370> thing<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:25.670> do<00:03:25.819> is<00:03:26.060> to

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
another really good thing to do is to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.580 
another really good thing to do is to
make<00:03:26.510> sure<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:26.930> plan<00:03:27.170> your<00:03:27.379> shots

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
make sure that you plan your shots

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.640 
make sure that you plan your shots
before<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:28.849> actually<00:03:29.090> take<00:03:29.390> off<00:03:29.599> it<00:03:30.379> can<00:03:30.560> be

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
before you actually take off it can be

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.470 
before you actually take off it can be
so<00:03:30.860> tempting<00:03:31.280> sometimes<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.819> just<00:03:32.120> literally

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
so tempting sometimes to just literally

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.449 
so tempting sometimes to just literally
start<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.200> drone<00:03:33.379> up<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.709> fly<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:33.980> around<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
start the drone up and fly it around and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.430 
start the drone up and fly it around and
see<00:03:34.640> what<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:34.879> get<00:03:35.060> but<00:03:35.690> if<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:35.900> can<00:03:36.050> plan<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
see what you get but if you can plan the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.780 
see what you get but if you can plan the
shot<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.860> if<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.069> can<00:03:37.190> talk<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.459> through<00:03:37.489> with

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
shot and if you can talk it through with

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.520 
shot and if you can talk it through with
the<00:03:37.819> actors<00:03:38.150> or<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.300> subject<00:03:38.810> it'll<00:03:39.319> just

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
the actors or the subject it'll just

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.949 
the actors or the subject it'll just
make<00:03:39.680> for<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.010> much<00:03:40.280> better<00:03:40.489> shot<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:41.690> more<00:03:41.840> you

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
make for a much better shot the more you

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.600 
make for a much better shot the more you
can<00:03:42.080> plan<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.800> better<00:03:42.980> will<00:03:43.220> be<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.489> end

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
can plan the better will be in the end

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.220 
can plan the better will be in the end
result<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:44.000> course<00:03:44.540> there'll<00:03:44.750> be<00:03:44.780> times<00:03:45.050> where

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
result of course there'll be times where

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.870 
result of course there'll be times where
you<00:03:45.290> can't<00:03:45.590> plan<00:03:45.860> because<00:03:46.280> you're<00:03:46.489> shooting

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
you can't plan because you're shooting

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.250 
you can't plan because you're shooting
an<00:03:46.940> event<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.390> it's<00:03:47.510> all<00:03:47.630> very<00:03:47.870> run-and-gun

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
an event and it's all very run-and-gun

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.650 
an event and it's all very run-and-gun
but<00:03:49.099> in<00:03:49.220> those<00:03:49.340> instances<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:50.120> more<00:03:50.510> you've

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
but in those instances the more you've

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.600 
but in those instances the more you've
practiced<00:03:51.019> beforehand<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:52.099> easier<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.549> will

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
practiced beforehand the easier it will

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.610 
practiced beforehand the easier it will
be<00:03:52.760> on<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.970> day<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.330> also<00:03:53.989> having<00:03:54.140> a<00:03:54.260> monitor

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
be on the day and also having a monitor

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.289 
be on the day and also having a monitor
which<00:03:54.799> is<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.190> highly<00:03:55.670> recommend<00:03:56.060> if<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:56.269> can

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
which is I highly recommend if you can

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.030 
which is I highly recommend if you can
get<00:03:56.660> yourself<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:56.959> monitor<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.470> will<00:03:57.860> just

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
get yourself a monitor that will just

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.430 
get yourself a monitor that will just
make<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.549> filming<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.420> this<00:03:59.780> event<00:04:00.110> much

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
make the filming of this event much

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.720 
make the filming of this event much
easier<00:04:00.799> because<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.160> can<00:04:01.280> actually<00:04:01.370> see<00:04:01.610> what

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
easier because you can actually see what

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:12.000 
easier because you can actually see what
you're<00:04:01.790> doing<00:04:02.000> rather<00:04:02.180> than<00:04:02.269> having<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.630> guess

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.170 

the<00:04:13.010> drone<00:04:13.250> really<00:04:13.519> shines<00:04:13.790> when<00:04:14.000> you're<00:04:14.090> able

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
the drone really shines when you're able

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.000 
the drone really shines when you're able
to<00:04:14.329> get<00:04:14.480> shots<00:04:14.540> that<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.079> helicopter<00:04:15.319> can<00:04:15.769> get

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
to get shots that a helicopter can get

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.770 
to get shots that a helicopter can get
so<00:04:16.340> for<00:04:16.489> example<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:16.940> when<00:04:17.329> I<00:04:17.359> was<00:04:17.479> in<00:04:17.600> Scotland

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
so for example I when I was in Scotland

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.860 
so for example I when I was in Scotland
I<00:04:18.370> sit<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.519> drone<00:04:19.910> up<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:20.450> really<00:04:20.690> nervous

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
I sit the drone up it's really nervous

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.300 
I sit the drone up it's really nervous
because<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.440> wasn't<00:04:21.889> sure<00:04:21.979> if<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.160> was<00:04:22.220> gonna

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
because I wasn't sure if I was gonna

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.520 
because I wasn't sure if I was gonna
crash<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:22.910> there<00:04:23.000> was<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.120> window<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:23.660> I

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
crash it and there was a window and I

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.890 
crash it and there was a window and I

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
the other side and it produced a really

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.740 
the other side and it produced a really
nice<00:04:34.190> shot<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.669> sometimes<00:04:35.450> you've<00:04:35.600> got<00:04:35.720> to
