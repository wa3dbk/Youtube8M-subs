00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.080
 youtube magic trick with cards 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.910
 revealed this time from Juan Tamariz and 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280
 need to do with some viewer pin 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.880
 social ethics camera the director of the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.609
 hello interior trick 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.000
 and we'll take turns each video 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.190
 so that it is not always the same 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.950
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.420
 is to unfold it and tell the viewer 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.420
 take a letter any 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.020
 ok and the others we pick them up again 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.199
 now what we will proceed 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.030
 and passing a little pile by piles 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.239
 and wherever you want to put it 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.239
 tell ya already 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 those letters 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.670
 now we will proceed to start cutting 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.810
 we cut through here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.329
 here we complete 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.420
 As you will see, I have nothing behind the 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.060
 hand 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.560
 therefore now we proceed to do to put 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.020
 three letters here 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.090
 and will have to respect it will have to 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.480
 remember what the diamond ones are 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.070
 of diamonds 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.909
 of diamonds 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.140
 good goes on diamonds 3 of diamonds and 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.140
 the 7 of diamonds 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.700
 more than diamonds 3 of diamonds 7 of 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.090
 diamonds and what a coincidence that all 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.009
 They are diamonds but good 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.490
 and now we have to tell him that I say a 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.020
 number from 1 to 10 in 3 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.610
 2 and 3 this will be a letter from the viewer 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.180
 it can not be my letter already left 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.310
 as it came out if that was 7 of 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.250
 diamond was here and it has gone wrong 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.710
 good as I am a magician like I will do 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.830
 something like that and the letter then 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.530
 here 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.710
 and then there is none 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.560
 good now 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.390
 will be the application 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.390
 This letter is based here 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.260
 and let's say that the diet 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.490
 by telling him to make the piles 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.830
 for example here when we say insurance 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.290
 I do not want to put here and here we put two 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.230
 speakers 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.030
 and now we can man who does not see 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.750
 now then when we are there 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.520
 we cut 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.010
 and we cut and what we will have are two 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.120
 normal letters and the next of the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.790
 two 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.129
 the viewer's then when you 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.630
 we say that now put the three letters 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.360
 we do it this way 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.510
 so that it is not seen then we put 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.510
 is 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.270
 the next one and already the next Saturday 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.800
 but we will do 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.110
 a kick kick so that the letter does not 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.070
 that we take the washings if we do not take 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.070
 any other 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.560
 and very important that when you go to 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.530
 do the first two also to vice 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.250
 well because if not the last one will be very 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.540
 will notice 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.180
 now then the number line that we have 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.180
 caught letters from here back 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.180
 12 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.370
 45 in the sixth we take the put here 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.440
 so when we tell him when he 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.599
 Say I had not gone out in one of these 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.090
 three you say good as I am a magician of 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.250
 a little touch 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.270
 and yours is not here but it 's the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.090
 that I have chosen 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.460
