section of the wetsuit air dome is a new
type<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.849> neoprene<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> market<00:00:31.640> it's<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
type of neoprene on the market it's a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.880 
type of neoprene on the market it's a
five<00:00:32.969> millimeter<00:00:33.180> panel<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.989> yamamoto

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
five millimeter panel of yamamoto

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.060 
five millimeter panel of yamamoto
neoprene<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:36.000> actually<00:00:36.780> has<00:00:37.050> hundreds<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.800> air

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
neoprene it actually has hundreds of air

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.540 
neoprene it actually has hundreds of air
cavities<00:00:38.610> within<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.480> neoprene<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.320> act<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
cavities within the neoprene that act to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.610 
cavities within the neoprene that act to
place<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> optimum<00:00:43.200> swimming

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
place you in the optimum swimming

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.770 
place you in the optimum swimming
position<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.700> it'll<00:00:44.910> actually<00:00:45.030> raise<00:00:45.480> your

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
position so it'll actually raise your

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.040 
position so it'll actually raise your
legs<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.469> your<00:00:46.950> torso<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.600> water<00:00:48.809> for

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
legs and your torso in the water for

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
legs and your torso in the water for
increased<00:00:49.440> power<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.829> speed<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.270> air

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
increased power and speed so the air

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
increased power and speed so the air
dome<00:00:51.629> neoprene<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.829> section<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> the

buoyancy<00:01:40.049> cells<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.740> actually<00:01:41.430> what<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> is

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
buoyancy cells and actually what this is

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.940 
buoyancy cells and actually what this is
these<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.390> cells<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.049> foam<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.799> are

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
these are cells of foam that are

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.830 
these are cells of foam that are
positioned<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> forum<00:01:45.000> area<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.509> the
