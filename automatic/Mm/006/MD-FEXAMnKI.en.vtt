00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
it all it all right so this seed is not

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.929 
it all it all right so this seed is not
a<00:00:27.029> normal<00:00:27.330> seed<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.680> see<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.160> 1.7

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
a normal seed as you can see it is 1.7

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.569 
a normal seed as you can see it is 1.7
terrain<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.449> course<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:32.219> also

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
terrain of course but that was also

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.290 
terrain of course but that was also
featured<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.390> my<00:00:33.660> others<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:35.300> few

featured in one of my others or in few

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.410 
featured in one of my others or in few
of<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.570> other<00:00:36.780> seed<00:00:37.500> reviews<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:39.059> seed

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
of my other seed reviews and this seed

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.110 
of my other seed reviews and this seed
is<00:00:39.690> actually<00:00:40.290> amplified<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.820> something

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
is actually amplified it is something

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
is actually amplified it is something
different<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.260> show<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.590> how<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> get

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
different I can just show you how to get

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700 
different I can just show you how to get
the<00:00:44.520> amplified<00:00:45.059> version<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.500> on

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the amplified version so it just go on

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.270 
the amplified version so it just go on
to<00:00:46.920> create<00:00:47.250> new<00:00:47.489> world<00:00:48.170> namely<00:00:49.170> world<00:00:49.860> however

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
to create new world namely world however

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.910 
to create new world namely world however
you<00:00:50.670> want<00:00:50.969> let's<00:00:51.300> call<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:54.260> amplifies<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
you want let's call it amplifies the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.479 
you want let's call it amplifies the
world<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.199> switch<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.340> your

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
world and then you switch on to your

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.430 
world and then you switch on to your
game<00:00:59.520> mode<00:00:59.820> whatever<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.050> my<00:01:01.379> case

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
game mode whatever you like in my case

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.100 
game mode whatever you like in my case
it<00:01:01.890> would<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.340> creative<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.329> more<00:01:03.780> world

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
it would be creative and more world

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.070 
it would be creative and more world
options<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> work<00:01:06.030> where<00:01:06.600> real

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
options and then the work where real

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.780 
options and then the work where real
time<00:01:07.409> would<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:08.299> large<00:01:09.299> biomes<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:10.229> but

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
time would be large biomes not but

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.390 
time would be large biomes not but
amplified<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> kind<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
amplified and you have to have a kind of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.539 
amplified and you have to have a kind of
beefy<00:01:14.820> computer<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.409> mine<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.130> also

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
beefy computer for that but mine is also

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.539 
beefy computer for that but mine is also
not<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.420> great<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.130> good<00:01:20.280> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
not that great but it's kind of good so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.050 
not that great but it's kind of good so
it<00:01:20.790> runs<00:01:21.049> decently<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.490> then<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.850> click

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it runs decently and then you just click

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.210 
it runs decently and then you just click
on<00:01:24.299> generate<00:01:24.689> new<00:01:24.900> world<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.979> takes

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
on generate new world and then it takes

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.370 
on generate new world and then it takes
some<00:01:26.460> time<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.729> load<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> terrain

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
some time to load up because the terrain

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.990 
some time to load up because the terrain
is<00:01:28.740> massively<00:01:29.430> huge<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.860> um<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.000> don't

that<00:02:54.910> into<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.630> video<00:02:56.050> description<00:02:56.819> we<00:02:57.819> even

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
that into the video description we even

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.610 
that into the video description we even
got<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.510> little<00:02:58.870> flower<00:02:59.290> forest<00:02:59.830> right<00:03:00.400> here

got a little flower forest right here

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.949 
got a little flower forest right here
very<00:03:02.620> cool<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.250> doesn't<00:03:03.790> load<00:03:03.880> up<00:03:04.090> too<00:03:04.329> quick

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
very cool it doesn't load up too quick

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.310 
very cool it doesn't load up too quick
as<00:03:05.200> i<00:03:05.650> have<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.510> computer<00:03:07.510> right<00:03:07.540> here<00:03:07.810> which

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
as i have this computer right here which

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.900 
as i have this computer right here which
is<00:03:08.560> not<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:09.280> great<00:03:09.670> but<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:11.140> runs<00:03:11.410> ok<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:12.579> if

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
is not that great but it runs ok but if

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.600 
is not that great but it runs ok but if
you<00:03:13.150> have<00:03:13.329> some<00:03:13.900> sort<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.290> NASA<00:03:14.650> pc<00:03:15.400> or

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
you have some sort of NASA pc or

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.199 
you have some sort of NASA pc or
something<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:17.079> should<00:03:17.410> be<00:03:17.650> no<00:03:17.920> problem<00:03:18.209> that

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
something that should be no problem that

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.210 
something that should be no problem that
would<00:03:19.480> be<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> nice<00:03:20.079> screenshot<00:03:20.530> for<00:03:21.040> the

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
would be a nice screenshot for the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.910 
would be a nice screenshot for the
thumbnail<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.720> guess<00:03:22.930> we'll<00:03:23.380> just<00:03:23.410> review

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
thumbnail so I guess we'll just review

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.650 
thumbnail so I guess we'll just review
this<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.730> then<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:27.790> seems<00:03:28.090> kind<00:03:28.480> of

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
this it then so this seems kind of

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.140 
this it then so this seems kind of
strange<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.410> just<00:03:29.950> review<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.579> seed<00:03:30.850> that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
strange to just review the seed that

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.300 
strange to just review the seed that
I've<00:03:32.109> just<00:03:32.140> gone<00:03:32.829> so<00:03:33.700> right<00:03:34.239> here<00:03:34.269> snow

I've just gone so right here snow
floating<00:03:36.310> islands<00:03:36.820> everywhere<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.680> through

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
floating islands everywhere and through

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.490 
floating islands everywhere and through
add-on<00:03:39.459> there<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.239> forest<00:03:40.750> let's<00:03:41.079> see<00:03:41.350> if

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
add-on there is a forest let's see if

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.190 
add-on there is a forest let's see if
there's<00:03:41.799> another<00:03:41.920> biome<00:03:42.910> maybe<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.630> new<00:03:43.959> one

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
there's another biome maybe a new one

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.500 
there's another biome maybe a new one
maybe<00:03:44.470> roof<00:03:44.799> forest<00:03:45.340> which<00:03:45.609> was<00:03:45.880> in<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.329> other

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
maybe roof forest which was in the other

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.750 
maybe roof forest which was in the other

man this is kind of stupid right now but
i<00:04:44.400> think<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.780> seed<00:04:46.139> is<00:04:46.970> one<00:04:47.970> of<00:04:48.180> my<00:04:49.070> favorite

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
i think the seed is one of my favorite

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.129 
i think the seed is one of my favorite
seat<00:04:50.430> even<00:04:50.850> though<00:04:51.000> i<00:04:51.030> haven't<00:04:51.690> really

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
seat even though i haven't really

seat even though i haven't really
checked<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.620> out<00:04:52.740> now<00:04:53.130> but<00:04:53.880> i've<00:04:54.270> generated

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
checked it out now but i've generated

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.370 
checked it out now but i've generated

it's just a tiger seem like there was a
rule<00:05:11.520> forest<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.810> i<00:05:12.840> guess<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.289> can<00:05:13.500> look

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
rule forest so i guess you can look

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.629 
rule forest so i guess you can look
around<00:05:14.099> a<00:05:14.430> bit<00:05:14.460> then<00:05:14.900> man<00:05:15.900> this<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:16.770> epic<00:05:17.130> let's

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
around a bit then man this is epic let's

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.540 
around a bit then man this is epic let's
check<00:05:17.880> for<00:05:18.150> dungeons<00:05:18.720> real<00:05:19.169> quick<00:05:19.889> as<00:05:20.130> I'm

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
check for dungeons real quick as I'm

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.890 
check for dungeons real quick as I'm
always<00:05:20.880> doing<00:05:21.389> so<00:05:22.520> where's<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.820> fences<00:05:24.510> there

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
always doing so where's the fences there

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.909 
always doing so where's the fences there
we<00:05:25.080> go<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.830> let's<00:05:26.400> take<00:05:26.669> down<00:05:26.940> into<00:05:27.419> the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
we go and let's take down into the

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.820 
we go and let's take down into the
bottom<00:05:29.210> maybe<00:05:30.210> it<00:05:30.450> would<00:05:30.690> even<00:05:31.050> possible<00:05:31.590> to

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
bottom maybe it would even possible to

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.580 
bottom maybe it would even possible to
have<00:05:31.860> some<00:05:32.460> sort<00:05:32.849> of<00:05:33.000> them
