00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello good now yes we are here 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.190
 new video of plants against zombies 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.020
 this time that good is a game that had 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.820
 some time ago and I have not uploaded anything 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.440
 I say still going'll play one 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.389
 game over has touched me with the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.009
 plants that I control because it 's a little more 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.200
 that with the zombies I have not played either 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.509
 a lot to the game but well let's see if 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.630
 there is luck we can not give you there is a 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.980
 little bit good I'll go changing plant 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.809
 moment I start with this but now go 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.399
 trying another one already if you see then 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:30.660
 how many although I suppose you have seen 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.120
 the game the truth that the graphics 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.790
 they improve quite a serial style onu 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.710
 so not but good to see if he found 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.450
 someone around here this plant what happens 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.600
 what is that is a bit slow but if you 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.120
 you do much more damage than with a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.340
 submachine gun those one face 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.300
 as everything you see so is that that goes 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.910
 out there jumping puts each one 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.320
 Let's go there 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.670
 in the style of shift I go there 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.670
 they are there in the west park 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.430
 if it's going to help a little 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.520
 but there because it comes 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 run is still 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.270
 we go 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.820
 run run run about 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.560
 They're not here 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.560
 they are here 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.399
 ok I did not see it here I've lived it 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.399
 and this one is not cool 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.219
 I have activated the turret mode that and 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.380
 he came behind villa and attacked but hey 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.590
 I'm asking a little bit just to start 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.640
 see if we go back a bit and not 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.640
 you know about rabei inside 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.660
 because I'm there to appear 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.490
 Let's go there 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.990
 we keep getting the turbo when they're 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.380
 right in front and so it has more 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.630
 complicated to give you much less then to 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.920
 he sees it and there we are going to revive him there 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.980
 but I hide that a little that if not 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.690
 they kill me I relive and so you want me not 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.160
 he tells them even though they are going to kill him 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.970
 again I suppose another dead 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.970
 what is that 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.540
 two 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.540
 to the traps 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.080
 Let's see 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:57.420
 if it leaves you as stunned there 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.420
 and if it arrives, there is no soap. 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.310
 come on let's go for him 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.300
 I'm recharging 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.300
 the element the turbo 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.629
 so that I fall 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.379
 what is this what stuns the 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.379
 speakers those 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.430
 now 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.210
 to see if I recover a little I'm going to 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.670
 put in turret mode and that up there 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.709
 to see where they are dead 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.170
 the west stand but here they come here 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.680
 to revive 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.680
 I'm waiting 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.790
 to see if I can relive this 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.740
 handsome as a missile as he was killed 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.440
 I think I have not killed another one of people 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.750
 it will be worth, it's worth, let's see how much 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.590
 three have been killed for the moment 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.350
 Normal worth normal normal are winning us 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.069
 we are winning we are going 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.970
 how much 6-1 throw that the gift 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.250
 dead ale 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.220
 run run run run coming 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.220
 they want to put it into existence 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.479
 with this it is more crappy to hit him with 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.580
 This character with the plant is for 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.580
 he killed another streak for two come 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.100
 mariano caught the carnivorous plant 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.340
 is recharged and they are up if you take 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.340
 other 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:49.850
 that's mine, it's okay, they're healing me 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.440
 to revive me where they are here as 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.980
 we go 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.980
 two 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.870
 I do not give him a male 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.200
 I kill you, it's no longer worth this 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.890
 now we are going to get caught 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.800
 6 come, come, come, save yourself, revive 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.650
 It's been revived and it's better to improve 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.420
 little I'm cured alone to time is worth 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.420
 to throw that out there to see if I give it 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.849
 come on let's go around here take this 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:29.899
 yes, it's not cool for me to put a few turns 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:38.779
 the leather Corro run but we 

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:41.420
 is maintained by the right can to drool 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:43.700
 Let's see how we're doing 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.990
 I'm going to change the plant 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:51.040
 character I'm going to catch the capture know 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.840
 ok if I came to see how he shot this 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.620
 to the new east I do not have the ability to 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.620
 half seems 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:05.080
 to see if with this it comes out a little better 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.080
 although I do not handle the other better 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.840
 you will be able to play 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.900
 for this that are resolved you end up 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.900
 there 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.289
 another another another another moment and this 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:29.810
 this also has put me the wall is 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.960
 so they would not give me but well, it's not going 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.980
 bad is not bad if we win even if it's the 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.100
 departure 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.710
 33 48 we're winning like a 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.750
 just go down to see if it can be the last 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.380
 we go from here 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:50.180
 do not think I get there 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:53.930
 it's worth the last 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.660
 good is not that bad so as not to play 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.070
 I almost have to put a little more and 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.410
 I see that you are cool because I will try to climb 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.050
 once in a while also because this game and 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.880
 back I have to go up a day too 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.199
 these so I do not expect anything that I have 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.199
 liked and until next time
