 we look German the Nokia Siemens 60 00 Classic occasion is the 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.650
 Successor to the very popular Nokia 63 00 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.909
 for the mobile phone 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:21.789

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.250

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.859
 solid processed 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.019
 around which is 100 times 45 times 11 millimeters that is a light year Trier 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400
 slimmer and Lidl 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.280
 Mr. Shauna Sand also percent heavy on his I made that with 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.740

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.270
 which in itself are not so difficult as never 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.190
 but im through the slim dimensions 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.560
 You can expect a slightly lighter phone 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.970
 the mobile dominates HSPA 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.690
 So the pr- and coupe is called 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.820

 He has the memory with Nico SD cards up to about 2 8's 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.570
 Work facilitates more extensible 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.370
 with a license for a 30 days this is not a material 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.630
 then listen 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.880
 you have to pay about 60 euros 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.810
 when you hear Germany Austria and Switzerland 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.120
