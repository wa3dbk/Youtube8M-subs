00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
but you can actually see as the bees are

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.389 
but you can actually see as the bees are
actually<00:00:28.980> emerging<00:00:29.939> from<00:00:30.630> these<00:00:31.399> capped

life<00:00:37.260> cycle<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> drone<00:00:38.610> brood<00:00:38.820> these<00:00:39.120> are

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
life cycle of the drone brood these are

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.630 
life cycle of the drone brood these are
drones<00:00:39.480> these<00:00:39.840> are<00:00:39.989> males<00:00:40.280> they<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.460> no

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640

there

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
there
very<00:01:35.130> interesting<00:01:35.610> shot<00:01:37.759> drones<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:39.030> their

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
very interesting shot drones on their

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.810 
very interesting shot drones on their
first<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.750> their<00:01:39.900> first<00:01:40.140> hours<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.680> life<00:01:40.829> these

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
first in their first hours of life these

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.709 
first in their first hours of life these
bees<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.390> no<00:01:42.570> stinger

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
bees have no stinger

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.830

so and on the other side the same thing

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.600 
so and on the other side the same thing
what<00:01:48.840> you'll<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.680> three<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.219> four<00:01:50.250> of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
what you'll see here is three or four of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.080 
what you'll see here is three or four of
them<00:01:50.700> they're<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:51.149> cutting<00:01:51.539> their<00:01:51.719> way<00:01:51.840> out

if I left this out in the open the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.070 
if I left this out in the open the
honeybees<00:02:01.880> from<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.240> colonies<00:02:02.690> would<00:02:02.840> come

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
honeybees from the colonies would come

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.700 
honeybees from the colonies would come
and<00:02:03.260> take<00:02:03.860> away<00:02:04.070> all<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:05.500> nectar<00:02:06.500> there's

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
and take away all of the nectar there's

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.900 
and take away all of the nectar there's
nectar<00:02:07.040> in<00:02:07.160> here<00:02:07.340> once<00:02:07.550> these<00:02:07.700> are<00:02:07.760> all
