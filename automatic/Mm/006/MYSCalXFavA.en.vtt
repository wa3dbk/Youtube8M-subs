probably<00:04:09.530> like<00:04:09.680> 16<00:04:10.250> hours<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:11.390> I'm<00:04:12.170> going<00:04:12.349> to

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
probably like 16 hours so I'm going to

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.350 
probably like 16 hours so I'm going to
let<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:12.560> go<00:04:12.739> another<00:04:13.010> day<00:04:13.340> or<00:04:13.549> two<00:04:13.579> before<00:04:14.150> I

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
let it go another day or two before I

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.420 
let it go another day or two before I
actually<00:04:14.659> snap<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.379> on<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.799> start<00:04:16.010> using<00:04:16.160> it

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
actually snap it on and start using it

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.659 
actually snap it on and start using it
because<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.510> did<00:04:17.959> use<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.739> glue<00:04:19.010> that<00:04:19.039> i<00:04:19.220> use<00:04:19.489> i

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
because it did use the glue that i use i

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.400 
because it did use the glue that i use i
think<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:19.910> recommends<00:04:20.449> something<00:04:20.750> like<00:04:20.870> 24<00:04:21.229> to

think it recommends something like 24 to
48<00:04:21.709> 48<00:04:22.100> hours<00:04:22.490> something<00:04:22.699> like<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.930> but
