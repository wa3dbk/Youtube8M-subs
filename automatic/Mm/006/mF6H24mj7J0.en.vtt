00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.900 
like that it's pretty bold and there it
is<00:02:13.000> really<00:02:14.000> pretty<00:02:14.050> cool<00:02:15.050> coral<00:02:15.680> tone<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
is really pretty cool coral tone and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.210 
is really pretty cool coral tone and
then<00:02:18.040> build<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.190> up<00:02:19.280> for<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.940> be<00:02:20.120> more<00:02:21.220> and

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
then build it up for it to be more and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.930 
then build it up for it to be more and
doing<00:02:22.459> or<00:02:22.640> even<00:02:22.940> without<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.239> mirror<00:02:24.819> but<00:02:25.819> i'll

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
doing or even without a mirror but i'll

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.650 
doing or even without a mirror but i'll
look<00:02:27.100> yeah<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.340> has<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.580> little<00:02:28.910> bit<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.269> neon

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
look yeah it has a little bit of a neon

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.100 
look yeah it has a little bit of a neon
factor<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.880> may<00:02:32.030> be<00:02:32.060> showing<00:02:32.420> up<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:32.750> kind

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
factor so it may be showing up just kind

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.509 
factor so it may be showing up just kind
of<00:02:33.200> like<00:02:33.319> a<00:02:33.410> pigmented<00:02:33.860> lip<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.280> is

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
of like a pigmented lip but it is

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.020
