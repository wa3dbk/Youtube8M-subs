00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
because there's one more test I need to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.860 
because there's one more test I need to
do<00:00:30.520> there's<00:00:31.520> not<00:00:32.090> much<00:00:32.300> point<00:00:32.570> of<00:00:32.750> me

do there's not much point of me

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.900 
do there's not much point of me
recommending<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:33.590> shelter<00:00:34.010> even<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.700> temporary

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
recommending a shelter even a temporary

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.570 
recommending a shelter even a temporary
shelter<00:00:35.440> unless<00:00:36.440> we've<00:00:36.680> tested<00:00:36.950> it<00:00:37.280> in<00:00:37.489> a

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
shelter unless we've tested it in a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
shelter unless we've tested it in a
really<00:00:37.970> good<00:00:38.390> storm

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.680 

and<00:00:43.070> they<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.220> predicted<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.880> this<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and they have predicted that this is

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.819 
and they have predicted that this is
going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:47.130> big<00:00:47.579> star

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.490 

now<00:00:54.640> we<00:00:55.090> already<00:00:55.540> know<00:00:55.750> that<00:00:55.780> these<00:00:56.170> blue

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
now we already know that these blue

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.010 
now we already know that these blue
tarps<00:00:56.920> are<00:00:57.129> completely<00:00:58.090> useless<00:00:58.329> for<00:00:58.960> a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
tarps are completely useless for a

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.150 
tarps are completely useless for a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.620 
disintegrating the polypropylene fabric
within<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.750> first<00:01:08.020> month<00:01:08.409> of<00:01:08.710> being<00:01:09.280> up<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
within the first month of being up so

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.480 
within the first month of being up so
we've<00:01:10.750> proven<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.220> what<00:01:12.340> we're<00:01:12.460> doing

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
we've proven that so what we're doing

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.370 
we've proven that so what we're doing
today<00:01:12.790> is<00:01:13.210> we're<00:01:13.420> going<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.659> prove<00:01:13.960> whether<00:01:14.259> or

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
today is we're going to prove whether or

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.870 
today is we're going to prove whether or
not<00:01:14.500> it's<00:01:14.830> any<00:01:14.979> good<00:01:15.220> for<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.460> temporary

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
not it's any good for a temporary

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.960 
not it's any good for a temporary
shelter<00:01:16.770> we've<00:01:17.770> got<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:17.979> thunderstorm<00:01:18.340> warning

in effect high winds and possibly even

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.389 
in effect high winds and possibly even
hail<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:23.500> looks<00:01:23.680> like<00:01:23.740> it's<00:01:24.009> gonna<00:01:24.190> hit<00:01:24.369> a

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
hail and it looks like it's gonna hit a

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.300 
hail and it looks like it's gonna hit a
square<00:01:24.790> on<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.899> it<00:01:26.050> will<00:01:26.140> be<00:01:26.350> one<00:01:26.740> excellent

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
square on and it will be one excellent

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.219 
square on and it will be one excellent
test<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.670> see<00:01:27.850> first<00:01:28.330> if<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.690> shelter<00:01:29.050> will

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
test to see first if the shelter will

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.609 
test to see first if the shelter will
stay<00:01:29.470> up<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:29.940> second<00:01:30.940> if<00:01:31.420> blue<00:01:31.660> tarps<00:01:32.050> are

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
stay up and second if blue tarps are

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.330 
stay up and second if blue tarps are
useful<00:01:33.130> for<00:01:33.280> even<00:01:33.640> a<00:01:33.789> temporary<00:01:34.179> shelter

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.399

would put it deep in the woods where
you'd<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:24.930> protection<00:03:26.360> what<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.390> really<00:03:27.690> want

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
you'd have protection what I really want

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.840 
you'd have protection what I really want
to<00:03:27.900> do<00:03:28.050> though<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.260> find<00:03:28.620> out<00:03:28.800> if<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.400> shelter

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
to do though is find out if the shelter

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.640 
to do though is find out if the shelter
frame<00:03:30.330> itself<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.650> good<00:03:31.860> design<00:03:33.410> it's<00:03:34.410> still

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
frame itself is a good design it's still

00:03:34.650 --> 00:04:12.030 
frame itself is a good design it's still
up<00:03:34.770> after<00:03:35.100> this<00:03:35.220> wind<00:03:35.520> I'll<00:03:36.390> be<00:03:36.570> impressed

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.449 

well<00:04:12.610> what<00:04:12.849> we<00:04:13.000> learn<00:04:13.209> from<00:04:13.420> this<00:04:14.459> obviously

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
well what we learn from this obviously

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.330 
well what we learn from this obviously
the<00:04:15.610> shelter<00:04:16.030> design<00:04:16.419> is<00:04:16.660> good<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.829> stayed<00:04:18.160> up

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
the shelter design is good it stayed up

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.060 
the shelter design is good it stayed up
in<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.549> wind<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:19.000> hasn't<00:04:19.269> been<00:04:19.329> blown<00:04:19.540> over

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
in the wind it hasn't been blown over

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.620 
in the wind it hasn't been blown over
but<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.130> think<00:04:21.400> we<00:04:21.519> can<00:04:21.699> conclude<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.210> these

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
but I think we can conclude that these

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.890 
but I think we can conclude that these
polypropylene<00:04:23.470> blue<00:04:23.949> tarps<00:04:24.389> are<00:04:25.389> completely

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
polypropylene blue tarps are completely

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.860 
polypropylene blue tarps are completely
useless<00:04:26.699> even<00:04:27.699> for<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> short-term<00:04:28.270> shelter

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
useless even for a short-term shelter

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.100 
useless even for a short-term shelter
like<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.340> plus<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.550> course<00:04:30.720> we<00:04:31.720> didn't<00:04:31.930> want

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
like this plus of course we didn't want

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.620 
like this plus of course we didn't want
it<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.260> provide<00:04:32.650> shelter<00:04:33.479> thanks<00:04:34.479> for

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
it to provide shelter thanks for

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.050 
it to provide shelter thanks for
watching
