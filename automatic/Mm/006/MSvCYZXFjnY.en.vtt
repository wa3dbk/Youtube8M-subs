00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hello in this video I want the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.740
 kettle wk 33 64 from the company 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.170
 briefly introduce severin 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.269
 since september 2011 on the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.700
 market currently costs about 20 euros 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.990
 has a capitalization of 15 liters 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.470
 So there's quite a lot here 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.410
 has a capacity of 1800 watts 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.930
 according to manufacturer information and yes in the test 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.730
 he did quite well too 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.800
 At Amazon very good customer review 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.800
 with 4 4 out of 5 stars 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.540
 short to the functionality there you have 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.730
 this cover you can open 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.940
 Here you can see this inside 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.300
 Stainless steel reserves ratio has none 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 filter for very hard water where 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.920
 Can not form lime flakes 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.410
 definitely the ideal kettle but 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.469
 otherwise a good device turned on 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.789
 he will be here at this toggle then 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.020
 you have a nice front here too 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.460
 You can always see company lights 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.149
 whether he is running or not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.160
 important in that he is himself 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.379
 already warmed up here on the outside 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 it good to know that he is on 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.470
 handle is easy to handle 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.119
 there are no problems otherwise 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.960
 is it so that he is here in operation like 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.549
 one sees here about 1750 watt decreases 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.400
 the whole thing causes him to be a liter 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.780
 water in three minutes 22 to cook 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.130
 bring it is a very good value 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.290
 there is something here 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.509
 less powerful water cookers too 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.180
 Devices that take over five minutes need 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.340
 and otherwise has one 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.500
 Noise decay of 61 decibels in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.970
 the tip of the something more than natural 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.880
 with devices the less achievement 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.899
 produce but you also hear in the video 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.780
 you can also do that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.549
 to chat 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.460
 otherwise what is missing here a bit 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.590
 is such a transparent and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.140
 transparent view window into the interior 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.140
 I think that's true inside 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.119
 you probably do not see it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.990
 here you can see one down there 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.369
 scale 1 liter 1 5 liters and 0 5 liters where 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.380
 you measure the water a bit 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.310
 but you can unfortunately see from the outside 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.110
 not at all 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.300
 how high the water level is then must 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.770
 you always have a look, but that is also 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.470
 actually the only drawback on the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.080
 kettle is wireless you have it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.970
 also seen for 20 euros a good 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.690
 water corinna good services good 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.080
 comprehensiveness and a total of one 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.790
 also very good feel 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.410
 thank you for watching i hope you 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.989
 could have a few simple interesting ones 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.910
 gain information from this video 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.349
 In my opinion , this is a very good one 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.870
 kettle you can get 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.670
 nickel can and is for 20 euros 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.280
 so in the middle price the lower one 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.280
 Price range also recommended
