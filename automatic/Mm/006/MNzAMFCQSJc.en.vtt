00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.540
 valmir 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.390
 It's good that depending on the sheik, there's a 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.100
 and xx in this question but depending on the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.949
 sheik if you have a composition 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.230
 appropriate nutritional 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.000
 perfectly be used in the long run 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.000
 we'll show you how then why the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.489
 people have here at our table exactly 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 the meals we make during the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.719
 22 hours at four o'clock right 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 taking the time we spend 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.090
 sleeping we have breakfast 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.899
 here a French bread wants a cold joint 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.899
 with an apple and milk we have the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.750
 we have dinner and we have the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.149
 snacks intervals né 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.680
 How could we do here? 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.649
 let's suppose I want to replace 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.160
 some of these main meals by 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.589
 sheik okay okay provided that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.260
 sheik with a good composition he can 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.330
 enter for example here at lunch then 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.950
 I'll give you lunch that's a sheikh with 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.350
 a good composition 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.020
 it has substances in its composition 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.360
 for example some are made with the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 goal of satiety 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.799
 then the person takes it to stay 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.659
 met for several hours if not 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.460
 It's a good idea to drink tea from here. 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.200
 a time he took a bite was 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 I 'm not going to have lunch, I will not have a cup. 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 Here, I'll thank you, then you'll see. 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.530
 Thank you, thank you. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.799
 indicates this doctor the son of the sheik is 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.790
 Caloric is also and the great charm of 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.070
 sheik is that he is full and has little 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.990
 nutritional point of view and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.560
 it has far fewer calories than one 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.390
 meal is an easy way to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.369
 replace a meal for people 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.649
 I want to lose weight, I think 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.299
 interesting but I can decide by 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.219
 My own account this I have to 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.110
 consult a doctor I do not think 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.780
 big problem on its own if 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.450
 decided it's not me, I do not know that it's clear that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.209
 It has a direction of a physician or 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.430
 nutritionist because he tends to use a 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.470
 most correct way will stay 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.300
 enthusiastic to exchange today too 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.610
 By the sheik exchange lunch and dinner 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.290
 sheik has trouble changing a 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.600
 second reflection rogge 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.620
 you know that for those very people 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.680
 obese 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.370
 one of the treatments that is done is to do 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.340
 for a few weeks a diet with 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.410
 the sheiks and it's not the end of the world and now 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.540
 doctor I am of those people that I 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.760
 I need to eat something at dinner. 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.250
 really just this way I love to eat some 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.130
 I can change the coffee at dinner. 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.709
 the sheikh can and it works a lot 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.780
 well because there are just people who do not 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.480
 Can not eat anything for breakfast 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.209
 have a bad habit of skipping this meal 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.940
 and only ate at lunch so if the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.250
 people use a sheik to the person they already have 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.070
 a first meal and this may help 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.440
 low is also to develop if it has 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.690
 and it's good that the person does not 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.790
 take a very long time exactly 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.680
 research shows that if the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.230
 fist person breakfast does not eat anything 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.760
 she spends less energy throughout the day 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.240
 itaú will have more difficulty in 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.240
 lose weight
