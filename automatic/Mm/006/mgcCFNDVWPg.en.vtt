00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.789
 he estimated 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.019
 and good you have a lot that has united us to offer channel 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.130
 - a very simple video very short a basic 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.320
 again showed as a good sign an access 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.210
 remote 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.630
 for a terminal 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.119
 or for a computer 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.380
 that is in the network 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.910
 external 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.460
 for this to work obviously have Kirchner access to the pep in that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.190
 of these computer or this server that they try to access 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.499
 and they must have 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:47.050
 permission to access or become a user and password otherwise 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.990
 they will not be able to connect 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.300
 first of all let's open 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.440
 the menu for sale to run windows + percent 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.810
 and we are going to put 126 thousand 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.400
 yes that means 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.010
 microsoft 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.980
 they are months 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.400
 clarion 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.080
 iy is a winter they are called like that but if the name was left 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.100
 and this basically that side 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.120
 in English it's the same context merchants access 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.550
 we have all the titles 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.150
 and still sadar accept 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.390
 not in this case as I have already been rowing theme my computer 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.260
 Well well she is not recorded and twente map is like that 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.680
 without giving information 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.030
 what you have to do here 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.360
 as a team, they are going to put fertilizer 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.890
 let me put you balotelli that puts the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.260
 the ip address 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.730
 of the server was the computer that deals with the love that makes 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.410
 that case that's the idea of ​​my computer and work 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.270
 I am no longer connected to an independent 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.980
 miami and withdrawal 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.260
 if they must connect 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.220
 will try to rowing that does but will not establish the connection 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 because I'm not connected to the same local network 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.980
 good as you can see my and that could not be traced 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.490
 this to say told me my 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 private 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.639
 keiko when already commented my 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.979
 local adam in my work 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:24.919
 what I was symbol to try 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.229
 also there was a thousand desk of my work 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.589
 I'm like and so against a phoenix I will give direct access 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.229
 and let's see what happens 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.259
 Marxism 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.059
 what says that sum 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.739
 private connection 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.739
 in total to some because 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.499
 -pm access information jo 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.499
 and I'm going to put your liu function and go 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.040
 will begin to charge 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.040
 my desk 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.209
 although the cliche ston 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.399
 If I want and I can get you 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:10.059
 when checking with 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.799
 maybe they never missed work 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.319
 and well if who to see you I will try water and there were indications of 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.219
 the gay collective 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.219
 in one of the domains quintín soriano 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.779
 this later also put together videos of him 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.749
 explains moody's basic things 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.009
 of the directory 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.009
 this icon good this year 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:11.839
 very thankful 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.259
 and I'm going to go out again 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.279
 now to not have to be doing this all the time 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.260
 what we have in life 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.550
 and is that it does not suffer a direct access to be able to quickly assess 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.699
 to a computer there was 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:42.689
 criminal 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.330
 speck 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.300
 touch and to do that what we have to do is that it still comes out 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.270
 right click anywhere 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.949
 they are not new 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.949
 we are not irak shortcut 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.039
 to put the following 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.039
 let's put m 27 s 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.169
 x 100 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.130
 mancuso 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.180
 efe - lights 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.729
 with advertising 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.219
 a space 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:13.849
 one with a diagonal 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.849
 pons or eat I asked him what 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.330
 that's the name of the server that a Japanese can also put the jou 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.010
 spain ' 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.120
 Hello with Haiti I put hyperinflation 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.710
 practical 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.419
 he married bent goals 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.419
 work computer 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.180
 we put photo space 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.439
 diagonal again 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.860
 suppose a double together points 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.170
 sweetens witch 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.000
 what is the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.229
 how wide we want it to be our 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:46.539
 remote access 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.809
 married my computer that I have my house accept me my 80 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:55.020
 and there was no harm 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.300
 double point is reading 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.539
 he married on computer he takes height of 800 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.369
 we would go to the incipient 

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:06.379
 and then it's against this we're kind of 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.839
 and could finish 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:17.180
 so double click here you can see that I already believe 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.070
 a 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.789
 direct access to the center as the terminal 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.240
 or that case my work computer 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.520
 and they go to icon properties 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.800
 you can see that the 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.100
 automatically 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.969
 stihl destination 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:31.530
 it's already made for him 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.740
 the remote access executable 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.059
 well let's try it if a double click on me and as 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.699
 will begin to tell lies lies 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.050
 and there they have it 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.050
 directly took me the screen of e 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.199
 well you are watching right now that you have 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.490
 if they ask me 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.490
 I'm hardly going to put my password 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.449
 and that would be all 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.940
 much easier and much more practical and much faster to be able to access 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:01.949
 remotely to a terminal 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.080
 A server 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.819
 The study did not militate computers 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:10.520
 and that would be a whole country finally the ing 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.520
 is for them to see synthetic europe that they are what they do 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.080
 to a computer 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.110
 It is true 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.210
 within a network 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.759
 private to which we obviously do not have access for this to eat is difficult 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:25.439
 have access to the detainee 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:27.550
 of this is not that computer 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.400
 and as 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.270
 I'm not everyone but this one 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.449
 small has as a second direct access to a terminal 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:35.889
 to a server played a computer 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:36.960
 this topic 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.529
 that has been useful and 

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:41.699
 and this and well if you have any questions 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.699
 Leave me a comment or saw how I have time 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:47.470
 stoch something they take care
