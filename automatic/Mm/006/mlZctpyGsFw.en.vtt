00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:29.640
 I become I am going I am going I am going I am going to have you 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.859
 they don't need them 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.859
 but stimulus 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.719
 your hands and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.120
 we are not going to tell you because of it 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.320
 first good to him I already have it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.899
 done 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:55.550
 night we start braiding makes you 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:55.550
 does is pick you first choose air spring 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.980
 so deep 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.479
 you divide that pluck into three equal 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.479
 pieces 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.570
 2 and 3 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.160
 we see there is doing you start with 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.479
 fight 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.820
 you just go a bit normal 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.820
 rights one two 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.590
 what you do is you grab this place now 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.660
 get over this and put those three together 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.640
 with this club so you can pick two 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.800
 gets 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.470
 well now we are going to take a kind step 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.640
 repeated until the end 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:53.350
 you pick up about what you do then 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:58.330
 you go 3 times bad is a 2 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.330
 and three and you do it together again 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.479
 you repeat it all the way to the end 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.479
 I'll do it again 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.530
 you grab such a place again 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.610
 one two Three 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.570
 I myself think Mary can be worse 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.570
 an ornate and environment 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.390
 a spray 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.390
 3 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.610
 I repeat this completely too 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.650
 disappear and I can go pretty well on my way 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.350
 starts to look like kids 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:58.200
 I'm just continuing with that now 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.200
 so steps one two three 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.780
 in hemmelder end 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:32.930
 therefore also makes 10 million 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:38.180
 every step 1 2 3 only now do the 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.560
 not with but you just braid on to 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.560
 down as far as you like 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.040
 I like it so long I sit I do 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.040
 how mystical you are 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.299
 and now I just do it for myself 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.160
 and the last time I do it again 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.160
 double through 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.900
 I certainly think so 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.890
 and I am very lucky 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:02.020
 watch it again on my own channel
