00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
because you're going to be folding the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.130 
because you're going to be folding the
top<00:01:48.050> of<00:01:48.230> the<00:01:48.290> skirt<00:01:48.590> over

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.990 

take<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.260> fabric<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.860> slip<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> inside<00:01:56.850> out

take the fabric and slip it inside out

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.359 
take the fabric and slip it inside out
place<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:57.960> elastic<00:01:58.440> around<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> top<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.130> the

place your elastic around the top of the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.790 
place your elastic around the top of the
maxi<00:01:59.729> skirt<00:01:59.760> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.780> fold<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.260> edges<00:02:01.409> over

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the elastic at this point I'd really

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.490 
the elastic at this point I'd really
suggest<00:02:09.090> pinning<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> skirt<00:02:10.110> with<00:02:10.350> either

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
suggest pinning the skirt with either

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.220 
suggest pinning the skirt with either
safety<00:02:11.039> pins<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.610> clothing<00:02:12.000> pins<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.630> then

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
safety pins or clothing pins and then

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.930 
safety pins or clothing pins and then
holding<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.770> up<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.890> your<00:02:14.100> body<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.610> make<00:02:14.790> sure

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
holding it up to your body to make sure

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.270 
holding it up to your body to make sure
you're<00:02:15.120> okay<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.780> length<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.920> clothing

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
you're okay with the length the clothing

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.650 
you're okay with the length the clothing
pins<00:02:17.430> will<00:02:17.670> also<00:02:17.910> really<00:02:18.239> help<00:02:18.420> keep

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
pins will also really help keep

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.330 
pins will also really help keep
everything<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.320> place<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.950> next<00:02:20.069> step

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
everything in place for the next step

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.650 
everything in place for the next step
this<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.520> what<00:02:23.700> I'm<00:02:23.820> using<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.330> bomb<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
this is what I'm using to bomb the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.570 
this is what I'm using to bomb the
fabric<00:02:24.959> together<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.100> basically<00:02:26.459> like

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
fabric together this is basically like

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.850 
fabric together this is basically like
