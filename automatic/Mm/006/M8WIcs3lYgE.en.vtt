are going to be talking about what is in
my<00:00:08.340> opinion<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.820> single<00:00:09.540> best<00:00:09.719> piece<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.260> gear

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
my opinion the single best piece of gear

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.730 
my opinion the single best piece of gear
in<00:00:10.820> bioshock<00:00:11.820> infinity<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:13.320> let's<00:00:13.440> get<00:00:13.590> right

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
in bioshock infinity so let's get right

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.359 
in bioshock infinity so let's get right
to<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.360> in<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.509> opinion<00:00:15.780> spectral<00:00:16.560> sidekick<00:00:17.100> is

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
to it in my opinion spectral sidekick is

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.880 
to it in my opinion spectral sidekick is
the<00:00:18.150> best<00:00:18.359> piece<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.869> gear<00:00:19.140> what<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.039> does<00:00:20.250> is

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
the best piece of gear what it does is

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.470 
the best piece of gear what it does is
dropping<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.980> weapon<00:00:23.340> creates<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.760> ghostly<00:00:24.090> Ally

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
dropping a weapon creates a ghostly Ally

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.839 
dropping a weapon creates a ghostly Ally
for<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.779> few<00:00:24.990> seconds<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:26.640> know<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> few

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
for a few seconds and you know a few

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.689 
for a few seconds and you know a few
seconds<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.480> about<00:00:27.630> 10<00:00:28.050> seconds<00:00:28.699> haven't

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
seconds is about 10 seconds haven't

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.680 
seconds is about 10 seconds haven't
timed<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> or<00:00:30.179> anything<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:33.239> reason<00:00:33.570> it's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
timed it or anything but the reason it's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.810 
timed it or anything but the reason it's
so<00:00:33.930> good<00:00:34.670> is<00:00:35.840> because<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.079> allows<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
so good is because it allows you to

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.459 
so good is because it allows you to
basically<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:39.420> own<00:00:40.790> your<00:00:41.790> own<00:00:41.820> turret

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
basically have your own your own turret

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.110 
basically have your own your own turret
essentially<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.460> I'll<00:00:44.610> show<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> real

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
essentially so I'll show you real

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.170 
essentially so I'll show you real
quickly<00:00:45.739> we're<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.340> command<00:00:47.670> ship<00:00:47.879> on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
quickly we're on the command ship on

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.020 
quickly we're on the command ship on
easy<00:00:48.899> difficulty<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.399> basically<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.940> it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
easy difficulty so basically what it

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.020 
easy difficulty so basically what it
does<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.469> pick<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.860> weapon<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
does so if you pick up a weapon the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.459 
does so if you pick up a weapon the
weapon<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.719> dropped<00:00:55.399> becomes<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
weapon that you just dropped becomes a

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.260 
weapon that you just dropped becomes a
turret<00:00:58.469> more<00:00:58.739> or<00:00:58.829> less<00:00:59.010> doesn't<00:00:59.969> take<00:01:00.090> any

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
turret more or less doesn't take any

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.030 
turret more or less doesn't take any
damage<00:01:01.070> it's<00:01:02.070> extremely<00:01:02.670> accurate<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.040> so

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
damage it's extremely accurate and so

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.859 
damage it's extremely accurate and so
you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> volley<00:01:05.880> gun<00:01:06.180> it's

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you can see what the volley gun it's

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.660 
you can see what the volley gun it's
just<00:01:06.990> devastating<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.100> that's<00:01:08.220> actually<00:01:08.460> my

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
just devastating and that's actually my

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.690 
just devastating and that's actually my
preferred<00:01:09.210> weapon<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> use<00:01:10.340> because<00:01:11.340> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
preferred weapon to use because it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.920 
preferred weapon to use because it
shoots<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.450> much<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:14.100> no<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.930> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
shoots out so much and no and so you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.240 
shoots out so much and no and so you
know<00:01:16.049> as<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.560> after<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:16.950> 10

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
know as you can see after about 10

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
know as you can see after about 10
seconds<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.790> dropped<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.439> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
seconds it dropped all you have to do is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.100 
seconds it dropped all you have to do is
pick<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.009> again<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.509> then<00:01:21.509> replace<00:01:22.080> it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
pick it up again and then replace it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.090 
pick it up again and then replace it
with<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> type<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> gun<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> want<00:01:24.259> now<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
with a type of gun you want now the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.280 
with a type of gun you want now the
reason<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.850> useful<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.990> hard

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
reason this is so useful is in in hard

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.600 
reason this is so useful is in in hard
mode<00:01:28.530> you're<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.250> doing<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> lot<00:01:29.549> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
mode you're going to be doing a lot of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.149 
mode you're going to be doing a lot of
ducking<00:01:30.060> behind<00:01:30.180> cover<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.770> this<00:01:31.770> guy<00:01:31.979> will

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
ducking behind cover and this guy will

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.920 
ducking behind cover and this guy will
still<00:01:32.400> be<00:01:32.520> continuing<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.090> shoot<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.810> know

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
still be continuing to shoot you know

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.440 
still be continuing to shoot you know
enemies<00:01:34.290> while<00:01:34.890> you're<00:01:35.130> behind<00:01:35.340> cover<00:01:35.759> then

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
enemies while you're behind cover then

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
enemies while you're behind cover then
if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.689> need<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> recharge<00:01:37.350> them<00:01:38.210> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
if you just need to recharge them you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
if you just need to recharge them you
just<00:01:39.390> hit<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.439> trade<00:01:40.799> weapon

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
just hit the you know trade weapon

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460 
just hit the you know trade weapon
button<00:01:41.400> twice<00:01:41.659> if<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> need<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.020> move<00:01:43.200> him<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
button twice if you need to move him you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.690 
button twice if you need to move him you
just<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.950> backup<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:47.009> I'll<00:01:47.280> kind<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.549> move

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
just kind of backup so I'll kind of move

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.920 
just kind of backup so I'll kind of move
them<00:01:47.759> over<00:01:48.000> here

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.260 

and<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.100> kind<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.369> use<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.579> process<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
and you just kind of use this process to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.889 
and you just kind of use this process to
move<00:01:54.680> now<00:01:55.680> volley<00:01:56.399> gun<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.180> said<00:01:57.390> earlier<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
move now volley gun as I said earlier is

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.130 
move now volley gun as I said earlier is
probably<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.450> the<00:02:00.450> gun<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.840> choice<00:02:01.110> just

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
probably the the gun of choice just

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.889 
probably the the gun of choice just
because<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.890> lays<00:02:02.100> down<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.700> much<00:02:02.850> fire<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
because it lays down so much fire and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.940 
because it lays down so much fire and
you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.409> actually<00:02:04.799> really

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you can see it's actually really

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590 
you can see it's actually really
accurate<00:02:05.490> against<00:02:05.700> moving<00:02:05.939> targets<00:02:06.090> like

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
accurate against moving targets like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.589 
accurate against moving targets like
that<00:02:07.009> it's<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.220> absolutely<00:02:08.789> devastating

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that it's just absolutely devastating

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.660 
that it's just absolutely devastating
and<00:02:09.780> then

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
and then

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.229 
and then

trade<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.739> out<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:29.360> just<00:02:29.480> make<00:02:29.660> sure<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.930> have

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
trade it out you just make sure you have

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.020 
trade it out you just make sure you have
your<00:02:30.260> volley<00:02:30.860> gun<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:34.640> know<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.819> can

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
your volley gun and you know you can

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.729 
your volley gun and you know you can
bring<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.360> over<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.720> different<00:02:35.930> area<00:02:36.500> so

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
bring it over to a different area so

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.229 
bring it over to a different area so
like<00:02:37.130> let's<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:37.459> say<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.760> want<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.030> go<00:02:38.120> up

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
like let's just say you want to go up

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:48.009 
like let's just say you want to go up
high<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:46.580> know<00:02:46.670> come<00:02:46.910> up<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> high<00:02:47.300> vantage

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
high you know come up to a high vantage

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.640 
high you know come up to a high vantage
point<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:49.700> find<00:02:49.910> someplace<00:02:50.209> that<00:02:50.660> has<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.840> you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
point just find someplace that has a you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.610 
point just find someplace that has a you
know<00:02:51.680> weapon<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.370> trade<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:54.350> kind<00:02:54.560> of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
know weapon to trade and just kind of

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:03.670 
know weapon to trade and just kind of
move<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:54.860> over<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:02.260> it's<00:03:03.260> not<00:03:03.380> really<00:03:03.650> that

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
move it over so it's not really that

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.320 
move it over so it's not really that
many<00:03:03.860> enemies<00:03:04.220> because<00:03:04.489> it's<00:03:04.640> destroyed<00:03:05.150> all

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
many enemies because it's destroyed all

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.479 
many enemies because it's destroyed all
of<00:03:05.480> them<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:08.530> now<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.590> only<00:03:09.799> downside<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.250> if

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
of them but now the only downside is if

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.940 
of them but now the only downside is if
you<00:03:10.610> don't<00:03:10.850> have<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> good<00:03:11.360> volley<00:03:11.660> gun<00:03:11.950> like

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
you don't have a good volley gun like

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.830 
you don't have a good volley gun like
let's<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:13.310> say<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.489> use<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:13.850> revolver<00:03:14.510> or

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
let's just say you use the revolver or

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.770 
let's just say you use the revolver or
the<00:03:14.959> hand<00:03:15.320> cannon<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:16.730> just<00:03:17.060> isn't<00:03:17.359> near<00:03:17.750> as

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
the hand cannon it just isn't near as

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.710 
the hand cannon it just isn't near as
good<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.820> mean<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.910> feel<00:03:20.120> fine<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.540> volley

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
good I mean I feel fine that the volley

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.630 
good I mean I feel fine that the volley
gun<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.079> actually<00:03:21.440> probably<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.769> best<00:03:22.160> weapon

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
gun is actually probably the best weapon

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.280 
gun is actually probably the best weapon
to<00:03:22.670> use<00:03:22.970> with<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.390> because<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:24.049> lays

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
to use with this because it just lays

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.520 
to use with this because it just lays
down<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:24.859> much<00:03:25.070> fire<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:27.049> best<00:03:27.230> part<00:03:27.470> of

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
down so much fire and the best part of

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.520 
down so much fire and the best part of
all<00:03:27.680> is<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.940> doesn't<00:03:29.269> use<00:03:29.570> any<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.870> your<00:03:30.140> ammo

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
all is it doesn't use any of your ammo

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.890 
all is it doesn't use any of your ammo
so<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:31.910> is<00:03:31.970> actually<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.480> Hale<00:03:32.630> fire

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
so and this is actually the Hale fire

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.150 
so and this is actually the Hale fire
it's<00:03:33.140> almost<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.500> same<00:03:33.620> thing<00:03:33.680> as<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.010> volley

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
it's almost the same thing as the volley

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.000 
it's almost the same thing as the volley
gun<00:03:34.340> but<00:03:35.140> so<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.200> know<00:03:36.260> eight<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.620> seven

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
gun but so you know eight of seven

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.550 
gun but so you know eight of seven
that's<00:03:37.340> how<00:03:37.519> much<00:03:37.640> ham<00:03:37.790> I'll<00:03:37.940> have<00:03:38.410> I'll<00:03:39.410> let

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
that's how much ham I'll have I'll let

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.009 
that's how much ham I'll have I'll let
it<00:03:39.590> shoot<00:03:39.799> a<00:03:39.890> couple<00:03:40.160> times<00:03:40.660> if<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.810> ever<00:03:41.959> will

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
it shoot a couple times if it ever will

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:50.830 
it shoot a couple times if it ever will
it's<00:03:45.019> really<00:03:45.350> no<00:03:45.470> enemies<00:03:45.799> around

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.830 

and<00:03:51.700> essentially<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.790> uses<00:03:52.880> no<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.420> though<00:03:53.600> so

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
and essentially it uses no and though so

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.330 
and essentially it uses no and though so
anyways<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.319> next<00:03:57.560> video<00:03:57.770> I'll<00:03:57.890> be<00:03:57.920> making

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
anyways in the next video I'll be making

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.830 
anyways in the next video I'll be making
I'll<00:03:58.430> show<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.670> how<00:03:58.819> to<00:03:58.880> use<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.420> strategy

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
I'll show you how to use this strategy

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.940 
I'll show you how to use this strategy
to<00:04:01.450> beat<00:04:02.450> this<00:04:02.690> command<00:04:03.170> deck<00:04:03.410> on<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.740> Hard

difficulty<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:04.730> could<00:04:04.880> even<00:04:05.000> use<00:04:05.240> it<00:04:05.270> on

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
difficulty and you could even use it on

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.350 
difficulty and you could even use it on
1999<00:04:06.290> mode<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:08.000> that's<00:04:08.510> it<00:04:08.840> thanks
