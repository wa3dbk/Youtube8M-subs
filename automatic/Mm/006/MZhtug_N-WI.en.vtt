00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.360 
continue to flowering what I do is I
snip<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> top<00:02:09.840> off<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:11.640> forces

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.009 

the<00:02:14.579> energy<00:02:14.939> to<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.209> other<00:02:15.359> leaves<00:02:15.659> making

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
the energy to the other leaves making

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.360 
the energy to the other leaves making
them<00:02:16.200> bigger<00:02:16.409> and<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:18.060> get<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> stronger<00:02:18.870> stock

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
them bigger and I get a stronger stock

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.630 
them bigger and I get a stronger stock
but<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.790> flowers<00:02:21.150> don't<00:02:21.420> come<00:02:21.810> up<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:22.650> that's

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
but the flowers don't come up so that's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.109 
but the flowers don't come up so that's
how<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.849> prolong<00:02:24.299> your<00:02:24.359> Thai<00:02:24.900> basil
