00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.520
 Hi, everyone, it's good to play Ana Maria today. 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.620
 will you teach you how to make a recipe? 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.480
 supersimples which is a dessert that 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.460
 Can you do for your Sunday in? 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.610
 family or with a day that you have 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.699
 home visits where I do not give myself 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.490
 You got it, but you do not want to have it. 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.859
 a very big dollar in turkey and is a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.380
 recipe that I started from small 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.859
 My grandmother's recipe and I always ate 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.500
 This candy in the nucleus aphasias Sunday in 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.860
 cocal and even a monkey nothing nobody talks about 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.680
 her and she did I thought ours was 12 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:47.670
 our lady 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:52.050
 whole making that sweet grandma of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.579
 Strawberry with Mary and me when she 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.710
 explained the step by step to this 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.160
 Playing with me, that 's all. 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.629
 It's just because I think it 's a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.729
 very difficult thing 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.250
 Okay, so we're going to resent it. 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.260
 You'll see how easy it is to do 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.180
 To start, we'll get the canister. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.570
 that we have used the size if 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.299
 It depends on whether you want to serve this 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.180
 quietly for three people until 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.850
 four people or two vans and I like 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.340
 too sweet to repeat then 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.750
 you will add washed strawberries and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.500
 chopped 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.829
 are small pieces making a layer 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.759
 of strawberries has not spread a layer 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.729
 Sigh , you destroy it, it's in your hand. 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.329
 and also spreads throughout the bowl 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.820
 do not spread well make a layer well 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.479
 stuffed strawberry with sigh 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.479
 broken 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.930
 And you'll see how pretty it is very much. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.780
 simple to do 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.820
 you can the amount you can use 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.910
 As you wish you can abuse speed 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.880
 per year said spiro does not have a 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.649
 exact amount to beat the olhÃ´metro 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.929
 it goes of your taste 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.970
 I used more or less a box full of 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.370
 strawberry and a sigh packet and now the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.340
 People put on the whipped cream I'm wearing 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.620
 the xanthi spray line ready and doing 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.170
 an inner layer spreading with space 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.740
 to feel if you do not want to rock 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.140
 Ready, you can chat in the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.560
 mixer does not support that whipped cream 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.830
 click on it with a bottle of that 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.340
 I get sugar spoon and sugar 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.020
 until you reach the point of whipped cream and then 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.140
 You use the same way but until 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.940
 stadium is ready with spray and does 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.090
 a layer of whipped cream after another 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.970
 layer of strawberry with a sigh will be 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.650
 well actually depending on the bowl you 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.860
 you choose whether you can do as many 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.610
 layers you have and it's important 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.920
 put enough chance and made up a 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.239
 drawing to look good like that in 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.340
 edges and whipped cream and still to spruce 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.940
 I got a strawberry 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.330
 cut in a more cute way 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.670
 because in three models silver already my sweet 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.790
 decorated and there is only serve 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.500
 you can either serve directly or leave a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.050
 little in the refrigerator that in the refrigerator he 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.730
 will give a pull of shanxi but then 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.090
 it's just you add a little more 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.700
 to be very nice people super simple 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.959
 and common ice cream saw how easy it is but it is 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.310
 almost impossible 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.260
 only one thing I never had 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.209
 I thought and it was very tasty 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.550
 it's not worth trying it's worth it 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.950
 make desserts the first to head 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.780
 trust was so easy to expect a 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.800
 in good condition until the next video 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.800
 Kiss bye
