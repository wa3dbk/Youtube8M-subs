00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.020
Alright ! Today, I'll shoot at will !

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.640
I'm talking to the retards who would do anything in the pit !

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.740
Dude, THIS is metal ! We do what we want, we're rock and roll !

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.940
Man, I don't know, but if you're going to the opera for example, you have to try to fit in !

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.380
You can't start stage diving right through the front row ! Same goes for metal !

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.880
For a long time, I've been sick of fata**es slamming during ballads, or the a**holes shouting tacky s*** between two songs...

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.140
But I think my tolerance threshold has been surpassed this year !

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.580
I saw bunnies going in a conga during Impiety...

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.280
...little dips***s happily moshing like in a ska concert, when it was a Windir gig...

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.580
....Dudes slamming like pigs during the Opeth set...

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.020
S*** ! (x3)

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.220
Yes, this was at Hellfest.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.800
No wonder anyways since I've heard shit like...

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.240
(rough fangirl imitation) Oh, you went at Hellfest ?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.640
Oh my god, I just couldn't decide between Solidays and Hellfest... Hellfest looks so rock and roll...

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.840
Oh rly you were at Hellfest too ? I was there with my friends...

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.160
We were the glitter girls, we were throwing glitter all over the crowd ! *laugh*

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.020
Anyways, let's start off with those dumb kids who can't stop doing karate in the pit !

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.380
If you get your kneecaps broken one day, you better not cry like a bitch !

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.420
In reality, you're pissed about your small penis ?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.680
Isn't it ?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.880
If you're in a beatdown hardcore gig, you have the right to punch the guys next to you, that's the point !

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.360
But the guys wearing Emmure shorts or Terror sweatshirts who think they're badass because they mosh on anything...

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.860
*infuriated scream*

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.300
Most of the time, during opening slots of metalcore, hardcore or deathcore bands,...

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.100
...when the pit is still a bit shy...

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.460
He likes to show that he is the law in the pit, by throwing pinwheels into the little guys' faces on the sides !

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.600
He is as stupid as he looks anyways...

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.920
(hardcore kid imitation) Hey do you know Providence ?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.220
(stutters) Hey ! Punch ! Punch'em in the face !

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.080
*keeps stuttering*

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.720
I just punched his face !

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.820
And in the same kind, but even more retarded, you've got this.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.760
These guys...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.820
They're the garbage of metal. I'm not even sure they're aware of what they do.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.900
*cringeworthy hardcore dancing*

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.060
How can they explain this to their kids ?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.600
*more hardcore dancing, but this time on a more fitting song*

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.800
In the pit, you have the non-metalhead guy who wants to have a good time.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.680
That one just left his workplace and got brought here by a friend.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.240
Come on ! Go with me, Jean-Christophe. It's not that mindless, you'll see !

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.940
However he's drunk after two mojitos...

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.400
What did you expect ? Jean-Christophe doesn't drink beer !

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.020
(drunk) Yeah... Hard rock ! Let's get'em moving ! Metal !

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640
Man, this is funeral doom !

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.140
You show me how to slam ? Never did that...

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.020
I don't say that you need to behave in a pit !

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.080
You just have to avoid being a huge son of a b**** !

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.800
Because, one other kind of a**hole are these posers that stay in the front row during death metal shows...

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.240
...then start crying like bitches once the guys behind them move too much !

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.520
Yeah ! (2x)

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.600
In fact, the pit is a place where you can find unlikely attitudes !

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.800
And those who I still don't get...

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.720
The guys whose I think they developed autism, because it completely goes beyond me...

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.040
It's those guys who bring filled to the brim beer glasses at the middle of pit !

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.180
S***, If you wanna lose 7 bucks, give it to me !

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.680
Oh man, true story : the other day...

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.380
I was moshing, and some random dude came in with a frozen Mars bar and gave it to me.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.260
Frozen ! Right off the refrigerator !

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.760
Well, thanks but...

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.660
And those retards who stay on stage during 10 minutes before stage diving..

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.600
This one's like Jean-Christophe, except he listens more heavy metal.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.600
But history proves that you shouldn't boast off too much. So beware !

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.580
Yeah...

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.920
Now go learn to listen to real music, faggot !
