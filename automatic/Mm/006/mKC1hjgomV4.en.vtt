wasn't feeling my way around but once

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.020 
wasn't feeling my way around but once
you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.740> start<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.250> what<00:01:38.490> each<00:01:38.700> option

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you can start to see what each option

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.990 
you can start to see what each option
was<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:40.049> real<00:01:40.799> time<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.640> made<00:01:41.880> everything

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
was in real time it just made everything

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.749 
was in real time it just made everything
more<00:01:42.420> intuitive<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.350> felt<00:01:43.740> more<00:01:43.979> at<00:01:44.340> ease

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
more intuitive and you felt more at ease

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.069 
more intuitive and you felt more at ease
and<00:01:45.030> having<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.360> fun<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.630> making<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and having the fun of making the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.370 
and having the fun of making the
character<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.060> my<00:01:48.060> character<00:01:48.509> baking<00:01:48.960> just

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
character and my character baking just

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050 
character and my character baking just
literally<00:01:49.829> changed<00:01:50.310> before<00:01:50.460> being<00:01:50.759> English

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
literally changed before being English

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.990 
literally changed before being English
it<00:01:51.540> made<00:01:52.259> me<00:01:52.470> want<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> sit<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.250> longer<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
it made me want to sit and longer and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.760 
it made me want to sit and longer and
actually<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:54.780> characters<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> lot<00:01:55.590> longer

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
actually make characters a lot longer

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.850 
actually make characters a lot longer
like<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.430> my<00:01:56.640> dorm<00:01:57.000> site<00:01:57.299> character<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.500> may

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
like out my dorm site character it may

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.740 
like out my dorm site character it may
not<00:01:59.100> look<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.520> I<00:02:00.030> did<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> whole<00:02:00.450> lot<00:02:00.600> with

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
not look like I did a whole lot with

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
not look like I did a whole lot with
that<00:02:00.869> character<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.770> did<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.700> an

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that character but really did like an

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.539 
that character but really did like an
hour<00:02:03.500> fine-tuning<00:02:04.500> its<00:02:04.710> weekend<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.430> then

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
hour fine-tuning its weekend and then

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.679 
hour fine-tuning its weekend and then
looking<00:02:05.850> at<00:02:06.030> her<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.270> different<00:02:06.630> angles

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
looking at her and different angles

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.570 
looking at her and different angles
and<00:02:07.780> saying<00:02:08.470> oh<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.920> know<00:02:09.009> that's<00:02:09.220> what<00:02:09.429> this

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
and saying oh you know that's what this

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.040 
and saying oh you know that's what this
does<00:02:09.849> not<00:02:09.879> this<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.239> blush

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
does not this is blush

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.589 
does not this is blush
and<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:11.830> is<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.069> right<00:02:12.610> proper<00:02:13.000> angle<00:02:13.420> for

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
and this is the right proper angle for

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.880 
and this is the right proper angle for
this<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.989> stuff<00:02:14.170> like<00:02:14.319> this<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.800> then

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
this and stuff like this and then

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.100 
this and stuff like this and then
looking<00:02:15.220> at<00:02:15.370> pictures<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.420> stuff<00:02:16.629> like<00:02:16.840> that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
looking at pictures and stuff like that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.430 
looking at pictures and stuff like that
so<00:02:17.640> III<00:02:18.660> really<00:02:19.660> went<00:02:19.900> all-in

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
so III really went all-in

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.500 
so III really went all-in
when<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.010> came<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.879> it<00:02:22.150> made<00:02:22.330> me<00:02:22.480> feel

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
when it came to that and it made me feel

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.990 
when it came to that and it made me feel
really<00:02:22.690> good<00:02:23.110> now<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.489> rest<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.849> game

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
really good now for the rest of the game

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.539 
really good now for the rest of the game
is<00:02:25.150> feel<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.599> map<00:02:25.870> screens<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.739> actual

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
is feel like the map screens and actual

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.210 
is feel like the map screens and actual
fighting<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.660> really<00:02:29.140> didn't<00:02:29.530> change<00:02:29.560> that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
fighting it really didn't change that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.490 
fighting it really didn't change that
much<00:02:30.280> for<00:02:30.790> me<00:02:30.940> but<00:02:31.150> what<00:02:31.540> has<00:02:31.840> changed<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.440> me

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
much for me but what has changed for me

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.680 
much for me but what has changed for me
is<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.920> questing<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.760> questing<00:02:34.180> has<00:02:34.299> changed

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
is the questing the questing has changed

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.750 
is the questing the questing has changed
because<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.530> little<00:02:35.830> subtle<00:02:36.190> things<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.549> an

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
because the little subtle things that an

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.940 
because the little subtle things that an
English<00:02:37.239> now<00:02:37.480> makes<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.410> whole<00:02:38.560> lot<00:02:38.590> easier

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
English now makes it a whole lot easier

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.920 
English now makes it a whole lot easier
to<00:02:39.400> understand<00:02:39.849> what<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.120> had<00:02:40.329> to<00:02:40.450> do<00:02:40.599> even

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
to understand what you had to do even

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.140 
to understand what you had to do even
though<00:02:41.079> I<00:02:41.110> always<00:02:41.590> say<00:02:41.890> MMO<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.549> universal

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
though I always say MMO is universal

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.309 
though I always say MMO is universal
even<00:02:43.420> if<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.599> don't<00:02:43.780> know<00:02:43.930> what<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.140> language

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
even if you don't know what the language

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.690 
even if you don't know what the language
is<00:02:44.590> they<00:02:44.799> all<00:02:44.980> point<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.640> right

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
is they all point you in the right

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.580 
is they all point you in the right
direction<00:02:45.849> most<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.660> them<00:02:46.810> have<00:02:46.959> all<00:02:47.200> over<00:02:47.349> run

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
direction most of them have all over run

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.789 
direction most of them have all over run
now<00:02:47.829> majority<00:02:48.790> don't<00:02:49.180> put<00:02:49.480> big-ass<00:02:50.260> circles

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
now majority don't put big-ass circles

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.589 
now majority don't put big-ass circles
on<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.099> screen<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:51.879> know<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.329> when<00:02:52.480> you

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
on the screen so you know that when you

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.300 
on the screen so you know that when you
come<00:02:52.810> into<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.140> area<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:53.620> need<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.160> be

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
come into this area you need to be

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.009 
come into this area you need to be
fighting<00:02:54.730> or<00:02:54.879> doing<00:02:55.180> whatever<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.840> that

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
fighting or doing whatever in that

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.930 
fighting or doing whatever in that
particular<00:02:56.290> area<00:02:56.590> or<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.489> probably<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:57.849> to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
particular area or you probably have to

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.610 
particular area or you probably have to
pick<00:02:58.090> up<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.299> drop<00:02:58.540> from<00:02:58.780> something<00:02:59.200> or<00:02:59.440> you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
pick up a drop from something or you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.229 
pick up a drop from something or you
probably<00:02:59.950> have<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.400> just<00:03:00.670> come<00:03:00.940> there<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
probably have to just come there and

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.819 
probably have to just come there and
like<00:03:01.450> stand<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.959> spot<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.410> then<00:03:02.590> cause

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
like stand in the spot and then cause

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.589 
like stand in the spot and then cause
like<00:03:03.129> a<00:03:03.160> real-time<00:03:03.640> event<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.060> happen<00:03:04.209> a

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
like a real-time event to happen a

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.170 
like a real-time event to happen a
little<00:03:05.079> minor<00:03:05.260> things<00:03:05.590> like<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:06.069> go<00:03:06.700> on<00:03:06.910> now

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
little minor things like that go on now

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.210 
little minor things like that go on now
that<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.900> universal<00:03:08.650> you'll<00:03:08.859> need<00:03:09.069> to

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
that that is universal you'll need to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.130 
that that is universal you'll need to
know<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.489> language<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:10.420> actually<00:03:10.780> go<00:03:10.900> through

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
know the language to actually go through

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.809 
know the language to actually go through
stuff<00:03:11.349> like<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.829> and<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:12.579> know<00:03:12.670> like<00:03:12.790> you
