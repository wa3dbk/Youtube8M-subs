00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
would be so big and so heavy

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.480 
would be so big and so heavy

your<00:04:51.380> chimney<00:04:51.650> most<00:04:52.310> chimneys<00:04:52.730> are<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.090> narrow

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
your chimney most chimneys are so narrow

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.630 
your chimney most chimneys are so narrow
not<00:04:53.960> even<00:04:54.230> small<00:04:54.500> children<00:04:54.950> can<00:04:54.980> fit<00:04:55.340> in<00:04:55.460> them

and for those of you who don't have a
chimney<00:04:57.620> well<00:04:58.250> I<00:04:58.580> guess<00:04:58.910> it<00:04:59.060> just<00:04:59.090> makes<00:04:59.450> all

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
chimney well I guess it just makes all

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.960 
chimney well I guess it just makes all
the<00:04:59.750> more<00:04:59.930> sense<00:05:00.200> done<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:01.310> why<00:05:01.520> are<00:05:01.580> you

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
the more sense done so why are you

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.940 
the more sense done so why are you
watching<00:05:02.210> this<00:05:02.450> video<00:05:02.720> because<00:05:03.620> your<00:05:03.770> parents
