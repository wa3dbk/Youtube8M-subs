00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello were in the video about how 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.780
 make the door myself i have 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.809
 the moment when made wooden 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.449
 nog is a wooden bar thickness in 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.680
 10 millimeters now I want to tell 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.300
 how do I do for example cuttings for a shovel 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.560
 diameter is 35 millimeters i have 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.550
 drill 35 millimeters in diameter i just 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.090
 a piece of wood from hardwood here at 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.570
 me like birch in two details 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.399
 the holes of the edge itself are drilled to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.539
 did not necessarily hold 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:50.239
 destroyed the edge there will not clamp the part in 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:55.379
 as the plaintiff the knife from the planer is pressed 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:59.969
 at an angle that facilitates the work of all 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.170
 device width the blank is wooden 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.380
 bar circumcised him on the saw chain saw put 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.939
 45 degrees cut off loud 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.250
 I work on a little plane when 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.500
 not working 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.990
 from one butt to do doing propyl in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.630
 the same saw here is inserted into it 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.200
 the usual perk drill 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.600
 here here I have on 25 drive it in 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.109
 pointed end into the body already directly 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.479
 clamp the drill then 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.820
 in order to start the very edge 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.100
 use a plane to sharpen him 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.719
 hole could enter freely insert 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.049
 here by the root held her hand 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:48.009
 free not to shake turn on the door 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.780
 start to paste and sit fly 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.209
 sawdust chips 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.560
 could be carved into such a surface 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.079
 here a little was not centered 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.860
 so there are flaws well don't call 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.860
 so important if you need them not to be 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.569
 it is possible to take a little bit thicker 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.190
 so that now there is no these here 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:13.130
 flaws when that's half gone 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.170
 this part, the finished workpiece begins 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.769
 nod very much to avoid it 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.019
 i will do here and there are 2 blank now i 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.650
 I will put it here for example it will be 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:28.299
 look it looked top headquarters 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.299
 set and go 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.129
 it looked like it meant there 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.110
 delivered 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:04.349
 and passed here also rotate now 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.459
 you need to make it less than 3 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.000
 words so involved here here i'm 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:16.489
 I will press 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.590
 this is all clamp points apparently 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.410
 It turns out a little higher than what I need 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:27.870
 reechku am bringing here to center 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:34.880
 a little bit the whole process is another clamp 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.880
 mean for 77 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.189
 corpse zinc homemade plump 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.430
 for greater importance 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:04.350
 It will no longer be here to continue to yourself means 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.530
 finish the process 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.530
 [music] 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:39.670
 [music] 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.670
 [applause] 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.670
 [music] 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.100
 [music] 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:10.120
 ready here 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:15.750
 It gives grater to get out of here is not accurate 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.750
 I do not mess it up 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:27.190
 is it ready through so thin 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:32.890
 35 millimeters for virtual blade 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.620
 Will go for Austria and put it like this 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:41.260
 do well I think to the limits of reasonable 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:45.030
 some cylinders and cuttings are possible and 40 and 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:51.970
 45 if not long or build up support 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:54.970
 extra so try good luck here 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:59.800
 so about it looks like for cutting 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:03.130
 part of the instructions the knife is pressed against the tank and we 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:07.660
 together with him to the tabletop well 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:12.070
 Circular is good here so what 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:16.090
 set at an angle when comes here 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:19.630
 that is, it starts a large diameter 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:22.320
 cut comes yes already necessary up 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.320
 35 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:30.960
 Well, here's the second pillar let's all very 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.200
 just mad 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.200
 like this
