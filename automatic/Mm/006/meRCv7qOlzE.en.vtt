00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
drop down in the cool maze and there you

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.390 
drop down in the cool maze and there you
go<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.049> pretty<00:01:04.379> much<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.739> lip<00:01:04.949> maze<00:01:05.159> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
go it is pretty much our lip maze is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.429 
go it is pretty much our lip maze is
exactly<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> says<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.659> we're<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
exactly what it says so we're going to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.649 
exactly what it says so we're going to
go<00:01:07.590> look<00:01:07.860> around<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.310> map<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
go look around this map and I think the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.050 
go look around this map and I think the
first<00:01:09.840> light<00:01:10.110> crystal<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.880> we

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
first light crystal is right here so we

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.010 
first light crystal is right here so we
have<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:13.799> isn't<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> most<00:01:14.640> exciting<00:01:15.020> PvP

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
have one it isn't the most exciting PvP

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.719 
have one it isn't the most exciting PvP
but<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.380> you're<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> maze<00:01:16.860> guy<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.460> want<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
but if you're a maze guy and you want to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.080 
but if you're a maze guy and you want to
do<00:01:17.850> mazes<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> pretty<00:01:18.930> large<00:01:19.320> maze<00:01:20.090> you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
