00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.840 
love is the ceramic finish on the inside
and<00:02:04.260> what's<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:04.590> great<00:02:04.770> about<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.160> ceramic<00:02:05.640> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and what's so great about the ceramic is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.060 
and what's so great about the ceramic is
that<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.150> very<00:02:06.210> clean<00:02:06.690> it's<00:02:07.200> very<00:02:07.410> green<00:02:07.800> but

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
that it's very clean it's very green but

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.190 
that it's very clean it's very green but
it's<00:02:08.190> also<00:02:08.430> nonstick<00:02:09.150> is<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> understand

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's also nonstick is what I understand

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.950 
it's also nonstick is what I understand
it<00:02:10.380> gets<00:02:10.680> a<00:02:10.860> great<00:02:11.160> sear<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.000> food<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.810> this

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
it gets a great sear on the food so this

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.600 
it gets a great sear on the food so this
is<00:02:13.080> definitely<00:02:13.290> up<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.220> want<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.490> start

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
is definitely up and I want to start

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.460 
is definitely up and I want to start
experimenting<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.510> my<00:02:15.600> kitchen<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.140> I'm

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
experimenting with in my kitchen so I'm

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:25.460 
experimenting with in my kitchen so I'm
really<00:02:16.800> glad<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.130> passed<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.490> place<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:25.290> this

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
really glad we passed this place so this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.920 
really glad we passed this place so this
next<00:02:25.740> line<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.190> really<00:02:26.640> cool<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.420> called<00:02:27.630> a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
next line is really cool it's called a

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.780 
next line is really cool it's called a
wedding<00:02:28.410> ring<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.890> essentially<00:02:29.460> it's<00:02:29.670> a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
wedding ring and essentially it's a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.330 
wedding ring and essentially it's a
reusable<00:02:30.330> paper<00:02:31.170> towel<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.890> love<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.220> idea

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
reusable paper towel and I love the idea

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.340 
reusable paper towel and I love the idea
of<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.820> because<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.420> can't<00:02:33.600> tell<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.900> how

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
of this because I can't tell you how

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.870 
of this because I can't tell you how
many<00:02:34.410> times<00:02:34.770> in<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.950> day<00:02:34.980> I'm<00:02:35.340> grabbing<00:02:35.700> paper

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
many times in a day I'm grabbing paper

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.490 
many times in a day I'm grabbing paper
towel<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.630> do<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.440> other

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
towel to do this that and the other

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.880 
towel to do this that and the other
thing<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:38.010> my<00:02:38.130> kitchen<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> really

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
thing in my kitchen and this is a really

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.620 
thing in my kitchen and this is a really
eco-friendly<00:02:40.890> green<00:02:41.040> alternative<00:02:41.790> with<00:02:42.420> a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
eco-friendly green alternative with a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.320 
eco-friendly green alternative with a
whole<00:02:42.780> lot<00:02:42.990> less<00:02:43.290> waste<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.460> I<00:02:44.490> love<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.940> idea

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
whole lot less waste so I love that idea

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.600 
whole lot less waste so I love that idea
now<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.960> comes<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.320> two<00:02:46.470> different<00:02:46.500> sizes<00:02:46.830> you

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
now it comes in two different sizes you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.740 
now it comes in two different sizes you
can<00:02:47.640> get<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.120> smaller<00:02:48.600> size

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.930 

in<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:51.960> larger<00:02:52.530> size<00:02:52.740> which<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.520> more<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.850> a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
in this larger size which is more like a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.390 
in this larger size which is more like a
placemat<00:02:54.480> now<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.110> think<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.920> place<00:02:56.160> that

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
placemat now I think that the place that

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.130 
placemat now I think that the place that
size<00:02:56.610> would<00:02:56.790> be<00:02:56.910> great<00:02:57.240> for<00:02:57.720> when<00:02:57.870> I'm<00:02:57.960> doing

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
size would be great for when I'm doing

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.720 
size would be great for when I'm doing
my<00:02:58.230> veggie<00:02:58.650> crap<00:02:58.890> because<00:02:59.160> I'll<00:02:59.280> wash<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.640> in

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
my veggie crap because I'll wash it in

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.070 
my veggie crap because I'll wash it in
the<00:02:59.760> sink<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.240> then<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.480> need<00:03:00.690> something<00:03:00.990> to

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
the sink and then I need something to

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.050 
the sink and then I need something to
put<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.380> top<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.070> rather<00:03:02.430> than<00:03:02.670> grabbing<00:03:02.850> a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
put it on top so rather than grabbing a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.490 
put it on top so rather than grabbing a
bunch<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.330> people<00:03:03.540> tell<00:03:03.720> us<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.110> can<00:03:04.290> do

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
bunch of people tell us you can do

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.400 
bunch of people tell us you can do

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.610 
water intake and I find one of the
easiest<00:03:38.760> ways<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.510> this<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.290> carry<00:03:40.530> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
easiest ways to do this is to carry a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.740 
easiest ways to do this is to carry a
water<00:03:40.890> bottle<00:03:41.100> with<00:03:41.280> me<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.420> water

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
water bottle with me so this water

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.530 
water bottle with me so this water
