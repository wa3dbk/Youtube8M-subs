00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
one thing you want to make sure is that

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.320 
one thing you want to make sure is that
the<00:02:28.590> hole<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.220> 2<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.030> 3<00:02:30.060> times<00:02:31.069> as<00:02:32.069> deep<00:02:32.580> as<00:02:32.850> the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
the hole is 2 to 3 times as deep as the

the hole is 2 to 3 times as deep as the
bulb<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.870> high<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:35.300> we<00:02:36.300> want<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.569> make<00:02:36.690> sure

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
bulb is high so we want to make sure

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.949 
bulb is high so we want to make sure
that<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.319> base<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:38.040> bulb<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.700> 6<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.810> 8

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
that the base of that bulb is 6 to 8

inches below the surface of the soil the

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.140 
inches below the surface of the soil the
next<00:02:43.980> thing<00:02:44.130> we're<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.520> do<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.940> add<00:02:45.120> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
next thing we're going to do is add a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.120 
next thing we're going to do is add a
little<00:02:45.270> fertilizer<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.380> bottom<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:46.980> our

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
little fertilizer to the bottom of our

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.180 
little fertilizer to the bottom of our
planting<00:02:47.670> hole<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.239> we're<00:02:49.080> choosing<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:50.010> use

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
planting hole and we're choosing to use

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.490 
planting hole and we're choosing to use
bonemeal<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.630> great<00:02:51.900> source<00:02:52.260> of

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
bonemeal because it's a great source of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.670 
bonemeal because it's a great source of
phosphorus<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.600> Bal<00:02:54.600> plants<00:02:55.200> need

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
phosphorus and Bal plants need

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.090 
phosphorus and Bal plants need
phosphorous<00:02:56.580> for<00:02:56.880> good<00:02:57.480> rooting<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.440> getting

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
phosphorous for good rooting and getting

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.610 
phosphorous for good rooting and getting
them<00:02:59.310> established<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:01.110> I'm<00:03:01.319> going<00:03:01.560> to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
them established so I'm going to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.309 
them established so I'm going to
sprinkle<00:03:02.069> some<00:03:02.700> bonemeal<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.840> bottom<00:03:04.200> of

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
sprinkle some bonemeal and the bottom of

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.940 
sprinkle some bonemeal and the bottom of
that<00:03:04.470> planting<00:03:05.280> hole<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:06.470> then<00:03:07.470> I'm<00:03:07.590> going<00:03:07.769> to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
that planting hole and then I'm going to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.420 
that planting hole and then I'm going to
work<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> little<00:03:08.580> bit<00:03:09.830> it's<00:03:10.830> important

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
work it in a little bit it's important

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.820 
work it in a little bit it's important
that<00:03:11.489> we<00:03:11.760> put<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.239> phosphorous<00:03:12.989> or<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.680> this

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
that we put the phosphorous or in this

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.650 
that we put the phosphorous or in this
case<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.310> bone<00:03:14.519> meal<00:03:14.790> at<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.030> bottom<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.569> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
case the bone meal at the bottom of the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.630 
case the bone meal at the bottom of the
hole<00:03:15.870> because<00:03:16.260> phosphorous<00:03:16.890> doesn't<00:03:17.400> leach

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
hole because phosphorous doesn't leach

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.990 
hole because phosphorous doesn't leach
through<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.390> soil<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:19.380> nitrogen<00:03:20.160> does<00:03:20.400> so

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
through the soil like nitrogen does so

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.520 
through the soil like nitrogen does so
we<00:03:21.150> want<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.480> make<00:03:21.630> sure<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.140> we<00:03:22.290> have<00:03:22.500> it

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
we want to make sure that we have it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.280 
we want to make sure that we have it
exactly<00:03:23.250> where<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.640> bulb<00:03:23.970> needs<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.690> before

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
exactly where that bulb needs it before

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.650 
exactly where that bulb needs it before
we<00:03:25.440> put<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.799> bulb<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.340> soil<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:27.450> we're

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
we put the bulb in the soil so we're

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.039 
we put the bulb in the soil so we're
ready<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.079> plant<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.880> we're<00:03:30.329> going<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.750> plant

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
ready to plant and we're going to plant

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.620 
ready to plant and we're going to plant
space<00:03:31.500> our<00:03:31.950> bulbs<00:03:32.400> about<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.940> same<00:03:33.180> distance

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
space our bulbs about the same distance

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.440 
space our bulbs about the same distance
as<00:03:33.840> we<00:03:34.019> planted<00:03:34.530> them<00:03:34.650> deep<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.790> know<00:03:35.910> 6-8

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
as we planted them deep so you know 6-8

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.390 
as we planted them deep so you know 6-8
inches<00:03:36.480> apart<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.680> they<00:03:37.799> have<00:03:37.950> plenty<00:03:38.220> of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
inches apart so that they have plenty of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.990 
inches apart so that they have plenty of
room<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.900> always<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.709> remember<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
room and we always have to remember the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.140 
room and we always have to remember the
point<00:03:42.359> goes<00:03:42.660> up<00:03:43.280> that's<00:03:44.280> where<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.730> chute<00:03:44.970> is

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
point goes up that's where the chute is

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.900 
point goes up that's where the chute is
going<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.690> come<00:03:45.959> from<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:47.280> base<00:03:47.579> down

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
going to come from and this base down

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.580 
going to come from and this base down
here<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.269> where<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.660> roots<00:03:48.930> are<00:03:49.109> going<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.470> be

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
here is where the roots are going to be

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.920 
here is where the roots are going to be
so<00:03:49.859> we're<00:03:50.010> going<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.310> put<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.820> point<00:03:51.060> up<00:03:51.420> the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
so we're going to put the point up the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.890 
so we're going to put the point up the
flat<00:03:52.200> part<00:03:52.560> down<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:54.769> just<00:03:55.769> kind<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.900> scatter

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
flat part down and just kind of scatter

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.000 
flat part down and just kind of scatter
those<00:03:58.200> around<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.829> our<00:03:58.980> planting<00:03:59.820> hole<00:04:00.200> if<00:04:01.200> you
