00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.190
 an agent miss that moment of this 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.760
 man decided to 14 and this time is not 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.640
 no template or corzine anything this 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.369
 it's something new are seasons it's mode 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.860
 manager and with a lot of desire to 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.200
 start this series and the horrible desire 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.020
 I choose as the team at Manchester 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.750
 united could come out like this year in the 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.510
 league more fatalism half was 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.550
 struggling to enter into champions no longer 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.630
 I say and collectiveros one of third 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.790
 already alone posts in Europe 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.100
 you are more touching and I think that 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.270
 we have to lift the pride of this 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:54.649
 kind of this type of equipment the 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.620
 premier if you already know maximum difficulty and 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.699
 I like challenges 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.469
 I do not like to play professionally and 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.839
 those things I like to be complicated 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.880
 that cost me the one of this we will try 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.600
 this year get already in the first year 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.460
 the three glasses I spent here I worked 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.369
 in the preview but we're going to if we 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.310
 we focus on the league cup and champions 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.880
 nothing else let's go for that 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.100
 and we will try to give everything to 100% and 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.560
 renew the team because he sees that the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.399
 Manchester has a quality team 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.350
 but I weigh two years and must renew 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.280
 Players 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.070
 and the first to discard this equipment 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.630
 is van persie is a great player can 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.810
 be very good everything you want 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.140
 but he can not give us anything with the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:53.430
 years down the succession I think that the best 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.430
 is to sing and search for players for example 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.090
 and van persie is the best for me has been 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.340
 the best solution and I think that has 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.160
 come out well after and leave course more 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.440
 one that knows one of the left side 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.149
 of defense players buy mission 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.760
 with which I think you have a vision of 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.740
 future and that can bring us much in 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.150
 a future these two players and course 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.459
 sooner not in a term soon we 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.730
 will bring great things to the team in 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.760
 defense is a strong and tall defense and 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.890
 well let's talk about this the one 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.900
 pick up the series with much desire I have 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.390
 a lot of desire to keep going up 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.970
 videos the next video will also be 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.739
 like this short summary and from 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.410
 that people run out before we'll do 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.250
 arts with videos of 20 thousand digits 30 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.800
 of career manager mode and let's hope 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.600
 I liked to give you the favorites and not you 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.600
 forget your goodbye books
