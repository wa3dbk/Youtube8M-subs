something uh do yourself can easily do
rent<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:24.970> machines<00:00:25.619> go<00:00:26.619> for<00:00:26.920> it<00:00:27.039> in<00:00:28.030> the<00:00:28.210> order

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770

rent the machines go for it in the order
myself<00:00:29.770> I<00:00:29.890> like<00:00:30.039> to<00:00:30.160> aerate<00:00:30.400> first<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.180> then

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
myself I like to aerate first and then

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.990 
myself I like to aerate first and then
it<00:00:32.140> just<00:00:32.289> when<00:00:32.710> you<00:00:32.800> power<00:00:33.070> it<00:00:33.160> Blake<00:00:33.579> breaks

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
it just when you power it Blake breaks

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.250 
it just when you power it Blake breaks
up<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.239> plugs<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:36.100> we're<00:00:36.250> going<00:00:36.520> for<00:00:36.550> here

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
up the plugs what we're going for here

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.970 
up the plugs what we're going for here
if<00:00:38.260> you<00:00:38.649> can<00:00:38.770> come<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:40.560> pulling<00:00:41.560> out<00:00:41.710> these

if you can come in pulling out these

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.110 
if you can come in pulling out these
plugs<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:45.010> not<00:00:45.160> getting<00:00:45.430> super<00:00:45.790> deep<00:00:45.940> on

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
plugs we're not getting super deep on

plugs we're not getting super deep on
this<00:00:46.239> lawn<00:00:46.540> because<00:00:46.840> it's<00:00:47.020> dry<00:00:47.290> it's<00:00:47.590> hard<00:00:47.970> but

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
this lawn because it's dry it's hard but

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.430 
this lawn because it's dry it's hard but
which<00:00:49.360> means<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.720> needs<00:00:49.840> everything<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:52.440> fire

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
which means it needs everything so fire

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.639 
which means it needs everything so fire
it<00:00:53.620> up<00:00:54.960> pretty<00:00:55.960> simple<00:00:56.489> pull<00:00:57.489> it<00:00:57.610> back<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.149> go

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
it up pretty simple pull it back and go

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.540 
it up pretty simple pull it back and go
now<00:00:59.649> if<00:00:59.770> you're<00:00:59.890> hauling<00:01:00.070> this<00:01:00.280> down

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
now if you're hauling this down

now if you're hauling this down
absolutely<00:01:01.120> nothing<00:01:01.930> will<00:01:02.079> stop<00:01:02.290> it<00:01:02.350> but<00:01:03.160> if

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
absolutely nothing will stop it but if

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.609 
absolutely nothing will stop it but if
you<00:01:03.370> if<00:01:03.610> you're<00:01:04.149> get<00:01:04.659> into<00:01:04.899> a<00:01:04.930> situation<00:01:05.170> you

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
need a saw just let go

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:16.960 
need a saw just let go
so<00:01:08.229> we'll<00:01:08.649> fire<00:01:08.890> it<00:01:08.920> up

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:47.980

lawn you see it's it's green doesn't
need<00:01:58.960> power<00:01:59.200> ratings<00:01:59.650> not<00:02:00.610> necessarily<00:02:01.180> so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
need power ratings not necessarily so

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.960 
need power ratings not necessarily so
what<00:02:01.570> we're<00:02:01.690> looking<00:02:01.960> at<00:02:02.110> is<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
batching we're fetching or dethatch and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.610 
batching we're fetching or dethatch and
down<00:02:07.660> in<00:02:07.900> here<00:02:08.290> it's<00:02:08.830> just<00:02:10.260> you<00:02:11.260> know<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.410> don't

yellow in it and that's what we wanted
we<00:02:23.620> want<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.890> get<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.300> dead<00:02:25.300> grass<00:02:25.570> off<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
we want to get that dead grass off the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.449 
we want to get that dead grass off the
surface<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.850> other<00:02:28.690> roots<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.370> is

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
surface of the other roots so this is

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.350 
surface of the other roots so this is
gonna<00:02:30.640> pull<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.030> out<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:33.250> same<00:02:33.490> ideas<00:02:33.970> if

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
gonna pull it out and the same ideas if

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.680 
gonna pull it out and the same ideas if
you<00:02:34.600> ever<00:02:34.720> see<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> field<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.740> has<00:02:35.920> been<00:02:35.950> burnt

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
you ever see a field that has been burnt

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.510 
you ever see a field that has been burnt
and<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.810> comes<00:02:38.050> back<00:02:38.140> greener<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.190> we'll<00:02:39.310> pull

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
and it comes back greener so we'll pull

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.110 
and it comes back greener so we'll pull
it<00:02:39.640> out

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
it out

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.550 
it out
get<00:02:40.870> rid<00:02:40.990> of<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.200> top<00:02:42.630> know<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:44.050> way<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.260> set

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
get rid of that top know the way you set

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.380 
get rid of that top know the way you set
it<00:02:44.680> up<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:45.640> want<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.000> go<00:02:46.209> as<00:02:46.540> heavy<00:02:47.200> as<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:47.890> can

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
it up you want to go as heavy as you can

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.000 
it up you want to go as heavy as you can
so<00:02:49.390> set<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.020> aerator<00:02:50.350> as<00:02:50.560> low<00:02:50.800> as<00:02:50.980> possible

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
so set the aerator as low as possible

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.760 
so set the aerator as low as possible
you<00:02:51.700> want<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.030> hitting<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> surface<00:02:53.410> you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
you want it hitting the surface you

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.280 
you want it hitting the surface you
don't<00:02:53.950> want<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.160> just<00:02:54.280> skim<00:02:54.550> over<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.850> top<00:02:55.290> but

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
don't want to just skim over the top but

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.890 
don't want to just skim over the top but
go<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.709> heavy<00:02:57.220> you're<00:02:57.760> comfortable<00:02:58.209> with<00:02:58.360> you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
go is heavy you're comfortable with you

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.479 
go is heavy you're comfortable with you
can<00:02:58.930> set<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.380> so<00:02:59.560> low<00:02:59.800> that<00:02:59.830> you'll<00:03:00.340> have

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
can set it so low that you'll have

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.020 
can set it so low that you'll have
nothing<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.880> block<00:03:01.090> dirt<00:03:01.390> left<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.730> may

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
nothing to block dirt left but you may

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.050 
nothing to block dirt left but you may
not<00:03:04.180> want<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:06.010> we're<00:03:06.220> we<00:03:06.640> got<00:03:06.850> on

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
here about a half setting every areas

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.960 
here about a half setting every areas
gonna<00:03:09.160> be<00:03:09.280> different

don't want to stop or again you're gonna
do

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.730 

simple<00:04:00.430> with<00:04:00.520> that<00:04:00.790> good<00:04:01.420> overlap<00:04:01.810> nice<00:04:02.470> and

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
simple with that good overlap nice and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.220 
simple with that good overlap nice and
even<00:04:03.070> straight<00:04:03.610> lines<00:04:03.880> we've<00:04:04.750> got<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.930> really

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
even straight lines we've got a really

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.060 
even straight lines we've got a really
good<00:04:05.380> college

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
good college

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:47.950 
good college
that's<00:04:06.640> will<00:04:06.820> rake<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:07.180> up

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.780 

so<00:04:48.960> I<00:04:48.990> haven't<00:04:49.320> really<00:04:49.470> devised<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.370> easy<00:04:50.550> way

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
so I haven't really devised the easy way

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.870 
so I haven't really devised the easy way
to<00:04:50.850> do<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.360> but<00:04:52.460> basically<00:04:54.200> hand<00:04:55.200> rake<00:04:55.880> you

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
to do this but basically hand rake you

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.840 
to do this but basically hand rake you
got<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.150> rake<00:04:57.300> up<00:04:57.330> all<00:04:57.600> this<00:04:57.780> dead<00:04:57.990> grass<00:04:58.850> I'm

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
got to rake up all this dead grass I'm

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.460 
got to rake up all this dead grass I'm
pretty<00:05:00.060> sure<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.420> can<00:05:00.570> see<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:01.020> you

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
pretty sure you can see that you

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.780 
pretty sure you can see that you
wouldn't<00:05:01.740> think<00:05:01.890> to<00:05:01.980> be<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.310> much<00:05:02.490> yellow

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
wouldn't think to be that much yellow

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.320 
wouldn't think to be that much yellow
grass<00:05:03.150> in<00:05:03.420> this<00:05:03.540> lawn<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:04.670> it<00:05:05.670> was<00:05:05.880> it<00:05:06.120> pulls

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
grass in this lawn but it was it pulls

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.890 
grass in this lawn but it was it pulls
it<00:05:06.510> out

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
it out

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.810 
it out
so<00:05:07.290> rake<00:05:07.470> it<00:05:07.590> into<00:05:07.710> piles<00:05:08.010> take<00:05:08.400> it<00:05:08.520> away<00:05:08.610> and

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
so rake it into piles take it away and

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
so rake it into piles take it away and
that's<00:05:11.820> about<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.150> I<00:05:12.180> mean<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.450> could<00:05:12.660> just

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
that's about it I mean you could just

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.550 
that's about it I mean you could just
let<00:05:12.960> your<00:05:14.690> co-workers<00:05:15.690> do<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:15.960> all<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.410> would

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
let your co-workers do it all that would

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:36.070 
let your co-workers do it all that would
be<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.710> easy<00:05:16.830> way<00:05:17.070> but<00:05:18.440> not<00:05:19.440> only<00:05:19.650> not<00:05:19.830> so<00:05:20.070> long

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.100 

so<00:05:37.080> it's<00:05:38.010> not<00:05:38.160> a<00:05:38.220> hundred<00:05:38.610> percent<00:05:39.110> necessary

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
so it's not a hundred percent necessary

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:48.950 
so it's not a hundred percent necessary
step<00:05:40.530> but<00:05:42.440> we<00:05:43.440> mow<00:05:43.650> laughter<00:05:44.660> just<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:47.930> make<00:05:48.930> a

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
step but we mow laughter just to make a

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.650 
step but we mow laughter just to make a
look<00:05:49.140> a<00:05:49.230> little<00:05:49.380> neater<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:50.300> it<00:05:51.300> just<00:05:51.450> gets

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
look a little neater and it just gets

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.100 
look a little neater and it just gets
that<00:05:51.870> 90%<00:05:52.290> off<00:05:53.630> or<00:05:54.630> that<00:05:54.750> 10%<00:05:56.990> kind<00:05:57.990> of

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
that 90% off or that 10% kind of

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.420 
that 90% off or that 10% kind of
finishing<00:05:58.680> touch

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.920 

then<00:06:05.430> we'll<00:06:05.640> spread<00:06:06.420> a<00:06:06.450> little<00:06:06.600> fertilizer

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
then we'll spread a little fertilizer

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.750 
then we'll spread a little fertilizer
and<00:06:08.390> watch<00:06:09.390> it<00:06:09.600> grow
