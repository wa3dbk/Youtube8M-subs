 rooms welcome to this new video 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.289
 of assassin's creed 4 black flag boy 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.690
 today we will carry out a mission killer o 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.369
 something like this is called in this 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.900
 so my god already from here I 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.609
 start breaking the boxes now 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.099
 I'll pick you up he was me 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.529
 aiming with those guys I hope I did 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.390
 fall no fuck anyway guys like 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.340
 I said I hope the videos of the walk 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.660
 through precisely what I am proposing on 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.070
 my channel you are enjoying me 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 I recommend the classes you don't have 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.120
 listi I put thumbnails here in 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.920
 low so that you can 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.040
 click on it and go see them 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.480
 we are also like myself at right 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.300
 because it is annoying 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.660
 fuck meanwhile disappears 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.840
 behind where we have to go here you have to 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.940
 alight 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.460
 ok we have pigeons here as usual 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.710
 from the assassin's creed ii even 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.989
 sure what we see a little accept 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.489
 mission okay we accept see them 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.920
 what it tells us is just taxes 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.960
 a corrupt officer who robbed merchants of 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.549
 here of the upper quarters of the ma you use 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.700
 their money to subsidize 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.130
 Templar operations 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.439
 no we cannot accept it of course 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.150
 so now we rebel against the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.330
 pigeon that escaped a pokÃ©mon though 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.670
 the one where we have to go 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.210
 tell me everything then the target 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.189
 of the murderer and therefore murderer 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.119
 of the murderer because the killer a 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.280
 apparently it's me 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.049
 let us proceed well or badly in that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.729
 label direction very close I thought 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.100
 my god was far more distant 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.450
 here they want us not to conflict 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.770
 so guys something from cabbage then 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.750
 I don't have to attract at all 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.030
 Egyptian attention where it should not 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.280
 to draw attention I climb on that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.290
 cabbage is what I do not know what it's called 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.220
 ok hide from behind behind a blade between 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.980
 between over the photo between the fireplaces 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.580
 wait don't wait for the crowd 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.170
 creation would propose it is up to probe the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.240
 throws in the cell and courtesans excuse me 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.430
 i am confused hires of straight appearance 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.670
 let's proceed to young ladies district 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:25.030
 this is my aspect of hell 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.740
 it happens here kill or move you wait 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.980
 he how you look at how he enjoys himself 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.750
 let's see if you have fun now I did 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.030
 sgamare does not conflict and I have it 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.820
 made boys mission carried out very well 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.590
 we can escape quiet kids neither 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.330
 we'll do another 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.340
 ok guys back here a 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.820
 another pigeon house to have another 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.440
 killer contract interact 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.660
 however, we are saying missions rather 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.760
 short I expected it to be longer 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.080
 the Spanish commander in the area 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.370
 commercial of the valley lies a 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.830
 military camp your goal 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.760
 the Templar captain who is stationed e 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.760
 distance here 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.280
 ok let's take the contract and send it away 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.239
 the pigeon ok 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.239
 what should I do 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.720
 it is here also we say this for 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.200
 so this time it's so close 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.360
 5, the head area does not enter into 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.000
 conflict again because you have it for 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.580
 always stop the same thing 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.040
 ok also so a stealth action 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.930
 I would say it would be the top 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.160
 let's see if we find the courtesans from 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.680
 somewhere else we have to 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.269
 launch into the well that is then of 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.820
 jumped from the ring but it's okay not 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.980
 no matter what someone is waiting for 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.470
 there that he could see us then that 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.570
 try to get sgam on purpose I am not 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.160
 I didn't do it 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.230
 mammamia thrown 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.600
 in short, until anxiety where it went to 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:56.720
 Finally this man or to say no no I 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:01.280

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.770
 hay course never thrown well yes 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.370
 approaching him we try to be able to 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.640
 that very well says it pulls this there 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.740
 then I'm so hay is immense and kind 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.970
 the room of harry potter and that the 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.950

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.970

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.860

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.810

 let's see if he knows anything from 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.800
 plundering had nothing at all 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.540
 of nice full bullet they were 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.100
 bullets to the gills boys 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.770

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.800
 it must not conflict 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.139
 the secondary objective tells me 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.580
