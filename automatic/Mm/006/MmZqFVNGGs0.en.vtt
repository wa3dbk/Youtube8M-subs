00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.269
 ludo the stage of today 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.290
 yes it was to be expected 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.209
 everyone expected a mass sprint 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.910
 and eventually rancho has it 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.589
 longest end and already has 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.869
 beautifully done I think it's one 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.730
 moment of inspiration was because they drove 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.880
 with three boys from belkin in front 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.410
 theo bos a second position and they left 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.600
 nevertheless fall a hole in that technical 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.460
 zone thereon slightly more than a kilometer 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.690
 of the arrival uses it 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.059
 made and 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.890
 Hunter Apple just came a little short but 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.679
 Do you think they are the last mile 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.719
 have explored the belkin team every 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:41.030
 team has the last one is the final 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.219
 and you are there three times 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.149
 they've passed twice in between 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.359
 done the same sign for the last one 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.300
 round 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.530
 so yes there are teams with it 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.140
 been busy but i'm thinking for one 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.760
 when the Belkin 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.499
 the three people in front of that decision 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.909
 have taken at that time and the rest 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:03.220
 The team owns a little there 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:05.269
 years later ringeloren you want this opinion 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.759
 but I understood from the interview 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.869
 that he had not studied it 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.329
 we would invent it in the past 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.950
 something like that and they would just plow into my 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.079
 complete so then you would be whole 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.149
 easy to do but en choice you 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.130
 from and how that way who was there 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.710
 not cycling so a bit like hey 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.899
 i have a hole about them they do for 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.280
 closed the door so I am spacious 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.649
 it was not rehearsed and so did it 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.049
 later so my back are logical 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.359
 Well a great win the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.850
 victory and the ride is ok i found it 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.340
 disappointing to be among the first 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.020
 Stay that stage the followers 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.520
 well there is still there but that 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.659
 wickens 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.189
 with the brochure within three minutes 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.869
 so they actually leave it 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.119
 rankings for rankings that that 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.439
 does this hurt me and I think 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.460
 also for the organization that it is not 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.950
 is fun 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.390
 because tomorrow a tough course 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.630
 what do you think for tomorrow 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.430
 Jan tomorrow it will be a lot 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.260
 heavier as the first leg 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.630
 leave in ardooie we arrive in 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.270
 brussels with a spicy final 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.220
 comma 6 slopes in total but that if 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.649
 the slope the brown well that's one anyway 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.510
 heavy slope but comes to 13 km from it 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.730
 and the but then from there to Brussels 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.940
 the last 13 kilometers and turning 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.730
 and yet fairly heavy up and down 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.650
 waste time and the last arrival this 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.480
 the last 600 meters is in anyway 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.760
 upward trend and then I expect 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.830
 well in power sprint with it a 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.820
 reasonable fairly large group to the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.440
 with 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.290
 and what is your country and people can 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.760
 participate in the eneco tour game 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.500
 your expectation for tomorrow for it 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.300
 eneco tour game 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.000

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:49.430

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.690

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.430

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.290

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.160

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.299
 added viviani and then you score 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.510

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.330
