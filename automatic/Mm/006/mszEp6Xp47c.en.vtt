party game modes that we can do so we're

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
party game modes that we can do so we're
gonna<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.340> gun<00:01:14.909> game<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> we're<00:01:15.420> also<00:01:15.540> going

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
to have infected hopefully there are

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
to have infected hopefully there are
more<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> future<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.720> really<00:01:19.170> enjoyed<00:01:19.470> all

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
more in the future I really enjoyed all

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
more in the future I really enjoyed all
the<00:01:19.680> ones<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.040> wearing<00:01:20.280> black<00:01:20.490> ops<00:01:20.700> 1<00:01:20.820> sticks

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the ones that wearing black ops 1 sticks

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.910 
the ones that wearing black ops 1 sticks
and<00:01:21.479> stones<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:22.049> was<00:01:22.170> gun<00:01:22.409> game<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and stones there was gun game and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
and stones there was gun game and
honestly<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.670> feel<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.240> more

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
honestly I feel that when there's more

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
honestly I feel that when there's more
variety<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.200> something<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.740> little

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
variety it's something that's a little

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.679 
variety it's something that's a little
bit<00:01:26.040> better<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.580> other<00:01:26.759> people<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
bit better for other people one of the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.700 
bit better for other people one of the
things<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.869> didn't<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.530> about

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
things that didn't really like about

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.200 
things that didn't really like about
