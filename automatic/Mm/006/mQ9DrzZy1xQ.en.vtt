00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.680
 here are tips and the engine say 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.780
 what really cool I think all of you 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.640
 conspiring me or like yesterday 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.800
 but just this little left 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.660
 They have spoken often where they have said 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.670
 Australia with the big fields was with 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.800
 oldtimer machines is coming too 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.320
 john deere out so that fits right 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.390
 yes, here we have a lot of things 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.520
 tractor driver three times out of a certain 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.930
 We'll start with that right away 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:01.120
 and first of all you see 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.730
 the farmer is so fuming at the whistle 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.080
 and so on and what is there now 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.440
 Differences what can you do here 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.850
 and you can here with the comma 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:16.140
 button the signs change with the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.149
 Point button the wheels could travel away 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.399
 spoke wheels as you like it so 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.410
 but a little love to detail 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:31.750
 how does the construction of the thalia like one? 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:35.380
 small whistle once in a while is it 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.479
 awesome as I said did me once 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.950
 built a normal slices today 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.910
 rims and president about it 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.600
 memory next to it with the different ones 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.670
 describe what we still have look 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.520
 We have a trailer here 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.800
 Seed fertilizer on the back, I think 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.140
 Master this too seed different 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.179
 Seed trailer and fertilizer 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.179
 probably then we have here 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:07.959
 a beautiful ball was wood wood is there 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.370
 I guess 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:15.450
 But should be wood look in the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.830
 beautiful trendy kept her red 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.670
 then you have very old ones 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.230
 baler but look what the optics 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.340
 something special can 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.340
 look at everything about her 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.260
 2 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:49.989
 well what can she do with a press 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:54.420
 open we fold when press enter 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:59.469
 we pry lower 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:05.469
 yes that was already raising should lower 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:08.909
 here we have a new holland 258 needs 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:11.560
 that too it could be 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.299
 it could be so objector 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.129
 look how looks's of these were 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.590
 honestly says do excuse me 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.919
 I am very nice but I think 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.040
 that 's the grass when you brake 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.040
 squeaks 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.079
 we look at the times 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.910
 ask what are you doing 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.390
 the rakitski rat gwa 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.740
 you have to drive that that moves what 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.630
 is also now i have no idea 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.520
 I'll definitely be in the comments 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.770
 can correct what you do with it 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.640
 I'm not sure that's for sure 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.030
 I dont know 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.170
 But let me teach you 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:14.410
 So what do we have here is the clay pigeons 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:20.680
 Litter house resorts are interesting 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:24.750
 head is there ne it is current 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.750
 The smoke of the farmer almost first tractor 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.220
 the brake is as smart as a 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.220
 military device 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:44.710
 but it is even more snow mower 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.260
 work by john deere and that's it 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:53.260
 almost a medial one, too 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:58.450
 Mower is two works then it is 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:03.780
 probably something in the 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.780
 judge also this device to screwdriver 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.140
 this follow robot would still be hd 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.940
 receiver is not what that is 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:22.340
 it is green, I have no too 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:28.370
 shoot away clay pigeons here so I leave 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:30.440
 The thing human dock a mower 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.040
 we still have a mower smb works 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.950
 Enough there you can choose 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.330
 We also have three different things 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.420
 that's I know it I do not know 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:46.040
 say this is distrustful to distrust he is 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:50.750
 also from john animal horny or that 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:53.390

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.700
 right for australia to fertilize and 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.890
 the semantic machine sure me 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.230
 guess when he looks for the picture 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.900
 judging mans toaster is that the 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.140

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.750

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.820
 she was with us, this is 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:47.830
 she came across 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:51.030
 simple pool or so full 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.030
 it would have on the one hand 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:07.810
