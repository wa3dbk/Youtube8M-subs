00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
holes here which I can see well enough

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.700 
holes here which I can see well enough
in<00:01:18.890> most<00:01:19.190> cases<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:20.600> then<00:01:21.110> use<00:01:21.350> my<00:01:21.500> whole

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
in most cases to then use my whole

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:38.039 
in most cases to then use my whole
flower

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:46.029 

that's<00:01:39.049> been<00:01:39.259> well<00:01:39.590> punched<00:01:44.560> i'm<00:01:45.560> using<00:01:45.950> in

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
that's been well punched i'm using in

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.710 
that's been well punched i'm using in
this<00:01:46.130> case<00:01:47.259> one<00:01:48.259> in<00:01:48.560> seven<00:01:48.950> eight<00:01:49.100> inch<00:01:49.909> hole

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
this case one in seven eight inch hole

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.929 
this case one in seven eight inch hole
saw<00:01:50.750> because<00:01:51.350> i'm<00:01:51.560> using<00:01:51.590> two<00:01:52.159> inch<00:01:52.399> net<00:01:52.670> pot

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
saw because i'm using two inch net pot

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.100 
saw because i'm using two inch net pot
so<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:54.049> have<00:01:54.679> a<00:01:54.710> whole<00:01:54.950> rending<00:01:55.659> try<00:01:56.659> to<00:01:56.720> drill

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
so I have a whole rending try to drill

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:16.539 
so I have a whole rending try to drill
in<00:01:57.259> I<00:02:12.430> can<00:02:13.430> see<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.330> pilot<00:02:15.140> fit<00:02:15.590> through<00:02:16.220> here

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
in I can see the pilot fit through here

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.920 
in I can see the pilot fit through here
when<00:02:16.819> it's<00:02:16.970> spinning<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.600> sort<00:02:17.870> of

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
when it's spinning you sort of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.870 
when it's spinning you sort of
persistent<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.560> intravenous<00:02:18.980> throughout<00:02:19.730> how

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
persistent of intravenous throughout how

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:36.490 
persistent of intravenous throughout how
I<00:02:19.910> can<00:02:20.180> go<00:02:20.269> so<00:02:20.480> fast<00:02:28.060> faster<00:02:29.200> quarter<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.840> six

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
I can go so fast faster quarter to six

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.220 
I can go so fast faster quarter to six
it's<00:02:37.099> just<00:02:37.430> very<00:02:37.670> different<00:02:37.970> punch<00:02:38.480> hole<00:02:38.810> on

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
it's just very different punch hole on

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.550 
it's just very different punch hole on
this<00:02:39.799> side<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:40.720> then<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.959> come<00:02:42.230> back<00:02:42.380> to

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
this side so then it come back to

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.730 
this side so then it come back to
results

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.650 

sometimes<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.890> get<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.100> core<00:02:48.370> out<00:02:48.400> I'm<00:02:49.210> kinda

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
sometimes to get the core out I'm kinda

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.150 
sometimes to get the core out I'm kinda
stayed<00:02:49.960> in<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.440> can<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.709> punch<00:02:50.950> it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
stayed in and you can just punch it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.280 
stayed in and you can just punch it
through<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.580> depends<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.209> haven't<00:02:52.959> figured<00:02:53.080> out

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
through it depends I haven't figured out

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.930 
through it depends I haven't figured out
how<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> get<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.920> stay<00:02:54.250> in<00:02:54.430> there<00:02:54.580> something

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
how to get it to stay in there something

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:08.130 
how to get it to stay in there something
this<00:02:55.030> punches<00:02:59.880> I'm<00:03:00.880> working<00:03:01.270> on<00:03:06.390> anyway<00:03:07.390> then

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
this punches I'm working on anyway then

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.350 
this punches I'm working on anyway then
once<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.770> have<00:03:08.980> them<00:03:09.130> all<00:03:09.280> punch<00:03:09.790> through<00:03:10.090> I

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
once I have them all punch through I

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.840 
once I have them all punch through I
then<00:03:10.959> roll<00:03:11.500> there<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.100> paint<00:03:12.340> them<00:03:12.430> with

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
then roll there and I paint them with

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.460 
then roll there and I paint them with
two<00:03:13.270> layers<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:14.400> exterior<00:03:15.400> latex<00:03:16.270> white<00:03:16.930> paint

two layers of exterior latex white paint
and<00:03:17.739> I'm<00:03:18.640> doing<00:03:18.820> at<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> very<00:03:19.420> end<00:03:19.600> as<00:03:19.989> opposed

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
and I'm doing at the very end as opposed

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.430 
and I'm doing at the very end as opposed
to<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:21.040> beginning<00:03:21.370> because<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:23.080> far<00:03:23.290> that

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
to a beginning because so far that

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.960 
to a beginning because so far that
seemed<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.650> be<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.860> way<00:03:24.070> it<00:03:24.100> works<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.760> I

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
seemed to be the way it works to that I

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.650 
seemed to be the way it works to that I
tried<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.570> with<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:26.730> paint<00:03:27.730> sprayer<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.209> that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
tried it with a paint sprayer and that

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.770 
tried it with a paint sprayer and that
kept<00:03:28.840> unplugging<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:30.030> plus<00:03:31.030> any<00:03:31.480> paint

everything<00:03:32.590> before<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.290> what<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.890> phone

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
everything before this is what the phone

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.040 
everything before this is what the phone
looks<00:03:39.370> like<00:03:39.580> when<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:39.850> get<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.209> most<00:03:40.810> people

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
looks like when you get it most people

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.310 
looks like when you get it most people

those most of it i'm going to insulate
with<00:04:43.840> insulation<00:04:44.440> pretty<00:04:44.740> similar<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.160> what

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
with insulation pretty similar to what

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.070 
with insulation pretty similar to what
i'm<00:04:45.430> making<00:04:45.580> my<00:04:45.820> troughs<00:04:46.090> out<00:04:46.270> of<00:04:46.450> but<00:04:46.930> there

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
i'm making my troughs out of but there

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.240 
i'm making my troughs out of but there
are<00:04:47.169> plenty<00:04:47.320> of<00:04:47.440> sections<00:04:47.800> where<00:04:47.950> that<00:04:48.070> just

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
are plenty of sections where that just

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.680 
are plenty of sections where that just
won't<00:04:48.490> fit<00:04:48.789> very<00:04:49.090> well<00:04:49.120> so<00:04:49.450> i'm<00:04:49.539> actually

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
won't fit very well so i'm actually

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.790 
won't fit very well so i'm actually
going<00:04:49.960> to<00:04:50.080> use<00:04:50.940> these<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.870> insulate<00:04:53.729> why<00:04:54.729> not

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
going to use these to insulate why not

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.920
