skateboard<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:43.129> i'm<00:00:44.129> guessing<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.730> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
skateboard and i'm guessing this is

their<00:00:45.059> attempts<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:46.710> bad<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.670> my

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
their attempts which was not bad in my

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
their attempts which was not bad in my
opinion<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:51.079> started<00:00:52.079> off<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.289> got<00:00:52.739> these<00:00:52.980> shoes

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219

opinion I started off I got these shoes
is<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.699> an<00:00:53.789> experiment<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.649> see<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.160> know

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
is just an experiment to see you know

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.470 
is just an experiment to see you know
how<00:00:56.489> they<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.660> how<00:00:57.989> life<00:00:59.270> did<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.420> were

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
how they you know how life did they were

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.599 
how they you know how life did they were
I<00:01:00.600> guess<00:01:00.809> or<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.469> they<00:01:01.620> held<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.460> there

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
I guess or if they held up or if there

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.329 
I guess or if they held up or if there
were<00:01:02.699> anything<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.210> other<00:01:03.449> skate<00:01:03.750> shoes<00:01:03.960> and
