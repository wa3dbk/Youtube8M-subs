00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.230
 dassault 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.619
 I'm not very good at catching a wave of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.350
 assaults even more informal but ended up 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:16.110

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.270
 because people in the right side acim 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.439

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.600
 left 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 coming back you can see a guy there where 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.409
 I said that I could be born a side 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.180
 right of the second escalator was born 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.579
 another downstairs is basically was 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.420
 marking today that the mills and size and 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.479
 returning 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:57.670
 Then when I took my training I went there 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:02:01.049
 on the bench and king quickie border 1 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.049
 I waited, the guy comes. 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.349
 I took a lucky guy ended up taking a 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.300
 amp p 7 loaded very lucky was 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.350
 all in my favor 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.069
 and as you can see you will see the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.459
 video is I will not stay 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.410
 the video all that part of the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.170
 Map even because I was not decided epe 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.519
 We do not go so I thought I'd get 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.970
 well marked 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:34.630
 if I could get the 25 that the usda 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.930
 fashion that there there used my state each 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.150
 one was basically a star game that saved 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.280
 his face in front of that samba 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.799
 man the guy could not kill he was not full 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.600
 I used his campaign to beat that. 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.400
 and another hit 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.180
 hence I have left that sport I 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.730
 I was in the elevator looking at 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.410
 more open area and you end up having more 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.049
 chance with 11 your enemy if you hit 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.489
 on the front line with him face you 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.060
 ends up giving him a chance he ran out 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:14.079
 taking another helicopter and not 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.530
 I came back again the helicopter had 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:22.780
 a score of 850 looking for some 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.489

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.380
