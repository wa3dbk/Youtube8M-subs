00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
when you think about rendering as well I

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.970 
when you think about rendering as well I
mean<00:04:06.510> personally<00:04:07.290> myself<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.799> don't<00:04:07.920> know

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
mean personally myself I don't know

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.530 
mean personally myself I don't know
about<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.130> guys<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.370> my<00:04:08.700> computer's<00:04:09.180> not<00:04:09.329> the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
about you guys but my computer's not the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.960 
about you guys but my computer's not the
best<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.230> mean<00:04:10.680> rendering<00:04:11.190> can<00:04:11.370> take<00:04:11.579> up<00:04:11.760> you

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
best so I mean rendering can take up you

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.370 
best so I mean rendering can take up you
know<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.180> can<00:04:12.299> take<00:04:12.420> an<00:04:12.569> hour<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:13.049> can<00:04:13.139> take<00:04:13.319> two

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
know it can take an hour it can take two

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.620 
know it can take an hour it can take two
hours<00:04:13.829> for<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> video<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:14.819> can<00:04:14.910> take<00:04:15.060> 30<00:04:15.389> minutes

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
hours for a video it can take 30 minutes

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.330 
hours for a video it can take 30 minutes
it<00:04:15.840> just<00:04:15.870> depends<00:04:16.289> on<00:04:16.320> how<00:04:16.470> long<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.769> videos<00:04:17.070> I

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
it just depends on how long the videos I

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.000 
it just depends on how long the videos I
mean<00:04:17.459> for<00:04:17.910> me<00:04:18.060> probably<00:04:18.359> if<00:04:18.930> it's<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.470> 10<00:04:19.680> minute

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
mean for me probably if it's a 10 minute

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.680 
mean for me probably if it's a 10 minute
video<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.459> might<00:04:20.609> take<00:04:20.850> me<00:04:21.030> an<00:04:21.120> hour<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.599> a

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
video it might take me an hour and a

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.870 
video it might take me an hour and a
half<00:04:21.870> two<00:04:22.229> hours<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.710> render<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:23.070> video<00:04:23.370> my

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
half two hours to render that video my

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.430 
half two hours to render that video my
computer<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.330> pretty<00:04:24.510> slow<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.780> then<00:04:25.050> you

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
computer is pretty slow and then you

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.260 
computer is pretty slow and then you
know<00:04:25.530> while<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.890> video<00:04:26.099> is<00:04:26.190> rendering<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.820> can

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
know while that video is rendering I can

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.939 
know while that video is rendering I can
you<00:04:27.599> know<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:27.750> can't<00:04:27.870> really<00:04:28.259> make<00:04:28.470> them<00:04:28.740> but

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
you know I can't really make them but

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.529 
you know I can't really make them but
thumbnail<00:04:29.370> sometimes<00:04:29.879> I<00:04:30.060> can't<00:04:30.240> really<00:04:30.330> do<00:04:30.509> a

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
thumbnail sometimes I can't really do a

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:31.670 
thumbnail sometimes I can't really do a
lot<00:04:30.629> of<00:04:30.750> other<00:04:30.960> things<00:04:31.199> because<00:04:31.289> it's<00:04:31.500> using

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
lot of other things because it's using

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.909 
lot of other things because it's using
up<00:04:31.889> pretty<00:04:32.520> much<00:04:32.610> all<00:04:32.879> the<00:04:33.060> all<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.389> all<00:04:34.199> that

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
up pretty much all the all the all that

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.200 
up pretty much all the all the all that
I<00:04:35.009> guess<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.280> could<00:04:35.340> say<00:04:35.580> all<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:35.789> power<00:04:36.000> for

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
I guess you could say all the power for

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.610 
I guess you could say all the power for
the<00:04:36.449> computer<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:36.900> can't<00:04:37.110> really<00:04:37.289> do<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.500> whole

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
the computer I can't really do a whole

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.899 
the computer I can't really do a whole
lot<00:04:37.770> else<00:04:38.009> because<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.310> just<00:04:38.400> runs<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:38.849> slow

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
lot else because it just runs so slow

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.899 
lot else because it just runs so slow
and<00:04:39.479> then<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:40.259> know<00:04:40.349> after<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.949> I<00:04:41.009> upload

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
and then you know after that I upload

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.119 
and then you know after that I upload
the<00:04:42.030> video<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> youtube<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.740> put<00:04:43.949> in<00:04:44.039> all

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
the you know the put in the correct

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.540 
the you know the put in the correct
title<00:04:45.629> I<00:04:45.930> put<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.199> any<00:04:46.590> annotations<00:04:46.889> that<00:04:47.400> I

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
title I put in any annotations that I

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.850 
title I put in any annotations that I
might<00:04:47.729> need<00:04:47.909> any<00:04:48.120> related<00:04:48.810> tags<00:04:49.199> all<00:04:49.680> that

might need any related tags all that

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.020 
might need any related tags all that
kind<00:04:50.069> of<00:04:50.099> stuff<00:04:50.159> which<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:50.669> know<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:50.819> got<00:04:50.940> to

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
kind of stuff which you know you got to

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.189 
kind of stuff which you know you got to
think<00:04:51.090> about<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.449> for<00:04:51.629> a<00:04:51.690> second<00:04:51.930> make<00:04:52.080> sure

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
think about that for a second make sure

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.930 
think about that for a second make sure
it's<00:04:52.319> you<00:04:52.740> know<00:04:52.830> all<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.099> right<00:04:53.250> stuff<00:04:53.580> and

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
it's you know all the right stuff and

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.490 
it's you know all the right stuff and
then<00:04:54.030> that's<00:04:54.300> about<00:04:54.599> it<00:04:54.629> that's<00:04:54.960> kind<00:04:55.229> of<00:04:55.319> a

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
then that's about it that's kind of a

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.649 
then that's about it that's kind of a
