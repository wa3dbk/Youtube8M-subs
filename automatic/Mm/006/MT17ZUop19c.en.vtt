00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
nice line um 40 percent let's just see

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.650 
nice line um 40 percent let's just see
what<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.209> does<00:02:45.269> shall<00:02:45.870> we<00:02:46.940> oho<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.239> that's

inclined<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:19.049> do<00:03:19.170> so

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
inclined to do so

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.170 
inclined to do so
look<00:03:22.379> okay<00:03:23.010> last<00:03:23.370> one

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180

let's go game you know you want to so

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.220 
let's go game you know you want to so
watch<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:29.010> ready<00:03:29.329> 21%<00:03:30.329> attack<00:03:30.569> because<00:03:31.019> it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
watch this ready 21% attack because it

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.280 
watch this ready 21% attack because it
feels<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.010> needs<00:03:32.159> to<00:03:32.480> okay<00:03:33.510> maybe<00:03:34.079> not

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
feels like it needs to okay maybe not

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.559 
feels like it needs to okay maybe not
today<00:03:34.469> maybe<00:03:35.629> another<00:03:36.629> day<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.379> for<00:03:37.680> now<00:03:38.569> that

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
today maybe another day but for now that

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.479 
today maybe another day but for now that
is<00:03:39.629> quite<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.170> nice<00:03:40.590> boost<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.340> range<00:03:43.489> so

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
is quite a nice boost to the range so

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.809 
is quite a nice boost to the range so
yeah<00:03:44.670> we<00:03:45.920> got<00:03:46.920> something<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.430> bit<00:03:47.579> better<00:03:47.700> on

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
yeah we got something a bit better on

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.789 
yeah we got something a bit better on
that<00:03:48.920> we<00:03:50.269> lost<00:03:51.269> some<00:03:51.750> percent<00:03:52.139> attack<00:03:52.469> on<00:03:52.650> this

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
that we lost some percent attack on this

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.800 
that we lost some percent attack on this
by<00:03:52.950> three<00:03:53.250> percent<00:03:53.639> but<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.209> think<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.659> nine

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
by three percent but I think the nine

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.270 
by three percent but I think the nine
percent<00:03:54.930> total<00:03:55.349> damage<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.040> twelve

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
percent total damage and the twelve

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.679 
percent total damage and the twelve
percent<00:03:56.459> strength<00:03:56.730> line<00:03:56.939> definitely<00:03:57.450> makes

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
percent strength line definitely makes

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.619 
percent strength line definitely makes
up<00:03:57.840> for<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.530> not<00:03:59.459> too<00:03:59.669> disappointed<00:03:59.879> but

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
up for that so not too disappointed but

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.780 
up for that so not too disappointed but
in<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.169> future<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.769> will<00:04:02.040> need<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.370> keep<00:04:02.579> this

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
in the future I will need to keep this

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.270 
in the future I will need to keep this
full<00:04:02.970> percent<00:04:03.269> boss<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.989> only<00:04:04.590> had<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.769> 25k

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
full percent boss but I only had a 25k

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.580 
full percent boss but I only had a 25k
budget<00:04:05.669> so<00:04:05.879> I'm<00:04:06.239> pretty<00:04:06.810> happy<00:04:06.959> with<00:04:07.230> how<00:04:07.379> that

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
budget so I'm pretty happy with how that

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.830 
budget so I'm pretty happy with how that
one<00:04:07.709> turned<00:04:07.919> out<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.450> happy<00:04:09.450> with<00:04:09.569> how<00:04:09.780> that

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
one turned out and happy with how that

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.929 
one turned out and happy with how that
one<00:04:10.169> turned<00:04:10.379> out<00:04:10.470> but<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:11.040> probably<00:04:11.639> should

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
one turned out but I probably should

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.699 
one turned out but I probably should
have<00:04:11.970> kept<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.269> 40<00:04:12.569> percent<00:04:12.810> boss<00:04:12.989> -<00:04:13.349> boss

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
have kept the 40 percent boss - boss

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.229 
have kept the 40 percent boss - boss
with<00:04:14.489> because<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.909> would<00:04:15.060> have<00:04:15.150> been

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
with because it would have been

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.589 
with because it would have been
obviously<00:04:15.780> more<00:04:15.989> helpful<00:04:16.410> but<00:04:17.370> overall<00:04:18.209> I

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
obviously more helpful but overall I

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.199 
obviously more helpful but overall I
think<00:04:18.690> it's<00:04:18.959> will<00:04:19.079> be<00:04:19.820> nicer<00:04:20.820> in<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:20.970> meantime

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
think it's will be nicer in the meantime

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.800 
think it's will be nicer in the meantime
with<00:04:21.509> only<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:22.199> budget<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.560> had<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:22.949> let's<00:04:23.130> see

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
with only the budget I had so let's see

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.700 
with only the budget I had so let's see
what<00:04:24.810> our<00:04:25.289> range<00:04:25.680> can<00:04:26.039> go<00:04:26.190> up<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.610> here<00:04:27.060> so

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
what our range can go up to here so

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:36.020 
what our range can go up to here so
that's<00:04:28.710> almost<00:04:29.400> 700<00:04:30.150> K<00:04:30.500> 730<00:04:31.789> so<00:04:32.789> 750<00:04:33.419> with<00:04:35.030> echo

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
that's almost 700 K 730 so 750 with echo

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.589 
that's almost 700 K 730 so 750 with echo
