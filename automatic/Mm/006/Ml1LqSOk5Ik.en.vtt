00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.460
 very special cube a cube mix up signed 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.380
 by oscar van deventer oscar is a great 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.360
 designer is a person that I admire 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.330
 a lot and the cube mix up I love 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.869
 thanks to crazy mckeever I found out about 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.960
 that there was a special edition of the cube 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.199
 mix up signed by oscar 100 units 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.390
 for everyone then each cube 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.969
 because it has the signature of oscar and the number 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.550
 of the cube as number 1 the signature as 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.890
 number 2 the signature so up to 100 then 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.570
 I can not resist I had to buy it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 besides the reasonable price were about 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.460
 30 euros so man if they were 300 euros 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.829
 I did not buy it but for 30 euros 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.899
 I had to buy it good but where is it 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.030
 the cube signed by oscar because this 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.100
 cube that you cube has here but it's 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.720
 a sticker not where the bucket is 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.780
 is here 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.390
 a mix up 3 x 3 x 3 rossi is here you see 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.400
 we did not see here, but this is 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.220
 a sticker here we have the signature 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.750
 authentic 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 Oscar cube number 43 to see this puzzle 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.540
 well rosita is not that it is very beautiful not 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.830
 it's a little ugly but hey it gives me 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.420
 not exactly the same because the end of the day 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.400
 out to see are like what I wanted to have in 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 my collection is a memory not a 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.540
 autograph at the end I would have liked 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.920
 much that I signed it in person and not 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.140
 to be able to take a picture with him that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.990
 signatures of other cubes maybe in a 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.460
 not too distant future would be fine 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.160
 because I do not have a rubik's cube signed 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.710
 by rubik or a photo with rubik a cube 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.140
 signed by meffert this would be very 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.740
 well they would not be perfect cubes for 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.200
 the collection and a nice memory 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.390
 and good as this cube is a mix up 3 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.399
 by 3 by 3 with all the faces equal is 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.409
 ballet we do not have colors because 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.810
 we have to have it returned to the state 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.899
 cubic you already know the mix up 3 by 3 by 3 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.450
 with turns of 45 degrees does not have a 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.520
 great imagination I focus on a 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.189
 intermediate level for example this 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.460
 45 degree hole and now I can do 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.759
 90 degree turns and continue so happy 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.280
 now I turn this level 45 degrees and I already 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.739
 You see what happens, not how it seems to be 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.989
 is breaking is that the centers and 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.319
 edges exchange papers to me that I 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.580
 it seems very strong that as big by 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.069
 true you see here a three by three 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.600
 standard you are used to in a 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.340
 rubik cube three times three then nothing 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.560
 the centers are there and they do not move 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.690
 always the same is the yellow red here 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.080
 good blue you know and suddenly 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.940
 we make a 45 degree turn and the center is 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.590
 a list and the list is a center is 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.870
 pretty strong and good you know that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.860
 there are many cubes mixup not mixup 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.570
 3 x 3 x 3 3 x 3 x 4 millsap plus good 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.680
 very good, that's how this is 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.260
 Cube 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.230
 a nice memory we say goodbye here 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.489
 with the fish cube and with the signature I hope 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.079
 that you liked the video as 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.079
 always and see you in another
