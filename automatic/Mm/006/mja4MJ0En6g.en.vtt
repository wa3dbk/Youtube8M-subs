live<00:02:39.630> stream<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.020> that's<00:02:40.200> way<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.410> go<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:41.040> is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
live stream so that's way to go that is

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.770 
live stream so that's way to go that is
a<00:02:41.160> big<00:02:41.310> pitch<00:02:41.550> fledgling<00:02:42.060> therefore<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.630> will

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
a big pitch fledgling therefore it will

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.900 
a big pitch fledgling therefore it will
be<00:02:42.900> traded<00:02:43.230> right<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.770> back<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.250> that's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
be traded right to back and that's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.210 
be traded right to back and that's
all<00:02:45.060> there<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:45.660> I'm<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.710> excited<00:02:46.980> to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.070 
all there is to it but I'm so excited to
finally<00:02:47.250> get<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> point<00:02:48.210> where<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.990> know

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
finally get to the point where you know

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.590 
finally get to the point where you know
the<00:02:49.470> series<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.190> everything<00:02:50.880> will<00:02:51.060> be<00:02:51.240> more

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
the series and everything will be more

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.660 
the series and everything will be more
streamlined<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.290> will<00:02:52.380> be<00:02:52.470> quicker<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:52.980> it

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
streamlined that will be quicker and it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.920
