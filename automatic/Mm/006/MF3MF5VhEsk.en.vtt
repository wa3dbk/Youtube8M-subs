the next two bars about to c minor and
then<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> turnaround<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.980> got<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> g7<00:00:21.109> which

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
then in a turnaround you got a g7 which

is not the type cord it's actually in

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.980 
is not the type cord it's actually in

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the kid c minor or Elop major which is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.990 
the kid c minor or Elop major which is
the<00:00:28.050> relative<00:00:28.349> major<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:29.310> typically<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> G

minor<00:00:30.179> which<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> three<00:00:31.289> chord<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
minor which is a three chord in the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.310 
minor which is a three chord in the
major<00:00:31.949> scale<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:33.390> has<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> b-flat<00:00:34.050> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
major scale and that has a b-flat of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.750 
major scale and that has a b-flat of
course<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.219> c<00:00:35.370> minor<00:00:35.550> has<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
course you know like to c minor has a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.560 
course you know like to c minor has a
b-flat<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.590> basically<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.489> you're<00:00:39.300> altering

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
b-flat so basically you you're altering

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.930 
b-flat so basically you you're altering
the<00:00:39.739> five<00:00:40.739> chord<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> make<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.489> dominant

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the five chord to make it a dominant

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.540 
the five chord to make it a dominant
chord<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> stronger<00:00:43.250> resolution<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
chord is a stronger resolution from the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.420 
chord is a stronger resolution from the
B<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> sea<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.829> instead<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.010> b-flat<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
B to the sea so instead of a b-flat to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
B to the sea so instead of a b-flat to
see<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.059> leading<00:00:48.930> tone<00:00:49.140> idea<00:00:49.469> kind<00:00:49.710> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
see it's a leading tone idea kind of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.619 
see it's a leading tone idea kind of
thing<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:53.010> website<00:00:53.309> about<00:00:53.399> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
using my pentatonic ideas in the key

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.550 
using my pentatonic ideas in the key
basically<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.049> e<00:01:22.229> flat<00:01:22.500> scale<00:01:23.689> C<00:01:24.689> minor<00:01:24.900> with

the alteration when the g7 comes in that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.830 
the alteration when the g7 comes in that
we've<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:30.119> B<00:01:30.270> note<00:01:30.509> instead<00:01:30.720> of

flat<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.330> then<00:02:58.450> I<00:03:01.080> energy<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.400> like<00:03:06.730> I

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
flat and then I energy so the like I

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.460 
flat and then I energy so the like I
mentioned<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.360> G<00:03:07.510> minor<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.020> cave<00:03:08.230> you

know if you're thinking about in the key
of<00:03:09.550> E<00:03:09.970> flat<00:03:10.420> should<00:03:11.140> be<00:03:11.260> F<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.560> basically<00:03:11.980> a

of E flat should be F is basically a

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.090 
of E flat should be F is basically a
Phrygian<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.760> kind<00:03:13.570> of<00:03:13.600> idea<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:14.110> Phrygian<00:03:15.070> mode

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
Phrygian a kind of idea a Phrygian mode

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.390 
Phrygian a kind of idea a Phrygian mode
and<00:03:15.660> basically<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.840> B<00:03:16.990> flat<00:03:17.140> alt<00:03:17.500> get<00:03:18.130> Salter

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
and basically the B flat alt get Salter

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.250 
and basically the B flat alt get Salter
to<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.640> beat<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.480> end<00:03:19.630> up<00:03:19.660> with<00:03:19.720> basically

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
to the beat so you end up with basically

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.980 
to the beat so you end up with basically
what's<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.800> fit<00:03:20.980> mode<00:03:21.130> of<00:03:21.280> harmonic<00:03:21.670> minor<00:03:24.990> and

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
what's a fit mode of harmonic minor and

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.470 
what's a fit mode of harmonic minor and
all<00:03:26.080> you've<00:03:26.200> done<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.410> really<00:03:26.710> altered<00:03:27.100> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
all you've done is really altered the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.600 
all you've done is really altered the
the<00:03:28.480> b-52<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.110> be<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.590> everything<00:03:29.890> else<00:03:30.100> is<00:03:30.460> in

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
the b-52 the be so everything else is in

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.990 
the b-52 the be so everything else is in
the<00:03:30.700> key<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.880> C<00:03:30.970> minor<00:03:31.300> stays<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.200> same<00:03:36.000> so

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
the key of C minor stays the same so

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.860 
the key of C minor stays the same so
hopefully<00:03:37.120> that'll<00:03:37.360> give<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.570> something<00:03:37.810> to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
hopefully that'll give you something to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.360 
hopefully that'll give you something to
work<00:03:37.960> with<00:03:38.020> him<00:03:38.230> feel<00:03:38.800> free<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.040> check<00:03:39.160> my
