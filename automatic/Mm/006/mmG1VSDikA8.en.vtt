00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
very evenly paradox it's you may want to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.979 
very evenly paradox it's you may want to
call<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.489> she<00:00:38.489> grew<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.750> seeing

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
call it she grew a lot with seeing

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.180 
call it she grew a lot with seeing
within<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.860> couple<00:00:41.280> months<00:00:43.100> it's<00:00:44.100> really

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
within these couple months it's really

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.880 
within these couple months it's really
cool<00:00:45.050> see<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.379> focus<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> bit<00:00:48.890> sorry

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
cool see if we can focus on a bit sorry

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.729 
cool see if we can focus on a bit sorry
but<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.700> camp<00:00:51.000> I'm<00:00:51.149> using<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.660> Canon<00:00:52.110> camera

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
but my camp I'm using my Canon camera

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.750 
but my camp I'm using my Canon camera
big<00:00:53.129> ones<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:54.690> video<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.460> doesn't

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
big ones to video this and it doesn't

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.860 
big ones to video this and it doesn't
exactly<00:00:57.120> focus<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.730> places<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.270> want<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
exactly focus on the places I want it to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.799 
exactly focus on the places I want it to
but<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.649> mean<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.219> snake<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.480> okay

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
but I mean it's a snake so it's okay

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.039 
but I mean it's a snake so it's okay
because<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:05.030> focusing<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.180> different<00:01:06.390> areas

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
because it's focusing on different areas

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.190 
because it's focusing on different areas
of<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.409> snake<00:01:08.390> except<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.630> blurry<00:01:09.869> part

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
of the snake except for that blurry part

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
of the snake except for that blurry part
right<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> could<00:01:11.909> actually

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
right there so that you could actually

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.210 
right there so that you could actually
see<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.540> whole<00:01:12.810> body<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.500> snake<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
see the whole body of the snake and I

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.440 
see the whole body of the snake and I
just<00:01:17.220> wanted<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.820> an<00:01:17.970> HD<00:01:18.330> video

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
just wanted you to do an HD video

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.450 
just wanted you to do an HD video
because<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.619> been<00:01:19.799> asking<00:01:20.250> me

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
because all of you have been asking me

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.800 
because all of you have been asking me
to<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.880> HD<00:01:21.360> videos<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.689> of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to do HD videos and here it is one of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.749 
to do HD videos and here it is one of
them<00:01:26.210> as<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.420> said<00:01:27.560> reason<00:01:28.560> why<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> never<00:01:29.220> really

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
them as I said reason why I never really

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.819 
them as I said reason why I never really
did<00:01:30.060> HD<00:01:30.659> videos<00:01:30.990> before<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:34.470> does

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
did HD videos before is because it does

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.200 
did HD videos before is because it does
take<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.939> lot<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.540> lot<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.020> space<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:38.909> does

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
take up a lot a lot of space and it does

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.980 
take up a lot a lot of space and it does
take<00:01:40.200> ages<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.799> download<00:01:41.430> onto<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:44.990> computer

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
take ages to download onto the computer

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.910 
take ages to download onto the computer
so<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.009> why<00:01:48.229> other<00:01:49.229> than<00:01:49.439> that

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.810 

it's<00:01:52.340> pretty<00:01:52.610> much<00:01:52.790> about<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.600> this<00:01:54.050> is<00:01:54.200> Barry

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
it's pretty much about it this is Barry

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.180 
it's pretty much about it this is Barry
you<00:01:55.820> can<00:01:56.000> see<00:01:56.240> okay

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
you can see okay

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.090 
you can see okay
let's<00:01:58.190> try<00:01:58.490> if<00:01:58.610> we<00:01:58.730> could<00:01:58.880> do<00:01:59.000> this<00:01:59.150> okay<00:01:59.980> sorry

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
let's try if we could do this okay sorry

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
let's try if we could do this okay sorry
wobbly<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:03.380> can<00:02:03.560> see<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:04.010> her<00:02:04.220> body

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
wobbly you can see on her body

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.840 
wobbly you can see on her body
there<00:02:05.450> are<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.750> orange<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.320> Pink's<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.070> a

there are the orange and Pink's that a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.210 
there are the orange and Pink's that a
normal<00:02:08.479> snow<00:02:08.810> would<00:02:09.080> have<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.800> orange

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
normal snow would have and the orange

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.950 
normal snow would have and the orange
and<00:02:10.369> reds<00:02:10.790> then<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.780> male<00:02:12.140> would<00:02:12.320> have<00:02:12.530> as<00:02:12.860> well

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
and reds then a male would have as well

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.900 
and reds then a male would have as well
no<00:02:14.960> if<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.590> move<00:02:15.740> down<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.190> body<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.790> the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
no if I can move down the body of the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.750 
no if I can move down the body of the
focus

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.490 

no<00:02:24.330> idea<00:02:24.569> what<00:02:24.689> she's<00:02:24.870> doing<00:02:25.019> right<00:02:25.260> there

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
no idea what she's doing right there

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.300 
no idea what she's doing right there
she's<00:02:26.400> kind<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.700> squirming<00:02:27.209> around<00:02:27.590> um<00:02:28.650> but

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
she's kind of squirming around um but

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.619 
she's kind of squirming around um but
yep<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.879> fully<00:02:30.209> paradox<00:02:30.870> coin<00:02:31.260> snake

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
yep this is a fully paradox coin snake

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.390 
yep this is a fully paradox coin snake
but<00:02:33.629> there<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.019> morph<00:02:34.409> called<00:02:34.890> uh<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.340> think

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
but there is a morph called uh I think

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.580 
but there is a morph called uh I think
reverse<00:02:35.939> stripe<00:02:36.360> not<00:02:36.989> River<00:02:37.290> stripe

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
reverse stripe not River stripe

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.210 
reverse stripe not River stripe

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
names it's one of the I don't think it's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.819 
names it's one of the I don't think it's
new<00:02:48.180> actually<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:48.959> it's<00:02:49.110> definitely<00:02:49.409> not

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
new actually but it's definitely not

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.720 
new actually but it's definitely not
super<00:02:50.579> common<00:02:50.879> so<00:02:51.650> because<00:02:52.650> we<00:02:52.769> have<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:53.489> new

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
super common so because we have a new

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.380 
super common so because we have a new
shipment<00:02:53.939> of<00:02:54.269> casseras<00:02:55.790> charcoal<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.970> Sara's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
shipment of casseras charcoal to Sara's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.580 
shipment of casseras charcoal to Sara's
all<00:02:58.200> kinds<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.650> different<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:59.069> Sara's<00:02:59.569> and<00:03:00.590> one

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
all kinds of different to Sara's and one

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.649 
all kinds of different to Sara's and one
of<00:03:01.709> them<00:03:01.859> I<00:03:01.980> saw<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:02.459> actually<00:03:02.849> have<00:03:03.030> this

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
of them I saw they actually have this

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.759 
of them I saw they actually have this
kind<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.590> paradoxical<00:03:05.459> echt<00:03:05.909> on<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.530> but<00:03:07.530> you

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
kind of paradoxical echt on it but you

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.710 
kind of paradoxical echt on it but you
can<00:03:07.950> tell<00:03:08.159> that<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.489> not<00:03:08.579> a<00:03:08.700> paradox<00:03:09.389> because

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
can tell that it's not a paradox because

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.339 
can tell that it's not a paradox because
it's<00:03:10.170> very<00:03:10.440> even<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.959> can<00:03:13.109> tell<00:03:13.319> that

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
it's very even and you can tell that

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.180 
it's very even and you can tell that
this<00:03:13.620> snake<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.190> paradox<00:03:14.840> because<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:16.530> all

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
this snake is a paradox because of all

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.550 
this snake is a paradox because of all
the<00:03:17.459> spots<00:03:17.790> let's<00:03:18.420> see<00:03:18.629> if<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.930> could<00:03:19.290> get<00:03:19.440> up

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
the spots let's see if I could get up

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.190 
the spots let's see if I could get up
onto<00:03:19.769> her<00:03:20.099> head<00:03:20.430> sorry<00:03:20.909> blurry<00:03:21.389> moments<00:03:24.200> you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
onto her head sorry blurry moments you

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.150 
onto her head sorry blurry moments you
see<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.590> their<00:03:25.769> head<00:03:27.199> her<00:03:28.199> head<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.650> very<00:03:29.040> a

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
see on their head her head is very a

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.080 
see on their head her head is very a
paradox<00:03:29.699> and<00:03:30.769> that's<00:03:31.769> their<00:03:32.190> super<00:03:32.519> body<00:03:32.760> she

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
paradox and that's their super body she

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.670 
paradox and that's their super body she
tends<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.449> get<00:03:33.569> more<00:03:33.629> red<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.829> middle<00:03:35.449> and

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
tends to get more red in the middle and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.640 
tends to get more red in the middle and
then<00:03:37.680> she<00:03:38.040> gets<00:03:38.220> back<00:03:38.699> to<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.239> oh<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.319> hate<00:03:40.620> when

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
then she gets back to the oh I hate when

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.509 
then she gets back to the oh I hate when
this<00:03:40.919> blurs<00:03:41.190> out<00:03:41.400> sorry<00:03:41.760> guys<00:03:42.949> and<00:03:43.949> then<00:03:44.370> it

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
this blurs out sorry guys and then it

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.120 
this blurs out sorry guys and then it
gets<00:03:44.639> back<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.209> white<00:03:45.419> again

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
gets back to the white again

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.070 
gets back to the white again
and<00:03:47.960> if<00:03:48.960> I<00:03:49.110> get<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.410> show<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.740> her<00:03:50.160> belly<00:03:51.080> the

and if I get to show you her belly the
stupid<00:03:52.560> camera<00:03:52.800> would<00:03:53.040> allow<00:03:53.280> me<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:57.920> hope

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920
