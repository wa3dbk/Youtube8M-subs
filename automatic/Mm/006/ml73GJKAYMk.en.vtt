hi<00:00:05.050> I'm<00:00:05.319> professor<00:00:05.560> Stephanie<00:00:06.189> and<00:00:06.430> today<00:00:07.090> we

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
hi I'm professor Stephanie and today we

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.169 
hi I'm professor Stephanie and today we
have<00:00:07.540> a<00:00:07.569> floor<00:00:07.960> plan<00:00:07.990> of<00:00:08.650> a<00:00:08.830> large<00:00:09.099> bedroom<00:00:09.730> and

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:10.179 
have a floor plan of a large bedroom and

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.610 
have a floor plan of a large bedroom and
I<00:00:10.240> want<00:00:10.389> to<00:00:10.480> talk<00:00:10.630> about<00:00:10.809> adding<00:00:11.880> texture

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
I want to talk about adding texture

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.320 
I want to talk about adding texture
furniture<00:00:14.620> pieces<00:00:15.130> are<00:00:15.580> generally<00:00:16.090> very

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
furniture pieces are generally very

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.679 
furniture pieces are generally very
geometric<00:00:17.289> so<00:00:17.800> oftentimes<00:00:18.220> we<00:00:18.730> look<00:00:18.970> for<00:00:19.359> the

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
geometric so oftentimes we look for the

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.169 
geometric so oftentimes we look for the
texture<00:00:20.320> and<00:00:20.470> pattern<00:00:21.039> to<00:00:21.699> have<00:00:21.909> some

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.179 
texture and pattern to have some

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.560 
texture and pattern to have some
curvilinear<00:00:23.070> qualities<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:25.150> can<00:00:25.359> use<00:00:25.539> a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
curvilinear qualities we can use a

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.040 
curvilinear qualities we can use a
combination<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.589> dots<00:00:26.919> and<00:00:27.310> lines<00:00:27.569> to<00:00:28.569> do<00:00:28.779> this

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
combination of dots and lines to do this

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.249 
combination of dots and lines to do this
you<00:00:29.739> can<00:00:29.919> see<00:00:30.130> I<00:00:30.159> got<00:00:30.489> started<00:00:30.939> with<00:00:31.480> some<00:00:32.140> of

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
you can see I got started with some of

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.670 
you can see I got started with some of
the<00:00:32.349> floor<00:00:32.590> plan<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:33.280> I'm<00:00:33.940> going<00:00:34.149> to<00:00:34.210> add<00:00:34.680> wood

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
the floor plan and I'm going to add wood

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.770 
the floor plan and I'm going to add wood
to<00:00:36.609> this<00:00:37.410> surface<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.680> one<00:00:39.670> of<00:00:39.789> the<00:00:39.940> holidays

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
to this surface and one of the holidays

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.560 
to this surface and one of the holidays
of<00:00:41.019> wood<00:00:41.320> is<00:00:41.559> that<00:00:41.620> it<00:00:42.309> is<00:00:42.519> does<00:00:43.030> have<00:00:43.269> some

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
of wood is that it is does have some

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.990 
of wood is that it is does have some
curves<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.530> it<00:00:44.559> and<00:00:44.859> it<00:00:45.460> gives<00:00:45.730> you<00:00:45.910> an

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
curves to it and it gives you an

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.840 
curves to it and it gives you an
opportunity<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:47.469> add<00:00:47.679> that<00:00:48.039> curvilinear

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
opportunity to add that curvilinear

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.450 
opportunity to add that curvilinear
quality<00:00:49.809> I've<00:00:49.899> got<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.170> small<00:00:50.589> lamp<00:00:50.920> on<00:00:51.190> there

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
quality I've got a small lamp on there

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.250 
quality I've got a small lamp on there
and<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:54.100> can<00:00:54.309> see<00:00:54.640> too<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:54.969> I<00:00:55.359> sort<00:00:56.170> of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
and you can see too that I sort of

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.919 
and you can see too that I sort of
making<00:00:56.589> it<00:00:56.829> look<00:00:56.949> like<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.219> grain<00:00:57.820> very<00:00:58.420> often

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
making it look like the grain very often

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.369 
making it look like the grain very often
when<00:00:59.199> we're<00:00:59.410> rendering<00:00:59.949> a<00:01:00.390> pattern<00:01:01.390> we<00:01:02.109> want

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
when we're rendering a pattern we want

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.870 
when we're rendering a pattern we want
where<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:03.399> rendering<00:01:03.940> part<00:01:04.269> is<00:01:04.540> is<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:06.670> that

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
where the rendering part is is not that

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.150 
where the rendering part is is not that
its<00:01:07.060> exact<00:01:07.570> but<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.460> gives<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.610> flavor<00:01:09.940> of<00:01:11.160> the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
its exact but it gives a flavor of the

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.470 
its exact but it gives a flavor of the
quality<00:01:12.850> of<00:01:13.380> our<00:01:14.380> pattern<00:01:14.940> so<00:01:15.940> here's<00:01:16.390> a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
quality of our pattern so here's a

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.560 
quality of our pattern so here's a
bedspread<00:01:17.290> pattern<00:01:18.010> again<00:01:18.850> I'm<00:01:19.030> just<00:01:19.300> using

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
bedspread pattern again I'm just using

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.040 
bedspread pattern again I'm just using
dots<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:20.530> dashes<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.310> lines<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:22.540> is<00:01:22.600> also

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
dots and dashes and lines this is also

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.450 
dots and dashes and lines this is also
adding<00:01:23.680> value<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.760> our<00:01:24.870> image<00:01:25.870> and<00:01:26.230> as<00:01:27.100> you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
adding value to our image and as you

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.540 
adding value to our image and as you
know<00:01:27.670> when<00:01:28.540> we<00:01:28.570> look<00:01:28.960> at<00:01:29.050> an<00:01:29.170> image<00:01:29.560> where<00:01:29.860> our

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
know when we look at an image where our

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.570 
know when we look at an image where our
eyes<00:01:30.820> attracted<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:32.050> contrast<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:33.160> darks<00:01:33.460> and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
eyes attracted to contrast of darks and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.690 
eyes attracted to contrast of darks and
lights<00:01:34.260> this<00:01:35.260> piece<00:01:35.710> right<00:01:35.950> here<00:01:36.010> is<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.370> bench

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
lights this piece right here is a bench

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.510 
lights this piece right here is a bench
and<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.600> put<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:38.110> geometric<00:01:38.800> pattern<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.310> there

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
and I put a geometric pattern in there

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.030 
and I put a geometric pattern in there
to<00:01:39.730> represent<00:01:39.960> painting<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.140> this<00:01:41.680> is<00:01:41.830> the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
to represent painting and this is the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.380 
to represent painting and this is the
wood<00:01:43.200> border<00:01:44.200> around<00:01:44.290> it<00:01:44.740> this<00:01:45.160> is<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.390> basket

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
wood border around it this is a basket

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.060 
wood border around it this is a basket
which<00:01:46.900> I'm<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.380> just<00:01:47.770> add<00:01:48.010> some

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
which I'm going to just add some

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.510 
which I'm going to just add some
curvilinear<00:01:48.910> lines<00:01:49.300> in<00:01:49.660> there<00:01:50.340> let's<00:01:51.340> look

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
curvilinear lines in there let's look

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.090 
curvilinear lines in there let's look
over<00:01:51.640> here<00:01:52.000> at<00:01:52.120> some<00:01:52.360> other<00:01:52.740> ways<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:54.040> you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
over here at some other ways that you

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.240 
over here at some other ways that you
can<00:01:54.580> take<00:01:55.480> that<00:01:55.510> rectangular<00:01:56.470> shape<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:56.980> a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
can take that rectangular shape of a

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.390 
can take that rectangular shape of a
table<00:01:57.820> for<00:01:58.660> example<00:01:59.170> we<00:01:59.650> could<00:01:59.890> make<00:02:00.100> this<00:02:00.340> a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
table for example we could make this a

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.339 
table for example we could make this a
glass<00:02:00.900> top<00:02:01.900> table<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:03.390> show<00:02:04.390> some<00:02:04.740> dashes

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
glass top table and show some dashes

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.949 
glass top table and show some dashes
that<00:02:08.349> give<00:02:08.679> us<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.720> actually<00:02:10.720> going<00:02:10.869> to

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
that give us this actually going to

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.320 
that give us this actually going to
tighten<00:02:11.349> up<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.590> little<00:02:11.770> bit<00:02:11.920> with<00:02:12.100> those<00:02:12.370> we

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
tighten up a little bit with those we

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.370 
tighten up a little bit with those we
would<00:02:13.480> probably<00:02:13.720> also<00:02:14.230> see

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
would probably also see

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.910 
would probably also see
border<00:02:16.380> around<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.360> do<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.920> more

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
border around it we can do a more

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.860 
border around it we can do a more
traditional<00:02:21.920> table<00:02:22.920> with<00:02:23.430> perhaps<00:02:23.970> an<00:02:24.420> inlay

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
traditional table with perhaps an inlay

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.040 
traditional table with perhaps an inlay
area<00:02:25.410> here<00:02:26.070> again<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.180> gives<00:02:27.420> us<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.780> chance

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
area here again this gives us a chance

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.530 
area here again this gives us a chance
to<00:02:28.440> add<00:02:28.560> interest<00:02:29.900> value<00:02:30.900> I'm<00:02:31.770> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.010> put<00:02:32.220> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
to add interest value I'm going to put a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.700 
to add interest value I'm going to put a
scoopy<00:02:33.540> curve<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:34.140> there<00:02:34.500> as<00:02:35.510> if<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.720> were<00:02:36.960> in

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
scoopy curve in there as if it were in

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.130 
scoopy curve in there as if it were in
legs<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.000> there's<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.330> couple<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.810> different

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
legs so there's a couple of different

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.120 
legs so there's a couple of different
ways<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.470> do<00:02:40.650> tables<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:42.260> also<00:02:43.260> wanted<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.830> show

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
ways to do tables I also wanted to show

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.700 
ways to do tables I also wanted to show
you<00:02:44.190> here's<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.640> couple<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.090> plants<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.470> one's

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
you here's a couple of plants this one's

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.830 
you here's a couple of plants this one's
a<00:02:46.830> leafy<00:02:47.250> plant<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:47.820> one<00:02:47.940> has<00:02:48.150> small<00:02:48.510> leaves

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
a leafy plant this one has small leaves

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.270 
a leafy plant this one has small leaves
I<00:02:49.230> wanted<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.830> show<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.760> tree<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:52.190> one<00:02:53.190> of

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
I wanted to show you a tree and one of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.790 
I wanted to show you a tree and one of
the<00:02:53.400> things<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.270> find<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:55.020> helpful<00:02:55.470> is

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
the things that I find this helpful is

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.750 
the things that I find this helpful is
to<00:02:56.460> actually<00:02:56.780> put<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.200> plant<00:02:58.560> if<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.490> notice

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
to actually put the plant if you notice

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.460 
to actually put the plant if you notice
I<00:02:59.880> have<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.030> pencil<00:03:00.300> drawing<00:03:00.840> I've<00:03:01.140> started

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
I have a pencil drawing I've started

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.280 
I have a pencil drawing I've started
with<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:01.950> circle<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.270> container<00:03:03.810> and

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
with this circle of the container and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.110 
with this circle of the container and
I'll<00:03:05.160> put<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.790> plant<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.740> container

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
I'll put the plant in the container

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.550 
I'll put the plant in the container
first<00:03:09.230> because<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:11.390> container<00:03:12.390> will<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.530> a

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
first because the container will have a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.160 
first because the container will have a
lot<00:03:13.740> of<00:03:13.770> overlapping<00:03:14.360> so<00:03:15.360> once<00:03:15.660> I've<00:03:15.870> done<00:03:15.900> the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
lot of overlapping so once I've done the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.560 
lot of overlapping so once I've done the
tree<00:03:16.380> here's<00:03:16.650> my<00:03:16.860> tree<00:03:17.730> trunk<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
tree here's my tree trunk here the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.680 
tree here's my tree trunk here the
branches<00:03:19.350> perhaps<00:03:20.250> their<00:03:20.580> leaves<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.270> here<00:03:21.630> I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
branches perhaps their leaves on here I

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.490 
branches perhaps their leaves on here I
can<00:03:21.780> make<00:03:22.580> small<00:03:23.580> leaves<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.570> dots<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.080> like<00:03:25.320> it

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
can make small leaves and dots I like it

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.880 
can make small leaves and dots I like it
to<00:03:25.650> come<00:03:25.910> outside<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.420> actual<00:03:27.989> but<00:03:28.739> not

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
to come outside of the actual but not

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.100 
to come outside of the actual but not
everything<00:03:29.280> doesn't<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.940> touch<00:03:30.209> makes

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
everything doesn't have to touch makes

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.229 
everything doesn't have to touch makes
it<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> little<00:03:31.440> interesting<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.100> then<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.610> come

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
it a little interesting and then I come

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.780 
it a little interesting and then I come
back<00:03:33.270> in<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.560> make<00:03:34.770> that<00:03:36.260> curved<00:03:37.400> container<00:03:38.400> I

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
back in to make that curved container I

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.510 
back in to make that curved container I
want<00:03:39.270> an<00:03:39.390> edge<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.560> container<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.100> want<00:03:41.310> two

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
want an edge to the container I want two

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.590 
want an edge to the container I want two
lines<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.540> show<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.900> container<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
lines to show the container and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.110 
lines to show the container and
oftentimes<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:46.080> can<00:03:46.110> add<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.830> darker<00:03:47.430> value

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
oftentimes you can add a darker value

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.850 
oftentimes you can add a darker value
where<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:50.250> dirt<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:52.020> again<00:03:52.470> gives

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
where the dirt is and this again gives

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.660 
where the dirt is and this again gives
you<00:03:53.160> some<00:03:53.630> distinguishing<00:03:54.630> qualities<00:03:55.670> gives

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
you some distinguishing qualities gives

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.020 
you some distinguishing qualities gives
interest<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:58.260> there's<00:03:58.650> another<00:03:59.100> typical

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
interest so there's another typical

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.180 
interest so there's another typical
plant<00:04:00.830> I<00:04:01.830> can<00:04:02.730> do<00:04:02.910> another<00:04:03.350> leafy<00:04:04.350> plant<00:04:04.680> here

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
plant I can do another leafy plant here

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.710 
plant I can do another leafy plant here
again<00:04:05.489> I've<00:04:05.670> got<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.150> pencil<00:04:07.820> sketch<00:04:08.820> that's

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
again I've got a pencil sketch that's

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.180 
again I've got a pencil sketch that's
showing<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:12.660> container<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.320> can<00:04:13.650> add<00:04:13.890> my

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
showing the container I can add my

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.150 
showing the container I can add my
leaves<00:04:14.489> it's<00:04:15.330> fun<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:16.049> again<00:04:16.560> have<00:04:16.919> some

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
leaves it's fun to again have some

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.840 
leaves it's fun to again have some
leaves<00:04:17.459> that<00:04:18.200> kind<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.350> come<00:04:20.310> out<00:04:20.489> they're

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
leaves that kind of come out they're

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.680 
leaves that kind of come out they're
very<00:04:21.090> curvilinear<00:04:21.810> there

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
very curvilinear there

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.560 
very curvilinear there
they're<00:04:22.840> organic<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:24.010> that's<00:04:24.730> a<00:04:24.970> great

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
they're organic and that's a great

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.000 
they're organic and that's a great
quality<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.730> plants<00:04:27.730> will<00:04:27.910> bring<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.860> your

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
quality that plants will bring to your

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.420 
quality that plants will bring to your
drawings<00:04:30.580> then<00:04:30.820> again<00:04:31.090> we<00:04:31.360> can<00:04:32.130> add<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.160> little

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
drawings then again we can add a little

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.780 
drawings then again we can add a little
value<00:04:33.790> back<00:04:34.210> great<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:35.200> also<00:04:36.040> have<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.340> couple<00:04:36.550> of

is<00:04:59.800> curved<00:05:00.160> this<00:05:00.430> way<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.820> hits<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.210> plank

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
is curved this way it hits that plank

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.750 
is curved this way it hits that plank
and<00:05:01.780> curves<00:05:02.440> back<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.920> other<00:05:03.100> way<00:05:03.400> and<00:05:03.700> that

and curves back the other way and that

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.110 
and curves back the other way and that
helps<00:05:04.240> with<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.960> detail<00:05:05.850> stippling<00:05:06.850> is

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
helps with the detail stippling is

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.810 
helps with the detail stippling is
another<00:05:07.600> quality<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:08.980> can<00:05:09.010> use<00:05:09.550> for

carpet and a significant part about

carpet and a significant part about
stippling<00:05:13.600> for<00:05:13.870> me<00:05:14.020> is<00:05:14.290> that<00:05:14.590> you<00:05:14.770> want<00:05:14.980> a

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
stippling for me is that you want a

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.390 
stippling for me is that you want a
stipple<00:05:15.580> very<00:05:15.940> heavy<00:05:16.590> heaviest<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.980> heaviest

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
stipple very heavy heaviest the heaviest

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.450 
stipple very heavy heaviest the heaviest
where<00:05:19.390> the<00:05:19.540> furniture<00:05:19.900> is<00:05:20.290> where<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.980> edges

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
where the furniture is where the edges

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.320 
where the furniture is where the edges
are<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:23.280> describe<00:05:24.280> it<00:05:24.400> as<00:05:24.490> having<00:05:24.520> up<00:05:24.940> sort

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
are and I describe it as having up sort

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.770 
are and I describe it as having up sort
of<00:05:25.360> a<00:05:25.450> more<00:05:25.660> open<00:05:26.080> cloud<00:05:26.470> in<00:05:27.460> the<00:05:27.820> center<00:05:28.450> there

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
of a more open cloud in the center there

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.720 
of a more open cloud in the center there
where<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:29.620> areas<00:05:30.130> that<00:05:30.160> are<00:05:30.610> not<00:05:31.140> again<00:05:32.140> by

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
where the areas that are not again by

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.230 
where the areas that are not again by
the<00:05:33.730> walls<00:05:34.030> or<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.750> furniture<00:05:36.060> this<00:05:37.060> is<00:05:37.120> a

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
the walls or the furniture this is a

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.350 
the walls or the furniture this is a
very<00:05:37.930> tedious<00:05:38.260> process<00:05:38.880> but<00:05:39.880> you'll<00:05:40.090> notice

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
very tedious process but you'll notice

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.010 
very tedious process but you'll notice
I'm<00:05:40.510> going<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.720> leave<00:05:41.530> this<00:05:42.130> Center<00:05:42.790> area<00:05:43.419> here

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
I'm going to leave this Center area here

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.740 
I'm going to leave this Center area here
with<00:05:44.200> a<00:05:44.230> little<00:05:44.500> bit<00:05:44.590> less<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:45.480> really<00:05:46.480> work

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
with a little bit less and really work

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.010 
with a little bit less and really work
to<00:05:47.410> get<00:05:47.620> more<00:05:48.070> of<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.610> stippling<00:05:48.910> around<00:05:49.630> the

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
to get more of the stippling around the

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.570 
to get more of the stippling around the
objects<00:05:50.770> around<00:05:50.919> the<00:05:51.220> furniture<00:05:53.580> and

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
objects around the furniture and

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.010 
objects around the furniture and
sometimes<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:55.300> can<00:05:55.450> even<00:05:55.530> indicate<00:05:56.530> a<00:05:57.010> shadow

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
sometimes you can even indicate a shadow

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.140 
sometimes you can even indicate a shadow
so<00:05:59.020> if<00:05:59.169> the<00:05:59.320> light's<00:05:59.560> coming<00:05:59.770> in<00:06:00.340> this<00:06:00.730> way<00:06:01.120> I

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
so if the light's coming in this way I

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.210 
so if the light's coming in this way I
like<00:06:01.630> to<00:06:01.810> shadow<00:06:02.110> with<00:06:02.470> just<00:06:02.800> one<00:06:03.730> direction

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
like to shadow with just one direction

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.400 
like to shadow with just one direction
might<00:06:06.220> be<00:06:06.430> a<00:06:06.460> little<00:06:06.700> bit<00:06:06.820> more<00:06:07.000> to<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.410> so

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
might be a little bit more to it so

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.710 
might be a little bit more to it so
these<00:06:08.590> are<00:06:08.800> some<00:06:09.010> ideas<00:06:09.160> of<00:06:09.640> adding<00:06:10.120> texture

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
these are some ideas of adding texture

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.380 
these are some ideas of adding texture
and<00:06:10.900> pattern
