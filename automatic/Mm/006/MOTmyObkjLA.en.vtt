the mechanism for the wipers so we're

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.369 
the mechanism for the wipers so we're
gonna<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.770> take<00:00:37.890> off<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> wipers<00:00:38.640> first

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the mechanism for the wipers and then I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.240 
the mechanism for the wipers and then I
think<00:00:52.050> there's<00:00:52.230> another<00:00:52.469> middle<00:00:52.860> bracket

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
think there's another middle bracket

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.350 
think there's another middle bracket
down<00:00:53.370> there<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.820> need<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.120> off

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
down there and we need to take off

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.590 
down there and we need to take off
before<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.840> take<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> intake<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.699> get

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
before we take out the intake so get

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.970 
before we take out the intake so get
started<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.199> I'll<00:00:58.410> come<00:00:58.649> back<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980

took out all those bolts pull those 10
millimeters<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:07.060> one<00:03:07.210> right<00:03:07.360> here

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
millimeters this one right here

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.970 
millimeters this one right here
back<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.940> tube<00:03:10.210> back<00:03:10.420> there<00:03:10.770> this<00:03:11.770> one

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
back there the tube back there this one

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.530 
back there the tube back there this one
right<00:03:12.100> here<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.550> kind<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> bracket

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
right here is kind of like a bracket

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.460 
right here is kind of like a bracket
holding<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.960> down<00:03:14.110> also<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:15.010> also<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:17.230> one

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
holding it down also and also this one

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.970 
holding it down also and also this one
right<00:03:17.650> here<00:03:18.780> it's<00:03:19.780> like<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.960> purge<00:03:20.320> solenoid<00:03:20.530> or

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
right here it's like a purge solenoid or

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.220 
right here it's like a purge solenoid or
something<00:03:21.310> like<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:22.690> think<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.050> has

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
something like that but I think it has

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.050 
something like that but I think it has
these<00:03:23.440> two<00:03:23.620> clips<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.070> go<00:03:24.250> up<00:03:24.400> here<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.030> just

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
these two clips that go up here so just

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.670 
these two clips that go up here so just
under<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.750> clips<00:03:26.020> I'm<00:03:26.200> going<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.440> push<00:03:26.560> it

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
under the clips I'm going to push it

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.880 
under the clips I'm going to push it
down

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
down

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.180 
down

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
cannot really see back there so you're

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.809 
cannot really see back there so you're
gonna<00:04:10.240> have<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.450> fill<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:10.959> out

the spark plugs and then start putting

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.290 
the spark plugs and then start putting
everything<00:05:52.150> back<00:05:52.510> thanks
