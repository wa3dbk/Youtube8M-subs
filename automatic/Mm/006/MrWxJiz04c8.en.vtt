four pin header on the motherboard got a

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.539 
four pin header on the motherboard got a
ultra-low<00:03:19.360> noise<00:03:19.470> adapter<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:21.070> this<00:03:21.250> reduces

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
ultra-low noise adapter so this reduces

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.259 
ultra-low noise adapter so this reduces
the<00:03:21.730> rpm<00:03:22.420> from<00:03:22.720> 1500<00:03:23.500> down<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:24.070> 1200<00:03:24.670> rpm<00:03:25.150> if

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
the rpm from 1500 down to 1200 rpm if

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.000 
the rpm from 1500 down to 1200 rpm if
you<00:03:25.360> need<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.690> fan<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.110> be<00:03:26.260> caught<00:03:26.799> even

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
you need the fan to be caught even

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.070 
you need the fan to be caught even
quieter<00:03:27.340> still<00:03:28.530> you've<00:03:29.530> got<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.860> 30<00:03:30.280> centimeter

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
quieter still you've got a 30 centimeter

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.860 
quieter still you've got a 30 centimeter
extension<00:03:32.080> cable<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.400> cable<00:03:34.390> on<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.690> fan

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
extension cable so the cable on the fan

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.199 
extension cable so the cable on the fan
itself<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:35.349> 20<00:03:35.709> centimeters<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.970> if<00:03:37.060> you're

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
itself is 20 centimeters so if you're

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:37.840 
itself is 20 centimeters so if you're
using<00:03:37.390> this

show you all the new features on this
new<00:03:56.900> nff<00:03:57.740> 12<00:03:58.070> pwm<00:03:58.850> fan<00:03:59.440> I'll<00:04:00.440> show<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.650> the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
new nff 12 pwm fan I'll show you the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.060 
new nff 12 pwm fan I'll show you the
blade<00:04:01.550> first<00:04:01.970> we've<00:04:02.240> got<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.710> hectare<00:04:03.710> per

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
blade first we've got a hectare per

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.250 
blade first we've got a hectare per
impeller<00:04:04.850> so<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.180> is<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.360> new<00:04:05.660> fan<00:04:06.050> design

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
impeller so this is a new fan design

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.900 
impeller so this is a new fan design
it's<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:07.010> 7<00:04:07.520> blade<00:04:07.760> fan<00:04:08.180> design<00:04:08.770> so<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:10.580> new

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
it's a 7 blade fan design so the new

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.670 
it's a 7 blade fan design so the new
hectare<00:04:11.210> per<00:04:11.360> impeller<00:04:11.780> says<00:04:12.320> it's<00:04:12.500> been

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
hectare per impeller says it's been

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.410 
hectare per impeller says it's been
optimized<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.370> achieve<00:04:13.700> a<00:04:13.730> perfect<00:04:14.060> balance

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
optimized to achieve a perfect balance

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.060 
optimized to achieve a perfect balance
between<00:04:14.780> power<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.980> quietness<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:17.860> also<00:04:18.860> if

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
between power and quietness and also if

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.740 
between power and quietness and also if
you<00:04:19.130> can<00:04:19.250> see<00:04:19.280> we've<00:04:19.670> got<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:20.000> inner<00:04:20.270> surface

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
you can see we've got the inner surface

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.540 
you can see we've got the inner surface
microstructures<00:04:21.739> which<00:04:21.890> is<00:04:22.280> like<00:04:22.400> if<00:04:22.460> the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
microstructures which is like if the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.220 
microstructures which is like if the
camera<00:04:22.880> can<00:04:23.000> pick<00:04:23.060> it<00:04:23.330> up<00:04:23.420> these<00:04:23.630> these<00:04:23.840> small

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
camera can pick it up these these small

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.340 
camera can pick it up these these small
little<00:04:25.240> indentations<00:04:26.240> in<00:04:26.420> the<00:04:26.480> side<00:04:26.840> of<00:04:27.200> the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
little indentations in the side of the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.270 
little indentations in the side of the
frame<00:04:27.790> so<00:04:28.790> what<00:04:28.970> this<00:04:29.120> does<00:04:29.360> as<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.990> blade

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
frame so what this does as the blade

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.790 
frame so what this does as the blade
passes<00:04:31.280> over<00:04:31.880> these<00:04:32.030> small<00:04:32.810> indentations<00:04:33.650> it

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
passes over these small indentations it

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.320 
passes over these small indentations it
reduces<00:04:34.280> air<00:04:34.640> noise<00:04:35.450> but<00:04:36.050> increases<00:04:36.770> airflow

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
reduces air noise but increases airflow

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.010 
reduces air noise but increases airflow
what's<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.560> feature<00:04:39.560> behind<00:04:40.070> there<00:04:40.720> in<00:04:41.720> here

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
what's the feature behind there in here

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.100 
what's the feature behind there in here
we've<00:04:42.200> got<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.410> new<00:04:42.560> SS<00:04:43.040> or<00:04:43.310> 2<00:04:43.700> bearing<00:04:44.450> so

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
we've got the new SS or 2 bearing so

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.290 
we've got the new SS or 2 bearing so
it's<00:04:45.260> better<00:04:45.520> stabilization<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.700> magnet<00:04:47.180> is

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
it's better stabilization the magnet is

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.830 
it's better stabilization the magnet is
close<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.870> centre<00:04:48.350> so<00:04:49.300> for<00:04:50.300> longer

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
close to the centre so for longer

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.140 
close to the centre so for longer
lasting<00:04:50.990> durability<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:51.980> gives<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.120> a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
lasting durability and gives you a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.080 
lasting durability and gives you a
better<00:04:53.860> overall<00:04:54.860> performance<00:04:54.920> so<00:04:55.730> the<00:04:55.850> fan

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
better overall performance so the fan

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.510 
better overall performance so the fan
should<00:04:56.330> run<00:04:56.570> smoother<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.650> stay<00:04:58.160> smooth

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
should run smoother and stay smooth

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.760 
should run smoother and stay smooth
throughout<00:04:59.090> its<00:04:59.300> duration<00:04:59.630> of<00:04:59.900> its<00:05:00.230> lifetime

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
throughout its duration of its lifetime

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.670 
throughout its duration of its lifetime
so<00:05:01.460> that's<00:05:01.840> good<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:03.020> they've<00:05:03.140> advanced

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
so that's good that they've advanced

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.060 
so that's good that they've advanced
that<00:05:03.860> turning<00:05:04.670> over<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:05.060> fan<00:05:05.620> you<00:05:06.620> can<00:05:06.800> see

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
that turning over the fan you can see

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.990 
that turning over the fan you can see
the<00:05:07.510> focus<00:05:08.510> floor<00:05:09.410> frame<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.190> this<00:05:10.760> is<00:05:10.820> the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
the focus floor frame and this is the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.390 
the focus floor frame and this is the
new<00:05:11.300> frame<00:05:11.660> design<00:05:12.080> you've<00:05:12.380> got<00:05:12.530> them<00:05:12.680> now<00:05:12.860> 11

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
new frame design you've got them now 11

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.120 
new frame design you've got them now 11
static<00:05:14.000> guides<00:05:14.450> on<00:05:15.260> each<00:05:15.410> of<00:05:15.680> these<00:05:15.770> gags

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
static guides on each of these gags

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.430 
static guides on each of these gags
you've<00:05:16.370> got<00:05:16.520> vortex<00:05:17.060> control<00:05:17.570> notches<00:05:18.050> and

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
you've got vortex control notches and

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.020 
you've got vortex control notches and
all<00:05:18.620> these<00:05:18.830> notches<00:05:19.100> are<00:05:19.400> angled<00:05:19.880> at

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
all these notches are angled at

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.510 
all these notches are angled at
different<00:05:20.420> degrees<00:05:20.600> so<00:05:21.500> this<00:05:21.650> helps<00:05:22.040> with<00:05:22.220> air

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
different degrees so this helps with air

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.750 
different degrees so this helps with air
flow<00:05:22.700> passing<00:05:23.450> through<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:23.990> also<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.980> sound

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
flow passing through and also the sound

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.940 
flow passing through and also the sound
of<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.180> air<00:05:26.480> as<00:05:26.750> well<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.170> it<00:05:27.260> makes<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.680> air<00:05:27.800> a

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
of the air as well so it makes the air a

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.130 
of the air as well so it makes the air a
lot<00:05:28.100> more<00:05:28.340> quieter<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.060> gives<00:05:29.570> you<00:05:29.780> a<00:05:29.810> lot

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
lot more quieter and gives you a lot

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.590 
lot more quieter and gives you a lot
more<00:05:30.380> better<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:31.130> lot<00:05:31.610> more<00:05:31.670> static<00:05:32.270> pressure

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
more better a lot more static pressure

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.380 
more better a lot more static pressure
to<00:05:33.230> get<00:05:33.980> rid<00:05:34.160> of<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.370> heat<00:05:34.490> as<00:05:34.760> quickly<00:05:35.150> as

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
to get rid of the heat as quickly as

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.540 
to get rid of the heat as quickly as
possible<00:05:35.450> and<00:05:36.080> out<00:05:36.440> back<00:05:36.830> of<00:05:36.860> your<00:05:37.100> case<00:05:37.280> our

with<00:05:51.709> the<00:05:51.889> 4-pin<00:05:52.549> connector<00:05:52.609> on<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:53.689> bottom

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:54.049 
with the 4-pin connector on the bottom

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:59.049 
with the 4-pin connector on the bottom
which<00:05:54.169> is<00:05:54.199> the<00:05:54.379> pwm<00:05:55.189> connector<00:05:57.819> show<00:05:58.819> you<00:05:58.909> the

00:05:59.049 --> 00:05:59.059 
which is the pwm connector show you the

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.569 
which is the pwm connector show you the
side<00:05:59.269> of<00:05:59.479> the<00:05:59.539> fan<00:05:59.859> so<00:06:00.859> you<00:06:00.889> can<00:06:01.009> see<00:06:01.339> they're

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:01.579 
side of the fan so you can see they're

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:04.419 
side of the fan so you can see they're
got<00:06:02.449> the<00:06:02.539> directional<00:06:03.139> arrows<00:06:03.619> there<00:06:03.919> Tony

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:04.429 
got the directional arrows there Tony

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:08.739 
got the directional arrows there Tony
which<00:06:04.609> is<00:06:04.759> for<00:06:04.939> intake<00:06:05.359> and<00:06:05.689> Altec<00:06:07.659> you<00:06:08.659> know

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:08.749 
which is for intake and Altec you know

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.879 
which is for intake and Altec you know
you<00:06:08.809> again<00:06:09.079> that<00:06:09.349> way<00:06:09.499> through<00:06:09.919> the<00:06:10.069> notches

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
you again that way through the notches

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.119 
you again that way through the notches
also<00:06:12.889> it<00:06:12.979> has<00:06:13.099> got<00:06:13.249> the<00:06:13.719> step<00:06:14.719> design<00:06:15.289> step<00:06:16.039> to

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:16.129 
also it has got the step design step to

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:18.399 
also it has got the step design step to
Inlet<00:06:16.489> design<00:06:16.609> so<00:06:17.389> again<00:06:17.689> this<00:06:17.839> increase<00:06:18.229> of

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
Inlet design so again this increase of

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.309 
Inlet design so again this increase of
suction<00:06:18.649> capacity<00:06:19.369> to<00:06:19.759> get<00:06:19.969> the<00:06:20.119> air<00:06:20.749> through

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
suction capacity to get the air through

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.679 
suction capacity to get the air through
as<00:06:21.499> quickly<00:06:21.769> as<00:06:21.979> possible<00:06:22.009> so<00:06:22.609> it<00:06:22.879> gets<00:06:23.089> away

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:23.689 
as quickly as possible so it gets away

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:26.649 
as quickly as possible so it gets away
heat<00:06:24.019> more<00:06:24.739> quickly<00:06:24.799> and<00:06:25.459> also<00:06:25.849> it<00:06:26.329> will<00:06:26.449> make

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
heat more quickly and also it will make

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.439 
heat more quickly and also it will make
the<00:06:26.869> noise<00:06:27.409> level<00:06:28.009> a<00:06:28.189> lot<00:06:28.609> more<00:06:28.819> quieter<00:06:29.329> as

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
the noise level a lot more quieter as

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.989 
the noise level a lot more quieter as
