 I just want to talk to you today 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.090
 divide 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.860
 These are the ingredients we use 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.350

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.920
 looser tastes just so I 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.469
 I can not say it 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.629

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.230
 called onions we can also have two 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.420
 Take up to three big onions and then 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.699
 Let's take a glass of wine through the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.260
 that 's really the fine thing about it 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.500
 you should be careful if you are the Turkish 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.659
 Supermarket is that he really fine 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.880
 on the packaging is also finer 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.460
 well before 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.920
 then we need half a cup of red 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.770
 Lentil fruits on the Turkish 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.479
 supermarket so a glass is with me 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.229
 200 grams are now about 100 120 grams 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.900
 linden lab measured and here are about 200 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.990
 gram at a hotline of the other 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.939
 we need oil for bathing 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.970
 and not too little for it 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.729
 show how much a lemon so the 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.110
 juice of a whole lemon over the very 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.970
 I think big here I will 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.820
 only use half the day and the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.689
 Half lemon then see a little later 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.789
 We very important are two tablespoons 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.899
 paprika mark and two tablespoons 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:00.700
 tomato marc and already to the 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:06.319
 I have spices here with spices 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.759
 Coriander in the disabled help it 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.420
 not missing that makes such a 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:18.560
 really fine touch because I then 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:20.269
 pomegranate syrup and now too 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.049
 you get from the turkish supermarket 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.360
 but also in various visited so in 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:32.180
 big supermarkets my art 17 o'clock 1 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.769
 euro 50 cost a special area comes 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.819
 yes pretty small selection is now 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.819
 not really that way 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:48.410
 powder black peter course allowed 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.970
 and create like broken 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.150
 first thing is going to be first 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.310
 The lenses here thoroughly wash something 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.200
 which is clear since that I will be whole 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.690
 then boil with a little water 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.950
 because the water we need to later 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.380
 to cultivate our culture but I am 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:18.000
 for that always the water from the left 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:19.800
 I'll show you that now 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.680
 if you have the top chance to harden the fire 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.210
 once the water is cooking now and now 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.510
 The washed minden will come too 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.510
 in addition 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.130
 by licking it whole 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.990
 goes faster 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.560
 I should then off and then the water 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.110
 has evaporated 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.860
 then it is always one 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.860
 bit of water with 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.209
 it should not even really 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.910
 It did not last 15 minutes 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.500
 Very fast means the whole look 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.500
 and really far 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.060
 so come back to the voyeur but that is 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.130
 pulled through really nice and there comes 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.130
 then a sauce with it 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:25.310
 about 1 tablespoon like coriander broth like 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.310
 they really like it 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.780
 you can do that according to your taste 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.780
 critical 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.930
 a plate done with some 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.060
 salad leaves washed off and ripped off 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.210
 and I bet on each one for a wrong 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.560
 and take a tablespoon and that 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.560
 just small, good
