00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000
 to 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.450
 hello hello what about friends and friends 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.550
 I welcome my channel, I am 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.010
 silvana and today what we are going 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.080
 to prepare is something very delicious that we 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.030
 serves for dinner for lunch and that 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.030
 Sure you will love a soufflÃ© 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.940
 potatoes and cheese is something super easy 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 simple fast and I think the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.660
 Most of us may like it here 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.809
 I have 850 grams of potatoes that are 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.090
 sewed to shit out and I'm going to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.100
 grind I'm going to crush them to make a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.520
 mashed what adds a little bit of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.530
 butter and a little milk 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.090
 once we have the puree ready 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:12.780
 creamy milk and butter is like that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.960
 you have to calculate the eye and we're going to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.680
 beat to snow point what would be the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.460
 I'm going to put a pinch of salt 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.890
 very little amount 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.890
 and we are going to beat them 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.060
 at the point of snow good once I 'm 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.060
 ready as you see the more clear shake 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.000
 let's add the yolks the three yolks 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.190
 what we have beaten three clear the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.190
 let's mix with the mash 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.490
 Y 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.310
 now that we have mixed them we are going to 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.030
 add what are our clear that 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.930
 are beaten to the point of snow and we are going to 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 go in enveloping form 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.850
 mixing them with our mashed potatoes 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.560
 you have to rectify the salt that 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:13.510
 be well of salt because one the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.510
 potatoes things with water and salt but 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.850
 anyway you have to try 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.850
 because those who are super rich 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.200
 then we mix this very well with 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.200
 sweetie 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.960
 and one of two 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.420
 they put it in a mold 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.060
 because you still have to put the cheese 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.220
 but we're going to put the cheese 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.200
 to put halfway after I'm 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.990
 over another little souffle and go in 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.900
 individual molds or can do it in 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.020
 molds in a large mold or molds 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.020
 individual 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.769
 mixing the two things as they come 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.769
 best 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.430
 well I'm going to empty myself in this a 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.430
 tap 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.020
 well a little 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.980
 we 're going to put cheese in this cheese 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.980
 buttery 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.720
 a little 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.950
 and he is standing with another bit of his faith 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.220
 we're going to bake 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.430
 preheated 200 degrees from 18 to 20 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.360
 minutes can be 25 minutes already depends 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.170
 from your oven 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.510
 when they're ready 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.939

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.280
 re hot but in this way so that 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.280

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.430

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.360
