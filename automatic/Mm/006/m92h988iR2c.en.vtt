 and it seems that the posh tb will keep us in 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.100
 the wait again at least the part 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.410
 the internet TV service 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.149

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.320
 according to the agency's report

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.370
 I live since it is not over yet 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 agreements with local stations 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.760
 to obtain content licenses 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.010
 that we could wait until 2016 for 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.750
 really cut the cable what 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.300
 we want to know to date is that the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.270
 new adjustment will stop internal changes and 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.369
 physicists starting with the same box and 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.590
 now it will be thinner and control

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.759
 and a microphone to dictate orders to him 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.940
 ree and that is the most 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:13.180
 drastic the interface of the new adjustment of 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.730
 will be based on 19 with integration of 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.050

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.430

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.959
 noticed that now they see it up in the soup 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.420
 and is that they just launched a campaign 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.489
 advertising with new artists in white 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.310

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.800

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.320
 motorways and at train stations 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.100
 but it turns out that now two months from 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.220
 have thrown 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.110
 and they can not reach spin by atom 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.660
 giucich already has 11 million users 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.650
 while spotify follows the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.600
 front with 75 million users and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.520
 with this we conclude our session of 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.920
