well<00:00:03.139> this<00:00:03.320> cavity<00:00:03.679> is<00:00:03.830> completely<00:00:04.340> empty

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:05.049 
well this cavity is completely empty

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.119 
well this cavity is completely empty
there's<00:00:06.049> a<00:00:06.140> beam<00:00:06.319> up<00:00:06.500> above<00:00:06.770> but<00:00:07.009> that

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:07.129 
there's a beam up above but that

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.459 
there's a beam up above but that
shouldn't<00:00:07.370> be<00:00:07.520> any<00:00:07.609> problem<00:00:07.870> hello<00:00:08.870> Graham

see<00:00:11.330> you<00:00:11.389> too<00:00:11.570> you<00:00:11.900> helped<00:00:12.139> us<00:00:12.260> out<00:00:12.350> last<00:00:12.619> year

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
see you too you helped us out last year

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.699 
see you too you helped us out last year
in<00:00:13.039> Acton<00:00:13.610> with<00:00:14.090> our<00:00:14.209> 1710<00:00:14.959> colonial<00:00:15.469> we<00:00:15.590> had<00:00:15.680> a

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
in Acton with our 1710 colonial we had a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.349 
in Acton with our 1710 colonial we had a
new<00:00:15.920> addition<00:00:16.039> on<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.550> side<00:00:16.760> you<00:00:16.970> came<00:00:17.210> in

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
new addition on the side you came in

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.210 
new addition on the side you came in
with<00:00:17.480> one<00:00:17.660> of<00:00:17.690> your<00:00:17.810> trucks<00:00:18.080> sprayed<00:00:18.920> foam

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
with one of your trucks sprayed foam

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.910 
with one of your trucks sprayed foam
into<00:00:19.580> it<00:00:19.670> worked<00:00:20.030> out<00:00:20.180> great<00:00:20.390> last<00:00:20.830> year<00:00:21.830> you

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
into it worked out great last year you

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.920 
into it worked out great last year you
drove<00:00:22.130> up<00:00:22.280> in<00:00:22.400> one<00:00:22.670> truck<00:00:22.970> this<00:00:23.390> year<00:00:23.690> I

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
drove up in one truck this year I

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.170 
drove up in one truck this year I
noticed<00:00:24.410> you<00:00:24.500> have<00:00:24.650> two<00:00:25.010> separate<00:00:25.550> rigs<00:00:25.789> with

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
noticed you have two separate rigs with

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.180 
noticed you have two separate rigs with
generators<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.080> metering<00:00:27.440> devices<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:28.039> so

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
generators the metering devices and so

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.340 
generators the metering devices and so
on<00:00:28.220> well<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.150> reason<00:00:29.450> for<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.660> two<00:00:29.840> rigs<00:00:30.110> is

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
on well the reason for the two rigs is

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.650 
on well the reason for the two rigs is
we've<00:00:30.500> got<00:00:30.619> two<00:00:30.830> solutions<00:00:31.070> this<00:00:32.059> first<00:00:32.390> truck

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
we've got two solutions this first truck

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.630 
we've got two solutions this first truck
has<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.530> formula<00:00:34.070> we<00:00:34.160> use<00:00:34.310> a<00:00:34.340> new

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
has the formula we use a new

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.610 
has the formula we use a new
construction<00:00:35.300> where<00:00:35.480> we<00:00:35.570> can<00:00:35.989> spray<00:00:36.290> on<00:00:36.320> an

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
construction where we can spray on an

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.610 
construction where we can spray on an
open<00:00:36.920> wall<00:00:37.270> between<00:00:38.270> studs<00:00:39.020> spray<00:00:39.380> on<00:00:39.530> the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
open wall between studs spray on the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.979 
open wall between studs spray on the
sheathing<00:00:39.829> but<00:00:40.220> it<00:00:40.520> isn't<00:00:40.910> suitable<00:00:41.180> for<00:00:41.480> the

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
sheathing but it isn't suitable for the

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.229 
sheathing but it isn't suitable for the
older<00:00:42.860> homes<00:00:43.010> where<00:00:43.399> we<00:00:43.489> have<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.760> inject<00:00:44.090> the

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
older homes where we have to inject the

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.910 
older homes where we have to inject the
foam<00:00:44.450> into<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:44.840> closed<00:00:45.050> cavity<00:00:45.620> is<00:00:45.739> too

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
foam into a closed cavity is too

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.400 
foam into a closed cavity is too
aggressive<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:46.640> in<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.720> second<00:00:48.079> truck<00:00:48.230> we've

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
aggressive so in the second truck we've

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.530 
aggressive so in the second truck we've
got<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:48.649> slowed<00:00:48.980> down<00:00:49.220> system<00:00:49.790> and<00:00:50.420> we

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
got this slowed down system and we

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.690 
got this slowed down system and we
inject<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.050> foam<00:00:51.290> as<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:51.950> liquid<00:00:52.489> through

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
inject the foam as a liquid through

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.479 
inject the foam as a liquid through
these<00:00:52.910> holes<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:54.350> runs<00:00:54.649> down<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.219> bottom

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
these holes it runs down to the bottom

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.799 
these holes it runs down to the bottom
of<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.670> cavity<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.210> then<00:00:56.360> very<00:00:56.630> slowly

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
of the cavity and then very slowly

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.340 
of the cavity and then very slowly
spreads<00:00:57.620> out<00:00:57.829> what<00:00:58.370> starts<00:00:58.790> to<00:00:58.820> grow<00:00:59.149> it's<00:00:59.780> an

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
spreads out what starts to grow it's an

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.290 
spreads out what starts to grow it's an
inch<00:01:00.559> of<00:01:00.739> liquid<00:01:00.890> if<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:01.399> expand<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:02.059> five

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
inch of liquid if you expand to five

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.299 
inch of liquid if you expand to five
feet<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.750> foam<00:01:02.989> but<00:01:03.649> it<00:01:03.770> takes<00:01:03.950> two<00:01:04.159> or<00:01:04.189> three

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
feet of foam but it takes two or three

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.639 
feet of foam but it takes two or three
minutes<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.790> do<00:01:05.030> this<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:06.079> that's<00:01:06.319> to<00:01:06.499> make

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
minutes to do this and that's to make

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.129 
minutes to do this and that's to make
sure<00:01:06.709> that<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:08.060> isn't<00:01:08.270> aggressive<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.929> won't

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:09.139 
sure that it isn't aggressive it won't

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:10.840 
sure that it isn't aggressive it won't
burst<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.590> wall<00:01:09.770> apart<00:01:10.039> I<00:01:10.189> wish<00:01:10.399> I<00:01:10.520> could<00:01:10.670> see

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
burst the wall apart I wish I could see

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.760 
burst the wall apart I wish I could see
it<00:01:10.909> well<00:01:11.509> we<00:01:11.600> got<00:01:11.719> a<00:01:11.749> little<00:01:11.899> demonstration<00:01:12.259> we

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
it well we got a little demonstration we

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.540 
it well we got a little demonstration we
can<00:01:12.920> run<00:01:13.069> for<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.490> here

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
can run for you here

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.550 
can run for you here
as<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.940> just<00:01:15.090> show<00:01:15.270> us<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> new<00:01:16.080> construction

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
as we just show us the new construction

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.600 
as we just show us the new construction
fun<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.440> see<00:01:22.590> how<00:01:22.740> aggressive<00:01:22.980> this<00:01:23.430> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
fun you can see how aggressive this is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.580 
fun you can see how aggressive this is
it<00:01:23.820> expands<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> hundred<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.870> one<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.230> no<00:01:25.350> time

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it expands a hundred to one in no time

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.740 
it expands a hundred to one in no time
at<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:25.980> and<00:01:26.160> blows<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.910> walls<00:01:27.120> of<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:27.600> box

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
at all and blows the walls of the box

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990 
at all and blows the walls of the box
apart<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.010> use<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.760> house

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
apart but if you use this in this house

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.810 
apart but if you use this in this house
the<00:01:30.870> wall<00:01:31.050> would<00:01:31.260> burst<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.430> we've<00:01:32.640> got

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the wall would burst so we've got

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.940 
the wall would burst so we've got
another<00:01:33.030> solution

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.940 

this<00:01:37.549> goes<00:01:37.789> in<00:01:37.969> as<00:01:38.119> a<00:01:38.210> liquid<00:01:38.799> nothing<00:01:39.799> much

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
this goes in as a liquid nothing much

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.300 
this goes in as a liquid nothing much
happens<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:40.579> just<00:01:40.789> smoothes<00:01:41.780> out<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:43.130> it's

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
happens it just smoothes out and it's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.340 
happens it just smoothes out and it's
going<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.610> take<00:01:43.820> two<00:01:44.689> or<00:01:44.780> three<00:01:44.840> minutes<00:01:45.289> to

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
going to take two or three minutes to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.219 
going to take two or three minutes to
grow<00:01:45.649> but<00:01:46.640> during<00:01:47.179> its<00:01:47.270> expansion<00:01:47.929> it's<00:01:48.079> going

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
grow but during its expansion it's going

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.929 
grow but during its expansion it's going
to<00:01:48.289> say<00:01:48.469> very<00:01:48.679> soft<00:01:49.070> almost<00:01:49.340> like<00:01:49.579> a<00:01:49.640> mousse

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939

this is can be cleaned off easily it
seals<00:02:09.910> completely<00:02:10.910> what<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.630> farm<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:12.019> cured

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
seals completely what the farm is cured

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.280 
seals completely what the farm is cured
in<00:02:12.530> maybe<00:02:13.280> four<00:02:13.580> or<00:02:13.610> five<00:02:13.670> minutes<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:15.170> be

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
in maybe four or five minutes just be

in maybe four or five minutes just be
scraped<00:02:15.590> off<00:02:15.769> with<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.980> scraper<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
scraped off with a scraper so the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.910 
scraped off with a scraper so the
question<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.540> had<00:02:17.750> was<00:02:17.959> how<00:02:18.230> do<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.620> know<00:02:18.799> if

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
question I had was how do you know if

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.289 
question I had was how do you know if
you<00:02:19.040> filled<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.519> whole<00:02:19.670> stub

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
you filled the whole stub

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.839 
you filled the whole stub
well<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:20.810> got<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.620> visual<00:02:21.860> check<00:02:22.130> because<00:02:22.549> we

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
well we got a visual check because we

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.430 
well we got a visual check because we
could<00:02:23.000> see<00:02:23.209> where<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> foam<00:02:23.750> appears<00:02:24.170> in

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
could see where the foam appears in

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.830 
could see where the foam appears in
these<00:02:24.799> holes<00:02:25.099> if<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.910> appears<00:02:26.209> here<00:02:26.510> we<00:02:26.690> know

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
these holes if it appears here we know

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.390 
these holes if it appears here we know
that<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.140> cabin<00:02:27.470> has<00:02:27.560> been<00:02:27.739> filled<00:02:28.040> from<00:02:28.250> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
that the cabin has been filled from the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.360 
that the cabin has been filled from the
bottom<00:02:28.700> oh<00:02:29.049> we<00:02:30.049> have<00:02:30.230> yet<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.440> put<00:02:30.680> me<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:30.950> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
bottom oh we have yet to put me and the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.400 
bottom oh we have yet to put me and the
firm<00:02:31.610> through<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.299> top<00:02:32.480> holes<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.170> when<00:02:33.319> we

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
firm through the top holes and when we

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.500 
firm through the top holes and when we
do<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.799> we'll<00:02:34.280> be<00:02:34.310> able<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.700> verify<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
do that we'll be able to verify that the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.150 
do that we'll be able to verify that the
cavity<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:35.989> completely<00:02:36.170> filled<00:02:36.829> when<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
cavity is completely filled when the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.130 
cavity is completely filled when the
foam<00:02:37.400> pops<00:02:37.880> out<00:02:38.090> those<00:02:38.269> holes<00:02:38.540> at<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.840> top<00:02:38.870> of

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
foam pops out those holes at the top of

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.319 
foam pops out those holes at the top of
the<00:02:39.200> wall<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.069> we<00:02:40.130> got<00:02:40.250> another<00:02:40.519> solution<00:02:40.790> too

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
the wall but we got another solution too

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.289 
the wall but we got another solution too
and<00:02:42.079> that's<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.799> high-tech<00:02:43.519> way<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.910> telling<00:02:44.239> if

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
and that's a high-tech way of telling if

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.090 
and that's a high-tech way of telling if
the<00:02:44.359> wall<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:44.660> filled<00:02:45.079> check<00:02:45.709> our<00:02:45.889> phone

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
the wall is filled check our phone

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.580 
the wall is filled check our phone
before<00:02:46.489> we<00:02:46.609> go<00:02:46.700> over<00:02:46.880> there<00:02:47.139> it<00:02:48.139> is<00:02:48.260> growing

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
before we go over there it is growing

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.050 
before we go over there it is growing
but<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.100> sure<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.639> slowly<00:02:51.700> it's<00:02:52.700> gonna<00:02:52.790> take<00:02:53.030> a

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
but it sure is slowly it's gonna take a

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.210 
but it sure is slowly it's gonna take a
couple<00:02:53.329> more<00:02:53.540> minute<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.109> notice<00:02:55.010> how

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
couple more minute and I notice how

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.009 
couple more minute and I notice how
there's<00:02:55.459> absolutely<00:02:55.940> no<00:02:56.209> distortion<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:56.930> the

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
there's absolutely no distortion in the

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.650 
there's absolutely no distortion in the
walls<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.590> box<00:02:57.980> at<00:02:58.220> all<00:02:58.370> that's<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.480> little

foam area is showing up as red white so

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.330 
foam area is showing up as red white so
that<00:03:35.420> means<00:03:35.750> if<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:36.020> put<00:03:36.290> my<00:03:36.440> hand<00:03:36.800> in<00:03:36.980> front<00:03:37.220> of

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
that means if I put my hand in front of

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.240 
that means if I put my hand in front of
it<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:38.120> reads<00:03:38.420> as<00:03:38.690> white-hot<00:03:39.410> heat<00:03:39.770> yeah

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
it it reads as white-hot heat yeah

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.930 
it it reads as white-hot heat yeah
exactly<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:42.160> in<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:43.310> way<00:03:43.520> you<00:03:43.550> can<00:03:43.790> ensure

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
exactly so in this way you can ensure

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.300 
exactly so in this way you can ensure
that<00:03:44.150> every<00:03:44.870> sub<00:03:45.170> day<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.500> completely<00:03:45.920> filled

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
that every sub day is completely filled

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.360 
that every sub day is completely filled
it's<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.090> very<00:03:47.300> reliable<00:03:47.959> way<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.440> show

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
it's a very reliable way to show

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.460 
it's a very reliable way to show
graphically<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.120> we<00:03:50.390> didn't<00:03:50.750> stop<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.260> foam

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
graphically that we didn't stop the foam

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.750 
graphically that we didn't stop the foam
halfway<00:03:52.010> up<00:03:52.160> filled<00:03:52.970> with<00:03:53.150> cavity<00:03:53.540> completely

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760

downstairs<00:03:55.760> in<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.090> room<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.330> we<00:03:56.570> hope<00:03:56.870> will

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
downstairs in a room that we hope will

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.449 
downstairs in a room that we hope will
become<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.380> covered<00:03:57.739> carriage<00:03:58.040> where<00:03:58.280> we've

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
become a covered carriage where we've

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.400 
become a covered carriage where we've
got<00:03:58.640> kind<00:03:59.270> of<00:03:59.330> a<00:03:59.390> problem<00:03:59.660> because<00:03:59.840> mother

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
got kind of a problem because mother

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.220 
got kind of a problem because mother
walls<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.860> very<00:04:00.950> irregular<00:04:01.780> can<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:02.840> tackle

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
walls is very irregular can you tackle

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.590 
walls is very irregular can you tackle
out<00:04:03.350> we<00:04:04.010> got<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.220> solution<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:04.820> no<00:04:05.180> problem

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
out we got a solution to that no problem

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.570 
out we got a solution to that no problem
ah<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:08.390> covered<00:04:08.750> carriageway<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:10.220> its<00:04:10.370> newly

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
ah the covered carriageway but its newly

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.850 
ah the covered carriageway but its newly

us<00:04:12.980> in<00:04:13.130> here<00:04:13.400> well<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:13.760> understand<00:04:14.360> that<00:04:14.480> this

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
us in here well I understand that this

us in here well I understand that this

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
wall may go but I thought we should

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.090 
wall may go but I thought we should
insulate<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:17.930> anyway<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.350> can<00:04:18.590> see<00:04:18.769> some<00:04:18.979> of

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
insulate it anyway you can see some of

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.500 
insulate it anyway you can see some of
the<00:04:19.160> challenges<00:04:19.370> we<00:04:19.850> face<00:04:20.120> all<00:04:20.330> there's

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
the challenges we face all there's

spray the same product onto here

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.250 
spray the same product onto here
it'll<00:04:37.400> probably<00:04:37.550> expand<00:04:38.210> beyond<00:04:38.600> discuss<00:04:39.020> but

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
it'll probably expand beyond discuss but

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260 
it'll probably expand beyond discuss but
we'll<00:04:39.410> come<00:04:39.590> back<00:04:39.770> afterwards<00:04:40.430> as<00:04:40.790> we<00:04:41.000> did<00:04:41.180> at

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
we'll come back afterwards as we did at

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.760 
we'll come back afterwards as we did at
the<00:04:41.360> Eichten<00:04:41.660> house<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.080> trim<00:04:42.229> it<00:04:42.380> off<00:04:42.500> flush

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
the Eichten house and trim it off flush

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.920 
the Eichten house and trim it off flush
so<00:04:43.040> your<00:04:43.190> wall<00:04:43.370> boards<00:04:43.850> go<00:04:44.000> on

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
so your wall boards go on

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.890 
so your wall boards go on
then<00:04:45.380> we<00:04:45.470> got<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.740> ceiling<00:04:46.690> obsessed<00:04:47.690> there's

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
then we got the ceiling obsessed there's

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.600 
then we got the ceiling obsessed there's
gonna<00:04:48.020> be<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.199> bedroom<00:04:48.410> so<00:04:49.220> we're<00:04:49.400> going<00:04:49.520> to

spray the foam directly on the subfloor

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.560 
spray the foam directly on the subfloor
for<00:04:52.100> two<00:04:52.250> reasons<00:04:52.669> one<00:04:52.729> for<00:04:53.030> thermal<00:04:53.270> comfort
