people have been excited for this lately

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.680 
people have been excited for this lately
especially<00:00:07.680> myself<00:00:08.340> because<00:00:09.269> if<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.510> don't

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
especially myself because if you don't

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.959 
especially myself because if you don't
know<00:00:09.960> phase<00:00:10.410> has<00:00:10.620> not<00:00:10.800> uploaded<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.490> nearly

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
know phase has not uploaded in nearly

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.240 
know phase has not uploaded in nearly
three<00:00:12.420> weeks<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:13.530> crazy<00:00:14.009> that's

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
three weeks and that it's crazy that's

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.279 
three weeks and that it's crazy that's
something<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.759> never<00:00:15.059> ever<00:00:15.210> see<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.049> phase

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
something you never ever see for phase

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.140 
something you never ever see for phase
and<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.949> think<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.279> because<00:00:17.430> they're<00:00:17.820> trying

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and I think it's because they're trying

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.689 
and I think it's because they're trying
to<00:00:18.270> hype<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.510> or<00:00:18.930> build<00:00:19.289> up<00:00:19.470> hype<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> new

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
to hype up or build up hype for a new

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.790 
to hype up or build up hype for a new

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.099

if<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.880> guys<00:00:27.060> don't<00:00:27.210> know<00:00:27.359> they<00:00:27.510> uploaded<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
if you guys don't know they uploaded a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.259 
if you guys don't know they uploaded a
trailer<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.130> couple<00:00:29.640> weeks<00:00:29.789> ago<00:00:29.910> or

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
trailer to that a couple weeks ago or

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.089 
trailer to that a couple weeks ago or
it's<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.679> recruitment

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
it's going to be the recruitment

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.889 
it's going to be the recruitment
challenge<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.940> definitely<00:00:33.300> would<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
challenge and I definitely would like to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.450 
challenge and I definitely would like to
see<00:00:34.050> either<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.410> those<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.680> think<00:00:35.040> relapse<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
see either of those I think relapse is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.580 
see either of those I think relapse is
going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> crazy<00:00:36.270> teamtage<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
going to be a crazy teamtage but at the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.750 
going to be a crazy teamtage but at the
same<00:00:37.770> time<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.370> recruitment

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
same time I think the recruitment

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.069 
same time I think the recruitment
challenge<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.300> something<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> lot<00:00:39.840> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.720 
challenge is something that a lot of
people<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.440> been<00:00:40.559> waiting<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.520> such<00:00:41.700> a

actually uploading on a weekly basis I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.780 
actually uploading on a weekly basis I
guess<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> could<00:01:11.040> say<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.340> don't<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> be

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
guess you could say you don't have to be

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.670 
guess you could say you don't have to be
uploading<00:01:12.119> every<00:01:12.210> single<00:01:12.600> day<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.049> they<00:01:13.500> like

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
uploading every single day and they like

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.350 
uploading every single day and they like
it<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:13.979> you're<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.760> an<00:01:14.909> active

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it when you're actually just an active

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760 
it when you're actually just an active
player<00:01:15.689> they<00:01:16.020> don't<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.650> you're

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
player they don't like it when you're

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
player they don't like it when you're
going<00:01:17.430> active<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:17.970> months<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.390> months<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
going active for months and months at a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
going active for months and months at a
time<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.100> something<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
time so I think that's something that

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.830 
time so I think that's something that
the<00:01:20.640> phase<00:01:20.820> leaders<00:01:21.150> are<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.659> really

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the phase leaders are really really

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
the phase leaders are really really
interested<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.369> why<00:01:23.580> I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
interested in right now and that's why I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
interested in right now and that's why I
think<00:01:23.729> Kitty's<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> best<00:01:24.540> contestant<00:01:24.930> ever

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
think Kitty's the best contestant ever

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.770 
think Kitty's the best contestant ever
because<00:01:25.799> he's<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.280> super<00:01:26.490> active<00:01:27.060> he<00:01:27.570> likes

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
because he's just super active he likes

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.330 
because he's just super active he likes
interacting<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.380> his<00:01:28.470> fans<00:01:28.710> he<00:01:28.979> has<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> nice

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
interacting with his fans he has a nice

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.819 
interacting with his fans he has a nice
fan<00:01:29.579> base<00:01:29.790> already<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.380> he's<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.740> of

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
fan base already and I think he's one of

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.980 
fan base already and I think he's one of
the<00:01:31.890> best<00:01:32.040> snipers<00:01:32.549> who<00:01:33.090> were<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.479> fazed<00:01:33.810> at

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the best snipers who were not fazed at

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.870 
the best snipers who were not fazed at
least<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.409> point<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.799> time<00:01:34.829> he<00:01:35.579> has<00:01:35.670> some

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
least at this point in time he has some

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700 
least at this point in time he has some
crazy<00:01:36.060> crazy<00:01:36.479> clips<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.259> guys<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.590> not

player<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:45.019> actually<00:02:45.319> get<00:02:45.769> in<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:45.980> top<00:02:46.130> 100<00:02:46.400> to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
player to actually get in the top 100 to

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.250 
player to actually get in the top 100 to
make<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.090> your<00:02:47.209> goal<00:02:47.239> but<00:02:47.959> i<00:02:48.019> definitely

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
make that your goal but i definitely

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.600 
make that your goal but i definitely
think<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.680> lot<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:48.920> people<00:02:49.040> were<00:02:49.280> watching<00:02:49.400> this

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
think a lot of people were watching this

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.340 
think a lot of people were watching this
video<00:02:49.850> could<00:02:50.030> get<00:02:50.239> in<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.390> top<00:02:50.569> 100<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.170> mean

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
video could get in the top 100 I mean

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.720 
video could get in the top 100 I mean
it's<00:02:51.739> not<00:02:51.830> like<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.190> hardest<00:02:52.459> thing<00:02:52.549> in<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
it's not like the hardest thing in the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.670 
it's not like the hardest thing in the
world<00:02:52.790> but<00:02:53.060> at<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.299> same<00:02:53.510> time<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:54.110> remember

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
world but at the same time I remember

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.410 
world but at the same time I remember
last<00:02:54.860> year<00:02:55.130> some<00:02:55.730> really<00:02:56.060> really<00:02:56.180> good

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
last year some really really good

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.330 
last year some really really good
players<00:02:56.690> did<00:02:57.080> not<00:02:57.290> get<00:02:57.500> in<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.680> top<00:02:57.830> 20<00:02:58.220> but

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
players did not get in the top 20 but

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.729 
players did not get in the top 20 but
they<00:02:58.459> only<00:02:58.610> made<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.030> top<00:02:59.330> 100<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.410> I

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
they only made it to top 100 so I

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.289 
they only made it to top 100 so I
personally<00:03:01.130> think<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.580> that's<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.970> great<00:03:02.180> way

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
personally think that that's a great way

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.580 
personally think that that's a great way

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
than getting myself exposure because

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.550 
than getting myself exposure because
that's<00:05:46.760> just<00:05:46.940> selfish<00:05:47.390> right<00:05:47.630> so<00:05:47.960> what<00:05:48.530> I

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
that's just selfish right so what I

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.290 
that's just selfish right so what I
