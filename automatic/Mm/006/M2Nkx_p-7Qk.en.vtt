00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
you more stability and stuff and a less

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.759 
you more stability and stuff and a less
recoil<00:03:09.090> which<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.810> recordist<00:03:10.260> weapon<00:03:10.560> isn't

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
recoil which the recordist weapon isn't

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.729 
recoil which the recordist weapon isn't
all<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.190> favorable<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.330> not<00:03:12.650> terrible<00:03:13.650> I

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
all that favorable it's not terrible I

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.290 
all that favorable it's not terrible I
guess<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.160> mean<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.430> could<00:03:14.640> kind<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:14.970> use<00:03:15.150> it

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
guess I mean you could kind of use it

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.750 
guess I mean you could kind of use it
but<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:15.780> it's<00:03:15.900> not<00:03:16.140> like<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.920> most<00:03:17.250> accurate

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
but but it's not like this most accurate

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.960 
but but it's not like this most accurate
weapon<00:03:18.530> also<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:20.220> honor<00:03:20.400> sights<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:20.850> this

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
weapon also the honor sights on this

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.509 
weapon also the honor sights on this
weapon<00:03:21.120> aren't<00:03:21.780> all<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.320> amazing<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.489> mean

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
weapon aren't all that amazing I mean

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.819 
weapon aren't all that amazing I mean
you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.120> use<00:03:24.360> them<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:25.170> overall<00:03:25.500> I

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
you can use them but just overall I

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.259 
you can use them but just overall I
don't<00:03:26.130> really<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.700> iron<00:03:26.880> sights<00:03:27.150> on

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
don't really like the iron sights on

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.520 
don't really like the iron sights on
this<00:03:27.360> weapon<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.720> mean<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.930> guess<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.290> could<00:03:28.500> use

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
this weapon I mean I guess I could use

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.890 
this weapon I mean I guess I could use
them<00:03:28.920> but<00:03:29.670> they're<00:03:29.820> just<00:03:29.850> not<00:03:30.120> all<00:03:30.690> that

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
them but they're just not all that

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.400 
them but they're just not all that
amazing

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
amazing

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.949 
amazing
I<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.370> overall<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.209> weapon<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.660> kind<00:03:33.900> of

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
I just overall this weapon is kind of

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.810 
I just overall this weapon is kind of
average<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.739> mean<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.130> kind<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.519> cheap

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
average I mean it's kind of a cheap

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.210 
average I mean it's kind of a cheap
assault<00:03:36.209> rifle<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:36.810> if<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.739> want<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.190> a

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
assault rifle but if you want like a

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.160 
assault rifle but if you want like a
more<00:03:38.549> expensive<00:03:38.790> assault<00:03:39.480> rifle<00:03:39.750> which<00:03:39.930> is

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
more expensive assault rifle which is

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.870 
more expensive assault rifle which is
better<00:03:40.560> than<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.160> would<00:03:41.340> honestly<00:03:41.489> recommend

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
better than I would honestly recommend

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.270 
better than I would honestly recommend
using<00:03:42.299> assault<00:03:42.690> rifle<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.950> carbine

using assault rifle I like the carbine

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.250 
using assault rifle I like the carbine
rifle<00:03:44.670> or<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.000> advanced<00:03:45.359> rifle<00:03:45.720> or<00:03:45.840> any<00:03:46.049> other

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
rifle or the advanced rifle or any other

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.410 
rifle or the advanced rifle or any other
assault<00:03:46.650> rifle<00:03:46.980> really<00:03:47.430> will<00:03:47.700> do<00:03:47.910> better<00:03:48.180> than

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
assault rifle really will do better than

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.960 
assault rifle really will do better than
