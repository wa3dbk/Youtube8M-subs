00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.570
 very good and that we are again in 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.480
 crash to bring you the previous list of 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.700
 minecraft 17.6 that in this case the only thing 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.950
 what has been changed has been the protocol 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.410
 of the names so that instead of 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.539
 load a name when you enter a 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.730
 starting load town is tweet and 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.169
 inside the air because he is already looking for 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.329
 name and others inside the server 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.850
 minecraft so this version is 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.160
 fully prepared so that when 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.059
 make the name change system 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.500
 by the air because it works with this 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.050
 new format no longer the versions 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.260
 Previous of minecraft 1.5 and earlier 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.390
 Well, they are not going to work and he has left us 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.550
 money put questions and answers 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.079
 right on the official website of moya 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.810
 on the post where you have announced that 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.870
 has got the 1.7 points expressed Felix and 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.030
 I will try to help you translate oslo 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.820
 and answer some of the questions that 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.530
 he has answered so many of 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.990
 you who surely also 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.149
 you will have doubts because you want to know not by 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.430
 example there is a question that says yes 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.920
 I can handle a player called font 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.880
 and the name is changed to bar for example 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.850
 to remain 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.200
 if you are going to continue banned also the subject 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.759
 of the white list time will happen 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.640
 exactly the same although in principle 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.070
 there is only the name that had this 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.560
 player at the beginning original it's going 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.240
 to adapt to the air of this player and it 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.729
 change the name by the one you want 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.770
 will always be able to access or 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.750
 always going to be banned or always going to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.869
 have your stats your pets all 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.670
 what they have on a server x I can not 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.939
 steal someone's name I can say 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.720
 I am from herbÃ³n or manu craft 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.880
 restless I'm not from the bon and the names 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.130
 they are still unique you can not have 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.630
 same name that another player will have 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.759
 that change the other player first the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.130
 name so you can wear the 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.170
 name that this player had 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.140
 above therefore prevents boys 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.299
 well the subject of the name thefts as 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.789
 work with the mods which is what goes 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:14.420
 to happen with the mods servers and we 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.430
 says ask the owner or the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.709
 server creator they should be 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.569
 able to support this system wants 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.130
 say the servers but we do not 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.819
 we are responsible for what happens in 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.329
 servers with bots 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.040
 I can change my name and where I'm going 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.079
 to have a cost how often 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.299
 I can do it for the moment says they're going to 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.730
 allow the name change when you 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:40.079
 good when people change over everything 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.060
 most to 1.8 or higher so 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.310
 there is still some time until 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.230
 finish to get this version that 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.079
 supposedly there should be a snapshot 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.840
 of 1.8 but there was no bone 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.120
 that we have been three weeks without any 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.499
 snapshot in no I follow but as well 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.329
 with this question that we had before 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.430
 neither can reveal any detail 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.079
 on how they are going to carry out 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.819
 Name changes will surely be in 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.030
 the official page of motion we will have 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.639
 that block us and in some option that 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.099
 they will put then we can make a 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.389
 name change and it also says 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.819
 they do not know if they are going to put 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:17.430
 restrictions so that people are not 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.159
 changing nor every five minutes by 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.340
 what good I think I should do 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:26.040
 something but not avoid a fixed number of 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.780
 changes but a monthly number per month 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.000
 example that you can not change more than one 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.720
 once or twice of nick per month 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.150
 I believe that 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.090
 pretty good so that people are not 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.970
 change do not happen and almost as yes and good 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.370
 Well, it's something anyway, like 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.290
 you know there's absolutely nothing yet 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.690
 so you do not know what it is that 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.420
 it will finally end up happening 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.160
 so where can I change my name and 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.170
 again up read the answer is 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.910
 I still do not know how they are going to 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.380
 do I own a server that 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.840
 I have to do when I update to the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.700
 1.7 point 6 nothing should not be done 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.200
 absolutely nothing because the cyber is 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.970
 they saw it works exactly the same as 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.730
 the files of the other servers 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.270
 minecraft to date but it's not going to 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.760
 be compatible with minecraft 1.7 point 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.390
 51.7 point 41 point of 7.2 etcetera 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.400
 although in the versions of the 1.7 points 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.080
 because it has become compatible up to 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.299
 the 1.7 points 5 because the only thing 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.790
 changed was the system of tweets but 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.740
 in 1.7 point six change the format 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.870
 it can not 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.940
 good can not play 1.7 players 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.690
 points 6 in series from 1 point 7.5 and 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.880
 vice versa 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.130
 2 players of the 1 point 7.5 can not 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.480
 play on servers 1.7 points 6 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.630
 for this system 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.480
 the name change from nick to chili 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.490
 so I can breathe and then if there's 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.730
 one more question they say I have 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.350
 I need a hug and he says amen 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.970
 here small take a hug do not you 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.200
 worry is not as difficult as it seems 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.490
 well up here is this little one this 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.470
 little answer question that what 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.330
 only we have about the 12 points 7.6 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.890
 but in the is that is what we are 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.310
 using right now because I'm a stick 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.750
 because he does not charge me to the air and good boy 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.920
 I hope you liked it if so 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.820
 favorite harlequin see you in the 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.820
