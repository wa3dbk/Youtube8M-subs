00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
like a flat type of feel to it so it's a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.400 
like a flat type of feel to it so it's a
little<00:00:39.090> different<00:00:39.540> feel<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.020> not<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
little different feel it's not the the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.860 
little different feel it's not the the
typical<00:00:41.190> silicone<00:00:42.180> when<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> think<00:00:42.719> of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
typical silicone when you think of

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
typical silicone when you think of
silicone<00:00:43.379> when<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> silicone<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
silicone when you think of silicone you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.810 
silicone when you think of silicone you
think<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.390> jelly<00:00:46.200> type<00:00:47.100> case<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.700> it's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
think of that jelly type case but it's

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
think of that jelly type case but it's
not<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> jelly<00:00:48.420> type<00:00:48.629> case<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> flat

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
not a jelly type case it's like a flat

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.060 
not a jelly type case it's like a flat
matte<00:00:50.489> type<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.000> feel<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
matte type of feel to it and on the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.069 
matte type of feel to it and on the
inside<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.610> does<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.329> really<00:00:54.840> nice

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
inside it does have that really nice

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.099 
inside it does have that really nice
padded<00:00:56.120> material<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> inside<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
padded material on the inside so it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.529 
padded material on the inside so it
doesn't<00:00:58.440> scratch<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:58.980> phone<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> really

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
doesn't scratch your phone so a really

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.049 
doesn't scratch your phone so a really
really<00:01:00.750> nice<00:01:00.930> quality<00:01:01.260> feel<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.160> we'll

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
really nice quality feel to it and we'll

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.960 
really nice quality feel to it and we'll
take<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.329> six<00:01:03.600> plus<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.220> usually<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.580> push

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
take my six plus and I usually just push

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.480 
take my six plus and I usually just push
the<00:01:06.180> tops<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.659> first<00:01:07.049> push<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.040> align<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the tops in first push it up align it

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
the tops in first push it up align it
and<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.090> plump<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> bottoms<00:01:10.409> down

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and then I just plump the bottoms down

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.179 
and then I just plump the bottoms down
so<00:01:11.250> very<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:11.970> easy<00:01:12.240> fitment<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.950> case

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so very very easy fitment for this case

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
so very very easy fitment for this case
and<00:01:14.490> I'll<00:01:15.150> try<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
and I'll try and get out of the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.020 
and I'll try and get out of the
reflection<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.340> right

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
reflection here but you can see right

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.780 
reflection here but you can see right
there<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> does<00:01:19.500> wrap<00:01:19.710> around<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
there so it does wrap around the the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.760 
there so it does wrap around the the
front<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.390> bit<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.780> kind<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
front a little bit all kind of do this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.160 
front a little bit all kind of do this
so<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> guys<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.670> gives<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.509> slight<00:01:24.840> lip

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
so you guys can see gives a slight lip

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.120 
so you guys can see gives a slight lip
to<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.080> course<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.530> does<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
to it and it of course it does have the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.240 
to it and it of course it does have the
exposure<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.329> your<00:01:30.479> switch<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> side<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
exposure for your switch on the side the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.980 
exposure for your switch on the side the
volume<00:01:32.520> controls<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.030> very<00:01:33.210> easy<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> press

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
volume controls are very easy to press

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.450 
volume controls are very easy to press
and<00:01:34.700> on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> does

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and on the back so you can see it does

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.399 
and on the back so you can see it does
have<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> opening<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.720> camera<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
have just the opening for the camera and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.600 
have just the opening for the camera and
if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.180> does<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:43.229> little

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.929 
my other video on the OEM leather case
for<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.780> phone<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.549> it's<00:01:59.549> kind<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
for this phone and it's kind of a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.429 
for this phone and it's kind of a
personal<00:02:00.299> preference<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.990> about<00:02:01.170> ten

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
personal preference this is about ten

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.130 
personal preference this is about ten
dollars<00:02:01.740> cheaper<00:02:02.090> than<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.299> leather<00:02:03.750> case

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
dollars cheaper than the leather case

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.679 
dollars cheaper than the leather case
that<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.130> get<00:02:05.280> for<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.390> exactly

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that you can get for it and it's exactly

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.190 
that you can get for it and it's exactly
the<00:02:06.990> same<00:02:07.200> fitment<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.060> kind<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.479> your

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the same fitment so it's kind of a your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.990 
the same fitment so it's kind of a your
choice<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.099> what<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.760> and
