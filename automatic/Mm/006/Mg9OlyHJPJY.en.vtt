00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
books he wrote good calories bad

books he wrote good calories bad
calories<00:00:28.290> and<00:00:29.160> also<00:00:29.460> why<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.030> get<00:00:30.180> back<00:00:30.330> I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
calories and also why we get back I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.229 
calories and also why we get back I
wonder<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:32.820> he's<00:00:32.910> gonna<00:00:33.059> have

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
wonder if what if he's gonna have

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.479 
wonder if what if he's gonna have
anything<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> say<00:00:33.780> about<00:00:33.899> sugar<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.920> carbs

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
anything to say about sugar and carbs

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.150 
anything to say about sugar and carbs
and<00:00:35.699> our<00:00:35.940> food<00:00:36.089> culture<00:00:36.510> let's<00:00:37.379> find<00:00:37.589> out<00:00:37.739> oh<00:00:40.160> I

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
and our food culture let's find out oh I

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.049 
and our food culture let's find out oh I
have<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.760> walk<00:00:43.460> if<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> think<00:00:44.699> about<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.879> this

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
have to walk if you think about it this

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.630 
have to walk if you think about it this
way<00:00:45.120> every<00:00:45.859> nutrient<00:00:46.859> you<00:00:46.980> consume<00:00:47.370> protein

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
way every nutrient you consume protein

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.849 
way every nutrient you consume protein
fat<00:00:48.239> carbohydrates<00:00:48.449> in<00:00:49.409> with<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> type<00:00:49.829> of

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
fat carbohydrates in with the type of

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.950 
fat carbohydrates in with the type of
carbohydrates<00:00:50.760> even<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.089> type<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.359> fats<00:00:51.780> have

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
carbohydrates even the type of fats have

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.619 
carbohydrates even the type of fats have
different<00:00:52.530> effects<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.249> the<00:00:53.629> hormone

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
different effects on the hormone

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
different effects on the hormone
specifically<00:00:55.319> this<00:00:55.469> hormone<00:00:55.800> insulin<00:00:56.010> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
specifically this hormone insulin that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
specifically this hormone insulin that
regulates<00:00:57.480> fat<00:00:57.719> accumulation<00:00:58.350> actually

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
regulates fat accumulation actually

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.959 
regulates fat accumulation actually
regulates<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.729> storage<00:01:00.179> of<00:01:00.239> fat<00:01:00.510> fat<00:01:00.929> cells

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
regulates the storage of fat fat cells

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.070 
regulates the storage of fat fat cells
so<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.659> way<00:01:04.050> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
so if you think about it that way and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
so if you think about it that way and
this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.500> an<00:01:04.650> idea<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.240> sort<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.300> had<00:01:06.510> its

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this is an idea that sort of had its

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
this is an idea that sort of had its
provenance<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.920> pre-world<00:01:08.310> War<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.880> Germany

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
provenance in pre-world War to Germany

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.390 
provenance in pre-world War to Germany
and<00:01:09.540> Austria<00:01:10.020> where<00:01:10.140> obesity<00:01:10.500> researchers

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and Austria where obesity researchers

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
and Austria where obesity researchers
had<00:01:11.670> come<00:01:11.910> to<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.390> obesity<00:01:13.050> as<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
had come to think of obesity as a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
had come to think of obesity as a
hormonal<00:01:13.680> defect<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.550> an<00:01:14.730> energy<00:01:15.180> balance

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
hormonal defect not an energy balance

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.500 
hormonal defect not an energy balance
problem<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.460> picks<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
problem and then it picks up in the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.990 
problem and then it picks up in the
early<00:01:18.750> 1960s<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.280> discovery<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.760> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
early 1960s with the discovery that the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
early 1960s with the discovery that the
hormone<00:01:21.330> insulin<00:01:21.410> regulates<00:01:22.410> fat

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
hormone insulin regulates fat

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
hormone insulin regulates fat
accumulation<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> think<00:01:24.420> about<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.630> that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
accumulation if you think about it that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.040 
accumulation if you think about it that
way<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:26.550> problem<00:01:26.940> with<00:01:27.090> modern<00:01:27.480> diets

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
way then the problem with modern diets

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.170 
way then the problem with modern diets
the<00:01:28.530> reason<00:01:28.860> people<00:01:28.980> get<00:01:29.250> fat<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.730> not<00:01:29.910> because

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the reason people get fat is not because

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.390 
the reason people get fat is not because
they<00:01:30.300> expend<00:01:30.780> more<00:01:31.050> taken<00:01:31.650> more<00:01:31.860> energy<00:01:32.250> than

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
they expend more taken more energy than

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.350 
they expend more taken more energy than
they<00:01:32.580> expend<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.300> because<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:35.360> carbohydrate

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
they expend but because the carbohydrate

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.510 
they expend but because the carbohydrate
content<00:01:36.660> of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.230> diet<00:01:37.470> stimulates<00:01:38.280> insulin

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
content of the diet stimulates insulin

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.060 
content of the diet stimulates insulin
secretion<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:40.410> insulin<00:01:40.890> secretion

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
secretion and that insulin secretion

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.120 
secretion and that insulin secretion
stimulates<00:01:42.030> fat<00:01:42.330> storage<00:01:42.930> pretty<00:01:43.680> much<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
stimulates fat storage pretty much that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.780 
stimulates fat storage pretty much that
simple<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.410> until<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.650> 1960s<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
simple and until the 1960s the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.920 
simple and until the 1960s the
conventional<00:01:48.330> wisdom<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
conventional wisdom with the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.570 
conventional wisdom with the
carbohydrates<00:01:49.680> who<00:01:49.860> are<00:01:49.950> uniquely<00:01:50.220> fat

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
carbohydrates who are uniquely fat

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.330 
carbohydrates who are uniquely fat
nobody<00:01:51.540> knew<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.020> lit<00:01:52.230> what<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.590> meant<00:01:52.980> but

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
nobody knew we lit what that meant but

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.030 
nobody knew we lit what that meant but
the<00:01:53.940> idea<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.690> if<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.470> didn't<00:01:55.680> want<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.920> be

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the idea it was if you didn't want to be

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.740 
the idea it was if you didn't want to be
fat<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.520> were<00:01:56.580> specific<00:01:56.790> food<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.540> didn't

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
fat there were specific food you didn't

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.600 
fat there were specific food you didn't
eat<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.530> BBM<00:01:59.130> Fred
