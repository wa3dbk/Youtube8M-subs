00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.310
 very good poor as we are come 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.590
 they are a video in today's video we are going to 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.770
 paint in black as you see here 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.800
 I did this for two reasons 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.869
 mainly the first one because 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.790
 camouflage a bit the image of goal but 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.020
 you know how good the upr is known in 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.810
 everybody then you if you see a 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.190
 a little silvery thing with a with 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.580
 the objective in the middle already recognizes it 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.170
 like a hole and well then well if the 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.239
 you see so you do not recognize so much that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.910
 It is a web for truth because that for 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.220
 disguise a bit that is a go pro of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.770
 face the thieves and do not call the 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.820
 attention let's say a thief steal already 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.239
 before an original then that a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.520
 an invitation or some the value is 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.010
 There I do not care what it is like, I'm not going 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.300
 to look determined 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.020
 and the second reason 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.760
 is to camouflage the because the silver that 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.159
 it has before the metallic color flame 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.600
 much attention and many times the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.420
 I want to go unnoticed here in the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.270
 chest and good I wear black clothes and such and 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.700
 does not stand out much you see a lot between 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.960
 between the clothes and put where you put it 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.980
 will stand out because it is a color 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.020
 bright with reflected light 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.510
 and black because it goes unnoticed 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.000
 you can put like that in one place and you can not see 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.240
 and those are the two reasons to paint it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.680
 what I did was first, first of all 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.350
 remove the case very carefully is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.930
 very easy to remove 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.229
 it's like a mobile phone case that 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.140
 you put the nails strips and the 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.610
 casing before removing anything having it 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.040
 everything very well organized because I am 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.590
 a disaster and I broke the button 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.990
 turn on a good run a little bit 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.680
 that goes attached to the case broke me and 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.399
 I also lost a little light, I did not lose 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.840
 what is the led light but I lost here 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.070
 I'm a disaster , I know, so 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.989
 you be very careful when 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.510
 you take everything good something all very well 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.980
 organized before you start working and 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.200
 once we have removed the casing 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.260
 we have everything well ordered the lights 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.410
 out and button you also take it out a lot 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.020
 be careful as we proceed to sand it on the side 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.330
 pro has as a kind of 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.150
 plastic 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.620
 a kind of waxed then if you 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.680
 you fix with the nail and screw it is that comes out 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.340
 and then the color is left with a 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.650
 coarse-grained sandpaper you still fix and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.599
 Well, if you want I gave him a fine 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.269
 you give good well good you choose everything for 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.209
 all parties can even give you 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.630
 the turn put the sandpaper on the table and 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.800
 pass over the 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:01.230
 the case you also very well left him 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.120
 all the edges and you also choose very 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.460
 ok the button that is also going to 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.390
 paint and once you have it very well 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.640
 sanding then clean the case the button 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.590
 with water but if you have alcohol a lot 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.480
 better because alcohol disinfects 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.570
 and perfectly clean all traces of 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.880
 paint or any material so what 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.360
 clean very well with a napkin and 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.820
 Once you have it ready without any remains 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.650
 of metallic paint of this one and ready 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.569
 to paint I painted it with a spray 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.290
 montana in color mars 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.450
 the spray model is 94 the graffiti artists 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.579
 They will understand me because I'm not interested 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.549
 not that brilliant finish gave him 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.829
 much more premium to the camera and for 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.530
 paint it then just hit a 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.319
 cardboard so as not to stain the table both 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.349
 pieces with insulating tape and on a 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.530
 cardboard on the table with the spray I gave him 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:01.629
 a few passes on the sides to 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.629
 that is painted all right 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.080
 and he hopes that that case he was 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.860
 dry with a remover 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.850
 and I started to mount the camera 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.170
 as one of the lights I lost them because 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.880
 What I did was use paper from 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.980
 onion you know the paper or onion 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.630
 to trace then use a piece of 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.880
 that with challenge on both sides to 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.670
 that is like waterproof and stick it 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.050
 inside to the housing and it was pretty 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.889
 well the truth 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.340
 and then the button I put everything and nothing 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:37.129
 is I put back the casing in the operated 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.559
 squeezing well and you 're 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.050
 it was as simple as new a 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:44.409
 very industrial finish to be made 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.409
 at home 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.560
 and as you can see, the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.290
 lights the button keeps working the 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.590
 lights continue to turn on and off and not 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.990
 is at a distance and so it remained 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.710
 this seems a bit wild to you 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.090
 paint her gopro having to choose the one 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.410
 Once you have it so new bought but 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.409
 well once you have time with 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.749
 she then the function of water is to record 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.849
 the finish of how it will look like 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:15.279
 no matter how important it is that you record well 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.050
 and good and hard drums and all that it 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:19.899
 other is one of the buttons of the lights 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.089
 with much later that more gives that it is 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:24.039
 black that is blue that is transparent and 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:26.319
 if you have a cheap camera and you want 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.569
 It looks like a lake but you can paint the 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:32.229
 of metallic gray you put there with 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:35.339
 felt-tip pen I buy 4 black edition and 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.779
 good to her happens to go through a 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:40.619
 Buying truth now 6 they steal it 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.989
 also 9 life I have this camera here 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:44.889
 from the Chinese that nobody is going to steal from me 

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:46.719
 come I hope you liked this 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.649
 video and see you in the next poor 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.649
 bye
