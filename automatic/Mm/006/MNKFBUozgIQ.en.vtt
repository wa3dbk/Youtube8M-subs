00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.139 
little bit more style than sort of a
little<00:00:49.860> box<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.579> normally<00:00:50.700> float

little box which you normally float
around<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.590> I've<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.890> bit<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
around in so here I've got a bit like a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.709 
around in so here I've got a bit like a
dark<00:00:53.640> area<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.480> we're<00:00:54.629> gonna

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
dark area here so we're gonna

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.299 
dark area here so we're gonna
demonstrate<00:00:55.020> how<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.920> mod<00:00:56.100> it's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
really really straightforward which is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.569 
really really straightforward which is
fantastic<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.559> yet<00:00:59.219> we're<00:00:59.309> gonna<00:00:59.399> get

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
fantastic and yet we're gonna get

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
fantastic and yet we're gonna get
started<00:00:59.760> straightaway<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
started straightaway so this is just the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.799 
started straightaway so this is just the
little<00:01:01.920> thing<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> built<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.480> second

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
little thing that I built just a second

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.179 
little thing that I built just a second
ago<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.409> kind<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.739> supposed<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.129> be

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
ago here it's kind of supposed to be

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.760 
ago here it's kind of supposed to be
like<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> speedboat<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.140> basic<00:01:07.380> one

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
like a speedboat but a very basic one

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.500 
like a speedboat but a very basic one
the<00:01:08.400> thing<00:01:08.580> about<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.909> mod<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.390> can

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the thing about this mod is you can

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.270 
the thing about this mod is you can
pretty<00:01:09.659> much<00:01:09.750> make<00:01:09.900> these<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.680> big<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.189> as

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
pretty much make these as big or as

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.429 
pretty much make these as big or as
small<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:13.290> there<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
small as you like so I do think there is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.080 
small as you like so I do think there is
a<00:01:13.530> block<00:01:13.830> limit<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> how<00:01:14.369> big<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.939> make

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
a block limit to how big you can make

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.820 
a block limit to how big you can make
them<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.590> quite

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
them but I do think it's actually quite

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
them but I do think it's actually quite
big<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.610> top<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:18.060> head<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> think<00:01:18.360> it's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
big off the top of my head I think it's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.620 
big off the top of my head I think it's
around<00:01:19.049> 2000<00:01:19.890> blocks<00:01:20.189> which<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.479> can

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
around 2000 blocks which as you can

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.480 
around 2000 blocks which as you can
imagine<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> pretty<00:01:22.439> big<00:01:22.740> ship<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.280> can

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
imagine is a pretty big ship so you can

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.480 
imagine is a pretty big ship so you can
make<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> pirate<00:01:24.090> ship<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.750> ferry<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
make like a pirate ship or a ferry or a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.850 
make like a pirate ship or a ferry or a
cruise<00:01:27.180> liner<00:01:27.600> or<00:01:27.869> ever<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.200> want<00:01:28.409> I've<00:01:28.619> kind

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
cruise liner or ever you want I've kind

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.200 
cruise liner or ever you want I've kind
of<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:28.950> gone<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.490> powerboat<00:01:30.000> here

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
of just gone for a little powerboat here

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.490 
of just gone for a little powerboat here
for<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> second<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> demonstrate

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
for a second just to kind of demonstrate

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.710 
for a second just to kind of demonstrate
and<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:33.000> you're<00:01:33.119> going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> need<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> start

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and what you're going to need to start

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.260 
and what you're going to need to start
this<00:01:33.869> off<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.460> basically<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.970> block

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this off is basically just one block

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.569 
this off is basically just one block
which<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.439> most<00:01:37.650> useful<00:01:37.920> block<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.369> here

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
which is the most useful block in here

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.190 
which is the most useful block in here
which<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.759> called<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.270> ship's<00:01:39.509> helm<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:40.049> this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
which is called the ship's helm now this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.719 
which is called the ship's helm now this
is<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> control<00:01:41.220> center<00:01:41.700> for

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
is kind of like the control center for

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.340 
is kind of like the control center for
the<00:01:41.939> boat<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> are<00:01:42.570> gonna<00:01:42.780> need<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.170> in

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
the boat and you are gonna need this in

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.319 
the boat and you are gonna need this in
order<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:43.799> them<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.070> work<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:45.090> they're

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
order to get them to work so they're

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.179 
order to get them to work so they're
really<00:01:45.600> easy<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.020> make<00:01:46.170> relatively<00:01:46.770> cheap<00:01:47.009> as

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
really easy to make relatively cheap as

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
really easy to make relatively cheap as
well<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.790> an<00:01:48.119> iron<00:01:48.329> ingot<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.960> three

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
well it's just an iron ingot with three

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.740 
well it's just an iron ingot with three
sticker<00:01:49.740> four<00:01:50.070> three<00:01:50.430> four<00:01:50.820> sticks<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.329> in

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
sticker four three four sticks and in

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.420 
sticker four three four sticks and in
four<00:01:52.020> oak<00:01:52.229> planks<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.070> gives<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
four oak planks and then that gives you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.010 
four oak planks and then that gives you
the<00:01:53.579> ship's<00:01:53.790> helm<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.630> whilst<00:01:54.840> you're

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the ship's helm and then whilst you're

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.149 
the ship's helm and then whilst you're
at<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.259> might<00:01:55.409> as<00:01:55.530> well<00:01:55.619> make<00:01:55.799> these<00:01:55.979> as

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
at it you might as well make these as

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.170 
at it you might as well make these as
well<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.549> they're<00:01:56.670> pretty<00:01:56.850> nice

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
well because they're pretty nice

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.399 
well because they're pretty nice
addition<00:01:57.659> these<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.960> measurement

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
addition these are the measurement

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.740 
addition these are the measurement
gauges<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> these<00:01:59.790> actually<00:01:59.939> move<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.540> stuff

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
gauges and these actually move and stuff

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.209 
gauges and these actually move and stuff
when<00:02:01.049> you're<00:02:01.200> sailing<00:02:01.500> which<00:02:01.860> shows<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
when you're sailing which shows you the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.760 
when you're sailing which shows you the
direction<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.969> speed<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.960> location<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
direction and speed and the location and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800 
direction and speed and the location and
all<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.040> stuff<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.610> these<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> little<00:02:06.719> bit

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
all that stuff so these are a little bit

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.809 
all that stuff so these are a little bit
more<00:02:06.960> expensive<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:08.099> two<00:02:08.250> iron<00:02:08.459> ingots

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
more expensive but just two iron ingots

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.720 
more expensive but just two iron ingots
two<00:02:09.090> gold<00:02:09.509> ingots<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.200> redstone<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.890> two

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
two gold ingots one redstone and two

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.270 
two gold ingots one redstone and two
glass<00:02:12.090> panes

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
glass panes

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.770 
glass panes
a<00:02:13.310> couple<00:02:13.730> more<00:02:13.819> items<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.450> see<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:14.660> is

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
a couple more items you can see this is

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.420 
a couple more items you can see this is
bobbing<00:02:15.050> up<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.230> down<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:16.340> government

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
bobbing up and down a just government

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.250 
bobbing up and down a just government
items<00:02:16.940> whilst<00:02:17.330> were<00:02:17.510> here<00:02:17.540> we've<00:02:17.930> got<00:02:18.080> this

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
items whilst were here we've got this

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.620 
items whilst were here we've got this
which<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.770> floater<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:19.730> these<00:02:19.850> are<00:02:20.120> floats

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
which is the floater so these are floats

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.030 
which is the floater so these are floats
that<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.870> can<00:02:20.990> attach<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> underside<00:02:22.010> of

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
that you can attach to the underside of

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.530 
that you can attach to the underside of
your<00:02:22.160> ship<00:02:22.520> which<00:02:22.760> means<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.150> when<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.390> put

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
your ship which means that when you put

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.150 
your ship which means that when you put
it<00:02:23.630> in<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.810> water<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.350> will<00:02:24.590> actually<00:02:24.920> float

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
it in the water it will actually float

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.010 
it in the water it will actually float
higher<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.790> haven't<00:02:26.330> got<00:02:26.450> any<00:02:26.600> of<00:02:26.690> these<00:02:26.810> on

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
higher I haven't got any of these on

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.540 
higher I haven't got any of these on
because<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.319> kind<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.650> wanted<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.950> keep<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.310> at

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
because I kind of wanted to keep it at

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.520 
because I kind of wanted to keep it at
water<00:02:29.330> level<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.870> can<00:02:30.050> make<00:02:30.170> your<00:02:30.290> ships

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
water level but you can make your ships

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.650 
water level but you can make your ships
higher<00:02:30.739> in<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> water<00:02:31.130> using<00:02:31.580> these<00:02:31.700> or<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.120> bit

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
higher in the water using these or a bit

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.240 
higher in the water using these or a bit
more<00:02:32.810> usefully<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.470> can<00:02:33.620> transfer<00:02:34.010> them<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
more usefully you can transfer them to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.830 
more usefully you can transfer them to
make<00:02:34.520> them<00:02:34.670> into<00:02:34.850> Shore<00:02:35.120> buffers<00:02:35.510> which<00:02:35.720> I

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
make them into Shore buffers which I

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.630 
make them into Shore buffers which I
will<00:02:35.989> demonstrate<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.560> second<00:02:36.920> but<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.520> is

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
will demonstrate in a second but that is

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.280 
will demonstrate in a second but that is
the<00:02:37.790> floater<00:02:38.030> again<00:02:38.390> with<00:02:38.600> an<00:02:38.720> ink<00:02:38.870> sack<00:02:39.110> and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
the floater again with an ink sack and

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.170 
the floater again with an ink sack and
then<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.500> will<00:02:39.590> give<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.830> these<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:41.090> I'm

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
then that will give you these so I'm

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.460 
then that will give you these so I'm
actually<00:02:41.300> going<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.660> stop<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.080> ship<00:02:42.140> here

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
actually going to stop this ship here

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.229 
actually going to stop this ship here
I'm<00:02:42.560> actually<00:02:42.650> going<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:42.980> mount<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.459> Oh<00:02:43.640> God

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
I'm actually going to mount it Oh God

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.910 
I'm actually going to mount it Oh God
there<00:02:44.780> we<00:02:44.840> go<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.170> I'm<00:02:45.470> gonna<00:02:45.590> click

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
there we go and I'm gonna click

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.259 
there we go and I'm gonna click
backspace<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.489> that's<00:02:46.790> going<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.970> stop<00:02:47.239> the

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
backspace and that's going to stop the

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.509 
backspace and that's going to stop the
ship<00:02:47.600> because<00:02:48.470> this<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.739> kind<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:48.980> how<00:02:49.160> you

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
ship because this is kind of how you

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.160 
ship because this is kind of how you
start<00:02:49.820> off<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:50.150> basically<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.840> build<00:02:51.019> it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
start off you basically have to build it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.360 
start off you basically have to build it
from<00:02:51.230> scratch<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:51.769> can<00:02:51.920> do<00:02:52.010> whatever<00:02:52.160> you

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
from scratch so you can do whatever you

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.640 
from scratch so you can do whatever you
want<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.700> little<00:02:53.180> tip<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:54.230> when<00:02:54.560> you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
want a little tip is to when you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.410 
want a little tip is to when you
actually<00:02:54.980> build<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.340> boat<00:02:55.489> try<00:02:56.030> not<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.269> have

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
actually build the boat try not to have

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.720 
actually build the boat try not to have
any<00:02:56.660> blocks<00:02:57.080> touching<00:02:57.739> on<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.310> bottom

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
any blocks touching on the bottom

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.250 
any blocks touching on the bottom
because<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.390> has<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.690> be<00:02:59.780> kind<00:02:59.959> of<00:02:59.989> like<00:03:00.110> an

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
because it has to be kind of like an

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.140 
because it has to be kind of like an
isolated<00:03:00.830> floating<00:03:01.250> unit<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.670> order<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.940> do

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
isolated floating unit in order to do

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.820 
isolated floating unit in order to do
that<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.510> if<00:03:02.840> you're<00:03:02.989> attached<00:03:03.319> like<00:03:03.560> one<00:03:03.739> of

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
that and if you're attached like one of

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.650 
that and if you're attached like one of
these<00:03:03.950> blocks<00:03:04.250> on<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.459> floor<00:03:04.670> here<00:03:04.910> then<00:03:05.540> it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
these blocks on the floor here then it

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.500 
these blocks on the floor here then it
won't<00:03:05.900> actually<00:03:06.110> allow<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.890> do<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.510> which

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
won't actually allow you to do it which

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.910 
won't actually allow you to do it which
is<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.690> good<00:03:08.959> tip<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.290> these<00:03:09.440> these<00:03:09.769> are

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
is a good tip but these these are

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.710 
is a good tip but these these are
actually<00:03:10.160> very<00:03:10.340> useful<00:03:10.550> and<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.569> we're

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
actually very useful and so we're

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.150 
actually very useful and so we're
actually<00:03:11.810> going<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.080> look<00:03:12.140> at<00:03:12.410> how<00:03:13.100> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
actually going to look at how the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.620 
actually going to look at how the
interface<00:03:13.790> works<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.269> it's<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.540> little

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
interface works and it's just a little

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.410 
interface works and it's just a little
demo<00:03:14.900> one<00:03:15.170> here<00:03:15.350> just<00:03:15.650> kind<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.250> for<00:03:17.030> funsies

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
demo one here just kind of for funsies

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.560 
demo one here just kind of for funsies
this<00:03:18.140> is<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.190> helm<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:20.030> what<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.299> do<00:03:20.450> is

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
this is the the helm and what you do is

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.550 
this is the the helm and what you do is
when<00:03:20.690> you're<00:03:20.840> ready<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:21.230> actually

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
when you're ready you actually

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.050 
when you're ready you actually
right-click<00:03:22.160> it<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.370> then<00:03:22.640> this<00:03:22.730> will<00:03:22.910> give

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
right-click it and then this will give

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.819 
right-click it and then this will give
you<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.450> little<00:03:23.780> bit<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.989> info<00:03:24.290> about<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.650> ship

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
you a little bit of info about the ship

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.520 
you a little bit of info about the ship
itself<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.820> you<00:03:26.600> can<00:03:26.750> change<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.110> name<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.320> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
itself so you can change the name of the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.500 
itself so you can change the name of the
ship<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.430> then<00:03:28.579> once<00:03:28.850> you're<00:03:29.000> ready<00:03:29.180> what<00:03:29.420> you

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
ship and then once you're ready what you

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.420 
ship and then once you're ready what you
do<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.930> can<00:03:30.110> compile<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.739> ship<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.400> that

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
do is you can compile the ship so that

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.370 
do is you can compile the ship so that
will<00:03:31.670> take<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.090> 39<00:03:32.660> blocks<00:03:32.870> which<00:03:33.200> are

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
will take the 39 blocks which are

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.440 
will take the 39 blocks which are
attached<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.610> ship's<00:03:34.910> helm<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.360> that

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
attached to the ship's helm and that

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.390 
attached to the ship's helm and that
will<00:03:35.600> count<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.019> as<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.320> boat<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.890> then<00:03:37.250> when

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
will count it as that boat and then when

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.590 
will count it as that boat and then when
you're<00:03:37.519> ready<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:37.730> launch<00:03:38.000> all<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:38.360> need<00:03:38.510> to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
you're ready to launch all you need to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.449 
you're ready to launch all you need to
do<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.930> Mount<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.320> ship<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.799> then<00:03:39.980> boom<00:03:40.220> you

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
do is Mount the ship and then boom you

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.340 
do is Mount the ship and then boom you
are<00:03:40.489> floating<00:03:41.000> now<00:03:41.510> these<00:03:41.750> things<00:03:41.959> are<00:03:42.200> useful

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
are floating now these things are useful

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.130 
are floating now these things are useful
you<00:03:42.620> see<00:03:42.769> these<00:03:42.890> are<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:44.630> buffers<00:03:44.930> there

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
you see these are the the buffers there

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.660 
you see these are the the buffers there
because<00:03:45.470> what<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.070> means<00:03:46.280> is<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:46.640> will

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
because what it means is that it will

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.310 
because what it means is that it will
actually<00:03:46.760> separate<00:03:47.570> away<00:03:47.720> from<00:03:48.140> these

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
actually separate away from these

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.080 
actually separate away from these
buffers<00:03:48.769> which<00:03:49.160> will<00:03:49.310> allow<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.579> to<00:03:49.700> kind<00:03:49.910> of

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
buffers which will allow you to kind of

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.460 
buffers which will allow you to kind of
build<00:03:50.299> off<00:03:50.450> them<00:03:50.720> but<00:03:50.870> they<00:03:50.989> weren't<00:03:51.109> actually

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
build off them but they weren't actually

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.960 
build off them but they weren't actually
count<00:03:51.709> as<00:03:51.829> part<00:03:52.010> of<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.280> ship<00:03:52.489> which<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:52.790> very

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
count as part of the ship which is very

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.400 
count as part of the ship which is very
very<00:03:53.120> cool<00:03:53.390> so<00:03:53.570> you<00:03:53.630> know<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.780> can<00:03:53.989> sail<00:03:54.200> this

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
very cool so you know you can sail this

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.920 
very cool so you know you can sail this
thing<00:03:54.590> away<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.070> those<00:03:55.910> buffers<00:03:56.540> will<00:03:56.720> still

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
thing away and those buffers will still

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.870 
thing away and those buffers will still
be<00:03:57.049> kept<00:03:57.260> there<00:03:57.560> which<00:03:58.010> is<00:03:58.190> very<00:03:58.400> good<00:03:58.670> which

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
be kept there which is very good which

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.280 
be kept there which is very good which
means<00:03:59.030> it's<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.329> little<00:03:59.630> bit<00:03:59.720> easier<00:03:59.750> to<00:04:00.109> build

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
means it's a little bit easier to build

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.870 
means it's a little bit easier to build
in<00:04:00.500> sort<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.680> deep<00:04:00.890> oceans<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.489> stuff<00:04:01.670> because

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
in sort of deep oceans and stuff because

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.280 
in sort of deep oceans and stuff because
you<00:04:01.970> do<00:04:02.120> have<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.329> point<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.780> kind<00:04:02.959> of<00:04:02.989> cross

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
you do have a point to kind of cross

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.620 
you do have a point to kind of cross
over<00:04:03.700> but<00:04:04.700> yeah<00:04:04.820> once<00:04:05.000> you're<00:04:05.120> ready<00:04:05.269> I'm

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
over but yeah once you're ready I'm

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.789 
over but yeah once you're ready I'm
going<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.930> get<00:04:06.230> out<00:04:06.320> of<00:04:06.410> this<00:04:06.470> one<00:04:06.680> because

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
going to get out of this one because

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.620 
going to get out of this one because
this<00:04:06.980> yeah<00:04:07.609> they're<00:04:07.820> kind<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.030> like<00:04:08.209> attaches

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
this yeah they're kind of like attaches

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.970 
this yeah they're kind of like attaches
back<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:08.959> stuff<00:04:09.140> which<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:09.320> pretty<00:04:09.560> cool

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
back and stuff which is pretty cool

you're<00:04:24.860> going<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.039> compile<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.580> ship<00:04:25.789> and<00:04:25.940> you

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
you're going to compile the ship and you

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
there's overflow which means that you

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.580 
there's overflow which means that you
cannot<00:04:28.889> create<00:04:29.220> vehicles<00:04:29.400> with<00:04:29.850> more<00:04:30.090> than

2048 blocks so as you can see that's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.760 
2048 blocks so as you can see that's
pretty<00:04:33.000> big<00:04:33.419> let<00:04:34.169> me<00:04:34.229> just<00:04:34.380> change<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.650> to

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
pretty big let me just change it to

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.980 
pretty big let me just change it to
daytime<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:36.270> if<00:04:36.389> you<00:04:36.479> just<00:04:36.600> get<00:04:36.720> rid<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:36.930> that

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
daytime so if you just get rid of that

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.870 
daytime so if you just get rid of that

dials which are moving depending on

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.740 
dials which are moving depending on
which<00:05:34.919> direction<00:05:35.130> we're<00:05:35.520> going<00:05:35.669> and<00:05:35.910> then<00:05:36.030> one

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
which direction we're going and then one

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.240 
which direction we're going and then one
on<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.960> left<00:05:37.199> is<00:05:37.380> slowly<00:05:37.680> building<00:05:37.919> up<00:05:38.130> the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
on the left is slowly building up the

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.980 
on the left is slowly building up the
speed<00:05:38.490> so<00:05:38.789> the<00:05:38.940> longer<00:05:39.389> that<00:05:39.479> I<00:05:39.539> hold<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:39.870> down

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
speed so the longer that I hold it down

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.930 
speed so the longer that I hold it down
the<00:05:40.110> faster<00:05:40.440> or<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.889> faster<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.250> ship<00:05:41.430> goes<00:05:41.669> I

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
the faster or the faster the ship goes I

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.420 
the faster or the faster the ship goes I
think<00:05:42.570> it<00:05:42.659> goes<00:05:42.810> up<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:43.169> what<00:05:43.680> is<00:05:43.830> essentially

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
think it goes up to what is essentially

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.969 
think it goes up to what is essentially
80<00:05:44.610> kilometers<00:05:45.300> an<00:05:45.419> hour<00:05:45.539> in<00:05:45.870> Minecraft<00:05:46.530> so

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
80 kilometers an hour in Minecraft so

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.210 
80 kilometers an hour in Minecraft so
does<00:05:47.190> get<00:05:47.370> pretty<00:05:47.550> fast<00:05:47.849> and<00:05:49.010> it's<00:05:50.010> just<00:05:50.159> a

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
does get pretty fast and it's just a

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.129 
does get pretty fast and it's just a
really<00:05:50.490> really<00:05:50.820> cool<00:05:50.940> model<00:05:51.330> like<00:05:51.479> this<00:05:51.659> now

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
really really cool model like this now

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.980 
really really cool model like this now
for<00:05:52.199> the<00:05:52.409> more<00:05:52.970> sort<00:05:53.970> of<00:05:54.060> familiar<00:05:54.690> with<00:05:54.840> this

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
for the more sort of familiar with this

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.960 
for the more sort of familiar with this
mod<00:05:55.169> you'll<00:05:55.860> know<00:05:56.039> that<00:05:56.220> this<00:05:56.340> actually<00:05:56.820> does

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
mod you'll know that this actually does

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.240 
mod you'll know that this actually does
have<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.210> hot-air-balloon<00:05:57.919> version<00:05:58.919> attached

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
have a hot-air-balloon version attached

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.159 
have a hot-air-balloon version attached
to<00:05:59.490> it<00:05:59.580> as<00:05:59.699> well<00:05:59.940> but<00:06:00.389> I<00:06:00.449> wanted<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:00.900> do<00:06:01.020> that

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
to it as well but I wanted to do that

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.870 
to it as well but I wanted to do that
maybe<00:06:01.320> in<00:06:01.500> a<00:06:01.590> separate<00:06:02.010> video<00:06:02.310> because<00:06:02.520> I<00:06:02.699> kind

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
maybe in a separate video because I kind

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.159 
maybe in a separate video because I kind
of<00:06:02.940> wanted<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.180> keep<00:06:03.270> this<00:06:03.479> as<00:06:03.630> just<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:03.990> ships

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
of wanted to keep this as just the ships

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.480 
of wanted to keep this as just the ships
so<00:06:04.440> if<00:06:04.530> you<00:06:04.620> would<00:06:04.740> like<00:06:04.889> to<00:06:05.039> see<00:06:05.159> kind<00:06:05.310> of<00:06:05.400> like

so if you would like to see kind of like

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.310 
so if you would like to see kind of like
a<00:06:05.580> hot-air-balloon<00:06:06.030> version<00:06:06.659> of<00:06:06.780> this<00:06:06.870> then

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
a hot-air-balloon version of this then

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.920 
a hot-air-balloon version of this then
let<00:06:07.500> me<00:06:07.620> know<00:06:07.650> that<00:06:08.220> would<00:06:08.310> be<00:06:08.340> really<00:06:08.430> cool<00:06:08.930> be

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
let me know that would be really cool be

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.939

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
want to get out of it you dismount it as

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.719 
want to get out of it you dismount it as
like<00:06:12.479> a<00:06:12.510> horse<00:06:12.840> but<00:06:13.530> it<00:06:13.889> still<00:06:14.099> floats<00:06:14.340> around
