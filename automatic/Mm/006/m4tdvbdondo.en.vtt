welcome<00:00:08.530> to<00:00:08.710> an<00:00:08.800> unboxing<00:00:09.160> that<00:00:09.840> doesn't<00:00:10.840> seem

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
welcome to an unboxing that doesn't seem

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.570 
welcome to an unboxing that doesn't seem
at<00:00:11.320> first<00:00:11.680> like<00:00:11.980> it<00:00:12.129> would<00:00:12.250> have<00:00:12.370> much

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
at first like it would have much

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.459 
at first like it would have much
application<00:00:13.240> to<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.480> everyday<00:00:13.719> consumer

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
application to the everyday consumer

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.350 
application to the everyday consumer
because<00:00:15.280> it<00:00:15.429> is<00:00:15.549> a<00:00:16.259> 500<00:00:17.259> plus<00:00:17.470> dollar<00:00:17.740> scanner

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
because it is a 500 plus dollar scanner

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.970 
because it is a 500 plus dollar scanner
but<00:00:19.360> it<00:00:19.779> actually<00:00:20.290> has<00:00:20.770> some<00:00:20.950> pretty

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
but it actually has some pretty

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.589 
but it actually has some pretty
compelling<00:00:21.340> things<00:00:21.790> about<00:00:22.029> it<00:00:22.210> that<00:00:22.360> might

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
compelling things about it that might

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.359 
compelling things about it that might
make<00:00:22.840> you<00:00:23.080> want<00:00:23.259> to<00:00:23.500> add<00:00:23.649> a<00:00:23.680> fujitsu<00:00:24.340> scansnap

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
make you want to add a fujitsu scansnap

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.450 
make you want to add a fujitsu scansnap
to<00:00:25.180> your<00:00:25.300> home<00:00:25.509> so<00:00:25.899> I<00:00:26.169> actually<00:00:26.770> already

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
I'll talk about some of the features as

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.020 
I'll talk about some of the features as
we<00:00:40.839> go<00:00:41.019> and<00:00:41.289> after<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.190> fact<00:00:42.370> so<00:00:42.550> first<00:00:42.850> we

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.150 
we go and after the fact so first we
have<00:00:43.210> our<00:00:43.239> AC<00:00:43.600> adapter<00:00:44.170> so<00:00:44.710> that's<00:00:44.859> pretty

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
have our AC adapter so that's pretty

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.319 
have our AC adapter so that's pretty
pretty<00:00:45.609> run-of-the-mill

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
pretty run-of-the-mill

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.950

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
next we have some packing materials also

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.279 
next we have some packing materials also
pretty<00:00:50.379> run-of-the-mill<00:00:50.589> and<00:00:51.960> finally<00:00:52.960> we

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
pretty run-of-the-mill and finally we

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.329 
pretty run-of-the-mill and finally we
have<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.589> scansnap

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
have the scansnap

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.750 
have the scansnap
itself<00:00:55.289> which<00:00:56.289> is<00:00:56.499> not<00:00:56.920> run-of-the-mill<00:00:57.219> and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
itself which is not run-of-the-mill and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.340 
itself which is not run-of-the-mill and
I<00:00:57.820> will<00:00:57.969> explain<00:00:58.210> what<00:00:58.420> actually<00:00:59.109> really

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
I will explain what actually really

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.709 
I will explain what actually really
heavy<00:00:59.559> bear<00:01:00.309> just<00:01:00.550> put<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:01.179> down<00:01:01.420> this<00:01:01.569> is

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
heavy bear just put that down this is

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.419 
heavy bear just put that down this is
not<00:01:01.899> a<00:01:01.929> portable<00:01:02.589> scanner<00:01:02.679> although<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.280> does

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
not a portable scanner although it does

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.070 
not a portable scanner although it does
have<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:03.670> very<00:01:03.909> small<00:01:04.150> form<00:01:04.390> factor<00:01:04.449> so<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.960> will

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
have a very small form factor so it will

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.420 
have a very small form factor so it will
easily<00:01:05.260> fit<00:01:05.530> on<00:01:05.680> your<00:01:05.770> desk<00:01:06.120> next<00:01:07.120> we<00:01:07.479> have<00:01:07.810> a

carrier sheet so I'll explain what the
carrier<00:01:11.140> sheet<00:01:11.410> does<00:01:11.710> in<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.790> moment<00:01:13.330> as<00:01:13.480> well

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.990 
start with that carrier sheet I'm sorry
that<00:01:54.070> was<00:01:54.190> 11<00:01:54.580> by<00:01:54.700> 17<00:01:55.120> it<00:01:55.990> can<00:01:56.230> be<00:01:56.850> Kate<00:01:57.850> give<00:01:57.940> me

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
that was 11 by 17 it can be Kate give me

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.650 
that was 11 by 17 it can be Kate give me
a<00:01:58.060> sec<00:01:58.210> guys

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
a sec guys

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.380 
a sec guys
so<00:01:59.620> let's<00:01:59.830> do<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.100> overall<00:02:00.550> physical<00:02:01.000> layout

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
so let's do the overall physical layout

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.140 
so let's do the overall physical layout
of<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> scans<00:02:01.960> now<00:02:02.170> that's<00:02:02.410> 1500<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:04.000> lift

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
of the scans now that's 1500 so you lift

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.520 
of the scans now that's 1500 so you lift
it<00:02:04.300> up<00:02:04.390> like<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:04.750> that's<00:02:05.230> all<00:02:05.380> pretty

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
it up like this that's all pretty

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.720 
it up like this that's all pretty
straightforward<00:02:05.830> you<00:02:06.190> pull<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.430> up<00:02:06.520> like<00:02:06.700> that

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
straightforward you pull it up like that

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.139 
straightforward you pull it up like that
you<00:02:07.180> can<00:02:07.330> load<00:02:07.540> in<00:02:07.750> whatever<00:02:08.379> documents<00:02:09.220> use<00:02:09.580> v

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
you can load in whatever documents use v

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.660 
you can load in whatever documents use v
so<00:02:10.420> if<00:02:10.509> it's<00:02:10.690> for<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.840> sake<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.489> sake

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
so if it's for the sake of for the sake

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.220 
so if it's for the sake of for the sake
of<00:02:12.700> demonstration<00:02:12.970> why<00:02:13.720> don't<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:13.930> take<00:02:14.110> our

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
of demonstration why don't we take our

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.929 
of demonstration why don't we take our
carrier<00:02:14.560> sheet<00:02:14.920> which<00:02:15.159> is<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.640> clear

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
carrier sheet which is just a clear

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.050 
carrier sheet which is just a clear
plastic<00:02:16.239> film

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.449 

that<00:02:19.270> closes<00:02:19.720> over<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.020> damaged<00:02:20.560> document<00:02:21.280> it

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
that closes over a damaged document it

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.970 
that closes over a damaged document it
can<00:02:21.520> also<00:02:21.670> be<00:02:21.910> used<00:02:22.209> rather<00:02:23.080> creatively<00:02:23.950> I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
can also be used rather creatively I

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.330 
can also be used rather creatively I
might<00:02:24.310> add<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:25.030> scan<00:02:25.450> pages<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.530> are<00:02:26.680> up<00:02:26.890> to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
might add to scan pages that are up to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.270 
might add to scan pages that are up to
11<00:02:28.239> by<00:02:28.390> 17<00:02:28.840> by<00:02:29.170> folding<00:02:29.560> them<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.770> half<00:02:29.800> over

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
11 by 17 by folding them in half over

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.949 
11 by 17 by folding them in half over
the<00:02:30.310> carrier<00:02:30.700> sheet<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.540> software

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the carrier sheet and the software

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.390 
the carrier sheet and the software
itself<00:02:32.200> will<00:02:32.410> automatically<00:02:33.010> stitch<00:02:33.250> it

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
itself will automatically stitch it

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.470 
itself will automatically stitch it
together<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:33.970> there<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.180> go

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
together so there you go

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.180 
together so there you go
that's<00:02:34.780> how<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.959> load<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.230> page<00:02:35.349> onto<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.830> you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
that's how you load a page onto it you

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.250 
that's how you load a page onto it you
press<00:02:36.370> scan<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:37.000> order<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.390> scan<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.810> now

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
press scan in order to scan it now

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.960 
press scan in order to scan it now
there's<00:02:38.590> almost<00:02:38.769> nothing<00:02:39.220> in<00:02:39.519> terms<00:02:39.760> of

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
there's almost nothing in terms of

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.850 
there's almost nothing in terms of
buttons<00:02:40.300> on<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.599> scan<00:02:40.810> snap<00:02:41.110> itself<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.709> can

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
buttons on the scan snap itself you can

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.380 
buttons on the scan snap itself you can
see<00:02:42.010> up<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.190> front<00:02:42.370> there's<00:02:42.790> no<00:02:43.060> buttons

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
see up the front there's no buttons

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.490 
see up the front there's no buttons
there's<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:45.780> output<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.080> paper<00:02:47.290> or

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
there's just the output for the paper or

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.350 
there's just the output for the paper or
documents<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.190> scanned<00:02:48.640> on<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
documents that you have scanned on the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.750 
documents that you have scanned on the
side<00:02:49.599> there's<00:02:49.989> pretty<00:02:50.260> much<00:02:50.319> nothing<00:02:50.620> on<00:02:51.580> the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
side there's pretty much nothing on the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.850 
side there's pretty much nothing on the
other<00:02:51.880> side<00:02:52.120> pretty<00:02:52.540> much<00:02:52.690> nothing<00:02:52.959> on<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
other side pretty much nothing on the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.880 
other side pretty much nothing on the
bottom<00:02:54.040> pretty<00:02:55.030> much<00:02:55.569> nothing<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.500> on<00:02:56.739> the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
bottom pretty much nothing and on the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.800 
bottom pretty much nothing and on the
back<00:02:57.209> okay<00:02:58.209> hold<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:58.450> there's<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.690> couple

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
back okay hold on there's a couple

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.420 
back okay hold on there's a couple
things<00:02:58.959> on<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.200> back<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.739> on<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.980> back<00:03:00.160> we

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
things on the back so on the back we

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.289 
things on the back so on the back we
have<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:01.080> DC<00:03:02.080> input<00:03:02.200> as<00:03:02.590> well<00:03:03.190> as<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.819> USB

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
have the DC input as well as the USB

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.780 
have the DC input as well as the USB
input<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.709> there<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.980> have<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.519> the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
input so there you have it that is the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.030 
input so there you have it that is the
physical<00:03:07.209> characteristics<00:03:07.569> of<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.140> S<00:03:08.349> 1500

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
physical characteristics of the S 1500

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.250 
physical characteristics of the S 1500
now<00:03:09.160> most<00:03:09.819> of<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.150> magic<00:03:10.299> is<00:03:10.599> in<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> software

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
now most of the magic is in the software

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.830 
now most of the magic is in the software
and<00:03:11.560> if<00:03:12.130> you've<00:03:12.340> ever<00:03:12.459> bought<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.030> scanner<00:03:13.510> and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
and if you've ever bought a scanner and

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.390 
and if you've ever bought a scanner and
tried<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.170> use<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.769> past<00:03:14.980> you'll<00:03:15.220> know

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
tried to use it in the past you'll know

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.900 
tried to use it in the past you'll know
that<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.849> software<00:03:16.239> can<00:03:16.989> be<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.440> bit<00:03:17.860> of<00:03:18.069> a<00:03:18.400> bear

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
that the software can be a bit of a bear

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.759 
that the software can be a bit of a bear
it'll<00:03:19.269> make<00:03:19.420> or<00:03:19.599> break<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.870> scanner<00:03:20.290> because<00:03:20.620> it

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
it'll make or break a scanner because it

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.199 
it'll make or break a scanner because it
can<00:03:20.890> have<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.190> best<00:03:21.370> image<00:03:21.640> quality<00:03:21.819> in<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
can have the best image quality in the

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.390 
can have the best image quality in the
world<00:03:22.390> but<00:03:23.049> if<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.170> software<00:03:23.739> crashes<00:03:24.010> on<00:03:24.280> you

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
world but if the software crashes on you

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.650 
world but if the software crashes on you
every<00:03:24.579> 30<00:03:24.790> seconds<00:03:25.239> which<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.450> have

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
every 30 seconds which I have

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.690 
every 30 seconds which I have
experienced<00:03:26.410> in<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.620> past<00:03:26.769> then<00:03:27.370> that's<00:03:27.579> not

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
experienced in the past then that's not

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.229 
experienced in the past then that's not
gonna<00:03:27.910> do<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.299> any<00:03:28.329> good<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.880> let's<00:03:31.090> go

use my cheat sheet here and I'm very
sorry<00:03:34.150> guys<00:03:34.329> but<00:03:34.540> there's<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.900> lot<00:03:35.140> of

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.360 
sorry guys but there's a lot of
different<00:03:35.560> points<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:35.950> didn't<00:03:36.190> want<00:03:36.310> to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
different points that I didn't want to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.729 
different points that I didn't want to
cover<00:03:36.549> so<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.390> scans<00:03:37.690> both<00:03:38.170> sides<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.680> the

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
cover so it scans both sides of the

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.890 
cover so it scans both sides of the
document<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.430> run<00:03:39.609> through<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:40.000> okay<00:03:40.660> it

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
can correct for things like upside-down

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.509 
can correct for things like upside-down
pages<00:03:43.630> if<00:03:43.780> your<00:03:44.230> document<00:03:44.739> is<00:03:44.890> accidentally

pages if your document is accidentally

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.979 
pages if your document is accidentally
running<00:03:45.730> through<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.090> little<00:03:46.359> bit<00:03:46.480> crooked<00:03:46.690> now

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
running through a little bit crooked now

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.050 
running through a little bit crooked now
it<00:03:47.109> does<00:03:47.319> have<00:03:47.350> guides<00:03:47.920> here<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:48.850> can

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
it does have guides here so you can

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.210 
it does have guides here so you can
adjust<00:03:49.359> it<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.569> different<00:03:50.019> sizes<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.650> paper

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
adjust it to different sizes of paper

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.520 
adjust it to different sizes of paper
but<00:03:52.090> just<00:03:52.510> in<00:03:52.630> case<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:52.959> does<00:03:53.079> run<00:03:53.260> through<00:03:53.500> a

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
but just in case it does run through a

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.080 
but just in case it does run through a
little<00:03:53.680> bit<00:03:53.889> crooked<00:03:54.069> by<00:03:54.370> accident<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:55.000> will

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
little bit crooked by accident it will

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.059 
little bit crooked by accident it will
actually<00:03:55.470> automatically<00:03:56.470> correct<00:03:56.889> that

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
actually automatically correct that

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.099 
actually automatically correct that
it'll<00:03:57.670> automatically<00:03:58.180> remove<00:03:58.540> blank<00:03:58.840> pages

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
it'll automatically remove blank pages

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.379 
it'll automatically remove blank pages
it'll<00:03:59.799> auto<00:04:00.010> crop<00:04:00.519> according<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.239> the

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
it'll auto crop according to the

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.259 
it'll auto crop according to the
document<00:04:01.900> type<00:04:02.079> so<00:04:02.410> a4<00:04:03.010> checks<00:04:03.430> business

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
document type so a4 checks business

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.699 
document type so a4 checks business
cards<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.810> this<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.019> all<00:04:05.170> stuff<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.500> can

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
cards and this is all stuff you can

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.840 
cards and this is all stuff you can
control<00:04:06.100> in<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.310> software<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.940> can<00:04:07.660> actually

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
control in the software you can actually

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.120 
control in the software you can actually
scan<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:10.150> text<00:04:10.569> and<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:11.470> can<00:04:11.650> make<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:11.980> a

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
scan to text and you can make it a

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.819 
scan to text and you can make it a
searchable<00:04:12.670> PDF<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.720> if<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:14.019> were<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.380> take<00:04:14.560> a

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
searchable PDF so if you were to take a

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.460 
searchable PDF so if you were to take a
text<00:04:15.190> document<00:04:15.690> Excel<00:04:16.690> sheets<00:04:16.930> actually

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
text document Excel sheets actually

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.979 
text document Excel sheets actually
don't<00:04:17.650> work<00:04:18.010> all<00:04:18.639> that<00:04:18.910> well<00:04:19.209> but<00:04:19.510> if<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.870> were

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
don't work all that well but if you were

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.980 
don't work all that well but if you were
to<00:04:20.169> take<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.620> more<00:04:21.430> text<00:04:22.030> heavy<00:04:22.210> document<00:04:22.840> and

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
to take a more text heavy document and

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.290 
to take a more text heavy document and
scan<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.889> through<00:04:24.070> here<00:04:24.280> it'll<00:04:24.550> automatically

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
scan it through here it'll automatically

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300 
scan it through here it'll automatically
convert<00:04:25.690> all<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:25.870> that<00:04:26.080> text<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.500> a<00:04:26.650> searchable

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
convert all of that text to a searchable

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.370 
convert all of that text to a searchable
PDF<00:04:27.430> which<00:04:28.360> is<00:04:28.510> pretty<00:04:28.720> cool<00:04:28.960> because<00:04:29.140> it

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
PDF which is pretty cool because it

stove RNA that you were dealing with for
the<00:05:02.890> longest<00:05:03.190> time<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.669> just<00:05:03.820> highlight

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
the longest time so you just highlight

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.750 
the longest time so you just highlight
stove<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:05.169> any<00:05:05.680> document<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.490> scan

stove on any document that you scan
through<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.810> can<00:05:07.960> actually<00:05:08.140> set<00:05:08.620> it

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
through it and you can actually set it

to<00:05:08.979> automatically<00:05:09.640> create<00:05:10.020> metadata<00:05:11.020> so<00:05:11.409> you

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
to automatically create metadata so you

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.279 
to automatically create metadata so you
can<00:05:11.710> create<00:05:11.890> tags<00:05:12.370> for<00:05:13.030> that<00:05:13.210> document<00:05:13.840> based

can create tags for that document based

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:15.930 
can create tags for that document based
on<00:05:14.500> anything<00:05:14.890> that<00:05:15.039> you<00:05:15.220> highlight<00:05:15.669> it<00:05:15.789> which

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
on anything that you highlight it which

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.089 
on anything that you highlight it which
makes<00:05:16.120> it<00:05:16.240> very<00:05:16.330> easy<00:05:16.539> to<00:05:17.349> index<00:05:17.830> things

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
makes it very easy to index things

what<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:21.070> was<00:05:21.190> actually<00:05:21.370> for<00:05:21.940> you<00:05:22.360> can<00:05:22.510> also<00:05:22.630> do

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
what it was actually for you can also do

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.589 
what it was actually for you can also do
highlighter<00:05:23.200> cropping<00:05:23.740> so<00:05:24.159> if<00:05:24.400> you<00:05:24.640> are<00:05:25.300> where

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
highlighter cropping so if you are where

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.230 
highlighter cropping so if you are where
to<00:05:25.919> cut<00:05:26.919> out<00:05:27.010> something<00:05:27.310> with<00:05:27.640> a<00:05:27.760> highlighter

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
to cut out something with a highlighter

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.120 
to cut out something with a highlighter
and<00:05:28.479> you<00:05:28.840> set<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.110> in<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.320> software<00:05:29.680> it'll

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
and you set it in the software it'll

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.680 
and you set it in the software it'll
automatically<00:05:30.669> crop<00:05:31.030> that<00:05:31.180> document

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
automatically crop that document

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.089 
automatically crop that document
according<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.229> section<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:32.650> highlighted

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
which is pretty neat as well works fine

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.830 
which is pretty neat as well works fine

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
is PC oriented so it is more of a PC

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.050 
is PC oriented so it is more of a PC
product<00:05:56.740> than<00:05:56.860> a<00:05:56.890> Mac<00:05:57.130> product<00:05:57.580> so<00:05:57.729> stay<00:05:57.940> away

a<00:06:34.690> new<00:06:34.840> scanner<00:06:35.289> so<00:06:35.560> they<00:06:35.710> do<00:06:35.770> inventory<00:06:36.520> those

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
a new scanner so they do inventory those

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.540 
a new scanner so they do inventory those
parts<00:06:37.060> you<00:06:37.509> can<00:06:37.750> get<00:06:38.020> them<00:06:38.229> you<00:06:39.069> don't<00:06:39.190> have<00:06:39.430> to

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
parts you can get them you don't have to

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.520 
parts you can get them you don't have to
just<00:06:39.729> throw<00:06:39.850> it<00:06:40.000> away<00:06:40.120> like<00:06:40.419> you<00:06:40.690> do<00:06:40.840> with<00:06:41.020> most

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
just throw it away like you do with most

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.400 
just throw it away like you do with most
printers

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
printers

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.780 
printers
so<00:06:42.680> there<00:06:42.830> you<00:06:42.860> go<00:06:42.920> now<00:06:43.160> that<00:06:43.190> makes<00:06:43.550> a<00:06:43.640> lot

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
so there you go now that makes a lot

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.310 
so there you go now that makes a lot
more<00:06:43.820> sense<00:06:44.000> that<00:06:44.300> they<00:06:44.660> fold<00:06:44.930> separately

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
more sense that they fold separately

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.370 
more sense that they fold separately
compact<00:06:45.770> doesn't<00:06:46.070> it<00:06:46.810> that's<00:06:47.810> cool

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
compact doesn't it that's cool

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.930 
compact doesn't it that's cool
let's<00:06:49.190> do<00:06:49.310> it<00:06:49.340> one<00:06:49.490> more<00:06:49.520> time<00:06:51.550> there<00:06:52.550> we<00:06:52.610> go

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
let's do it one more time there we go

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.400 
let's do it one more time there we go
okay<00:06:54.130> finally<00:06:55.130> business<00:06:56.060> cards<00:06:56.510> it'll<00:06:57.260> do

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 
okay finally business cards it'll do

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.380 
okay finally business cards it'll do
business<00:06:57.860> cards<00:06:58.250> as<00:06:58.430> long<00:06:58.730> as<00:06:58.940> they're<00:06:59.090> not<00:06:59.120> on

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
business cards as long as they're not on

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.030 
business cards as long as they're not on
a<00:06:59.420> black<00:06:59.780> background<00:07:00.380> which<00:07:00.560> most<00:07:00.800> of<00:07:00.950> them

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.040 
a black background which most of them

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.330 
a black background which most of them
aren't

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
aren't

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.520 
aren't
it'll<00:07:01.520> do<00:07:01.670> business<00:07:02.060> cards<00:07:02.450> in<00:07:02.600> a<00:07:03.050> wide

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
it'll do business cards in a wide

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.800 
it'll do business cards in a wide
variety<00:07:04.220> of<00:07:04.250> different<00:07:04.670> languages<00:07:05.030> and<00:07:05.360> it'll
