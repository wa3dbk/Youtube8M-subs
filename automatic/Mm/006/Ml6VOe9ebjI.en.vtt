main room upstairs because I don't

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.039 
main room upstairs because I don't
believe<00:01:05.990> in<00:01:06.400> allowing<00:01:07.400> clutter<00:01:07.820> in<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.690> shared

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
believe in allowing clutter in a shared

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.620 
believe in allowing clutter in a shared
area<00:01:09.440> which<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.579> narrow<00:01:10.880> with<00:01:11.210> tubing

one<00:06:43.460> because<00:06:43.639> i<00:06:43.850> noticed<00:06:44.240> walmart<00:06:45.199> that<00:06:45.320> I<00:06:45.410> go

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
one because i noticed walmart that I go

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.730 
one because i noticed walmart that I go
to<00:06:45.680> the<00:06:46.010> only<00:06:46.280> store<00:06:46.550> that<00:06:46.580> I<00:06:46.729> saw<00:06:47.180> it<00:06:47.539> act<00:06:48.229> and

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.480 
to the only store that I saw it act and
I<00:06:49.460> think<00:06:50.449> this<00:06:50.660> would<00:06:50.900> be<00:06:50.930> a<00:06:51.350> great<00:06:51.650> because

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
I think this would be a great because

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.560 
I think this would be a great because
this<00:06:52.699> is<00:06:52.820> not<00:06:53.000> all<00:06:53.300> my<00:06:53.630> makeup<00:06:55.389> which<00:06:56.389> is

this is not all my makeup which is

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.680 
this is not all my makeup which is
strange<00:06:56.960> for<00:06:57.260> somebody<00:06:57.500> who<00:06:57.919> doesn't<00:06:58.250> really

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
strange for somebody who doesn't really

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.740 
strange for somebody who doesn't really
go<00:06:59.690> all<00:06:59.810> out<00:06:59.840> on<00:07:00.470> her<00:07:00.680> me<00:07:00.860> pub<00:07:01.130> so<00:07:01.490> but<00:07:02.449> I<00:07:02.479> just

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
go all out on her me pub so but I just

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.290 
go all out on her me pub so but I just
want<00:07:02.990> to<00:07:03.050> have<00:07:03.229> a<00:07:03.259> backup<00:07:03.620> of<00:07:03.979> this<00:07:04.430> because<00:07:04.910> I

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
want to have a backup of this because I

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.650

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
think this is ideally something that

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.890 
think this is ideally something that
even<00:07:08.990> a<00:07:09.500> novice<00:07:10.370> and<00:07:10.820> makeup<00:07:11.240> should<00:07:11.389> have<00:07:11.690> to

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:11.900 
even a novice and makeup should have to

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.890 
even a novice and makeup should have to
keep<00:07:12.169> your<00:07:12.770> makeup<00:07:13.669> and<00:07:13.940> stuff<00:07:14.270> organized

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900
