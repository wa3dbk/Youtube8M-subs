 good friends from youtube this comes 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.200
 being a review unam boxing of what 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.030
 it's been a new team that we're 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.120
 driving that is called break guide 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.619
 I already uncovered that where all this was 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.620
 tool that is being a two 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.920
 three four or five pieces 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.010
 this tool is is used to 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.960
 make cuts save time 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.520
 when you are using when you are 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.290
 painting a box of double colors 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.600
 strip where you have system floors that do not 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.329
 you want to paint this part of what is the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.589
 that protects it 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.589
 the moment to turn 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.570
 you can see an original video that 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.340
 comes from the sprite the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.670
 operation of just telling you 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.879
 showing 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.340
 or the uncovering of this tool we 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.590
 Proceed with assembling the equipment 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.660
 this the team already comes with the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.300
 tool since it already comes with a key 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.810
 to the little one that we are going to use to 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.380
 tighten these screws 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.380
 are 2 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140
 in this base 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.860
 although as we can see this is a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 Friday 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.580
 square to facilitate the claw of what 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.020
 what is this tool 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.130
 this part of here is where you hug 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.210
 what has been tradition 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.210
 general extensions 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.940
 or the mouth of your what is the gun 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.940
 this 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.220
 this is an extension that I have a 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.020
 little 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.000
 We can not see, I'm going to show you how 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.600
 it looks 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.600
 in room 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.730
 we can see that they are already fixed 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.620
 and this is you 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.170
 to paint greater reach this 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.460
 deficiency this the distinction is not going to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.390
 the gun 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.569
 now we are going to show you how 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.680
 how is this put together ok let's proceed 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.840
 with 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.790
 bitter in this team 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.480
 that the advisable in this case would be 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.860
 that the moment I am is putting together your 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.860
 sprite tool 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.140
 put it 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.430
 flash couple flush 6 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.209
 with this side of here 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.430
 at the moment of turning the whole elbow 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.379
 the angle 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.379
 do not hinder here truth 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.290
 let's try what is 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.170
 the part of the hole larger than the hole 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.849
 is more up 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.849
 because it embraced here 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.650
 good 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.110
 bring this benefit of what 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.370
 as well 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.280
 slightly 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.629
 we are a little pressure what is 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:48.709
 we have ready the next step would be 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.980
 It is advisable to put this to put the 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.980
 disk 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.220
 in this butterfly 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.220
 Hello 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.430
 that slowly so that it reaches to enter 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.430
 is 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.209
 here I am already 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.210
 and we can see that it already starts like this is how 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.210
 it would be 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.570
 then I will continue with the armed and 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.640
 the recommended nozzles for this 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.030
 tool are specified in the 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.300
 back of the young people being 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.300
 sisters 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:42.350
 and you can see there but it's 4 11 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.849
 5 11 and 5 13 for interiors and so they go to 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.759
 use these rough surfaces 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.560
 as the taco or brick would be 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.400
 recommended at 6:15 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.330
 in this case I am going to use a 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.259
 13 11 I want you to paint a little and that the 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.259
 fan is not so big 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.979
 let's put this 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.090
 it seems that we have some neighbors the 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.090
 really thing 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.160
 we do not have to accommodate the guard 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.199
 nozzles in such a way so that a 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.199
 moment that is when the streak comes out 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.730
 daniela well 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.840
 This is now ready to connect 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.940
 which is the gun on this side 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.940
 and this one would be demonstrating a 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.980
 thank you very much 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.980
 See you soon
