the nozzles especially the the bubble
cup<00:02:41.970> series<00:02:42.330> operate<00:02:42.720> very<00:02:42.930> much<00:02:43.050> like<00:02:43.260> the

cup series operate very much like the

now<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:46.110> case<00:02:46.320> we've<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.800> replaced

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
now in this case we've just replaced

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.070 
now in this case we've just replaced
what<00:02:47.430> would<00:02:47.820> typically<00:02:48.240> be<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> rubber<00:02:48.780> bumper

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
what would typically be a rubber bumper

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.750 
what would typically be a rubber bumper
on<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.410> front<00:02:49.770> end<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.100> we<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.640> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
on the front end that we have with the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.120 
on the front end that we have with the

twisters with this PVC front end that

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.370 
twisters with this PVC front end that
pops<00:02:53.460> forward<00:02:54.030> now<00:02:54.960> what<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.320> does

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
pops forward now what this does

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.740 
pops forward now what this does
basically<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.730> straight<00:02:57.090> stream<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.720> have

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
basically is in straight stream you have

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.260 
basically is in straight stream you have
great<00:02:58.080> reach<00:02:58.290> good<00:02:58.830> penetration<00:02:59.280> you're<00:03:00.090> not

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
great reach good penetration you're not

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.330 
great reach good penetration you're not
going<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.480> do<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> lot<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.840> aspiration<00:03:01.650> when

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
going to do a lot of aspiration when

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.430 
going to do a lot of aspiration when
this<00:03:02.520> pops<00:03:02.820> out<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.390> change<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.230> fog

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
this pops out you change it to fog

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.530 
this pops out you change it to fog
pattern<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.040> starts<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.610> aerate<00:03:05.940> on<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.300> teeth

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
pattern it starts to aerate on the teeth

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.480 
pattern it starts to aerate on the teeth
out<00:03:06.750> here<00:03:07.020> you'll<00:03:07.650> lose<00:03:07.890> some<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> reach

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
out here you'll lose some of the reach

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.850 
out here you'll lose some of the reach
and<00:03:08.730> penetration<00:03:09.570> but<00:03:09.750> your<00:03:10.050> expansion<00:03:10.590> will

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
and penetration but your expansion will

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.320 
and penetration but your expansion will
jump<00:03:11.070> up<00:03:11.190> pretty<00:03:11.400> dramatically<00:03:11.940> you'll<00:03:12.150> have

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
jump up pretty dramatically you'll have

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.680 
jump up pretty dramatically you'll have
a<00:03:12.360> lot<00:03:12.720> more<00:03:12.750> bubbles<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.620> work<00:03:13.800> with<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
a lot more bubbles to work with the the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.330 
a lot more bubbles to work with the the
bubble<00:03:15.959> couple<00:03:16.260> rigidly<00:03:16.560> was<00:03:16.740> designed<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
bubble couple rigidly was designed and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.920 
bubble couple rigidly was designed and
