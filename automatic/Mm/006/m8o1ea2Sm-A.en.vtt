particularly hard to kill mobs like
these<00:00:21.390> beetles<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.519> problem<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
these beetles here the problem with the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.380 
these beetles here the problem with the
beetles<00:00:25.130> they<00:00:26.130> spawn<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.519> closed-off<00:00:27.090> cave

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
beetles they spawn in closed-off cave

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.540 
beetles they spawn in closed-off cave
areas<00:00:27.810> if<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.289> accidentally<00:00:28.890> mine<00:00:29.070> into<00:00:29.400> one

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
areas if you accidentally mine into one

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.720 
areas if you accidentally mine into one
of<00:00:29.670> them<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.380> huge<00:00:31.859> swarm<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
of them it can be a huge swarm that

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.370 
of them it can be a huge swarm that
takes<00:00:33.120> out<00:00:33.300> your<00:00:33.480> army<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.899> your<00:00:33.989> base<00:00:34.170> before

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
takes out your army and your base before

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.340 
takes out your army and your base before
you're<00:00:34.620> ready<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:37.020> kind<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.230> have

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
you're ready for it so you kind of have

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.840 
you're ready for it so you kind of have
to<00:00:37.380> mind<00:00:37.649> carefully<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:41.070> tile<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.520> beetle

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
to mind carefully the tile that beetle

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.720 
to mind carefully the tile that beetle
is<00:00:41.969> standing<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.629> now<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.260> ramp<00:00:43.980> which

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
is standing on right now is a ramp which

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.010 
is standing on right now is a ramp which
means<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.239> walk<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.899> it's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
means they can walk on it like it's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
means they can walk on it like it's
ground<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.430> took<00:00:47.610> down<00:00:47.730> either<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
ground so if I took down either the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.580 
ground so if I took down either the
walls<00:00:48.329> around<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.899> could<00:00:49.110> still<00:00:49.410> get<00:00:49.530> out

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
walls around it it could still get out

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
walls around it it could still get out
even<00:00:49.950> though<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> looks<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.550> wall<00:00:53.690> now<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
even though it looks like wall now the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.840 
even though it looks like wall now the
thing<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.230> beetles<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.250> reproduce

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
thing with beetles is they reproduce

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.099 
thing with beetles is they reproduce
every<00:00:57.239> four<00:00:57.570> days<00:00:59.149> there's<00:01:00.149> 12<00:01:00.480> days<00:01:00.780> per

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
every four days there's 12 days per

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.590 
every four days there's 12 days per
season<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.859> peace<00:01:02.070> seasons<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> year<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
season for peace seasons a year so that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
season for peace seasons a year so that
means<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.290> about<00:01:04.530> 12<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.100> beetles

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
means you get about 12 more beetles

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.539 
means you get about 12 more beetles
every<00:01:05.850> year<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.390> wait<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.750> deal<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.549> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
every year you wait to deal with it so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.920 
every year you wait to deal with it so
it<00:01:08.640> means<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:08.970> soon<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> discover<00:01:09.659> them

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it means as soon as you discover them

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.660 
it means as soon as you discover them
the<00:01:10.200> longer<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.650> take<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.979> actually<00:01:11.250> deal

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the longer you take to actually deal

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
the longer you take to actually deal
with<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.909> problem<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:13.229> worse<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
with the problem the worse it's going to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.490 
with the problem the worse it's going to
be

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
be

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.690 
be
I<00:01:16.570> discovered<00:01:17.570> this<00:01:17.870> cave<00:01:18.200> about<00:01:18.560> for<00:01:19.100> in-game

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
I discovered this cave about for in-game

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.430 
I discovered this cave about for in-game
years<00:01:20.030> ago<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:22.280> do<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.550> math<00:01:22.730> on<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.120> one

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.590 

now<00:01:27.440> my<00:01:27.770> little<00:01:28.430> squad<00:01:28.760> there<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.180> not<00:01:29.360> too

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
now my little squad there is not too

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.160 
now my little squad there is not too
awful<00:01:29.990> bad<00:01:30.260> off<00:01:30.670> there<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.850> still<00:01:32.180> or<00:01:32.900> at<00:01:33.020> least

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
awful bad off there in still or at least

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.050 
awful bad off there in still or at least
mostly<00:01:33.500> still<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.100> highest<00:01:34.340> tier<00:01:34.700> of<00:01:34.790> armor

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
mostly still the highest tier of armor

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.380 
mostly still the highest tier of armor
in<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.180> game<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:37.400> problem<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:38.030> lot<00:01:38.270> of

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
in the game the problem is a lot of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.030 
in the game the problem is a lot of
their<00:01:38.510> pieces<00:01:38.720> are<00:01:39.020> still<00:01:39.170> bronze<00:01:39.530> or<00:01:39.830> LED

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
their pieces are still bronze or LED

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.030 
their pieces are still bronze or LED
which<00:01:40.520> means<00:01:40.820> they're<00:01:41.119> not<00:01:41.150> quite<00:01:41.750> as<00:01:41.930> good<00:01:42.920> as

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
which means they're not quite as good as

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.530 
which means they're not quite as good as
they<00:01:43.160> should<00:01:43.220> be<00:01:45.820> but<00:01:46.820> despite<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.300> I

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
they should be but despite that I

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.719 
they should be but despite that I
decided<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.440> wanted<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.740> come<00:01:49.070> down<00:01:49.250> here<00:01:49.460> and

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
decided I wanted to come down here and

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.830 
decided I wanted to come down here and
open<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.450> up<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:50.840> see<00:01:50.990> what<00:01:51.140> happens<00:01:52.840> what

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
open this up and see what happens what

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.760 
open this up and see what happens what
ensued<00:01:54.440> was<00:01:54.890> quite<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.610> massacre<00:01:56.770> I've

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
ensued was quite the massacre I've

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.859 
ensued was quite the massacre I've
already<00:01:58.040> tried<00:01:58.220> this<00:01:58.369> once<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:59.030> exited<00:01:59.690> out

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
already tried this once and I exited out

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.330 
already tried this once and I exited out
because<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.140> didn't<00:02:00.410> want<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.740> lose<00:02:00.920> my<00:02:00.979> whole
