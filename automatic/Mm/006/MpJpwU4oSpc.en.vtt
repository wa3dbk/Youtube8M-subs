 I'll show you how to do it right for 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.340
 start we need to measure the necessary 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.050
 the amount of coffee we will be today 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:45.960
 use today we will 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:48.780
 use 25 grams today to us 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.090
 need grinding between nicole and semolina 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.789
 a little more flour but a little less 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.739
 monkey now we need to prepare our 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.870
 funnel for this we take here such 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.829
 filter they are sold in stores first 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.680
 need to filter a little wet 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.420
 prepare it for coffee no need to take 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.950
 very hot water water should be 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 approximately 92 93 degrees we are not only 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.390
 prepared the filter now but we still 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.610
 warmed up our dishes because coffee is not 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.720
 love different temperatures pour out 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.890
 and start brewing brewing with us 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.980
 will take place in several stages 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.890
 first it will be before brewing 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.960
 a little stir so that all the coffee was 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.720
 in our water 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.450
 the grain swells now we pour 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.030
 always fill in a spiral 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.760
 need to start pouring center and by 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.420
 edges so that we create a shape 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.290
 varron glasses i think it is very 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.450
 convenient very correct way 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.310
 cooking because when we 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:58.940
 we can observe absolutely the whole process 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:01.220
 we see everything from go our coffee I'm ready 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.750
 I consider coffee made in this way 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.450
 as correctly as possible 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.070
 clean to taste it fully displays 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.500
 the taste of our today's grain 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.570
 please enjoy yours 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.430
 appetite and with you was Nastya Lotta you
