00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
against England and we think that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.460 
against England and we think that
170-180<00:03:40.240> will<00:03:40.510> be<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.630> very<00:03:40.810> good<00:03:40.930> total<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.380> if

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
170-180 will be a very good total and if

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.470 
170-180 will be a very good total and if
