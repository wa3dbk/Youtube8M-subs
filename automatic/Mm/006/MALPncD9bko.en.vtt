heel fits and how soft the heel is on
your<00:00:23.850> foot<00:00:24.060> they<00:00:24.539> did<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> nice<00:00:24.900> job<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.199> keeping

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
your foot they did a nice job of keeping

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.710 
your foot they did a nice job of keeping
the<00:00:25.590> shoot<00:00:25.800> light<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.449> here's

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the shoot light as you can see here's

the shoot light as you can see here's
the<00:00:27.779> rocker<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.500> was<00:00:28.890> telling<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.310> about<00:00:29.340> in

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the rocker I was telling you about in

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.339 
the rocker I was telling you about in
the<00:00:29.939> center<00:00:30.240> area<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.810> hard<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.109> tell<00:00:31.289> from

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the center area it's hard to tell from

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.620 
the center area it's hard to tell from
the<00:00:31.590> side<00:00:31.769> profile<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:33.329> see<00:00:33.510> it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the side profile you can really see it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.690 
the side profile you can really see it
here<00:00:33.870> when<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> show<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:35.190> bottom<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
here when I show you the bottom and you

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.250 
here when I show you the bottom and you
can<00:00:35.730> kind<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.630> dirt<00:00:36.809> pattern

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
can kind of see from the dirt pattern

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.130 
can kind of see from the dirt pattern
where<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.760> foot<00:00:38.969> was<00:00:39.149> forced<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.510> land<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:39.989> in

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
where my foot was forced to land was in

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.530 
where my foot was forced to land was in
this<00:00:40.290> area<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> there's<00:00:41.730> almost<00:00:41.969> no<00:00:42.300> wear<00:00:42.480> on

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
this area and there's almost no wear on

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.779 
this area and there's almost no wear on
the<00:00:42.780> heel<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.260> account<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.399> from<00:00:44.640> this

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the heel and account for that from this

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.770 
the heel and account for that from this
the<00:00:45.480> bump<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:47.489> material<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.570> can

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.060 
the bump out of the material you can
kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> bump<00:00:49.469> there

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
kind of see the bump there

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.420 
kind of see the bump there
okay<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.539> strike<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.890> you're<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> mid<00:00:53.280> foot

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
okay as you strike if you're a mid foot

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.000 
okay as you strike if you're a mid foot
record<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.390> coming<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.260> pretty

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
record you're coming down on that pretty

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.119 
record you're coming down on that pretty
consistently<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.940> shoe<00:01:00.859> fit<00:01:01.859> great

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
consistently there so a shoe fit great

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.759 
consistently there so a shoe fit great
on<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.820> upper<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> was<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:04.350> enjoyed<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
on the upper I was I really enjoyed the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.910 
on the upper I was I really enjoyed the
fit<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> upper<00:01:05.430> much<00:01:05.610> better<00:01:05.850> than<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.530> go

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
fit of the upper much better than the go

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.070 
fit of the upper much better than the go
bionics<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> paired<00:01:09.930> these

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
bionics I think if you paired these

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.179 
bionics I think if you paired these
shoes<00:01:10.320> together<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.799> almost<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.070> my

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
shoes together and almost have my

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.310 
shoes together and almost have my
perfect<00:01:11.460> shoe<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.330> definitely<00:01:12.869> has<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> lot

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
perfect shoe this definitely has a lot

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
perfect shoe this definitely has a lot
more<00:01:13.350> cushioning<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.220> there's<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> lot<00:01:15.150> more

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
more cushioning and there's a lot more

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
more cushioning and there's a lot more
shoe<00:01:15.630> than<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.409> bionics<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.830> wouldn't<00:01:17.070> call

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
shoe than the go bionics I wouldn't call

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.499 
shoe than the go bionics I wouldn't call
this<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.670> minimal<00:01:18.479> shoe<00:01:18.659> by<00:01:18.869> any<00:01:18.900> means<00:01:20.509> even

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
this a minimal shoe by any means even

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.510 
this a minimal shoe by any means even
though<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> doesn't<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.229> high<00:01:22.560> heel<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
though it doesn't have a high heel to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.780 
though it doesn't have a high heel to
toe<00:01:23.700> offset<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.409> light<00:01:25.680> shoe<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
toe offset it's a light shoe but it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.609 
toe offset it's a light shoe but it
still<00:01:27.360> feels<00:01:27.659> more<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> traditional

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
still feels more like a traditional

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.609 
still feels more like a traditional
trainer<00:01:29.340> than<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:31.079> bionics

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
trainer than the go bionics

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
of a trend with standard trainer feeling

mid-foot<00:01:40.570> strike<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:42.369> might<00:01:42.579> be<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.850> shoe

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
mid-foot strike this might be the shoe

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.389 
mid-foot strike this might be the shoe
for<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.390> certainly<00:01:43.869> find<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.289> that<00:01:44.469> middle

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
for you certainly find that that middle

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.529 
for you certainly find that that middle
ground<00:01:45.609> acts<00:01:46.060> as<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.619> trainer<00:01:48.009> for<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.700> land

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
ground acts as a trainer for you to land

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.389 
ground acts as a trainer for you to land
on<00:01:49.869> your<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:50.469> middle<00:01:50.679> foot<00:01:50.979> it's<00:01:51.130> actually

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
on your the middle foot it's actually

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.160 
on your the middle foot it's actually
probably<00:01:51.549> hard<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:52.000> land<00:01:52.240> on<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.719> back<00:01:52.959> gear

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
probably hard to land on the back gear

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.779 
probably hard to land on the back gear
foot<00:01:53.380> with<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.709> way<00:01:53.920> it's<00:01:54.100> built<00:01:54.280> up<00:01:54.520> there<00:01:54.700> in

foot with the way it's built up there in
the<00:01:54.880> center<00:01:55.179> I<00:01:55.390> think<00:01:56.049> it's<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.679> different

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
the center I think it's just a different

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.590 
the center I think it's just a different
way<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.130> training<00:01:57.789> someone<00:01:58.149> on<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.329> mid<00:01:58.450> foot

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
way of training someone on the mid foot

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.499 
way of training someone on the mid foot
similar<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.609> Newton<00:02:00.609> having<00:02:00.939> guides<00:02:01.149> in<00:02:01.420> the

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
similar to Newton having guides in the

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.260 
similar to Newton having guides in the
front<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.959> let<00:02:02.859> you<00:02:02.979> know<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.579> reward<00:02:04.119> you<00:02:04.240> for

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
landing correctly definitely this shoe

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.259 
landing correctly definitely this shoe
forces<00:02:08.019> you<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.519> it's<00:02:09.519> more<00:02:09.729> aggressive<00:02:09.910> and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
forces you to it's more aggressive and

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.850 
forces you to it's more aggressive and
forcing<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.869> land<00:02:11.140> on<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.440> mid<00:02:11.650> foot
