00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
stereo sound right now I've got it
hooked<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> mono<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.229> have

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
hooked up to mono because I don't have

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.910 
hooked up to mono because I don't have
the<00:01:25.530> connector<00:01:25.979> hook<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.600> stereo<00:01:27.920> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the connector hook it up for stereo and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.109 
the connector hook it up for stereo and
then<00:01:29.040> also<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.700> hook<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
then also you can hook it up to a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.140 
then also you can hook it up to a
trackball<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.979> an<00:01:32.070> analog<00:01:32.400> controller<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
trackball and for an analog controller I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.100 
trackball and for an analog controller I
know<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> games<00:01:34.610> RC<00:01:35.610> Daigo<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.900> can

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
know one of the games RC Daigo you can

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.789 
know one of the games RC Daigo you can
actually<00:01:37.579> get<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.820> they<00:01:39.210> look<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.600> like

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
actually get like they look just like

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.340 
actually get like they look just like
radio-controlled<00:01:40.799> controllers<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.229> hook<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
radio-controlled controllers and hook it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.889 
radio-controlled controllers and hook it
up<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:44.100> board<00:01:44.939> here<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.390> play<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> game

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
up to this board here and play the game

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.240 
up to this board here and play the game
with<00:01:46.200> those<00:01:46.320> special<00:01:46.530> controllers<00:01:47.009> actually

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
with those special controllers actually

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.469 
with those special controllers actually
I<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.490> need<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> special<00:01:47.970> controllers

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
I think you need the special controllers

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.249 
I think you need the special controllers
to<00:01:48.600> play<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:51.420> yeah<00:01:51.600> there's<00:01:51.810> those

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
to play it so yeah there's those

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.800 
to play it so yeah there's those
connectors<00:01:52.880> also<00:01:53.880> some<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.299> games<00:01:54.540> can

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
connectors also some of the games can

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.010 
connectors also some of the games can
actually<00:01:55.170> store<00:01:55.409> replays<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.340> sidebar<00:01:56.880> er

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
actually store replays on sidebar er

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.649 
actually store replays on sidebar er
medium<00:01:58.829> unit<00:01:59.159> which<00:01:59.369> I've<00:01:59.460> actually<00:01:59.630> got<00:02:00.630> over

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
medium unit which I've actually got over

just<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.209> mahjong<00:04:15.209> gamer<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.720> me<00:04:15.810> there's<00:04:15.959> a

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
just a mahjong gamer to me there's a

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
just a mahjong gamer to me there's a
Shanghai<00:04:16.350> game<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:18.410> guess<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.590> shooters<00:04:19.950> are

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
Shanghai game I guess the shooters are

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.440 
Shanghai game I guess the shooters are
probably<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.459> strong<00:04:20.700> point<00:04:20.940> uh<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:21.180> this<00:04:21.270> is

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
probably the strong point uh but this is

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.400 
probably the strong point uh but this is
one<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.780> better<00:04:21.900> ones<00:04:22.109> in<00:04:22.290> my<00:04:22.380> opinion

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
one of the better ones in my opinion

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:45.100 
one of the better ones in my opinion
rate<00:04:22.980> crisis<00:04:23.400> here

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:58.790 

all<00:04:45.680> right<00:04:45.890> it's<00:04:46.760> almost<00:04:47.060> good<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.390> go<00:04:47.510> here

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:29.560 

there<00:04:59.370> we<00:04:59.490> go

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.820 

there<00:05:30.570> is<00:05:30.810> about<00:05:31.080> it's<00:05:31.259> about<00:05:31.410> how<00:05:31.530> long<00:05:31.710> it

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
there is about it's about how long it

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.129 
there is about it's about how long it
takes<00:05:32.039> I<00:05:32.250> guess<00:05:32.280> that's<00:05:32.669> a<00:05:32.940> minute<00:05:33.360> or<00:05:33.449> two

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:48.760 

later

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.800 

so<00:05:49.280> I<00:05:49.340> guess<00:05:49.490> it's<00:05:50.060> not<00:05:50.210> a<00:05:50.270> machine<00:05:50.449> that's

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
so I guess it's not a machine that's

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.719 
so I guess it's not a machine that's
essential<00:05:51.259> to<00:05:51.289> have<00:05:51.500> unless<00:05:51.860> you're<00:05:52.069> a<00:05:52.130> big

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
essential to have unless you're a big

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.909 
essential to have unless you're a big

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
machines like I said most of the games

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.469 
machines like I said most of the games
