let's say let's take the marathon I see

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.860 
let's say let's take the marathon I see
in<00:00:01.829> your<00:00:01.890> lead<00:00:02.100> Runner<00:00:02.520> and<00:00:02.780> you'll<00:00:03.780> probably

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
in your lead Runner and you'll probably

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.170 
in your lead Runner and you'll probably
finish<00:00:04.319> it<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:04.770> under<00:00:04.920> two<00:00:05.279> hours<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.819> 30

finish it in under two hours and 30

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.259 
finish it in under two hours and 30
minutes<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.629> call<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> sprint<00:00:08.150> so<00:00:09.150> I'll

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
minutes I call that a sprint so I'll

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.600 
minutes I call that a sprint so I'll
basically<00:00:09.420> eat<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:10.500> an<00:00:10.920> appropriate<00:00:11.400> meal

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
basically eat of an appropriate meal

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.400 
basically eat of an appropriate meal
four<00:00:12.179> hours<00:00:12.360> before<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.719> start<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:12.960> marathon

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
four hours before you start the marathon

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.530 
four hours before you start the marathon
a<00:00:13.620> little<00:00:14.219> hormonal<00:00:14.429> touch-up<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.450> know

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a little hormonal touch-up you know

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.840 
a little hormonal touch-up you know
before<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:15.929> start<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.410> line<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.369> then

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
before you start this line and then

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.310 
before you start this line and then
drink<00:00:18.300> lots<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.570> water<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> next<00:00:19.140> two<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
drink lots of water for the next two and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.349 
drink lots of water for the next two and
a<00:00:19.380> half<00:00:19.500> hours<00:00:19.760> now<00:00:20.760> when<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.000> get<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
a half hours now when you get to the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.170 
a half hours now when you get to the
Iron<00:00:21.539> Man<00:00:21.720> which<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> 12<00:00:23.100> hour<00:00:23.250> event<00:00:23.550> well

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
Iron Man which is a 12 hour event well

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.240 
Iron Man which is a 12 hour event well
that's<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.449> little<00:00:24.660> more<00:00:24.840> than<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> sprint<00:00:25.439> now

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
that's a little more than a sprint now

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.400 
that's a little more than a sprint now
it's<00:00:26.460> very<00:00:26.699> hard<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> basically<00:00:27.480> eat<00:00:27.779> when

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
it's very hard to basically eat when

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.700 
it's very hard to basically eat when
you're<00:00:28.529> swimming<00:00:29.960> it's<00:00:30.960> kind<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.260> hard<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.500> eat

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you're swimming it's kind of hard to eat

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.950 
you're swimming it's kind of hard to eat
when<00:00:31.740> you're<00:00:32.040> running<00:00:32.329> but<00:00:33.329> you've<00:00:33.510> got<00:00:33.660> six

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
when you're running but you've got six

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.229 
when you're running but you've got six
hours<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.380> bike<00:00:34.649> which<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> great<00:00:36.059> way

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
hours in that bike which is a great way

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.049 
hours in that bike which is a great way
to<00:00:36.300> refuel<00:00:36.860> but<00:00:37.860> now<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.700> you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
to refuel but now what you do you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.889 
to refuel but now what you do you
basically<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:40.309> composition<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.899> protein

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
basically have a composition of protein

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.470 
basically have a composition of protein
and<00:00:43.140> carbohydrate<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.120> taking

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and carbohydrate that you can be taking

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.119 
and carbohydrate that you can be taking
now<00:00:45.600> small<00:00:45.960> amounts<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.620> about<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.890> time

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
now small amounts to about this time

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.150 
now small amounts to about this time
period<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:48.149> replenish<00:00:48.510> refuel<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:50.010> ready

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
period to replenish refuel and get ready

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.860 
period to replenish refuel and get ready
for<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.670> last<00:00:50.850> two<00:00:51.180> hour<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.510> sprint

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
for that in that last two hour of sprint

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.760 
for that in that last two hour of sprint
which<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> marathon<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.260> again<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
which is the marathon so again it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.889 
which is the marathon so again it
depends<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> event<00:00:57.300> now<00:00:57.539> let's<00:00:57.809> say

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
depends on the event now let's say

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
depends on the event now let's say
you're<00:00:58.079> running<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.530> hundred<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:58.980> fifty<00:00:59.219> mile

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you're running a hundred and fifty mile

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.510 
you're running a hundred and fifty mile
marathon<00:01:00.469> okay<00:01:01.469> that's<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.250> long

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
marathon okay that's going to be a long

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.690 
marathon okay that's going to be a long
event<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:04.170> does<00:01:04.290> Dean<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.640> in

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
event now what does Dean do you see in

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
event now what does Dean do you see in
16<00:01:06.119> when<00:01:06.270> he's<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.479> 60<00:01:06.780> minutes<00:01:06.810> he's<00:01:07.380> throwing

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
16 when he's on 60 minutes he's throwing

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
16 when he's on 60 minutes he's throwing
down<00:01:08.100> basically<00:01:08.490> McDonald's<00:01:09.119> cheeseburgers

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
down basically McDonald's cheeseburgers

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.830 
down basically McDonald's cheeseburgers
and<00:01:10.049> he's<00:01:10.200> throwing<00:01:10.560> down<00:01:10.680> McDonald's<00:01:11.250> malt

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
and he's throwing down McDonald's malt

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.630 
and he's throwing down McDonald's malt
well<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> reason<00:01:13.170> why<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> that's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
well the reason why I can do that that's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.450 
well the reason why I can do that that's
high<00:01:14.970> octane<00:01:15.420> fuel<00:01:15.810> by<00:01:16.710> following<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> zone

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
high octane fuel by following the zone

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.899 
high octane fuel by following the zone
diet<00:01:17.670> he's<00:01:18.090> adapted<00:01:18.810> his<00:01:18.900> body<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.409> burn<00:01:19.590> fat

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
diet he's adapted his body to burn fat

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.380 
diet he's adapted his body to burn fat
to<00:01:20.909> make<00:01:21.060> lots<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.479> ATP<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.820> that's<00:01:23.820> why<00:01:24.000> they

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
to make lots of ATP and that's why they

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.600 
to make lots of ATP and that's why they
can<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.780> through<00:01:25.049> 151<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.950> try<00:01:26.280> thought<00:01:26.460> as

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
can go through 151 and try thought as

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.330 
can go through 151 and try thought as
many<00:01:27.180> fat<00:01:27.750> things<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:28.770> fun<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> eat

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
many fat things which are fun to eat

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.490 
many fat things which are fun to eat
will<00:01:29.759> milkshakes<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.900> McDonald's<00:01:31.380> or

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
will milkshakes and McDonald's or

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
will milkshakes and McDonald's or
they're<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.070> high<00:01:32.189> fat<00:01:32.460> empty<00:01:32.880> because

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
they're really high fat empty because

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.100 
they're really high fat empty because
his<00:01:34.110> body<00:01:34.979> has<00:01:35.280> been<00:01:35.460> basically<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.090> 2<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
his body has been basically a 2 now to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.870 
his body has been basically a 2 now to
convert<00:01:37.500> fat<00:01:39.350> into<00:01:40.350> basically<00:01:40.710> now<00:01:40.979> ATP<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
convert fat into basically now ATP and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.700 
convert fat into basically now ATP and
that's<00:01:42.509> why<00:01:42.750> he<00:01:42.899> has<00:01:43.020> an<00:01:43.140> unfair<00:01:43.619> advantage

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
that's why he has an unfair advantage

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.910 
that's why he has an unfair advantage
over<00:01:44.070> everyone<00:01:44.399> else<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.180> they<00:01:45.479> use

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
over everyone else because if they use

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.730 
over everyone else because if they use
carbohydrates<00:01:47.479> its<00:01:48.479> low<00:01:48.810> octane<00:01:49.200> fuel<00:01:49.500> you

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
carbohydrates its low octane fuel you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.030 
carbohydrates its low octane fuel you
cannot<00:01:50.130> make<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.640> nearly<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.540> much<00:01:51.810> ATP<00:01:52.439> from

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
cannot make and nearly as much ATP from

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.330 
cannot make and nearly as much ATP from
carbohydrates<00:01:53.909> as<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.990> from<00:01:55.170> fat<00:01:55.439> so

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
carbohydrates as you can from fat so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.910 
carbohydrates as you can from fat so
let's<00:01:56.579> say<00:01:56.640> you've<00:01:56.729> got<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.880> Maserati<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.920> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
let's say you've got a Maserati or you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.340 
let's say you've got a Maserati or you
put<00:01:59.100> low<00:01:59.369> octane<00:01:59.759> fuel<00:02:00.060> into<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.540> high

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
put low octane fuel into it or high

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.670 
put low octane fuel into it or high
octane<00:02:01.710> fuel<00:02:02.390> well<00:02:03.390> only<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> few<00:02:03.990> only<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.380> fool

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
octane fuel well only a few only a fool

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.620 
octane fuel well only a few only a fool
would<00:02:04.710> put<00:02:05.009> low<00:02:05.189> octane<00:02:05.549> fuel<00:02:05.850> until<00:02:06.180> Maserati

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
would put low octane fuel until Maserati

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.080 
would put low octane fuel until Maserati
and<00:02:06.979> that's<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> most<00:02:08.250> athletes<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.849> they're

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and that's the most athletes do they're

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.690 
and that's the most athletes do they're
putting<00:02:09.360> low<00:02:09.569> octane<00:02:10.110> feel<00:02:10.470> into<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> Maserati

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
putting low octane feel into a Maserati

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.910 
putting low octane feel into a Maserati
and<00:02:12.819> if<00:02:13.720> you're<00:02:13.870> basically<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.379> basically

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and if you're basically have basically

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.830 
and if you're basically have basically
trained<00:02:15.250> your<00:02:15.370> body<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.760> be<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
trained your body that you be like a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.869 
trained your body that you be like a
Maserati<00:02:17.110> give<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.099> high-octane<00:02:18.400> field

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
Maserati give it a high-octane field

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.890 
Maserati give it a high-octane field
