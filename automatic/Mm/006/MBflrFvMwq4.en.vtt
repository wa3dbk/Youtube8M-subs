00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.140 
salad to a friend's house and I wasn't
sure<00:00:41.350> if<00:00:41.470> I<00:00:41.590> would<00:00:41.740> have<00:00:41.890> time<00:00:42.310> to<00:00:42.730> make<00:00:42.970> the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
sure if I would have time to make the

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.600 
sure if I would have time to make the
dressing<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.630> it's<00:00:44.080> also<00:00:44.260> better<00:00:44.590> to<00:00:45.430> make

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
dressing and it's also better to make

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.610 
dressing and it's also better to make
the<00:00:45.760> dressing

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the dressing

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.560 
the dressing
at<00:00:47.620> least<00:00:47.950> a<00:00:48.250> little<00:00:48.670> bit<00:00:48.820> ahead<00:00:49.000> of<00:00:49.270> time<00:00:49.540> so

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
at least a little bit ahead of time so

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.290 
at least a little bit ahead of time so
that<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.260> flavors<00:00:51.220> can<00:00:51.580> really<00:00:52.090> marry

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
that the flavors can really marry

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.660

ingredients<00:06:53.680> that<00:06:53.710> you'll<00:06:53.979> need<00:06:54.039> is<00:06:54.460> just<00:06:54.700> 1

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
ingredients that you'll need is just 1

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.390

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
cup of finely shredded mozzarella cheese

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.920 
cup of finely shredded mozzarella cheese
and<00:06:57.760> you'll<00:06:57.880> just<00:06:58.030> sprinkle<00:06:58.419> that<00:06:58.449> right<00:06:58.720> over

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
and you'll just sprinkle that right over

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.879 
and you'll just sprinkle that right over
the<00:06:59.020> top<00:06:59.289> and<00:06:59.590> then<00:07:00.630> your<00:07:01.630> toaster<00:07:02.260> sugared

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
the top and then your toaster sugared

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.290 
the top and then your toaster sugared
almonds<00:07:03.490> and<00:07:04.419> then<00:07:04.840> the<00:07:05.110> poppy<00:07:05.380> seed<00:07:05.740> dressing

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
almonds and then the poppy seed dressing

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.150 
almonds and then the poppy seed dressing
so<00:07:07.300> it<00:07:07.660> separates<00:07:08.020> a<00:07:08.200> little<00:07:08.229> bit<00:07:08.560> because

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
so it separates a little bit because

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.090 
so it separates a little bit because
it's<00:07:09.460> vinegar<00:07:10.060> and<00:07:10.600> oil<00:07:11.139> in<00:07:11.470> there<00:07:11.710> so<00:07:12.010> you

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
it's vinegar and oil in there so you

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.230 
it's vinegar and oil in there so you
could<00:07:12.280> just<00:07:12.310> shake<00:07:12.550> that<00:07:12.610> up<00:07:12.820> a<00:07:13.000> little<00:07:13.090> bit

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 
could just shake that up a little bit

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.690 
could just shake that up a little bit
but<00:07:13.600> that's<00:07:13.750> the<00:07:14.020> salad<00:07:14.530> and<00:07:14.770> I<00:07:14.979> will<00:07:15.280> post<00:07:15.490> a

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700
