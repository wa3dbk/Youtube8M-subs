volume<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:08.030> start<00:00:09.030> tools<00:00:09.389> here<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.639> we<00:00:11.639> can

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
volume I start tools here and we can

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.700 
volume I start tools here and we can
select<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.630> portion<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.099> image<00:00:14.460> here<00:00:16.910> and

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
select a portion of the image here and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.970 
select a portion of the image here and
this<00:00:19.710> will<00:00:19.980> show<00:00:20.250> up<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.900> preview<00:00:22.410> here<00:00:22.769> I

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
this will show up on the preview here I

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.150 
this will show up on the preview here I
can<00:00:23.369> move<00:00:24.090> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.709 

and<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:30.060> decide<00:00:30.890> how<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.919> want<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.910> modify

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and I can decide how I want to modify

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.860 
and I can decide how I want to modify
the<00:00:34.260> image<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.250> mean<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> volume<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.390> can

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the image I mean the volume I can

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.639 
the image I mean the volume I can
extrude<00:00:37.410> our<00:00:37.769> emboss<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.790> will<00:00:39.390> use<00:00:39.600> simply<00:00:40.350> dig

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
extrude our emboss I will use simply dig

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.360 
extrude our emboss I will use simply dig
and<00:00:40.920> grow<00:00:41.160> which<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.910> easier<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.600> me<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.720> say

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
and grow which is easier for me to say

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.040 
and grow which is easier for me to say
so<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.940> use<00:00:45.379> different<00:00:46.379> shapes<00:00:46.650> like

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
so we can use different shapes like

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.420 
so we can use different shapes like
circle<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:50.010> cubic<00:00:50.720> linear<00:00:51.720> or<00:00:52.019> constant<00:00:52.890> let's

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
circle be cubic linear or constant let's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.950 
circle be cubic linear or constant let's
draw<00:00:54.920> Grove<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.089> constant<00:00:58.129> value<00:00:59.960> we

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
draw Grove is with a constant value we

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.469 
draw Grove is with a constant value we
get<00:01:01.110> this<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.619> of<00:01:01.739> thing<00:01:02.250> happening<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.790> I

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.510 

can<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.470> other<00:01:10.680> side<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
can do that on the other side on the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:24.380 
can do that on the other side on the
back<00:01:11.729> side<00:01:12.170> let's<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> different<00:01:14.009> shape

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.150 

if<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.020> want<00:01:25.260> something<00:01:26.000> round<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:28.320> happen<00:01:28.710> here

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
if I want something round to happen here

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.110 
if I want something round to happen here
I<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.540> add<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:34.340> just<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.550> add<00:01:35.790> something

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
I just can add I just can add something

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.350 
I just can add I just can add something
like<00:01:36.480> that

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.290 

okay<00:01:42.160> that's<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.310> way<00:01:44.260> it<00:01:45.260> works<00:01:45.560> basically

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
okay that's the way it works basically

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.190 
okay that's the way it works basically
now<00:01:47.300> we<00:01:47.360> will<00:01:47.660> look<00:01:48.200> at<00:01:48.410> some<00:01:48.910> practical

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
now we will look at some practical

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.030 
now we will look at some practical
applications<00:01:52.570> I'm<00:01:53.570> not<00:01:53.840> an<00:01:54.020> artist<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.710> will

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
applications I'm not an artist so I will

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.370 
applications I'm not an artist so I will
just<00:01:55.370> show<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.120> principle<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.110> hope

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
just show you the principle and I hope

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.510 
just show you the principle and I hope
and<00:01:57.860> I<00:01:58.190> will<00:01:58.370> not<00:01:59.710> destroy<00:02:00.710> too<00:02:01.040> much<00:02:01.220> this

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
and I will not destroy too much this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.210 
and I will not destroy too much this
nice<00:02:01.820> young<00:02:02.330> lady<00:02:03.310> here<00:02:04.310> we<00:02:04.460> will<00:02:04.640> initialize

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
nice young lady here we will initialize

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.140 
nice young lady here we will initialize
animation<00:02:07.220> as<00:02:08.530> 3d<00:02:09.530> mesh<00:02:09.890> full<00:02:10.429> image<00:02:10.850> which

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
animation as 3d mesh full image which

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.470 
animation as 3d mesh full image which
means<00:02:11.390> is<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.570> flat<00:02:12.070> it's<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.340> flat<00:02:13.640> image<00:02:13.970> at<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
means is a flat it's a flat image at the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:24.340 
means is a flat it's a flat image at the
beginning

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:33.030 

select<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.400> tools<00:02:27.220> will

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:03:47.370 

do<00:02:33.840> all<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.290> turn

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.030 

okay<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.280> rests<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.850> principle<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:50.040> I'm

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
okay that rests the principle of it I'm

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.410 
okay that rests the principle of it I'm
really<00:03:51.340> not<00:03:51.640> an<00:03:51.850> artist<00:03:52.270> but<00:03:52.600> I'm<00:03:53.500> sure<00:03:54.420> some

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
really not an artist but I'm sure some

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.410 
really not an artist but I'm sure some
people<00:03:55.450> can<00:03:56.020> do<00:03:56.170> something<00:03:56.880> nice<00:03:57.880> with<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.210> I

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
people can do something nice with that I

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.080 
people can do something nice with that I
hope<00:03:58.810> so<00:04:01.950> something<00:04:02.950> easier<00:04:03.370> for<00:04:03.580> me<00:04:03.730> is<00:04:03.790> to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
hope so something easier for me is to

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.830 
hope so something easier for me is to
show<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.360> how<00:04:04.990> the<00:04:05.050> 3d<00:04:05.830> editor<00:04:06.370> tools<00:04:06.760> can<00:04:07.690> be

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
show you how the 3d editor tools can be

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.700 
show you how the 3d editor tools can be
used<00:04:08.050> to<00:04:08.320> create<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:09.040> 3d<00:04:09.670> graphics<00:04:10.710> for

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
used to create the 3d graphics for

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:33.780 
used to create the 3d graphics for
example<00:04:12.130> here<00:04:12.520> I<00:04:12.900> select<00:04:16.320> this<00:04:17.320> part<00:04:17.650> here

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.830 

here<00:04:34.420> I<00:04:34.450> will<00:04:34.630> use<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:35.230> tills<00:04:35.830> plane<00:04:36.220> tool<00:04:36.970> as

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
here I will use the tills plane tool as

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.540 
here I will use the tills plane tool as
it<00:04:38.140> name<00:04:38.490> implies<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:40.000> tool<00:04:40.270> allows<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:40.840> tilt

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
it name implies this tool allows to tilt

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.700 
it name implies this tool allows to tilt
the<00:04:42.550> plane<00:04:42.850> like<00:04:43.180> this<00:04:43.440> which<00:04:44.440> is<00:04:44.470> an

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
the plane like this which is an

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.040 
the plane like this which is an
interesting<00:04:45.370> effect<00:04:45.790> okay<00:04:46.630> we<00:04:46.690> can<00:04:46.870> do<00:04:47.020> that

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
interesting effect okay we can do that

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.440 
interesting effect okay we can do that
that<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:48.300> think<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.390> best<00:04:49.570> here<00:04:49.900> will<00:04:50.110> be<00:04:51.450> just

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
that I think the best here will be just

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.670 
that I think the best here will be just
like<00:04:53.250> that

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.440 

and<00:04:59.680> finally<00:05:00.280> this<00:05:00.430> is<00:05:00.490> another<00:05:01.210> application

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
and finally this is another application

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.860 
and finally this is another application
of<00:05:02.520> tilted<00:05:03.520> plane<00:05:03.610> tool<00:05:04.060> as<00:05:04.420> we've<00:05:04.630> seen

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
of tilted plane tool as we've seen

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.800 
of tilted plane tool as we've seen
before<00:05:05.640> to<00:05:06.640> produce<00:05:06.970> nice<00:05:07.300> 3d<00:05:08.110> effects<00:05:09.810> let's

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
before to produce nice 3d effects let's

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:42.959 
before to produce nice 3d effects let's
look<00:05:11.020> at<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.860> video<00:05:12.370> convert

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.029
