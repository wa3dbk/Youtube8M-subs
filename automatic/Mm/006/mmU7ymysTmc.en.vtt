00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:09.740
 today i will show you one experiment 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:13.070
 in front of you are blocks and mycelium here 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.600
 you see white even plaque at all 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.970
 blocks 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.220
 hanging bunches 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.720
 throw hang it already comes the second wave 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.500
 fruiting and I want to convert your 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.820
 attention to this one here a number of blocks 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.370
 he is not white he is black like that 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.430
 small glimpses of such whiteness 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:43.339
 this blocks were seeded with mycelium which 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.449
 in its appearance was very different from 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:50.390
 good mycelium it is slightly sour 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.110
 it smells kind of wet we had it 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.180
 tagged 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.670
 here's the pace bad mycelium straw 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.280
 same what's in this block what's in this 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.199
 but because of the bad mycelium you see that in 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.020
 one they are dark black and 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:13.150
 block small mounts white spots 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.650
 here is the overgrown mushroom structure here 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.579
 only the first one goes to these blocks 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.520
 fruiting 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:23.510
 here from the whole block here is a couple like 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.840
 bunches 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.920
 here here here and here 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.280
 a little bit 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.180
 that is, practically no fruiting 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.630
 it's all about what you need 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.930
 acquire good seed and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.659
 do not purchase through mail 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.950
 she look for suppliers who is 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.710
 let's say so 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.549
 at 1 2 3 days delivery maximum 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.820
 by road not even by mail 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.460
 By road, the goods are shipped by mail . 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.070
 longer and mycelium has time to die 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.429
 due to being kept improper 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.840
 mycelium storage temperature conditions 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.810
 I want to say it again to 4 degrees 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.519
 Celsius until it can be stored up to two 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.459
 maximum of three months at this 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.580
 temperature is constant if it is at 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:27.099
 lower boundary temperature without 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.599
 defrosting and freezing again just 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.560
 frozen loan can be kept 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:35.500
 much longer but here we spent 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.660
 experiment and make sure that the mycelium 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.079
 which was kept at non-compliance 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.269
 thermal performance it dramatically 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.260
 different in its productivity and 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.970
 the appearance of those who were good 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.109
 states therefore buy mycelium 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.450
 only verified sellers and 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:06.340
 See that the transfer does not take 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:10.560
 more than two days well, a maximum of 3 is in 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.430
 warm season I mean not summer 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.810
 September-October and 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.620
 Well if April to mid-May when there 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.219
 more or less 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.189
 cool summer temperatures do not buy 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:31.450
 their goals in general in the summer cook their 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:31.450
 acreage for winter thanks
