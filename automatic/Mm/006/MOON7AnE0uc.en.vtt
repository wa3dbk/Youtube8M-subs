00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello in today's video I bring you one 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.160
 first impression of the base 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.889
 mac makeup studio fix powder and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.379
 is a compact makeup base in 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 dust format that has a coverage 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.340
 medium high so if you want to see which 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.510
 It has been my first impression on this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.540
 I leave based video watching 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.520
 as you see I have some marquitas some 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.780
 granites I'm not going to get corrector and 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.090
 we will see the coverage that really 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.940
 it has the base I do not know if I said it before 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.900
 but the tone is an in w 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.290
 22 I applied before or the control 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.540
 lotion the brightness control solution 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.430
 that have given me a couple of many to 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:01:03.729
 I'll try it and see how I feel 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:01:07.510
 it seems like the composition of the base 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.340
 brings fine talc is true that note 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.190
 that the politos stay much more 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.100
 filled with a base of standards and not 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.390
 let's apply craymer 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.330
 the truth is that just me naked eye 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.100
 I liked it a lot, I'm going to apply the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.320
 makeup right and right away I'll be back 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.600
 the base format of that from here is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.640
 a compact that I work so little here 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.560
 to open all three his mirror that the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.509
 it's true that it was quite good and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.670
 then bring here what would become the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.020
 product then has a little eyelash that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.640
 we raise and down here brings your 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.520
 sponge this type of powder bases 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 It is indicated for oily skin as in 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.350
 the case of mine because in its content 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.110
 has silica that absorbs the greatness of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.450
 the skin and also has talcum powder 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.710
 completed by milestone the expectations that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.909
 I have on that basis, the truth is that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.920
 They are pretty good that you bring and 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.240
 camel to try the store and the truth that 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.819
 the coverage he gave me was pretty 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.830
 good and I was impressed by 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.420
 say it like that because I was a little 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.989
 aesthetics when testing bases in 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.430
 dust because I did not feel comfortable I thought 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.010
 that they were not going to cover me as much as a 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.180
 fluid base 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.269
 the ignorance of a 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.709
 so you have where it contains because the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.390
 problem areas that I have that are 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.370
 made of the very freight here by the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.569
 it worked under my nose or I have 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.189
 some granites the truth is that 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.200
 now he has covered them well not 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.719
 totally but it 's a pretty finish 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.129
 natural that I like so nothing oier 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.560
 updating during the day to see what 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.739
 such is going and at the end of the day I will give my 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.739
 impressions 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.219
 was returned now and as I have 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.079
 changed the color of the lips a little 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.209
 and that's because I'm recording some 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:53.490
 videos but the foundation does not the 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:58.260
 I have played and are now the 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.360
 three and a half ago about 5 4 hours ago and 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.250
 half five hours that I take the base 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.810
 put and I have to tell you what 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.630
 pretty good that they liked 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.550
 quite because as you can see neither the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.320
 Blusher or illuminator are gone 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.850
 falling with the base is something in everything 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.920
 pretty good and I have brightness because my 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.690
 skin is fat but the truth is that it is 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.459
 holding up pretty well 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.410
 I feel shine here in the area 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.770
 of the forehead but not an ugly glow that 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.770
 tell you 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.430
 shine and here in the area of 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.750
 nose and I noticed it a little more 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.519
 tell you that he is holding me up 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.370
 but after having eaten here 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.269
 by the sides of the lip and in the area 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.030
 of the chin 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.090
 I lost base and also a little bit 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.469
 the nostrils but for the rest 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.049
 of the face the truth that is quite 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.579
 well within a couple of hours it's back 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.120
 to update and I will give you my impressions 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.120
 final 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.569
 now here the seal again to make 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.269
 the latest update and to give you already 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.239
 my final opinions are right now 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.590
 seven twenty in the afternoon and 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.750
 I've been wearing makeup since nine o'clock 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.480
 tomorrow about the makeup I 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.519
 I endure divinely but the truth is 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.729
 that the area of the forehead I hardly have 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.979
 grease and we did not shine 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.410
 area under the eye or on the chin 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.199
 only some that others above the 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.960
 nose but both side the blusher and I 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.449
 Holds perfect as the coverage continues 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.729
 intact also the little granites do not 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.020
 they have finished leaving and I the 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.360
 I recommend those of you who have skins 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.889
 fats we also have to have in 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.840
 account that has a wide range of 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.900
 colors and that we can each find 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.460
 the perfect tone for our skin and I 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.500
 What else can I say that I liked? 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.270
 a lot and that is still very happy 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.590
 have bought it and little else is left for me 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.510
 say oh that what I hope you have 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.400
 liked the video and meditated on xÃ tiva 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.139
 if it has been like that also if you want to 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.639

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.229

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.550

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.569
 videos that you want to see or in general 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.800

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.080

 go up and you will not lose any and nothing else 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.439
 dismiss for today thank you very much for seeing me 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.439
 see you the next video see you later 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.560
 I see how we clean wishing 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.129
 wash my face and I ran out to 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.080
 take truth I think you 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.059
 since if they have lost me the little 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.169
 could take advantage of the soil as the 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.169
 grandmother against cabbage 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:44.720
 but the truth is that you see guas but 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.720
 the truth but the truth 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:53.890
 but there is a noise 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.240
 or
