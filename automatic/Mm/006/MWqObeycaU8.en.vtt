00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.689
 hello I'm tomÃ¡s colombian pilot door 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:56.620
 competing in the American championship 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:58.510
 of super sport speed below 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.730
 I want to show you how to make a better 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.430
 stopped because we worry about you here 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.630
 in port security 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.280
 Motor brake consists of using the motor 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.730
 reducing changes like retaining for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.190
 slow down 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.380
 it is important to have two fingers of 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.590
 hands on the brake cam and the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.880
 rear brake lever time 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.130
 ready to go into action when you 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.920
 require what allows you to earn seconds 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.810
 in it in a rushed editorial this 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.770
 will reduce the effort ros 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.770
 about the kingdoms 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.020
 The main brake on the motorcycle is the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.299
 front that is really the one that has 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.310
 the bike the butt we use it as 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.009
 complement and as help for 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.020
 stabilize the bike and ideally then 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.020
 is to use both at the same time 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.080
 and reduce speed in a way 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.180
 gradual to that of the traffic light shrimp 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.880
 intersection or before facing a 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.190
 road curve in practice what 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.350
 is used normally I will not carry everything 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.790
 the time of this position but when 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.429
 let's get closer to a lot area 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.340
 traffic I hope you liked the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.560
 handling tips remember in comply 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.130
 we talk about the engine we educate and 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.130
 we create awareness 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 do not
