they're very very effective while

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.110 
they're very very effective while
sniping<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.200> also<00:05:30.160> while<00:05:30.430> playing<00:05:30.700> with<00:05:30.850> a

is and this one straight up to spawn
just<00:05:36.610> head<00:05:36.760> back<00:05:36.790> off<00:05:37.210> on<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.690> second<00:05:38.230> level

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
just head back off on the second level

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.870 
just head back off on the second level
of<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.620> building<00:05:38.950> jump<00:05:39.190> over<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.640> small

sight all the way over to be down which
is<00:05:43.780> very<00:05:44.170> very<00:05:44.380> effective<00:05:44.860> straight<00:05:45.190> off<00:05:45.370> this

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
is very very effective straight off this

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.490 
is very very effective straight off this
bone<00:05:45.820> so<00:05:46.420> these<00:05:46.630> tekken<00:05:47.020> one<00:05:47.110> is<00:05:47.200> not<00:05:47.290> about

bone so these tekken one is not about

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.620 
bone so these tekken one is not about
going<00:05:47.680> back<00:05:48.010> but<00:05:48.220> rather<00:05:48.400> forward<00:05:48.970> so<00:05:49.420> when<00:05:49.600> i

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
going back but rather forward so when i

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.650 
what makes this map so special will make
this<00:06:23.190> map<00:06:23.400> so<00:06:23.640> unique<00:06:24.120> towards<00:06:24.450> the<00:06:24.540> other

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
this map so unique towards the other

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.880 
this map so unique towards the other
maps<00:06:24.840> and<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.170> is<00:06:25.290> of<00:06:25.440> course<00:06:25.620> the

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
maps and that is of course the

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.430 
maps and that is of course the
destructible<00:06:26.640> rocks<00:06:26.790> and<00:06:27.570> yeah<00:06:28.110> the<00:06:28.260> three

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
destructible rocks and yeah the three

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.570 
destructible rocks and yeah the three
locations<00:06:28.920> where<00:06:29.100> you<00:06:29.160> can<00:06:29.310> find<00:06:29.430> the

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
locations where you can find the

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.220 
locations where you can find the
destructible<00:06:30.000> rocks<00:06:30.090> on<00:06:30.480> this<00:06:30.630> map<00:06:30.900> and<00:06:31.140> the

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
destructible rocks on this map and the

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.260 
destructible rocks on this map and the
first<00:06:31.440> one<00:06:31.620> is<00:06:31.650> over<00:06:31.890> here<00:06:32.310> there's<00:06:32.820> two<00:06:33.060> small

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
first one is over here there's two small

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.670 
first one is over here there's two small
areas<00:06:33.600> where<00:06:33.750> you<00:06:33.810> can<00:06:33.900> shoot<00:06:34.140> then<00:06:34.380> the<00:06:34.470> snow

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
areas where you can shoot then the snow

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.260 
areas where you can shoot then the snow
and<00:06:34.890> the<00:06:34.920> ice<00:06:34.980> actually<00:06:35.370> fall<00:06:35.760> down<00:06:36.000> this

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
and the ice actually fall down this

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.510 
and the ice actually fall down this
actually<00:06:36.630> a<00:06:36.690> gap<00:06:37.080> so<00:06:37.650> people<00:06:37.830> can<00:06:38.070> fall<00:06:38.250> down

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
actually a gap so people can fall down

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.180 
actually a gap so people can fall down
and<00:06:38.790> die<00:06:38.870> the<00:06:39.870> second<00:06:40.230> one<00:06:40.320> is<00:06:40.350> under<00:06:40.830> be<00:06:40.980> dumb

need<00:06:51.240> to<00:06:51.360> discover<00:06:51.750> a<00:06:52.050> pop<00:06:52.260> discovery<00:06:52.950> see

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
need to discover a pop discovery see

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.550 
need to discover a pop discovery see
what<00:06:53.670> I<00:06:53.730> did<00:06:53.760> there<00:06:53.940> boom<00:06:54.360> baby<00:06:54.630> but<00:06:55.260> yeah<00:06:55.410> it

what I did there boom baby but yeah it

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.260 
what I did there boom baby but yeah it
is<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:55.710> great<00:06:56.070> map<00:06:56.280> that<00:06:56.550> there<00:06:56.700> is<00:06:56.790> a<00:06:56.940> lot<00:06:57.240> to

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
is a great map that there is a lot to

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.840 
is a great map that there is a lot to
learn<00:06:57.450> so<00:06:57.840> get<00:06:58.050> to<00:06:58.260> it<00:06:58.290> and<00:06:58.650> just<00:06:58.710> a<00:06:59.400> heads<00:06:59.610> up

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
learn so get to it and just a heads up

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.120 
learn so get to it and just a heads up
heads<00:07:00.240> up<00:07:00.450> about<00:07:00.630> the<00:07:00.900> destructible<00:07:01.530> rocks<00:07:01.650> a

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
heads up about the destructible rocks a

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.860 
heads up about the destructible rocks a
lot<00:07:02.670> of<00:07:02.700> people<00:07:02.820> know<00:07:03.210> where<00:07:03.510> they're<00:07:03.720> located

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
lot of people know where they're located

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.630 
lot of people know where they're located
on<00:07:04.350> the<00:07:04.470> map<00:07:04.620> so<00:07:04.920> instead<00:07:05.160> of<00:07:05.220> just<00:07:05.430> running

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:05.640 
on the map so instead of just running

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.550 
on the map so instead of just running
over<00:07:05.970> they<00:07:06.090> will<00:07:06.210> jump<00:07:06.510> and<00:07:06.780> that's<00:07:07.230> the<00:07:07.380> same

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
over they will jump and that's the same

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.320 
over they will jump and that's the same
for<00:07:07.710> me<00:07:07.830> I<00:07:07.860> bill<00:07:08.100> I<00:07:08.130> played<00:07:08.640> the<00:07:08.790> map<00:07:08.940> so<00:07:09.180> many

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
for me I bill I played the map so many

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.180 
for me I bill I played the map so many
times<00:07:09.600> I've<00:07:09.840> built<00:07:09.960> up<00:07:10.140> this<00:07:10.320> reflex<00:07:10.800> whenever

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
times I've built up this reflex whenever

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.190 
times I've built up this reflex whenever
I<00:07:11.280> come<00:07:11.880> to<00:07:12.060> this<00:07:12.180> area<00:07:12.360> where<00:07:12.780> there<00:07:12.960> is<00:07:13.080> to

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200 
I come to this area where there is to

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.560 
I come to this area where there is to
distract<00:07:13.500> Barack<00:07:13.890> I<00:07:14.190> will<00:07:14.640> jump<00:07:14.970> just<00:07:15.330> because

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
distract Barack I will jump just because

distract Barack I will jump just because
I<00:07:15.690> don't<00:07:15.840> want<00:07:15.870> to<00:07:16.020> take<00:07:16.170> the<00:07:16.200> risk<00:07:16.320> of<00:07:16.620> falling

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
I don't want to take the risk of falling

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.950 
I don't want to take the risk of falling
down<00:07:17.160> so<00:07:17.550> don't<00:07:18.150> expect<00:07:18.330> getting<00:07:18.780> like<00:07:18.930> a

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
down so don't expect getting like a

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.320 
down so don't expect getting like a
seven<00:07:19.470> or<00:07:19.620> eight<00:07:19.800> chemistry<00:07:20.280> just<00:07:20.550> by<00:07:20.820> people

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
seven or eight chemistry just by people

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.810 
seven or eight chemistry just by people
falling<00:07:21.630> down<00:07:21.810> there<00:07:22.200> so<00:07:22.800> yeah<00:07:23.160> that's<00:07:23.370> it<00:07:23.580> for

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820 
falling down there so yeah that's it for

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.910 
falling down there so yeah that's it for
