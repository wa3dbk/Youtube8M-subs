so<00:00:09.290> how's<00:00:09.530> the<00:00:09.710> engineering<00:00:10.100> work<00:00:10.250> coming

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
so how's the engineering work coming

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.010 
so how's the engineering work coming
it's<00:00:11.030> not<00:00:11.150> my<00:00:11.300> cup<00:00:11.480> of<00:00:11.510> tea

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.020 
it's not my cup of tea

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.959 
it's not my cup of tea
but<00:00:12.920> I<00:00:13.010> have<00:00:13.219> gotten<00:00:13.490> some<00:00:13.610> brownie<00:00:13.820> points

with<00:00:14.240> Leffler<00:00:14.660> what's<00:00:15.380> the<00:00:15.500> problem<00:00:15.800> then

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
with Leffler what's the problem then

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.280 
with Leffler what's the problem then
if<00:00:16.490> I<00:00:16.610> have<00:00:16.700> to<00:00:16.760> replace<00:00:16.939> one<00:00:17.270> more<00:00:17.450> OD<00:00:17.810> n<00:00:17.960> relay

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
if I have to replace one more OD n relay

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.530 
if I have to replace one more OD n relay
in<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.470> next<00:00:18.710> ten<00:00:18.950> years<00:00:19.270> that'll<00:00:20.270> be<00:00:20.360> too

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
in the next ten years that'll be too

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.220 
in the next ten years that'll be too
soon

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230

brain backtracked the information into
your<00:01:28.940> subconscious<00:01:29.210> as<00:01:29.810> soon<00:01:29.960> as<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:30.170> read

the news

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.460 
the news
it<00:01:32.240> was<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:32.659> real<00:01:33.050> though<00:01:33.409> I<00:01:35.110> could<00:01:36.110> see<00:01:36.290> their

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
it was so real though I could see their

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.540 
it was so real though I could see their
ships<00:01:36.590> approaching<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.400> Deneb<00:01:37.700> system<00:01:38.210> and

no the Borg have adapted to that
technology<00:02:30.769> as<00:02:31.189> well<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:32.420> we're<00:02:32.599> better<00:02:32.810> off

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
technology as well but we're better off

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.110 
technology as well but we're better off
retuning<00:02:33.650> our<00:02:33.799> photon<00:02:34.340> torpedoes<00:02:34.909> and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
retuning our photon torpedoes and

retuning our photon torpedoes and
bothering<00:02:35.569> with<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.900> blood<00:02:36.170> technology<00:02:36.980> I

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
bothering with that blood technology I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.640 
bothering with that blood technology I
don't<00:02:37.760> disagree<00:02:38.180> with<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.569> I'm<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.290> trying

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
don't disagree with you I'm just trying

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:49.000 
don't disagree with you I'm just trying
to<00:02:39.799> point<00:02:40.010> out<00:02:40.189> that<00:02:40.400> we<00:02:40.579> too<00:02:40.819> can<00:02:41.030> adapt

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.410 

that's<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:49.849> used<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.209> think<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:52.420> remember

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
that's what I used to think I remember

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.050 
that's what I used to think I remember
when<00:02:53.569> things<00:02:53.780> were<00:02:53.900> different<00:02:54.110> when<00:02:55.060> people

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
when things were different when people

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.900 
when things were different when people
forgot<00:02:56.330> about<00:02:56.390> wool<00:02:56.840> 35<00:02:57.290> 9<00:02:57.580> when<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.670> board

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
forgot about wool 35 9 when the board

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.339 
forgot about wool 35 9 when the board
was<00:02:59.090> just<00:02:59.300> another<00:02:59.540> enemy<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.110> could<00:03:00.260> be

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349
