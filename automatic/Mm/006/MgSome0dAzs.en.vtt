00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:39.000
 place where they torture many things of my 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 body because it 's true 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:51.780

 do not believe that you are alone because it is bad 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:04.630
 what happens is that now you can see 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.530
 so look 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.280
 imagine when we have denominators 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.859
 non-conventional 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.740
 with your body in one hour and 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:55.430
 we train three of four only one hour 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.430
 we try to focus on the interest 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.440
 It is very simple 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:18.410
 not so complicated that it will help them 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.410
 how to maintain that part and in addition to 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:29.570
 the people you have modified with the 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.570
 children 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.030
 we are going to show you 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.920
 they are things that I may not have in my 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.920
 home but I know I trust 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.250
 and in the year 2015 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.980
 then the infrastructure 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.069
 that can use more more more words 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.579
 biscuits 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.639
 then I'm going to suffer all we started 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.049
 always with a mini heating I love 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.599
 do it in this sanctuary because girls 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.280
 the exercise has to be fun and 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.769
 then dani I will always run 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.170
 around or doing little things 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:16.130
 because I join and I feel very 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.410
 aurrera amorín meats and jumps jump 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.389
 that's what I call it with this ball of 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.000
 pilates we can do pairs exercises 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.800
 for example, what am I doing 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.930
 includes the complete core and the arms or 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.820
 be all the choir the waist the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.070
 belly all everything everything is included 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.600
 in this exercise that's very good 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.120
 depends on the needs you 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.560
 they have to look at what they want to do 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.740
 two other exercises that I'm going to 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.350
 show are to exercise the abdomen 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.020
 under that is the wand that remains as 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.400
 the 5 by the coast girl if we do this 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.520
 we are going to hide then those 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.350
 from the axis of the ebro I am my hen 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.450
 it hurts all of your images not godin or 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.680
 laugh but let 's stop it for 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.260
 ahead 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.110
 now the exercise stays where I am 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.419
 doing the knees in the chest serves 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.760
 for the obliques you want the obliques 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.310
 noblejas me when I do not know that 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.810
 rich are the chubby we have to 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.750
 our side 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.389
 then who have those droplets on 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.280
 nadir foot what all the exercises that 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.290
 I'm showing you in general they serve 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.580
 to exercise the entire abdomen where the 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.410
 situation specifications are those that 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.990
 they are specialized for that part of the 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.570
 fourth then the important thing is that 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.820
 you do not demand it is very hard to do it 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.160
 because the abdomen hurts enough but if 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.720
 it hurts because you exercised if you 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.000
 we do with constancy we do all 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.889
 the days we will surely see 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.320
 results and we will feel very much 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.940
 more motivated it 's good that they do 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.950
 accompanied by example as I do 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.870
 of my coach because one demands more 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.880
 of feeling a little more pressuring of 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.710
 you have to do it with all my dolls 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.690
 waist I know it's hard I know that 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.160
 it hurts but you have to do it my edges 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.979
 remember the series that I told you 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.870
 in the direction of 3 to 4 series and can 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.870
 do it for 15 to 30 repetitions 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:07.560
 I arrived I am very tired but 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.560

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.050
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.260

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.400
 tell them and recommend in the process that 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.040

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.730

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.220
 I mean, the child is not reading

 I live and it's a spectacular thing 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:56.320
