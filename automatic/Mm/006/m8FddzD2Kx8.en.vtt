00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.310
 greet his friends 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.359
 passage to the year 2010 requires exceptional video 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.349
 today we will do 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.739
 Wow yesterday 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.329
 rhythmic today 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.329
 major mission 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.160
 the major 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
 but billy 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.780
 to fight against simplifying as much as possible 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.430
 it will be done in two stages 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.130
 we're going on the major broadcast enough 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.480
 but down 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.320
 with a little shifted we start 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 which gives us 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.420
 the little bass riff that accompanies you will see quite simple it is played 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.650
 on the two strings hard so the rope if it's the rope 5 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 body of six inhabitants 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.619
 from the moment we are on the chords in half it is the rope if its 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.640
 life 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.010
 if we go over the body 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.010
 that would be the agreement of saint-camille 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.560
 after for the agreement of 6 7 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.749
 we will use the second box on the fifth string 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 a fifth body in the void 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.670
 16th anyway 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.090
 he does it from the end fifth body second place you 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.900
 the fifth camp david 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.580
 desire of ropes 4th range 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.580
 and 6th as a second gas 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.480
 alas herbal teas listen well because it's heavy I'll you 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.829
 to learn something 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.369
 it's called country 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:25.959
 grope 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.609
 atomic lapointe it is played 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.569
 as well on a piano on a guitar on all the instruments you need 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.369
 and it's a range that fits 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:37.829
 wonderfully well without knowing more 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.579
 explanations 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.759
 in fact the chords that I gave you 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.409
 and you're going to play the cantata or when 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.999
 I do not know if -ni major 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.359
 it will be necessary to ask people a little more competent but you 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.669
 play comedy 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.049
 places 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.509
 5 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.179
 it is missing two or 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.049
 April 4 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.339
 he is red 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.339
 therefore we do not bring anonymity 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.009
 but in the continuity 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.599
 so we are not in the fourth 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.909
 third 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.909
 third round 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.239
 second empty 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.239
 second in three in the first round 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.289
 jean-pierre only to the rope 6 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.659
 we have to play against 3 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.659
 all the others will be 32 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.119
 lower you master his mclaren 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:56.299
 it will be enough to play them as you feel for the time you want 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.789
 and you will see sassandra losc malicki 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:02.789
 again yesterday 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.940
 we will add to this guitar riff the little riff bass attention thank you 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.789
 an unhappy base 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.419
 now tempting 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.319
 you remember 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.839
 I'll do it first by going down and then back on the piece 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.610
 and after it's improvisation 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.330
 it's the volume of your glory feet on the turbo kit at the right time and I 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.110
 really played at your leisure 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.139
 the gloss 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.139
 and a sandblaster 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.419
 carry 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.580
 again 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:43.589
 you are not 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.099
 percent achieved 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.770
 1 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.770
 Gael Monfils 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.740
