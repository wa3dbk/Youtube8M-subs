00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 and our next protagonist comes out 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.490
 these lands had an important 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.170
 accident when he was 13 years old and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.960
 exceeded thanks to the sport and 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.150
 concretely thanks to the trail now it is 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.799
 One of the firmest promises in Spain 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.170
 of mountain races we have come to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.170
 vall d'uixó to meet ramón navarra 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.950
 let's go back a few more days 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.930
 well we go to the kitchen and we 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.390
 we find ramón and loles that are 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.340
 the parents of ramón the barrier that is 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.980
 some days 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.900
 ramón your son an emergent star in 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.570
 the world of bringing a baby, it does 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.390
 pretty good training and with a lot 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.610
 sacrifice and the boy then day by day 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.140
 Well, it's progressing and we can 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.790
 support you in everything we can and up 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.699
 I've always liked the hobby of 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.160
 the mountain the scalar astrology and he 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.570
 Well, no one to dabble 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.670
 he has also gotten himself 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.210
 he got in until he reached an end that 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.640
 I was 12 years old where they already went alone to the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.930
 I think good mountain has come 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.310
 moment that you introduce us to your son 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.310
 yes man let's go we want it 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.700
 com 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:26.110
 well here you have ramón good morning 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.140
 here we are in your room so 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.119
 I see a few stories full of trophies 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.520
 be fashionable in the world of the good train 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.110
 they are more but they are more difficult because 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.899
 as you go changing categories 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.509
 because every time it costs more if in 2012 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.030
 I started participating in the league 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.759
 Valencian mountain races and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.979
 there, I had a good feeling myself 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.509
 I was fine I was fast after 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.360
 keep doing the championships 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.159
 autonomic where I could also 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.630
 win and we went to ourense that was the 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.569
 spain championship online career 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.100
 where I finished third and in summer we had 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.380
 the championship Spain and kilometer 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.289
 bertikala metí constancia constancia y 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.819
 At the end I was able to win it, so 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.849
 I see here in your valencianista room 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.430
 I do not know if a little since I was little 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.069
 I really liked football and I always 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.290
 been from Valencian 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.749
 well I prepare the backpack we go 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.030
 because he's my son but I see that it 's a lot 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:23.760
 sacrifice much suffering what of the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.830
 trail races then 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.260
 while this taste that reaches where 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.970
 had to arrive is very constant in 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.819
 everything he does or I put him 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.269
 go ahead to applaud him and tell him 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.269
 champion 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.840
 good ramón tell us where we are 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.390
 well this is the athletics track of 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.200
 here of vall d'uixó is my place of 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.590
 I train more often 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.110
 and where I train the sc and the mi every day 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.480
 trained coach practically 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.250
 to the whole club of Munich to state him 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.069
 has its tests within the category 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.140
 junior cadet and what happens that from time to time 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.849
 in when we talk about participating in 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.400
 tests the absolute category in 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.380
 relatively short distances us 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.239
 here roughly see you around 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.980
 three days a week there are not two 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.160
 guides that we call quality that would be 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.660
 the short series and strength and then a 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.090
 couple of days more than what we do about 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.910
 all try to face the future what is 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.709
 the training of the athlete in this case 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.019
 working on the theme of circuits 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.940
 force the issue of the flexibility of 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.860
 stretching and such that we are not in a hurry 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.750
 with the results and the - you do not have to 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.640
 have no hurry and especially and what 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.410
 more important that you enjoy the mountain 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.940
 and on Wednesdays and we come here to 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.079
 make speed to me is the least 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.690
 like it because no longer the first one that no longer 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.510
 and apart from always spinning the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.730
 same place where you can truly to the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.200
 track over a thousand laps and yes that is 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.260
 truth that I have many neighbors 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.560
 family members and people who support me studies 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.720
 we combine it for the moment very clearly 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.579
 I like it a lot because I have to study 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.280
 many hours train many others and 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.340
 practically between training I study 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.379
 I do not leave home good school alone 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.420
 first of all and I do not have much time 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.910
 free but at the moment it's going pretty well 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.470
 We are already in the mountains tell us what 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.239
 it is this that surrounds us we find ourselves in 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.370
 these moments in all that is the 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.850
 climb of the path of the wall that is 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.530
 call that is on the road then 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.750
 that separates alfondeguilla from the 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.199
 white we have seen some plane of their 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.300
 cumbersome twins 6 and besides that 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.760
 I have enough facility to 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.930
 develop it but of course if above 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.510
 train them a lot 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.330
 ramón tell us about that important moment 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.810
 in your sports career the accident that 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.840
 you had at 13 years that happened everything was 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.120
 in one in a physical education class 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.919
 in which we were doing what 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.280
 that is being artistic gymnastics and 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.620
 and we were doing some jumps 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.560
 but I had never never done 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.240
 12 a trampoline and then they put us 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.090
 the trampoline and it was the first time 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.370
 I went on a trampoline and the last one because 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.430
 instead of leaving then what is still a 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.860
 normal jump I came out at ground level and 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.590
 so when I turned the body it was where 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.740
 I bend my body and that's where I 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.080
 I did the damage they practically had me 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.030
 23 months lying down and then three more 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.030
 months also of recovery without doing 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.430
 I did not have two vertebrae that I have 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.750
 little more to the sisters-in-law on top of being 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.169
 so much time at home because I what 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.210
 I wanted to go out of the house that I 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.850
 give the air then I was also 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.000
 climbing at that moment I started running 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.340
 you also did podiatry mountaineering 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.310
 He was also doing this age 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.740
 objectives because I want to make the cup of 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.060

 vertical kilometer and has also been a 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.000
 very important career as zegama and

 that is the rise to cabezo and I have 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.640
 said that it is a career that is quite 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.590
 I hope so, because it's the 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.210

 Well we live them calmly because it is 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.720
 Young when I'm 22, we'll live like 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.770
 that we do not want to believe because 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.140
 We all know that at that age because 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.300

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.990
