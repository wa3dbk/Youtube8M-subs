00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.480
 Hello everyone on this occasion 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.460
 I bring a new tutorial on how to do 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.860
 run faster the game need for 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.779
 speed most wanted good maybe not 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.670
 have a good pc and then you 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.650
 will run very slowly and that's what we 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.739
 get out of the wave and do not let us enjoy the 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.739
 game 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.010
 good let's start for this let's use 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.770
 two methods I'm going to explain 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.860
 how to use each of them 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.760
 first they are going to download this program on 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.429
 link I'll leave it in the description 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.469
 after they have downloaded it 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.469
 decompress and then open the program 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.960
 When you have it open, click on 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.960
 the second option 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.070
 later where it says to the executive and 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 then you look where you have installed 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.850
 the game 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.890
 you choose the ecce and you give it to open 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.840
 you will get a picture you give in 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.840
 to accept 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 then you look for the name of the game that 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 tell speed exe 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.410
 and click on the last option 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.480
 you're looking for the boyfriend again and this time 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.640
 click on the third option 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.640
 you get a picture and you accept 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.930
 and that's it, that's all, and you close the 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.550
 program does not matter that the closures alone 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.550
 do not go eliminate it 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.990
 and now we go to the next step this 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.840
 too easy 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.800
 they create a notepad and they are going to paste what 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.330
 following 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.470
 I 'm going to leave that in the 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.470
 video description 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.230
 then they write inside those that I do not know 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.620
 how are they called the name of the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.620
 game 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.840
 me and also here leaving a space like that 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.840
 like me 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.690
 and then put save with 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.220
 yes 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.380
 i 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.690
 and again write the name as 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.480
 we have done previously and then a 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.370
 point and then path as well as I 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.890
 I'm doing and you keep it in the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.870
 desk I recommend that you keep going 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.140
 step slowly and do not get confused 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.140
 nothing 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.260
 you will see we have our file created 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.110
 on the desktop and now they go to the file 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.030
 they right click on it and they copy it and 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.540
 then they go to the game folder and they 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.540
 dan hit 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.940
 and then they give to send to the desk 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.610
 i 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.710
 i 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.910
 Y 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.120
