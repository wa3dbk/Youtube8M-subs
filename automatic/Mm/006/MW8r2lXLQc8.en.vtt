vehicles only my last video again where
the<00:01:03.270> arrows<00:01:03.600> were<00:01:03.870> pointing<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.489> showed

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600

infantry<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.950> tutorial<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.580> only<00:01:08.790> for

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
infantry so this tutorial is only for

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.660 
infantry so this tutorial is only for
vehicles<00:01:09.900> which<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.619> much<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
vehicles which is not much of a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.370 
vehicles which is not much of a
difference<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.409> two<00:01:13.850> units<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.990> are

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
difference for the two units so we are

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.940 
difference for the two units so we are
going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:18.140> searching<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> Soviets

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
going to be searching for the Soviets

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.090 
going to be searching for the Soviets
Rhino<00:01:22.950> heavy<00:01:23.430> tank<00:01:23.850> which<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.560> called<00:01:25.610> H<00:01:27.080> tnk

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
Rhino heavy tank which is called H tnk

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.260 
Rhino heavy tank which is called H tnk
all<00:01:29.119> capitalized<00:01:30.119> letters<00:01:35.030> with<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> little

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
all capitalized letters with a little

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.520 
all capitalized letters with a little
bracket<00:01:36.689> at<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.810> end<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.259> find<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
bracket at the end so we can find a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.190 
bracket at the end so we can find a
quicker

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.690 

all<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.410> here<00:01:46.620> it<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.830> Rhino<00:01:47.100> heavy<00:01:47.400> tank

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
all right here it is a Rhino heavy tank

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.190 
all right here it is a Rhino heavy tank
so<00:01:48.480> again<00:01:49.200> basic<00:01:49.830> mod<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:51.050> not<00:01:52.050> like

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so again basic mod really not like

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
so again basic mod really not like
really<00:01:52.560> complicated<00:01:53.400> mod<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.240> in

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
really complicated mod that you go in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.950 
really complicated mod that you go in
there<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.630> change<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:55.320> vocal<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.960> cameo

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
there and change the vocal and the cameo

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.460 
there and change the vocal and the cameo
and<00:01:58.290> stuff<00:01:58.560> no<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.960> simple<00:02:00.960> speed

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
and stuff no this is just simple speed

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.020 
and stuff no this is just simple speed
power<00:02:02.390> costs<00:02:03.390> rate<00:02:04.230> of<00:02:04.380> fire<00:02:04.620> and<00:02:06.140> yeah<00:02:07.140> so

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
power costs rate of fire and yeah so

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.760 
power costs rate of fire and yeah so
let's<00:02:09.030> make<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.540> Rhino<00:02:09.990> heavy<00:02:10.290> tank<00:02:11.210> speed<00:02:12.210> up

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
let's make the Rhino heavy tank speed up

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.700 
let's make the Rhino heavy tank speed up
to<00:02:13.770> about<00:02:14.610> 10<00:02:15.060> speaking<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.690> little<00:02:15.870> faster

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
to about 10 speaking a little faster

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.370 
to about 10 speaking a little faster
kind<00:02:17.460> of<00:02:17.520> like<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> dog<00:02:18.810> or<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> Tarot

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
kind of like a like a dog or a Tarot

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.180 
kind of like a like a dog or a Tarot
drone<00:02:19.680> make<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.610> cost<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.680> don't<00:02:22.680> know<00:02:22.770> let's

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
drone make the cost I don't know let's

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.660 
drone make the cost I don't know let's
make<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:25.070> 350<00:02:26.270> because<00:02:27.270> anything<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.260> below<00:02:28.710> 300

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
make it 350 because anything a below 300

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.510 
make it 350 because anything a below 300
kind<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.140> screws<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.260> up<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.500> little<00:02:31.620> bit<00:02:31.860> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
kind of screws it up a little bit the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.850 
kind of screws it up a little bit the
build<00:02:33.150> time<00:02:33.330> for<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.260> comes<00:02:34.500> out<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
build time for it it comes out of the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.090 
build time for it it comes out of the
war<00:02:35.010> factory<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:37.290> buy<00:02:37.470> two<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.740> them<00:02:37.980> you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
war factory and you buy two of them you

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.410 
war factory and you buy two of them you
only<00:02:38.220> get<00:02:38.370> one<00:02:38.550> out<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.000> because<00:02:39.240> it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
only get one out of it because it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.910 
only get one out of it because it
produces<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.290> slow<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:42.080> yeah<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.440> try<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.710> keep

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
produces it slow so yeah so try to keep

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.910 
produces it slow so yeah so try to keep
it<00:02:44.040> up<00:02:44.130> 300<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.120> nothing<00:02:45.360> below<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.920> had

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it up 300 and nothing below that had

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.650 
it up 300 and nothing below that had
that<00:02:47.040> issue<00:02:47.250> with<00:02:47.580> terror<00:02:47.820> drones<00:02:48.120> having

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
that issue with terror drones having

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.130 
that issue with terror drones having
them<00:02:48.780> at<00:02:48.930> 250<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.810> yeah<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:51.840> could<00:02:52.020> also

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
them at 250 and so yeah we could also

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.220 
them at 250 and so yeah we could also
