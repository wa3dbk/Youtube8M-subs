00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.260
 Here at this point I want the 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.090
 compete 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.090
 vk publicly saved 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 I have the sentence over several years ago 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.140
 on with the spade here on a picture too 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.280
 compare and always the same on 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.280
 this invites to grow 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.229
 So I say it was on both 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.860
 it's easy to go straight straight 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.860
 who in the cross 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.640
 there it goes pretty well in the poor two 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.220
 sharing was even compost 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.030
 Applied where I dug 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.610
 is now the compost down and the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.280
 Earth layers are a complete and 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.710
 here with the satan still up 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.080
 kompost confessed to the holy house now 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.430
 easily incorporated and on both 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.399
 surfaces now comes a thin layer 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.789
 with the games as a natural state 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.789
 fertilizer 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.910
 and the layer is now with the star 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.890
 crisis easily incorporated 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.070
 I need to Freese in here 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:05.940
 the heavy soil around this loamy 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:08.070
 Kloten white get nothing and already 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.590
 After this short work I can do one 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.900
 Find a difference here on the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.850
 beet with the so pay are still half 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:22.590
 rotted compass parts on top and on 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.530
 the piece of what was dug up are 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.910
 very fine green beans no compost 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.550
 Particles he shines on top of the earth 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.650
 also to be a little bit wet and wrinkled 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.800
 because it's just the ground parts from the bottom 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.800
 are 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.970
 a direct difference in growth 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.170
 You can plant after such a short time 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.840
 not yet recognize 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.020
 I think that's just the first 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.530
 long-term test over the years, resulting 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.220
 on the left side we have the picture 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.690
 which was made and saw 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.240
 edited and on the right side there 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.960
 we beet's what the late 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.960
 was dug up
