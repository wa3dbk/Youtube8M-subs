okay now it's time to go ahead and
attaching<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:15.800> arms<00:00:16.420> so<00:00:17.420> I'm<00:00:17.510> gonna<00:00:17.630> flip

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
attaching the arms so I'm gonna flip

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.500 
attaching the arms so I'm gonna flip
over<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:19.070> chassis<00:00:19.610> get<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.420> arm<00:00:20.630> and<00:00:21.400> there's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
over the chassis get the arm and there's

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.320 
over the chassis get the arm and there's
just<00:00:23.510> these<00:00:23.720> little<00:00:24.320> pins<00:00:24.650> that<00:00:25.090> have<00:00:27.640> just<00:00:28.640> no

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
just these little pins that have just no

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.540 
just these little pins that have just no
thread<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:30.109> them<00:00:30.260> you<00:00:30.350> just<00:00:30.560> slide<00:00:30.859> them<00:00:31.070> in

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
thread to them you just slide them in

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.869 
thread to them you just slide them in
and<00:00:31.850> that's<00:00:32.239> it<00:00:33.040> go<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.129> move<00:00:34.190> that<00:00:34.519> into

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
and that's it go and move that into

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.770 
and that's it go and move that into
place<00:00:35.150> and<00:00:37.930> there's<00:00:38.930> one<00:00:40.239> then<00:00:41.239> another<00:00:41.540> one

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
place and there's one then another one

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.689 
place and there's one then another one
goes<00:00:42.080> through<00:00:42.769> the<00:00:43.220> front<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:46.790> now<00:00:47.500> until<00:00:48.699> we

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
goes through the front and now until we

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.939 
goes through the front and now until we
can<00:00:49.850> get<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.540> right<00:00:50.720> pieces<00:00:51.019> in<00:00:51.379> there<00:00:51.620> these

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
can get the right pieces in there these

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.890 
can get the right pieces in there these
are<00:00:52.010> just<00:00:52.280> going<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.699> be<00:00:52.820> really<00:00:53.299> loose<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:53.780> I

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
are just going to be really loose so I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.140 
are just going to be really loose so I
have<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.320> be<00:00:54.470> very<00:00:54.769> careful<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:55.280> none<00:00:56.030> of

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
have to be very careful that none of

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.950 
have to be very careful that none of
them<00:00:56.239> fall<00:00:56.570> out<00:00:57.220> which<00:00:58.220> is<00:00:58.430> in<00:00:59.210> my<00:00:59.420> opinion<00:00:59.869> a

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
them fall out which is in my opinion a

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.850 
them fall out which is in my opinion a
pretty<00:01:00.170> bad<00:01:00.530> design<00:01:01.010> but<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:03.170> works<00:01:03.470> in<00:01:03.710> the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
pretty bad design but it works in the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.100 
pretty bad design but it works in the
end<00:01:05.320> it's<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.380> nice<00:01:06.560> time<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.010> flip<00:01:07.220> it<00:01:07.369> over<00:01:08.110> and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
end it's a nice time to flip it over and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.080 
end it's a nice time to flip it over and
do<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.290> top<00:01:09.619> ones<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.580> it's<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.880> same

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
do the top ones and it's the same

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.149 
do the top ones and it's the same
process<00:01:11.359> for<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.869> rear<00:01:11.990> as<00:01:12.439> it<00:01:12.649> is<00:01:12.770> for<00:01:13.070> the

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
process for the rear as it is for the

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.109 
process for the rear as it is for the
front<00:01:13.750> but<00:01:14.750> for<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.530> top<00:01:15.829> ones<00:01:16.189> it<00:01:16.789> is<00:01:16.850> a

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
front but for the top ones it is a

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.240 
front but for the top ones it is a
little<00:01:17.600> bit<00:01:17.810> different<00:01:18.259> because<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:18.710> get<00:01:18.890> one

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
little bit different because you get one

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.760 
little bit different because you get one
long<00:01:19.729> pin<00:01:20.119> instead<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.719> two<00:01:20.930> short<00:01:21.259> ones<00:01:21.469> but

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
long pin instead of two short ones but

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.499 
long pin instead of two short ones but
yeah<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.070> just<00:01:22.280> slides<00:01:22.549> in<00:01:22.850> right<00:01:23.210> through<00:01:23.420> the

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
yeah it just slides in right through the

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.179 
yeah it just slides in right through the
front<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:24.679> goes<00:01:24.920> all<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.369> way<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.570> back

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
front and goes all the way to the back

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.190 
front and goes all the way to the back
okay<00:01:28.189> both<00:01:28.549> sides<00:01:28.820> are<00:01:29.000> done<00:01:29.179> and<00:01:29.539> now<00:01:29.780> we<00:01:29.840> can

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
okay both sides are done and now we can

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.050 
okay both sides are done and now we can
go<00:01:30.350> ahead<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.890> move<00:01:31.039> on<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.729> axle

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
go ahead and move on to the axle

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.929 
go ahead and move on to the axle
carriers<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.020> here<00:01:33.259> I<00:01:33.289> have<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:34.100> front<00:01:34.460> right

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
carriers so here I have the front right

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.050 
carriers so here I have the front right
what<00:01:35.390> I'm<00:01:35.479> gonna<00:01:35.600> be<00:01:35.780> doing<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.469> putting<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:37.280> big

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
what I'm gonna be doing is putting a big

bearing in the front

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.779 
bearing in the front
make<00:01:45.200> sure<00:01:45.409> those<00:01:45.649> push<00:01:45.979> down<00:01:46.249> all<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.670> way

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789

I'm<00:01:47.689> gonna<00:01:47.869> get<00:01:48.109> the<00:01:48.350> top<00:01:48.590> part<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
I'm gonna get the top part of the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.230 
I'm gonna get the top part of the
driveshaft<00:01:49.509> slide<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:50.749> through<00:01:51.999> get<00:01:52.999> one<00:01:53.179> of

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
driveshaft slide that through get one of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.160 
driveshaft slide that through get one of
these<00:01:53.359> small<00:01:53.780> little<00:01:54.590> pins<00:01:56.020> slide<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.140> through

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
these small little pins slide it through

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.179 
these small little pins slide it through
the<00:01:57.409> hole<00:01:59.229> on<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.380> dress<00:02:00.590> out<00:02:00.829> or<00:02:01.069> at<00:02:01.159> least

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
the hole on the dress out or at least

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.629 
the hole on the dress out or at least
try<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.810> there<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:02.929> go

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:03.639 
try to there we go

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.309 
try to there we go
then<00:02:04.639> get<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.969> wheel<00:02:05.119> hex<00:02:05.420> up<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:06.079> has<00:02:06.289> a

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
then get the wheel hex up it has a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.510 
then get the wheel hex up it has a
little<00:02:06.560> groove<00:02:06.829> for

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.760 

that<00:02:10.520> bar<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.270> I'm<00:02:11.450> gonna<00:02:11.660> snap<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.020> down<00:02:12.380> just

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
that bar and I'm gonna snap it down just

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.180 
that bar and I'm gonna snap it down just
like<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.600> no<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.960> same<00:02:15.170> thing<00:02:15.530> for<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
like that no the same thing for the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.060 
like that no the same thing for the
other<00:02:16.220> side<00:02:16.540> all<00:02:17.540> right<00:02:18.020> now<00:02:18.680> there's<00:02:18.890> one

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
other side all right now there's one

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.680 
other side all right now there's one
step<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.400> wasn't<00:02:19.880> able<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.090> show<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.390> and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
step that wasn't able to show you and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.390 
step that wasn't able to show you and
that's<00:02:20.840> how<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.140> install<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.860> pivot<00:02:22.220> bowls

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
that's how to install the pivot bowls

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.730 
that's how to install the pivot bowls
basically<00:02:23.090> they<00:02:23.750> get<00:02:23.930> fed<00:02:24.170> through<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> top

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
basically they get fed through the top

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.850 
basically they get fed through the top
and<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:25.190> little<00:02:25.430> cap<00:02:25.820> snaps<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:26.600> there<00:02:26.860> then

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
and this little cap snaps in there then

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.550 
and this little cap snaps in there then
at<00:02:28.310> this<00:02:28.580> point<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.210> can<00:02:29.390> see<00:02:29.690> there<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.530> a

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
at this point you can see there is a

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.710 
at this point you can see there is a
place<00:02:30.980> where<00:02:31.310> an<00:02:31.430> Allen<00:02:31.760> wrench<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:32.360> fit<00:02:32.570> in

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
place where an Allen wrench to fit in

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.300 
place where an Allen wrench to fit in
there<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.320> screw<00:02:33.560> these<00:02:33.740> into<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
there so you can screw these into the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.030 
there so you can screw these into the
harms<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.990> going<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.800> next
