we<00:00:12.230> never<00:00:12.590> ever<00:00:12.740> ever<00:00:13.309> feed<00:00:14.120> the<00:00:14.299> plant<00:00:14.570> ever

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
we never ever ever feed the plant ever

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.790 
we never ever ever feed the plant ever
what<00:00:16.580> we<00:00:16.700> do<00:00:16.880> is<00:00:17.029> we<00:00:17.180> feed<00:00:17.450> the<00:00:17.630> soil<00:00:17.840> and<00:00:18.380> so

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
what we do is we feed the soil and so

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.670 
what we do is we feed the soil and so
when<00:00:19.640> you<00:00:19.730> feed<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.240> soil<00:00:20.570> and<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:21.470> soil

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
when you feed the soil and the soil

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.700 
when you feed the soil and the soil
becomes<00:00:22.189> healthy<00:00:22.640> then<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.180> plant<00:00:23.480> can<00:00:24.259> feed

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
becomes healthy then the plant can feed

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.550 
becomes healthy then the plant can feed
in<00:00:25.070> its<00:00:25.759> own<00:00:26.029> cycle<00:00:26.419> in<00:00:26.960> other<00:00:27.110> words<00:00:27.349> it<00:00:27.529> goes

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
in its own cycle in other words it goes

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.450 
in its own cycle in other words it goes
to<00:00:28.100> the<00:00:28.220> snack<00:00:28.460> bar<00:00:28.490> when<00:00:29.000> it<00:00:29.029> wants<00:00:29.570> to<00:00:29.720> and

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
to the snack bar when it wants to and

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.710 
to the snack bar when it wants to and
that's<00:00:31.460> very<00:00:31.789> different<00:00:32.300> than<00:00:32.480> then

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
that's very different than then

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.439 
that's very different than then
conventional<00:00:33.350> agriculture<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.449> normally

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
conventional agriculture and normally

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.530 
conventional agriculture and normally
the<00:00:35.960> vines<00:00:36.199> are<00:00:36.440> fed<00:00:36.769> every<00:00:37.640> couple<00:00:38.180> of<00:00:38.269> weeks

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
the vines are fed every couple of weeks

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.890 
the vines are fed every couple of weeks
or<00:00:39.430> continuously<00:00:40.430> fed<00:00:40.730> it<00:00:41.300> for<00:00:41.570> that<00:00:41.690> matter

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
or continuously fed it for that matter

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.590 
or continuously fed it for that matter
and<00:00:42.199> so<00:00:42.320> they<00:00:42.530> grow<00:00:42.949> outside<00:00:43.879> of<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.120> cycle<00:00:44.510> of

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
and so they grow outside of the cycle of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.420 
and so they grow outside of the cycle of
nature<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:45.200> tend<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.620> have<00:00:45.800> vines<00:00:46.070> that

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
nature so you tend to have vines that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.389 
nature so you tend to have vines that
grow<00:00:46.940> very<00:00:47.390> radically<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.320> have<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.280> be

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
grow very radically and have to be

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.850 
grow very radically and have to be
protected<00:00:50.050> usually<00:00:51.050> by<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:51.260> use<00:00:51.590> of

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
protected usually by the use of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.790 
protected usually by the use of
artificial<00:00:52.550> chemicals<00:00:53.180> but<00:00:53.870> when<00:00:54.050> vines<00:00:54.350> grow

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
artificial chemicals but when vines grow

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.830 
artificial chemicals but when vines grow
in<00:00:54.980> their<00:00:55.100> own<00:00:55.129> cycle<00:00:55.879> because<00:00:56.390> they're<00:00:56.660> not

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
in their own cycle because they're not

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.600 
in their own cycle because they're not
fed<00:00:57.170> directly<00:00:57.500> but<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:57.920> take<00:00:58.219> care<00:00:58.460> of<00:00:58.489> the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
fed directly but you take care of the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.350 
fed directly but you take care of the
soil<00:00:58.850> they<00:00:59.750> grow<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.050> little<00:01:00.350> slower<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:00.980> you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
soil they grow a little slower and you

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.869 
soil they grow a little slower and you
have<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.390> growth<00:01:02.960> that's<00:01:03.680> much<00:01:04.039> more<00:01:04.280> resistant

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
have a growth that's much more resistant

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.200 
have a growth that's much more resistant
to<00:01:04.940> disease<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.680> growth<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.979> is<00:01:07.130> makes<00:01:08.119> the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
to disease and growth that is makes the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.020 
to disease and growth that is makes the
plant<00:01:08.479> much<00:01:08.690> stronger<00:01:09.050> so<00:01:09.649> what<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:10.490> see<00:01:10.759> and

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
plant much stronger so what you see and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.060 
plant much stronger so what you see and
in<00:01:11.270> front<00:01:11.539> of<00:01:11.630> us<00:01:11.750> now<00:01:11.780> are<00:01:12.259> different<00:01:12.380> compost

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
in front of us now are different compost

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
in front of us now are different compost
piles<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:13.759> are<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:16.250> are<00:01:16.369> made<00:01:16.610> from

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
piles that are that are made from

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.480 
piles that are that are made from
different<00:01:17.509> properties<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:18.050> we<00:01:18.410> farm<00:01:18.649> so

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
different properties that we farm so

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.330 
different properties that we farm so
this<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:20.479> pile<00:01:21.259> right<00:01:21.530> here<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.069> for<00:01:22.310> our

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
this this pile right here is for our

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.940 
this this pile right here is for our
sunny<00:01:22.640> slope<00:01:22.970> property<00:01:23.509> this<00:01:24.229> pile<00:01:24.560> right

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
sunny slope property this pile right

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.550 
sunny slope property this pile right
here<00:01:25.429> is<00:01:25.610> from<00:01:25.940> this<00:01:26.209> estate<00:01:26.660> right<00:01:26.929> here<00:01:27.410> and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
here is from this estate right here and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.080 
here is from this estate right here and
that<00:01:28.160> pile<00:01:28.429> over<00:01:28.700> there

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
that pile over there

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.350 
that pile over there
is<00:01:29.420> from<00:01:29.690> our<00:01:29.840> pinot<00:01:30.050> noir<00:01:30.170> properties<00:01:30.890> so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
is from our pinot noir properties so

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.380 
is from our pinot noir properties so
each<00:01:32.360> pile<00:01:32.720> represents<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.160> totality<00:01:34.640> the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
each pile represents the totality the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.109 
each pile represents the totality the
the<00:01:35.959> totality<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.649> ingredients<00:01:37.220> made<00:01:37.429> only

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
the totality of ingredients made only

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.510 
the totality of ingredients made only
from<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.140> particular<00:01:39.619> piece<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.190> property

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
from that particular piece of property

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.960 
from that particular piece of property
and<00:01:41.500> if<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.679> take<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.920> look<00:01:43.190> at<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.459> compost

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
and if you take a look at this compost

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.699 
and if you take a look at this compost
this<00:01:44.119> is<00:01:44.270> just<00:01:44.479> in<00:01:44.599> the<00:01:44.690> process<00:01:44.869> now<00:01:45.319> of<00:01:45.349> being

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
this is just in the process now of being

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.639 
this is just in the process now of being
made<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.160> takes<00:01:46.340> about<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.360> year<00:01:47.479> for<00:01:48.319> us<00:01:48.440> to

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
made it takes about a year for us to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.070 
made it takes about a year for us to
completely<00:01:49.069> ferment<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.209> and<00:01:50.300> process<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:50.959> so

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
completely ferment it and process it so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.499 
completely ferment it and process it so
it's<00:01:51.200> about<00:01:51.349> halfway<00:01:51.590> done<00:01:52.039> but<00:01:52.849> compost<00:01:53.330> is

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
it's about halfway done but compost is

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.339 
it's about halfway done but compost is
an<00:01:53.630> incredibly<00:01:58.360> it's<00:01:59.360> just<00:01:59.630> an<00:01:59.720> incredibly

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
an incredibly it's just an incredibly

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.400 
an incredibly it's just an incredibly
active<00:02:01.009> material<00:02:01.819> one<00:02:02.030> one<00:02:02.360> handful<00:02:03.080> of

active material one one handful of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.190 
active material one one handful of
compost<00:02:04.009> can<00:02:05.000> contain<00:02:05.390> billions<00:02:05.690> and

billions of microorganisms as a matter
of<00:02:07.910> fact<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.569> hand<00:02:08.929> fill<00:02:09.110> right<00:02:09.289> there

handful right there there could be more
bacteria<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:13.040> microorganisms<00:02:13.840> than<00:02:14.840> humans

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
bacteria and microorganisms than humans

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.949 
bacteria and microorganisms than humans
that<00:02:15.739> populate<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.340> whole<00:02:16.370> earth<00:02:16.660> that's<00:02:17.660> how

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
that populate the whole earth that's how

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.220 
that populate the whole earth that's how
that's<00:02:18.500> how<00:02:18.709> active<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:20.060> what<00:02:20.870> kind<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.170> a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
that's how active and what kind of a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.980 
that's how active and what kind of a
special<00:02:21.650> material<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:22.220> really<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.540> think
