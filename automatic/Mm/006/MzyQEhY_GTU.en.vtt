00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.490

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.139
 canutillos filled with custard and 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.150
 for this we are going to need the 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.880
 following ingredients for the cream 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.859
 pastry we will need half a liter of 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.039
 milk 150 grams of sugar 2 eggs 75 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.589
 grams of flour half cinnamon bar and 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.980
 a little bit of sugary vanilla and to 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.450
 do the combs we will need 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.700
 puff pastry that you can find it in 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.820
 mercadona the first thing we will do will be 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.309
 make the custard and for that 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.129
 we will put a pot on the fire where 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.800
 will miss the pint of milk the 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.960
 half cinnamon and vanilla bar 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.210
 sugared when it starts to boil 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.780
 We leave a couple of minutes for 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:01.050
 take the flavor of cinnamon and vanilla 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.050
 and then we removed it from the fire 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.009
 and then he is making milk 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.530
 we take the opportunity to mix the two eggs 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.530
 with the sugar with the help of a rod 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.579
 once we have mixed the eggs with the 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:26.920
 sugar well let's go little by little 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.920
 the flour and we're mixing everything 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.960
 well here we have already all good mixed 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.149
 We take a colander and add the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.450
 milk little by little and we are mixing it 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.450
 all 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.859
 and once we have all the milk what 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.740
 put on fire until it breaks the 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.229
 boil so that it thickens a little 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.270
 and when we see that it is heavy enough 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.329
 that has broken the boil because we can already 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.220
 Remove from the fire and the list is ready 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.490
 we are moving from time to time so that 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.429
 do not crust us until it cools 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.250
 while our pastry cream is 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.830
 It is chilling because we will go 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.580
 greasing the clubs to make the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.580
 canutillos 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.879
 once we have entered the clubs 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.250
 we proceed to make the canutillos and 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.590
 for this we extend the mass that I 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.000
 this case I have picked a fresh dough but 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.280
 it's also frozen 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.640
 if you use the frozen one, you take it out at night 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.549
 above and leave it in the refrigerator and 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.379
 you do not have a list for the morning 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.140
 we remove the paper that brings with much 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.030
 be careful because being cool is 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.730
 pretty stuck and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.380
 we put it on the table and previously 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.380
 the woman flour powder 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.480
 we will throw a little flour for 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.310
 avoid getting stuck to the roller and the 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.250
 we stretch a little bit and we already have it 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.890
 ready to cut once we have 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.710
 stretched the dough we will proceed to cut it 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.770
 with the help of a short pizza and how 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.140
 advice I tell you that you give me a little and 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.860
 make marks so that all the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.860
 equal rolls 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.860
 and once we have them all cut 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.860
 we go rolling them on the sticks 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.170
 when we have rolled all the dough 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.440
 in the clubs we put them in a 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.210
 tray and paint them egg 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.550
 because this will make them brown in the 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.550
 oven and take a nice color 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.629
 and we put them in the oven about 15 minutes 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.349
 once past this time we take it out 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.330
 of the oven and let them cool 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.330
 a little bit to be able to take out the sticks 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.509
 now let's proceed to fill 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.740
 our primer and for that I'm going to use 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.740
 a churrera 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.480
 and our canutillos are ready 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.670
 filled with custard that are 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.100
 delicious I hope you liked it 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.300

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.300
