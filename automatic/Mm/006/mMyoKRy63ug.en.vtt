00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.000
 welcome to this video number 2 this 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.700
 series of graphic videos I hope you 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.439
 have liked the number 1 video if not yet 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.750
 you have seen it, I recommend you, it is valuable 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.220
 previous page and see it I appreciate 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.290
 also for all the comments that 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.150
 have left I am reading each of 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.280
 thank you I want to tell you that very 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.309
 soon the course will be available 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.820
 speed in six weeks is a program 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.949
 effective to develop speed and 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.720
 accuracy is the secret of this program 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.560
 of training is to touch while 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.870
 we learn and have fun 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.140
 it's about simple exercises and with a 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.050
 musical sense that will be fun 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.510
 to touch them and at the same time progress in your 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.670
 technique but today I have another video for 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.460
 you let's see what the sequences are 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.460
 how to apply them on your own solos 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.100
 all right 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.020
 ok let's see an exercise of 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.760
 sequences a sequence is a group of 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.610
 notes that we can use so 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.220
 ascending or descending along 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.480
 a rope or along several ropes 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.400
 in certain of scales is to say is a 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.990
 melodic fragment that repeats something 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.350
 very used by classical composers 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.270
 for example 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.090
 in this speed course in six 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.830
 weeks you will see different examples of 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.020
 I'll even give you tips 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.150
 to generate your own sequences and 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.850
 apply it to your solos 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.860
 ok let's go with this example let's 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.420
 start with the note of 35 of the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.420
 first string the note is the 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.730
 when one now with finger four 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.730
 let's touch the trust note and 82 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.909
 and then we're going to play the note in the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.909
 fret 7 yes 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.079
 5 8 and 7 always with the turn in nothing 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.079
 down up down 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.370
 and now let's do 5 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.819
 7 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.379
 and 8 that this would be the melodic sequence 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.739
 we want to use throughout the entire 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.739
 example 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:45.110
 in this case it would be 58 75 78 the pace is 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.709
 the rhythm is three and the three notes by 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.709
 each pulse 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:59.140
 alright now let's run us a fret 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:01.830
 back and we're going to do 4 7 5 and 4 5 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.830
 7 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.879
 well so far we have this 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.610
 now let's go with the finger to the fret 7 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.830
 of the first string of the note if 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.330
 We were going to do 7 10 8 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.330
 and 7 8 10 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:33.299
 now let's do 587 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.299
 and 578 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.440
 now let's go with the 18th finger of the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.530
 first, what would we do 8 12 10 8 10 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.530
 12 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.939
 and now we are going to run only the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.939
 finger and let's do now 9 12 19 10 12 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.790
 now let's go to the bottom 10 the first 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.790
 what are we going to do 10 13 12 10 12 13 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:11.150
 now the fret 7 of the first when 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.150
 We were going to do 7 10 878 10 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.190
 now 8 12 10 8 2 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.780
 we go back to fret 5 in the first 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.780
 rope and let's do 5 807 5 7 8 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.669
 now let's go to the bottom 7 and we're going to do 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.669
 7 10 8 7 8 10 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.300
 the last sequence would be 4 7 5 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.650
 457 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.070
 and we are going to finish with the note in the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.300
 fret 5 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.300
 all the example would be 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.220
 well I recommend you first of all that 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.990
 memorize is each of the sequences 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.349
 for example, even if it's the beginning with 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.680
 first and memorize and coordinate both 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.680
 hands 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.990
 this figure that was going to be the sequence 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.430
 that will always be repeated in all 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.770
 all groups of sequences always 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.199
 are three notes you play first the most 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.590
 acute then the most severe and then the 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.120
 of the middle and then the sharpest the 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.659
 medium and the most serious is always repeated 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.659
 this same idea 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.380
 I recommend you also practice it 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.120
 slowly with a metronome and here you go to 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.980
 have the three back in tracks for 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.600
 practice it in three speeds 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.520
 well I hope you liked this 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.620
 video if you like it changes your 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.360
 I am going to read them and 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.030
 remember to share it with your friends 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.880
 tomorrow I will be sending you a new video 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.139
 where are we going to learn the technique of 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:30.460
 tapping popularized by spam comes out 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.460
 see you and say
