00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.030
 it is true that many people said to themselves more is a passionate 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.700
 of car but what makes the om unique i am an automotive enthusiast 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.509
 and I'll tell you that dynamic qualities our vehicles e I the 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.699
 I want it to be at the same level if not better and this is particularly the case 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:22.660
 with you age 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.689
 it's in terms of chassis 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.689
 much better than any existing sports car on the market 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.529
 hush 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 m 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.150
 on the other hand if we know anyway 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.790
 the electric motor 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.120
 the most perfect engine 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.340
 worldwide in terms of performance in terms of number of parts in terms of 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.380
 the rapporteur 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.580
 it's really something good 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.910
 saab is awesome this electric motor it will be in all cars tomorrow 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.940
 and the storage of energy that is in the form of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.990
 e or e10 batteries to roger hanin 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.769
 finally the subject itself 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.200
 so we are also working on 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.010
 on fuel cell related applications 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.780
 but what interests us is 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.090
 the media side 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.960
 the electricity network is the most complete network in the world 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140
 at the end of the world we find the most cited 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.360
 then this voter who is not often made the same way 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.970
 vehicle performance and theme 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.040
 the engine performance and that it was 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.110
 anyway with a reader still extremely solution 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 interesting 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.290
 we have about ten orders including the one that we delivered already a 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.160
 number of people 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.870
 the model we have a new motorization required arrives 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.870
 mid-2009 in the vehicle so it's an engine 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.610
 extremely powerful couplings 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.530
 for 300 horses 390 tons meter a biker very very light gold of 30 kilos 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 no extraordinary improvement over the previous month engine 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.480
 and overall a car that keeps its leadership 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.820
 for those who stay 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.290
 the first is the best electric sports car 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.110
 a rather surprising concept at its launch in 2004 for the 20 years of the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.049
 venturi brand 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.539
 and who today actually I have a lot of emulators a lot of interest 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:18.800
 for us it's a car 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.970
 finally we have very small series as is the case of poultry 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.770
 show that we are capable of mastering advanced technologies 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.150
 score in France surveyed we have this skill it is helped in the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.459
 domain of the explanation of vehicles finally in the field of the chain of 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.509
 electric traction 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:34.570
 but it exists 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.839
 in France skills 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.669
 is the rumor true 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.049
 m flames there the rumor 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.820
 that we are working on vehicles 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.220
 adp who have extreme performance emc 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:48.789
 when 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.179
 wimereux hybrid engine things like that 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:52.509
 his 16th season 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:53.529
 are you aiming to say it 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.679
 but for the time of one year per cent 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.429
 Norman in any approach is here 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.589
 you can see that 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.069
 to help them 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.539
 nude pics 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:04.509
 erdf 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.609
 the most passionate of design purpose sacha lakic that makes so many cars 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.609
 in a motorcycle and a car 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.739
 it's really passionate 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.870
 p passion always goes by with respect to the data of 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.680
 the application of this research 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.539
 people on the trapping vehicles informing so the job is there 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.169
 otherwise one of the gear really not for us interested in poultry 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.919
 young people 67 eur 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.909
 of this research 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.129
 ground link level by integrating native michelin guide 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.599
 e but it's true we have currently on the water 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.499
 extremely interesting vehicle coordinator you have all the 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:43.039
 present by all present and share all with you but that's true 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.559
 that Bordeaux are not a big team she sold us a rhythm of 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.399
 brics means to imitate 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.719
 and we need a good here go forward step by step 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:52.669
 every world demand early victims 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.489
 superb stage we showed our work
