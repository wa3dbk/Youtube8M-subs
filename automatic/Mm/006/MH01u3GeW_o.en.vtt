00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that are used to PK wait I actually need

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.479 
that are used to PK wait I actually need
to<00:00:45.020> put<00:00:46.020> some<00:00:46.230> mates<00:00:46.530> pots<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.160> summoning

to put some mates pots and summoning
parts<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.090> well<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
parts here as well because in the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.750 
parts here as well because in the
crucible<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.500> use<00:00:49.829> your<00:00:50.039> still<00:00:50.280> tighter<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
crucible you use your still tighter and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.819 
crucible you use your still tighter and
stuff<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> could<00:00:52.530> really<00:00:52.739> use

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
stuff like that so I could really use

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.150 
stuff like that so I could really use
that<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.489> first<00:00:53.789> step<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.180> well<00:00:54.329> actually<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
that on my first step as well actually I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.830 
that on my first step as well actually I
really<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> make<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> PK<00:00:57.180> type<00:00:57.449> only

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
really want to make like a PK type only

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.389 
really want to make like a PK type only
I<00:00:57.870> mean<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.230> got<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> gear<00:00:58.680> tab<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.250> pretty

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
I mean I got a gear tab which is pretty

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.889 
I mean I got a gear tab which is pretty
much<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.760> my<00:00:59.879> behaviour<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.780> but

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
much all my behaviour on there but

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.450 
much all my behaviour on there but
actually<00:01:01.199> need<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.469> make<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> Gator<00:01:02.070> with

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
actually need to make the Gator with

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.060 
actually need to make the Gator with
parts<00:01:02.850> food<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> summoning<00:01:04.680> stuff<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
parts food and all the summoning stuff I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.500 
parts food and all the summoning stuff I
need<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> gear<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> guess<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.270> would<00:01:06.390> be

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
need and the gear I guess that would be

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.100 
need and the gear I guess that would be
quite<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.619> awesome<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.159> evil

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
quite an awesome because evil

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.149 
quite an awesome because evil
regathering<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.619> fast

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
regathering is going to be very fast

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.100 
regathering is going to be very fast
that<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:11.580> even<00:01:12.240> though<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> didn't<00:01:12.930> die<00:01:13.080> yet

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that way even though I didn't die yet

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320 
that way even though I didn't die yet
i'm<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.740> supposed<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.430> die<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.880> well<00:01:15.000> because

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
i'm not supposed to die as well because

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.820 
i'm not supposed to die as well because
it<00:01:15.390> will<00:01:15.570> lose<00:01:15.720> my<00:01:15.869> calls<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.439> ghana<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it will lose my calls and ghana and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.950 
it will lose my calls and ghana and
stuff<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.640> bet<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.600> better<00:01:18.780> if

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
stuff like that so I bet it's better if

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.450 
stuff like that so I bet it's better if
I<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.049> die<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.890> will<00:01:20.040> lose<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
I don't die because I will lose a lot of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.929 
I don't die because I will lose a lot of
 if<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.939> die<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.290> yeah<00:01:22.369> maybe<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.520> shouldn't

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
 if I die so yeah maybe I shouldn't

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.060 
 if I die so yeah maybe I shouldn't
make<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.689> because<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.320> will<00:01:25.560> probably

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
make that that because I will probably

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.010 
make that that because I will probably
die<00:01:26.280> ever<00:01:26.580> make<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:27.570> right<00:01:27.689> anyway<00:01:27.960> so

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
die ever make that all right anyway so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.590 
die ever make that all right anyway so
moving<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.310> more<00:01:30.090> against<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.479> well

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
moving on got some more against as well

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
case you don't know it's maxed out

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.349 
case you don't know it's maxed out
except<00:03:23.250> for<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.430> engineering<00:03:23.940> but<00:03:24.060> i<00:03:24.090> just

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
except for the engineering but i just

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.910 
except for the engineering but i just
don't<00:03:24.450> feel<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:24.720> doing<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.260> engineering<00:03:25.739> so

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
don't feel like doing the engineering so

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.710 
don't feel like doing the engineering so
I<00:03:25.950> don't<00:03:26.190> do<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.430> because<00:03:27.299> why<00:03:27.450> play<00:03:27.690> games

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
I don't do it because why play games

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.360 
I don't do it because why play games
because<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:28.859> just<00:03:29.040> don't<00:03:29.160> like

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
because I like it and I just don't like

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.710 
because I like it and I just don't like
the<00:03:29.549> engineering<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.180> guess<00:03:30.389> it's<00:03:30.569> fair

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the engineering so I guess it's fair

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.170 
the engineering so I guess it's fair
enough<00:03:30.930> right<00:03:31.170> but<00:03:32.100> yeah<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.310> don't<00:03:32.700> scale

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
enough right but yeah I don't scale

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.809 
enough right but yeah I don't scale

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
well yeah I do have this diversity stuff

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.129 
well yeah I do have this diversity stuff
it's<00:04:12.000> probably<00:04:12.299> up<00:04:12.480> here<00:04:12.660> there<00:04:12.959> we<00:04:13.049> go

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
it's probably up here there we go

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.289 
it's probably up here there we go
there's<00:04:13.349> stuff<00:04:13.680> even<00:04:14.370> got<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.519> kaiju<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:15.090> got<00:04:15.269> a

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
there's stuff even got a kaiju I got a

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.789 
there's stuff even got a kaiju I got a
lot<00:04:15.480> engineering<00:04:16.079> stuff<00:04:16.289> that's<00:04:16.500> why<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.650> don't

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
lot engineering stuff that's why I don't

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.440 
lot engineering stuff that's why I don't
even<00:04:16.950> need<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.340> do<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.579> anymore<00:04:17.789> man<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.180> still

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
even need to do it anymore man I still

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.629 
even need to do it anymore man I still
got<00:04:18.690> like<00:04:18.810> 500<00:04:19.139> k<00:04:19.530> tokens<00:04:19.950> left<00:04:20.010> maybe<00:04:20.370> like

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
got like 500 k tokens left maybe like

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.600 
got like 500 k tokens left maybe like
600<00:04:21.239> k<00:04:21.419> alright<00:04:22.229> so<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.440> got<00:04:22.470> full<00:04:22.770> tour<00:04:23.039> as<00:04:23.310> well

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
600 k alright so I got full tour as well

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.210 
600 k alright so I got full tour as well
obviously<00:04:24.360> my<00:04:24.720> max<00:04:24.990> cape<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.530> then

obviously my max cape and then
dragon<00:04:26.670> claws<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.390> the<00:04:27.900> gods<00:04:28.170> were<00:04:28.290> that

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
dragon claws and the gods were that

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.190 
dragon claws and the gods were that
is<00:04:29.010> were<00:04:29.250> nothing<00:04:29.850> anymore<00:04:30.060> as<00:04:30.330> well<00:04:30.510> then

those don't even know why I still have
that<00:04:33.080> because<00:04:34.080> i<00:04:34.440> never<00:04:34.500> use<00:04:34.950> it<00:04:34.980> i'm<00:04:35.250> probably

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
that because i never use it i'm probably

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.340 
that because i never use it i'm probably
gonna<00:04:35.640> be<00:04:35.850> k<00:04:36.030> with<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.330> some<00:04:36.570> day<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.960> lose<00:04:37.110> it

me it's my runescape story all right I'm
I<00:04:42.660> thought<00:04:42.900> that<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.710> was<00:04:43.920> actually<00:04:44.220> funny
