another<00:00:35.730> useful<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.510> don't<00:00:36.719> get<00:00:36.960> is

another useful one that you don't get is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.000 
another useful one that you don't get is
with<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> Games<00:00:38.790> Workshop<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> half<00:00:39.570> round

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
with the Games Workshop is a half round

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.319 
with the Games Workshop is a half round
and<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.160> should<00:00:41.280> flat<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.579> one<00:00:41.640> side<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.149> round

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and we should flat on one side and round

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.930 
and we should flat on one side and round
on<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> other<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.370> tend<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> use<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.760> Games

is<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.409> check<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:10.650> mould<00:01:10.950> lines<00:01:11.420> ok<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.479> what

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
is to check your mould lines ok so what

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.249 
is to check your mould lines ok so what
is<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.200> mould<00:01:13.470> line<00:01:14.869> plastic<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> metal

and<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> mould<00:01:19.170> line<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.490> space<00:01:20.759> where

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and the mould line is the space where

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
and the mould line is the space where
the<00:01:21.030> two<00:01:21.240> molds<00:01:21.570> join<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.200> he<00:01:22.740> generally

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the two molds join because he generally

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.780 
the two molds join because he generally
relies<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.299> vacuum<00:01:25.290> style<00:01:28.280> casting<00:01:29.280> process

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
relies on a vacuum style casting process

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.480 
relies on a vacuum style casting process
or<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> metal<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.530> vulcanized

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
or with the metal it's a vulcanized

or with the metal it's a vulcanized
rubber<00:01:32.579> centrifugal<00:01:33.450> mold<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.320> spam<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
rubber centrifugal mold that spam and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.870 
rubber centrifugal mold that spam and
the<00:01:35.430> blade<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.880> forced<00:01:36.450> outwards<00:01:37.880> there's

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the blade is forced outwards there's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.690 
the blade is forced outwards there's
usually<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.900> line<00:01:40.380> running<00:01:40.680> along<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
usually a line running along the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.420 
usually a line running along the
miniature<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.630> lying<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> middle

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
miniature it's like lying in the middle

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
miniature it's like lying in the middle
and<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.030> surest<00:01:45.570> way<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.810> ruining<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and that is the surest way of ruining a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.899 
and that is the surest way of ruining a
paint<00:01:46.799> job<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.790> leaving<00:01:48.780> mold<00:01:49.020> lines<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.909> see

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
paint job is leaving mold lines on I see

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.670 
paint job is leaving mold lines on I see
