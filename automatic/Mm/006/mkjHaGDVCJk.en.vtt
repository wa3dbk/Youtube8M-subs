00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
move the mouth or you do this as well

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.860 
move the mouth or you do this as well
and<00:03:37.120> lift<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.840> coffee<00:03:38.080> paper<00:03:38.470> out<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:40.630> the

you're<00:03:44.620> ready<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:46.650> get<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.830> effect<00:03:49.350> and

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
you're ready and get that effect and

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.310 
you're ready and get that effect and
I'll<00:03:50.500> just<00:03:50.650> use<00:03:50.860> my<00:03:50.970> robust<00:03:51.970> wipe<00:03:52.240> looking<00:03:53.020> at

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
I'll just use my robust wipe looking at

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.740 
I'll just use my robust wipe looking at
my<00:03:53.560> little<00:03:53.710> bit<00:03:53.860> Messick<00:03:54.190> through<00:03:54.520> open<00:03:54.850> plain

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.880 

or<00:03:58.750> just<00:03:59.050> some<00:03:59.200> warm<00:03:59.500> water<00:04:01.590> shove<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.710> in<00:04:02.800> the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
or just some warm water shove it in the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.309 
or just some warm water shove it in the
tub

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.270 

and<00:04:11.319> that's<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.890> effect<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.340> get<00:04:12.489> with<00:04:12.640> that

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
and that's the effect you get with that

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.569 
and that's the effect you get with that
which<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.459> quite<00:04:15.790> nice<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.329> may<00:04:16.449> be<00:04:16.510> like<00:04:16.750> that

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:29.610 

that<00:04:21.579> one<00:04:25.350> nice<00:04:26.350> as<00:04:26.590> well<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:29.050> Titov

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
that one nice as well and this is Titov

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.270 
that one nice as well and this is Titov
I've<00:04:29.800> done<00:04:30.100> earlier<00:04:31.380> so<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:36.010> with<00:04:36.250> the

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
I've done earlier so this is with the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.370 
I've done earlier so this is with the
master<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.360> don't<00:04:37.660> know<00:04:37.780> if<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.900> can<00:04:38.050> see<00:04:38.229> the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
master I don't know if you can see the

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.969 
master I don't know if you can see the
mic<00:04:38.560> on<00:04:38.800> so<00:04:39.750> he<00:04:40.750> can<00:04:40.960> hear<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.110> dog<00:04:41.350> barking<00:04:41.410> it's

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979

just ran it through the embossing

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.810 
just ran it through the embossing
machine<00:05:31.229> so<00:05:32.229> that's<00:05:32.380> quite<00:05:32.560> nice<00:05:32.740> I<00:05:33.130> was

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
machine so that's quite nice I was

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.360 
machine so that's quite nice I was
having<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.240> play<00:05:34.450> and<00:05:34.780> trying<00:05:35.110> to<00:05:38.160> do<00:05:39.160> the

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
having a play and trying to do the

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.520 
having a play and trying to do the
gilding<00:05:39.729> flakes<00:05:39.760> by<00:05:40.270> using<00:05:40.510> all<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.870> glue<00:05:41.169> and

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
gilding flakes by using all the glue and

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.770 
gilding flakes by using all the glue and
like<00:05:42.039> sponging<00:05:42.760> it<00:05:42.849> over<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:45.330> trying<00:05:46.330> that<00:05:46.570> to

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
like sponging it over and trying that to

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.960 
like sponging it over and trying that to
see<00:05:46.960> if<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.110> worked<00:05:47.470> I<00:05:47.860> might<00:05:48.639> have<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:48.910> have

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
see if that worked I might have to have

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.460 
see if that worked I might have to have
another<00:05:49.210> plague<00:05:49.539> because<00:05:49.900> it<00:05:50.020> didn't<00:05:50.260> work

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
another plague because it didn't work

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.010 
another plague because it didn't work
out<00:05:50.680> very<00:05:50.740> well<00:05:51.099> this<00:05:52.000> is<00:05:52.210> what<00:05:52.389> I<00:05:52.419> call<00:05:52.750> just

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
out very well this is what I call just

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.350 
out very well this is what I call just
that<00:05:53.710> slight<00:05:53.919> loads<00:05:54.190> of<00:05:54.340> dots<00:05:54.580> all<00:05:54.820> over<00:05:54.970> of

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
that slight loads of dots all over of

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.500 
that slight loads of dots all over of
gilding<00:05:55.750> of<00:05:55.810> legs<00:05:56.520> so<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.550> don't<00:05:58.060> think<00:05:58.300> that'll

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
gilding of legs so I don't think that'll

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.909 
gilding of legs so I don't think that'll
work<00:05:58.660> whether<00:05:58.990> that's<00:05:59.229> the<00:05:59.410> card<00:05:59.680> I'm<00:05:59.889> using

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
work whether that's the card I'm using

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.240 
work whether that's the card I'm using
because<00:06:00.520> it's<00:06:00.700> got<00:06:01.260> the<00:06:02.260> texture<00:06:02.680> to<00:06:02.919> I<00:06:02.950> don't

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
because it's got the texture to I don't

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.750 
because it's got the texture to I don't
know<00:06:03.340> if<00:06:03.400> you<00:06:03.490> can<00:06:03.639> see<00:06:05.370> I've<00:06:06.370> got<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.639> little

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
know if you can see I've got a little

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.629 
know if you can see I've got a little
bit<00:06:06.970> the<00:06:07.090> texture<00:06:07.599> and<00:06:08.070> so<00:06:09.070> ever<00:06:09.250> it's<00:06:09.430> that

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
bit the texture and so ever it's that

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.940 
bit the texture and so ever it's that
although<00:06:09.970> it<00:06:10.180> feels<00:06:10.389> smoothest<00:06:11.080> got<00:06:11.800> this

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
although it feels smoothest got this

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.640 
although it feels smoothest got this
lightning<00:06:12.520> grace<00:06:12.729> so<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.539> was<00:06:13.780> that<00:06:13.960> one<00:06:14.169> and

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
lightning grace so that was that one and

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.100 
lightning grace so that was that one and
that<00:06:14.770> didn't<00:06:15.070> work<00:06:15.390> but<00:06:16.390> I've<00:06:16.539> tried<00:06:16.870> it<00:06:17.080> with

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
that didn't work but I've tried it with

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.940 
that didn't work but I've tried it with
miracle

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950
