in<00:00:33.410> step<00:00:34.410> 1<00:00:34.620> we're<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> place<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.460> sand

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
in step 1 we're going to place a sand

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
in step 1 we're going to place a sand
block<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> dirt<00:00:36.930> block<00:00:37.170> neither<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.739> has<00:00:37.920> an

a v-shape with solid blocks oops

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.740 
a v-shape with solid blocks oops
then<00:00:43.770> throw<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> splash<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.030> water<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
then throw a splash of water in the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.010 
then throw a splash of water in the
opening<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.530> throw<00:00:47.160> our<00:00:47.250> sugar<00:00:47.489> cane<00:00:47.730> down

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
opening and throw our sugar cane down

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.560 
opening and throw our sugar cane down
build<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> back<00:00:49.440> most<00:00:49.770> block<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.789> place<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
build the back most block up one place a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.360 
build the back most block up one place a
sticky<00:00:51.989> piston<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.440> top<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.829> block<00:00:53.100> then

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
sticky piston on top of that block then

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
sticky piston on top of that block then
a<00:00:53.399> solid<00:00:53.940> block<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.360> front<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.719> sticky

a solid block in front of that sticky

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470 
a solid block in front of that sticky
piston<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.579> cosmetic<00:00:57.300> reasons

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
piston and then it for cosmetic reasons

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
piston and then it for cosmetic reasons
it's<00:00:57.840> also<00:00:57.989> nice<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> cover<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> water

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it's also nice to cover that water

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.369 
it's also nice to cover that water

facing inwards now in this gap between

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.300 
facing inwards now in this gap between
the<00:01:27.540> two<00:01:27.689> Pistons<00:01:28.259> we're<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> place<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the two Pistons we're going to place a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
the two Pistons we're going to place a
block<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.939> redstone<00:01:30.329> which<00:01:31.110> will<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
block of redstone which will be the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.789 
block of redstone which will be the
final<00:01:31.770> step<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.340> our<00:01:32.369> bud<00:01:32.820> switch<00:01:33.650> lastly<00:01:34.650> we

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
final step for our bud switch lastly we

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.249 
final step for our bud switch lastly we
need<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.040> place<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.400> chest<00:01:35.790> two<00:01:36.299> blocks<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
need to place a chest two blocks out to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.340 
need to place a chest two blocks out to
hold<00:01:37.799> our<00:01:38.009> drops<00:01:38.310> than<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> hopper<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.780> collect

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
hold our drops than a hopper to collect

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.740 
hold our drops than a hopper to collect
and<00:01:40.619> move<00:01:40.979> our<00:01:41.250> drops<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.390> need<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> build

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and move our drops then we need to build

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.499 
and move our drops then we need to build
a<00:01:42.930> glass<00:01:43.259> cage<00:01:43.680> around<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.729> prevent<00:01:45.180> our

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
a glass cage around this to prevent our

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.069 
a glass cage around this to prevent our
drops<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.290> flying<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:48.810> glass

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
drops from flying out and now glass

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.859 
drops from flying out and now glass
isn't<00:01:49.380> required<00:01:49.829> any<00:01:50.250> solid<00:01:50.700> block<00:01:51.149> will<00:01:51.570> do

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
isn't required any solid block will do

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
isn't required any solid block will do
but<00:01:52.530> glass<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:53.009> looks<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> best<00:01:53.520> now<00:01:54.000> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
but glass just looks the best now you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.490 
but glass just looks the best now you
can<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.570> whenever<00:01:54.750> sugarcane<00:01:55.320> would

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
can see that whenever sugarcane would

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.660 
can see that whenever sugarcane would
grow<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.860> we're<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.250> emulate

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
grow and we're just going to emulate

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
grow and we're just going to emulate
that<00:01:56.850> by<00:01:57.060> placing<00:01:57.360> some<00:01:57.570> sugar<00:01:57.930> cane

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
that by placing some sugar cane

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.170 
that by placing some sugar cane
it'll<00:01:58.829> get<00:01:58.920> immediately<00:01:59.430> destroyed<00:01:59.820> picked

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it'll get immediately destroyed picked

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.709 
it'll get immediately destroyed picked
up<00:02:00.299> by<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> hopper<00:02:01.170> put<00:02:01.860> into<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> chest

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
up by that hopper put into the chest

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.389 
up by that hopper put into the chest
that's<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.140> tutorial<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.070> use

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
that's it for this tutorial you can use

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.999 
that's it for this tutorial you can use
