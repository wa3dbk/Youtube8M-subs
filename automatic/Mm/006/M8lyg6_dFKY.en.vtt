okay guys today's video is going to be
on<00:00:08.269> power<00:00:09.269> supplies<00:00:10.099> I<00:00:11.099> was<00:00:11.639> having<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.000> look

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
on power supplies I was having to look

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.680 
on power supplies I was having to look
at<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.420> rate<00:00:12.719> max<00:00:13.019> one<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.650> used<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
at this rate max one that we used in the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.500 
at this rate max one that we used in the
AMD<00:00:15.690> overclock<00:00:16.289> one<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.029> it<00:00:18.029> just<00:00:18.240> really

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
AMD overclock one and it just really

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.429 
AMD overclock one and it just really
stands<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.350> being<00:00:19.710> silver<00:00:20.689> most<00:00:21.689> new<00:00:22.170> power

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
stands out being silver most new power

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.769

silver especially if you have any of the
older<00:00:27.269> ones<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.900> was<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.070> wondering<00:00:29.609> how

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
older ones I was just wondering how

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.330 
older ones I was just wondering how
tough<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.570> would<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.140> take<00:00:31.439> mine<00:00:31.710> apart<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
tough it would be to take mine apart and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.330 
tough it would be to take mine apart and
paint<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.360> make<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> match<00:00:34.829> your<00:00:35.070> case<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
paint it make it to match your case a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.030 
paint it make it to match your case a
little<00:00:35.760> better<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.750> that's<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:37.829> we're<00:00:37.950> going

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the dual fan won the antec let's see

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
the dual fan won the antec let's see
there's<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> bottle<00:00:54.660> KY<00:00:55.170> dash<00:00:55.770> 520<00:00:56.579> ATX<00:00:57.949> which

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
there's a bottle KY dash 520 ATX which

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.970 
there's a bottle KY dash 520 ATX which
is<00:00:59.309> if<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.390> make<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.649> 20

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is if you can make that out for in 20

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.640 
is if you can make that out for in 20
watts<00:01:02.190> total<00:01:03.110> but<00:01:04.110> we're<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> start

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
watts total but we're going to start

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.510 
watts total but we're going to start
stripping<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.939> see<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:07.020> can

stripping this down and see what we can

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.010 
stripping this down and see what we can
take<00:01:08.520> off<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.659> ready<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
take off of it here to get it ready to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.770 
take off of it here to get it ready to
paint<00:01:10.520> well<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.939> particular<00:01:12.540> model

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
paint well on this particular model

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.100 
paint well on this particular model
we're<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.689> take<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> solder

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
we're going to have to take the solder

we're going to have to take the solder
off<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.360> power<00:01:18.360> cord<00:01:18.570> connector<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
off of the power cord connector and the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
off of the power cord connector and the
switch<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> back<00:01:20.600> can't<00:01:21.600> say<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:21.900> all<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
switch on the back can't say if all of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.300 
switch on the back can't say if all of
them<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:23.040> pretty<00:01:23.189> sure

it's<00:02:58.889> fairly<00:02:59.220> expensive<00:02:59.850> when<00:03:00.420> you're<00:03:00.540> doing

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
it's fairly expensive when you're doing

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.699 
it's fairly expensive when you're doing
small<00:03:01.859> projects<00:03:02.579> like<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.989> difference

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
small projects like this the difference

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.920 
small projects like this the difference
is<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.220> how<00:03:05.459> long<00:03:05.730> it'll<00:03:06.180> take<00:03:06.359> before<00:03:06.690> the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
is is how long it'll take before the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.920 
is is how long it'll take before the
glue<00:03:07.319> sets<00:03:07.709> up<00:03:07.889> on<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.480> tape<00:03:09.720> that

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
glue sets up on it this is the tape that

glue sets up on it this is the tape that
I've<00:03:10.170> been<00:03:10.410> buying<00:03:10.880> if<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.030> can<00:03:12.150> make<00:03:12.359> that

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.360 
number and everything so we don't want
to<00:04:09.300> paint<00:04:09.540> over<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:10.740> I'm<00:04:10.830> going<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.070> mask

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
to paint over that so I'm going to mask

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.520 
to paint over that so I'm going to mask
that<00:04:11.550> off<00:04:11.910> with<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.300> masking<00:04:12.750> tape<00:04:12.960> before<00:04:13.170> we

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
that off with the masking tape before we

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.240 
that off with the masking tape before we
prime<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.790> that'll<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.150> our<00:04:15.300> next<00:04:15.450> step<00:04:16.250> okay

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
prime so that'll be our next step okay

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.900 
prime so that'll be our next step okay
we<00:04:17.489> got<00:04:17.700> our<00:04:17.910> parts<00:04:18.390> painted<00:04:18.900> up<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:20.220> decided<00:04:20.790> to

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
we got our parts painted up I decided to

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.520 
we got our parts painted up I decided to
go<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> little<00:04:21.239> different<00:04:21.660> color<00:04:21.840> on<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.350> was

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
go a little different color on it I was

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.800 
go a little different color on it I was
originally<00:04:22.800> going<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.250> paint<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.640> yellow<00:04:23.820> but

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
originally going to paint it yellow but

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.200 
originally going to paint it yellow but
I<00:04:24.840> decided<00:04:25.290> that<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.740> may<00:04:26.130> not<00:04:26.370> end<00:04:26.760> up<00:04:26.970> keeping

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
I decided that we may not end up keeping

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.440 
I decided that we may not end up keeping
this<00:04:27.570> one<00:04:27.900> in<00:04:28.170> this<00:04:28.350> case<00:04:28.790> so<00:04:29.790> we<00:04:29.910> decided<00:04:30.240> to

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
this one in this case so we decided to

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.530 
this one in this case so we decided to
just<00:04:30.570> do<00:04:30.960> black<00:04:31.380> on<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.950> make<00:04:32.100> it<00:04:32.160> more

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
just do black on it to make it more

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.800 
just do black on it to make it more
modern<00:04:33.540> looking<00:04:34.170> and<00:04:35.120> match<00:04:36.120> with<00:04:36.150> just<00:04:36.690> about
