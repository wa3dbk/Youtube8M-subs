00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.219
 and all the engines including petrol and diesel are all equipped with 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:09.799
 start &amp; stop system 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.949
 that of a device that turns off when the vehicle is not a 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.140
 brand so I think about what stop traffic lights boils sofico during 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.609
 city ​​use 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.840
 sails for all other related parts instead consumption 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.760
 question cars all our high shady motorization are crazy 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.270
 particularly they are engines that have a very low impact in terms 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.650
 just think with a thousand 3 we also have the possibility of having kitchens 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.380

 the feeling of feeling immediately at ease thanks to the fact of 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.670
 reach all the main controls immediately and have an optic 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.710
 precise of the angles of encumbrance of this month 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.700
 as for safety, I want to point out that this vehicle 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.210
 and let's say how the larger hotels are supplied with the category 28 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 liters inserted into the seat 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.640
 obviously the height-adjustable safety belts complete with 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.920
 pretensioners is the whole part related to fruit trees 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.830
 as far as active safety is concerned, I would like to remind you that there is a standard 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.450
 sp. system 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.820
 starting from the basic model and in the part of the passenger compartment management 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.490
 there is a help membership that goes by the name of you london 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.020
 this allows us in uphill starts 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.740
 full crack article to have 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.679
 bump up 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.200
 that the vehicle back off so I have all the time d 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.100
 if mum arrives if i crush the clutch then avoid 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.080
 in the back we analyze the modularity part is called del 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.010
 trunk 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.620
 I want you to notice vat large load capacity in the rear area 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.280
 possibility of moving the hatbox on 2 levels I point out 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.590
 the attacks of the first level of the second level 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.919
 Opposite school mode as best I believe in the loading phase 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.370
 as regards instead it is the part of the session we have two versions one 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.659
 version 5 a version 7 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.549
 this one you see is a 5-seater version and a 7-seater version 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.980
 there was a possibility to do this in order to access the third row 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.310

 contacts in the back area these evenings can be folded up you can 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.200
 then virtually remove a wall 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.949
 as for the spaces inside instead 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:42.159
 of the vehicle we wanted to emphasize the very wide knee lap higher 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.239
 of the category the possibility of having a gomez space for all three 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.609
 occupants is the second final is a good a zone as you see here for the head 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.099
 where there are plenty of space 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.420
 close to this part by pointing out that there is an airplane-like blackcap 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.319
 is called 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.860
