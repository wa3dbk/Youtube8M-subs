00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
3 I did a pin right here you see my

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.969 
3 I did a pin right here you see my
dazzle<00:06:01.240> lagging<00:06:02.240> because<00:06:03.169> I<00:06:03.409> think<00:06:03.560> I<00:06:03.740> messed

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
dazzle lagging because I think I messed

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.550 
dazzle lagging because I think I messed
up<00:06:04.129> some<00:06:04.879> wires<00:06:05.090> this<00:06:05.330> usually<00:06:05.900> this<00:06:06.080> is<00:06:06.229> the

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
up some wires this usually this is the

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.659 
up some wires this usually this is the
first<00:06:06.740> time<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:06.919> have<00:06:07.069> been<00:06:07.099> ever<00:06:07.370> since<00:06:07.490> my

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
first time I have been ever since my

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.330 
first time I have been ever since my
first<00:06:07.819> video<00:06:08.150> but<00:06:08.389> uh<00:06:08.710> stepped<00:06:09.710> on<00:06:09.919> a<00:06:09.949> couple

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
first video but uh stepped on a couple

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.490 
first video but uh stepped on a couple
wires<00:06:10.490> and<00:06:11.029> I<00:06:11.330> think<00:06:11.629> that<00:06:11.750> messed<00:06:11.930> it<00:06:12.080> up<00:06:12.199> but

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
wires and I think that messed it up but

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.499 
wires and I think that messed it up but
I'll<00:06:12.620> fix<00:06:12.800> it<00:06:13.009> and<00:06:14.289> as<00:06:15.289> I<00:06:15.740> was<00:06:15.919> saying<00:06:16.219> the<00:06:17.029> kdr

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
I'll fix it and as I was saying the kdr

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.170 
I'll fix it and as I was saying the kdr
might<00:06:17.750> not<00:06:17.900> be<00:06:18.050> the<00:06:18.169> best<00:06:18.379> but<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:19.580> actual

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
might not be the best but the actual

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.809 
might not be the best but the actual
gameplay<00:06:20.509> and<00:06:21.139> the<00:06:21.409> kills<00:06:21.650> are<00:06:22.129> pretty<00:06:22.669> good

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
gameplay and the kills are pretty good

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.740 
gameplay and the kills are pretty good
