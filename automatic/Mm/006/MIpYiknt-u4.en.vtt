00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.670
 European Championship 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.520
 No, this breathtaking song, you ask yourself as a neutral viewer what the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.820
 Driving athletes 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.190
 to handle these difficult tasks with the railcar 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.479
 The fascination of Breitbarth is not always different 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.390
 Obstacles are that you come to every competition and there are always new ones 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.860
 Requirement for the whole story 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.180
 because the obstacle is in the stayer of the animal was always coming back to his 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.870
 Boundaries where his new limits continue below you never know what comes from it 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.330
 there Boehner is not individual the sport it was almost always one spoke 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.409
 rediscover new techniques to learn new obstacles 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.319
 no matter how hard an obstacle is 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.009
 there are safe variants as demonstrated here by Baker Kenny Wheeler i 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.229
 he supports himself with one foot and thus accepts a penalty point 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.729
 how the current world champion tackles them themselves 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.409
 His performance was unbreakable on that day 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.409
 with nine points he crossed the twelve sections 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.529
 Kiel's price target is France 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:35.209
 he is the new European Champion in the 26 inch class 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.899
 the German participants took 6th and 8th place in this final 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.709
 Hannes Herrmann finished eighth with 7 40 points 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.500
 and with 43 points Thomas Kroth took sixth place 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.529
 so I have to say he's out there he's talking about portraits 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.299
 and that's why I am very satisfied as 10 microns sixth place al-wazir 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.049
 is always among the top 8 to few that I have achieved and sixth place was 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.719
 even air backwards and therefore Nicholson satisfied under the track already 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.259
 that ended in a positive way 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.039
 There were positive things this weekend too 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.089
 sweating racing in beautiful summer weather in the flour to grind 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:15.139
 The spectators attend the athletes enthusiastically at the MSC Melsungen 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.309
 The Morrison and the sponsors have succeeded rockfall highlight for 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.499
 absolute top class to protect the right light 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.540
 So I have to say the voter made a great event more 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.780
 I think it was for all participants to the event 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:29.549
 Audience could 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.760
 in competition this Wednesday, and the sectors were exciting we were there 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.789
 has seen the work of his last sector decided 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.349
 who was not here 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.299
 has definitely missed something this weekend 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.400
 As the results want to read again can do this on the page 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.400
