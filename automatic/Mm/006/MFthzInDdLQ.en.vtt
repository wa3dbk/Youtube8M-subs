safety arrest systems and they're kind

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.369 
safety arrest systems and they're kind
of<00:00:54.820> like<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:54.970> yo-yo<00:00:55.269> that<00:00:55.480> cable<00:00:56.019> that<00:00:56.140> comes

and<00:00:59.019> forth

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.550 

I<00:01:03.310> was<00:01:04.239> telling<00:01:04.450> you<00:01:04.630> guys<00:01:04.780> earlier<00:01:05.020> we<00:01:05.230> do<00:01:05.380> who

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
I was telling you guys earlier we do who

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.500 
I was telling you guys earlier we do who
try<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.830> do<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.070> lot<00:01:06.370> of<00:01:06.400> work<00:01:06.670> on<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.180> ground

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
try to do a lot of work on the ground

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.480 
try to do a lot of work on the ground
because<00:01:07.930> it's<00:01:08.260> a<00:01:08.350> lot<00:01:08.560> easier<00:01:08.860> when<00:01:09.130> you're<00:01:09.370> up

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
because it's a lot easier when you're up

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.010 
because it's a lot easier when you're up
in<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.730> air<00:01:09.760> any<00:01:10.180> time<00:01:10.450> you're<00:01:10.600> up<00:01:10.660> in<00:01:10.840> there

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
in the air any time you're up in there

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.150 
in the air any time you're up in there
it's<00:01:11.230> harder<00:01:11.590> work<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.310> ladder<00:01:12.810> scaffold<00:01:14.160> on

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
it's harder work on a ladder scaffold on

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.550 
it's harder work on a ladder scaffold on
the<00:01:15.370> roof<00:01:15.610> anything<00:01:16.240> it's<00:01:16.690> always<00:01:16.900> harder<00:01:17.440> to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
the roof anything it's always harder to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.470 
the roof anything it's always harder to
get<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.950> more<00:01:18.130> difficult<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.940> navigate

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
get and more difficult to navigate

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.510 
get and more difficult to navigate
through<00:01:20.050> things<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.530> do<00:01:20.680> things<00:01:20.980> so<00:01:21.250> it's

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
through things and do things so it's

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.080 
through things and do things so it's
better<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:22.120> do<00:01:22.330> like<00:01:23.520> try<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.580> figure<00:01:24.820> out

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
better to do like try to figure out

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.940 
better to do like try to figure out
where<00:01:25.300> your<00:01:25.450> sling<00:01:25.720> fall<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.080> gonna<00:01:26.260> be<00:01:26.500> build

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
where your sling fall is gonna be build

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.860 
where your sling fall is gonna be build
your<00:01:27.130> trusses<00:01:27.640> on<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:27.970> ground<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.540> then<00:01:28.660> try

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
your trusses on the ground and then try

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.710 
your trusses on the ground and then try
to<00:01:28.900> get<00:01:29.140> your<00:01:29.320> anchor<00:01:29.980> points<00:01:30.460> on<00:01:30.730> those<00:01:31.330> so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
to get your anchor points on those so

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.840 
to get your anchor points on those so
when<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:31.990> send<00:01:32.260> them<00:01:32.350> up<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.800> air<00:01:33.010> if<00:01:33.730> you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
when you send them up in the air if you

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.940 
when you send them up in the air if you
have<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.090> good<00:01:34.510> anchor<00:01:34.900> point<00:01:35.170> already<00:01:35.590> there

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
have a good anchor point already there

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.040 
have a good anchor point already there
and<00:01:36.100> you're<00:01:36.220> not<00:01:36.400> fumbling<00:01:36.910> with<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.390> with<00:01:37.930> the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
and you're not fumbling with it with the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.050 
and you're not fumbling with it with the
ladder<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:38.770> trying<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.160> get<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.850> and

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
ladder and trying to get to it and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.880 
ladder and trying to get to it and
figure<00:01:40.210> out<00:01:40.390> how<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.690> get<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.050> it

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.810 

Furion<00:01:46.729> up<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.090> not<00:01:47.300> too<00:01:47.540> bad<00:01:47.840> once<00:01:48.640> once<00:01:49.640> you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
Furion up is not too bad once once you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.580 
Furion up is not too bad once once you
already<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.479> fall<00:01:50.750> protection<00:01:50.990> in

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
already have the fall protection in

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.219 
already have the fall protection in
place<00:01:51.620> and<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.250> anchors<00:01:52.610> in<00:01:52.790> place<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:53.990> not

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
place and the anchors in place it's not

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.670 
place and the anchors in place it's not
too<00:01:54.470> bad<00:01:54.680> but<00:01:55.040> some<00:01:56.000> had<00:01:56.420> taken<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.290> getting<00:01:57.560> to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
too bad but some had taken to getting to

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.530 
too bad but some had taken to getting to
that<00:01:57.830> point<00:01:58.100> takes<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.580> couple<00:01:58.909> extra<00:01:59.270> hours

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
that point takes a couple extra hours

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.480 
that point takes a couple extra hours
and<00:01:59.750> then<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.140> harnessing<00:02:00.710> is<00:02:00.890> not<00:02:01.070> that<00:02:01.310> bad

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
and then the harnessing is not that bad

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.999 
and then the harnessing is not that bad
I<00:02:01.550> mean<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.970> put<00:02:02.119> on<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.270> harness<00:02:02.740> only<00:02:03.740> takes

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
I mean to put on a harness only takes

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.219 
I mean to put on a harness only takes
maybe<00:02:04.310> five<00:02:04.670> minutes<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.300> most<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.020> dish

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
maybe five minutes the most and the dish

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.830 
maybe five minutes the most and the dish
checking<00:02:06.770> all<00:02:06.920> your<00:02:07.100> equipment<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:07.940> make

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
checking all your equipment and make

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.210 
checking all your equipment and make
sure<00:02:09.050> everything's<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.679> good<00:02:09.890> working

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
sure everything's in good working

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.580 
sure everything's in good working
condition<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:11.209> it's<00:02:11.450> not<00:02:11.660> really<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.110> much

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
condition so it's not really that much

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.890 
condition so it's not really that much
of<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.890> time<00:02:13.130> once<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.640> get<00:02:13.910> into<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.300> habit<00:02:14.780> of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
of a time once you get into a habit of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.410 
of a time once you get into a habit of
doing<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.410> it's<00:02:15.590> not<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:16.069> bad

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.200 

experiences<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.500> was<00:02:20.860> rough<00:02:21.190> very<00:02:21.640> rough<00:02:21.790> at

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
experiences it was rough very rough at

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.120 
experiences it was rough very rough at
the<00:02:22.360> first<00:02:22.630> time<00:02:22.900> very<00:02:23.140> hard<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:23.710> used<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
it and it's a little complicated to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.010 
it and it's a little complicated to
figure<00:02:26.620> out<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:27.940> we<00:02:28.060> got<00:02:28.270> we<00:02:28.480> got<00:02:28.510> through<00:02:28.990> it
