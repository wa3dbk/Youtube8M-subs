descend here is also tricky it's a it's
a<00:00:30.169> rough<00:00:30.349> surface<00:00:30.590> their<00:00:31.750> Road<00:00:32.750> will<00:00:33.260> be

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
a rough surface their Road will be

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.860 
a rough surface their Road will be
closed<00:00:33.949> to<00:00:34.250> traffic<00:00:34.489> coming<00:00:34.940> up<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:35.329> hill<00:00:35.360> so

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
closed to traffic coming up the hill so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.380 
closed to traffic coming up the hill so
it'll<00:00:36.800> be<00:00:36.949> safe<00:00:37.250> in<00:00:37.460> that<00:00:37.610> respect<00:00:38.000> but<00:00:38.149> any

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
it'll be safe in that respect but any

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.020 
it'll be safe in that respect but any
dissent<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:39.019> is<00:00:39.379> dangerous<00:00:40.220> and<00:00:40.460> this<00:00:40.730> is<00:00:40.879> no

descending<00:01:40.350> Jenkins<00:01:40.890> hollow<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:41.789> on

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
descending Jenkins hollow you're on

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.940 
descending Jenkins hollow you're on
Howard's<00:01:42.390> lick<00:01:42.570> briefly<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.350> probably<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
Howard's lick briefly it's probably the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.359 
Howard's lick briefly it's probably the
smoothest<00:01:44.909> flattest<00:01:45.860> nicest<00:01:46.860> part<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
smoothest flattest nicest part of the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:02:31.230 
smoothest flattest nicest part of the
course<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.570> also<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.079> briefest

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.240 

and<00:02:31.780> we<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:31.900> did<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> descent<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:33.010> dis

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and we just did the descent of dis

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.730 
and we just did the descent of dis
pinette<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:34.510> descend<00:02:34.990> sharp<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.650> then

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
pinette and you descend sharp and then

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.980 
pinette and you descend sharp and then
you<00:02:35.890> have<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.070> long<00:02:36.690> section<00:02:37.690> where<00:02:37.900> you're

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
you have a long section where you're

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.100 
you have a long section where you're
still<00:02:38.170> descending<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.790> can<00:02:40.000> draft<00:02:40.300> and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
still descending but you can draft and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.560 
still descending but you can draft and
they<00:02:41.410> come<00:02:41.770> out<00:02:41.950> onto<00:02:42.280> 259<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:43.180> have<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.330> mile

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
they come out onto 259 you have a mile

00:02:43.570 --> 00:03:11.190 
they come out onto 259 you have a mile
and<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> half<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:44.260> Valley<00:02:44.920> Road

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.310 

so<00:03:12.200> you've<00:03:12.980> just<00:03:13.010> done<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.490> about<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.360> mile<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:15.230> a

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
so you've just done a about a mile and a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.710 
so you've just done a about a mile and a
half<00:03:15.350> two<00:03:15.709> mile<00:03:15.920> falls<00:03:16.340> flat<00:03:16.640> coming<00:03:17.120> from<00:03:17.209> 259

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
half two mile falls flat coming from 259

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.870 
half two mile falls flat coming from 259
you<00:03:18.290> come<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.680> up<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.040> whole<00:03:19.190> way<00:03:19.400> once<00:03:19.700> you

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
you come and up the whole way once you

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.410 
you come and up the whole way once you
leave<00:03:20.060> 259<00:03:20.720> 259<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:22.010> dead<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.880> valley<00:03:23.090> so

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
leave 259 259 is dead in the valley so

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.300 
leave 259 259 is dead in the valley so
as<00:03:23.959> soon<00:03:24.110> as<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.290> come<00:03:24.440> up<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.709> 59<00:03:25.040> you're

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
as soon as you come up to 59 you're

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:43.210 
as soon as you come up to 59 you're
going<00:03:25.580> uphill<00:03:41.709> here<00:03:42.709> we<00:03:42.800> are<00:03:42.920> in<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.070> back

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
going uphill here we are in the back

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.330 
going uphill here we are in the back
side<00:03:43.580> of<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.600> racecourse<00:03:45.170> where<00:03:45.830> you<00:03:46.100> turn

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
side of the racecourse where you turn

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.180 
side of the racecourse where you turn
off<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.000> crab<00:03:47.450> run<00:03:47.750> on<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.260> colors<00:03:48.590> run<00:03:48.830> this

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
off a crab run on the colors run this

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.840 
off a crab run on the colors run this
point<00:03:49.550> you're<00:03:50.330> about<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.750> mile<00:03:51.290> from<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.459> climb

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
point you're about a mile from the climb

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.380 
point you're about a mile from the climb
up<00:03:53.090> Jenkins<00:03:53.660> hollow<00:03:53.870> which<00:03:54.769> will<00:03:55.010> be<00:03:55.190> the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
up Jenkins hollow which will be the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:13.170 
up Jenkins hollow which will be the
start/finish<00:03:56.390> line

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.210 

and<00:04:14.180> we<00:04:14.450> turning<00:04:14.900> onto<00:04:15.020> Jenkins<00:04:15.560> hollow<00:04:15.769> this

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
and we turning onto Jenkins hollow this

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.069 
and we turning onto Jenkins hollow this
is<00:04:16.340> where<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.579> kicks<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.329> top<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:17.870> about<00:04:18.049> a

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
is where it kicks to the top is about a

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.789 
is where it kicks to the top is about a
mile<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:19.970> is<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.150> climb<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.380> top<00:04:21.560> of

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
mile and this is a climb to the top of

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.820 
mile and this is a climb to the top of
the<00:04:22.280> loop<00:04:22.960> it'll<00:04:23.960> be<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.260> start/finish<00:04:24.800> line

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
the loop it'll be the start/finish line

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.380 
the loop it'll be the start/finish line
and<00:04:27.820> it's<00:04:28.820> tough<00:04:29.090> so<00:04:29.450> this<00:04:29.720> is<00:04:29.750> it

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
and it's tough so this is it

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.450 
and it's tough so this is it
you
