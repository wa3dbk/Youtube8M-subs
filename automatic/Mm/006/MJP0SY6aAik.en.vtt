00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
humne almost invincible well I was a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.180 
humne almost invincible well I was a
little<00:02:02.840> sloppy<00:02:03.020> did<00:02:03.590> not<00:02:03.740> do<00:02:03.860> such<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.100> great

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190

multiplayer use him with maxed out gear

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.280 
multiplayer use him with maxed out gear
yeah<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:14.240> that's<00:02:14.420> there<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.810> go<00:02:14.990> so<00:02:15.200> if

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
yeah so that's there you go so if

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.690 
yeah so that's there you go so if
anybody's<00:02:15.680> wondering<00:02:15.770> if<00:02:16.040> Shazam<00:02:16.370> was<00:02:16.520> worth

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
anybody's wondering if Shazam was worth

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.370 
anybody's wondering if Shazam was worth
the<00:02:16.910> trouble<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.300> getting<00:02:17.480> he<00:02:17.780> definitely<00:02:18.260> is

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
the trouble of getting he definitely is

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.740 
the trouble of getting he definitely is
so<00:02:18.890> yeah<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.370> know<00:02:19.459> what<00:02:19.580> we<00:02:19.730> have<00:02:20.570> used

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
so yeah you know what we have used

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.150 
so yeah you know what we have used
helium<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.410> guess<00:02:21.560> that'll<00:02:21.800> be<00:02:21.830> your<00:02:21.950> next

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
helium and I guess that'll be your next

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.370 
helium and I guess that'll be your next
view<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.400> demonstrate<00:02:22.790> how<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:23.900> use

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
view that demonstrate how you can use

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.320 
view that demonstrate how you can use
any<00:02:25.100> kind<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.570> backup<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:28.010> your<00:02:28.070> app<00:02:28.250> data<00:02:28.520> to
