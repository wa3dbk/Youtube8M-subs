so I think that you guys have a really
good<00:00:25.170> range<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.340> sizes<00:00:26.699> represented

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
good range of sizes represented

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.730 
good range of sizes represented
including<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.840> really<00:00:28.199> really<00:00:28.439> adorable

little small form-factor

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.650 
little small form-factor
it's<00:00:31.109> probably<00:00:31.470> got<00:00:31.650> more<00:00:31.859> bite<00:00:32.489> than

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
it's probably got more bite than

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.360 
it's probably got more bite than
cuteness<00:00:33.660> though<00:00:33.870> right<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> very

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
faster than a reference card not only

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.950 
faster than a reference card not only
that<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> memory<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.970> also<00:01:21.150> overclocked

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that but the memory is also overclocked

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
that but the memory is also overclocked
as<00:01:22.110> well<00:01:22.290> okay<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> reference<00:01:23.189> card<00:01:23.400> you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
as well okay with the reference card you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.190 
as well okay with the reference card you
have<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:24.030> maybe<00:01:24.299> seven<00:01:24.600> gigahertz<00:01:24.960> that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
have about maybe seven gigahertz that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.230 
have about maybe seven gigahertz that
reference<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:26.159> ours<00:01:26.369> you'll<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.820> an

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
reference with ours you'll have an

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.210 
reference with ours you'll have an
additional<00:01:27.450> 200<00:01:27.960> megahertz<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.530> 7.2

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
additional 200 megahertz so 7.2

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.980 
additional 200 megahertz so 7.2
gigahertz<00:01:29.520> speed<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> looks<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.869> you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
gigahertz speed so it looks like you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.510 
gigahertz speed so it looks like you
guys<00:01:31.110> also<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> new<00:01:31.680> cooler<00:01:31.920> technology

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
guys also have a new cooler technology

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.800 
guys also have a new cooler technology
on<00:01:32.640> here<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> tell<00:01:33.210> me<00:01:33.299> about<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
on here you want to tell me about it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.660 
on here you want to tell me about it
that's<00:01:34.110> right<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.680> introduced<00:01:35.009> new<00:01:35.189> ice

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that's right so we introduced new ice

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.280 
that's right so we introduced new ice
storm<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.390> available<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.930> Dell<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
storm and it's available on Dell and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.780 
storm and it's available on Dell and
they<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.729> our

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
they get just have here and also on our

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.670 
they get just have here and also on our
antic<00:01:39.240> stream<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.350> types<00:01:40.590> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
antic stream so you have two types of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.499 
antic stream so you have two types of
versions<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> dual<00:01:41.909> fan<00:01:42.090> version

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
versions you have the dual fan version

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.210 
versions you have the dual fan version
and<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.110> triple<00:01:43.409> van<00:01:43.560> version<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.100> they're

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
and the triple van version and they're

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.850 
and the triple van version and they're
all<00:01:44.460> both<00:01:44.700> using<00:01:45.119> 90<00:01:45.390> millimeter<00:01:45.720> fans<00:01:45.960> but

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
all both using 90 millimeter fans but

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.440 
all both using 90 millimeter fans but
what<00:01:47.189> everyone<00:01:47.610> focus<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> amp

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
what everyone focus on is the amp

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.600 
what everyone focus on is the amp
extreme<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.799> only<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
extreme so not only do you have the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.999 
extreme so not only do you have the
triple<00:01:50.880> fan<00:01:51.060> version<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.899> center<00:01:52.259> fan<00:01:52.530> acts

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
triple fan version the center fan acts

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.429 
triple fan version the center fan acts
as<00:01:53.280> an<00:01:53.399> intake<00:01:53.759> where<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.840> side<00:01:55.170> fans

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
as an intake where as the side fans

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020 
as an intake where as the side fans
they're<00:01:55.799> acting<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.219> exhaust<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> they're

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
they're acting as exhaust and they're

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.209 
they're acting as exhaust and they're
rotating<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.600> different<00:01:57.899> directions<00:01:58.219> to

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
rotating in different directions to

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.459 
rotating in different directions to
reduce<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.909> turbulence<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> also<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.320> that

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
reduce the turbulence and also with that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.859 
reduce the turbulence and also with that
you'll<00:02:01.829> reduce<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> noise<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.630> cool

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
you'll reduce the noise as well so cool

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
you'll reduce the noise as well so cool
so<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.530> won't<00:02:04.770> restart<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.219> make<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> hot<00:02:05.670> air

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
so you won't restart to make the hot air

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
so you won't restart to make the hot air
and<00:02:06.000> get<00:02:06.329> back<00:02:06.479> into<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:06.719> video<00:02:06.930> card<00:02:07.229> that's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
and get back into your video card that's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.949 
and get back into your video card that's
excellent<00:02:08.220> that's<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.459> really<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:08.849> idea<00:02:08.959> also

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
excellent that's a really good idea also

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.559 
excellent that's a really good idea also
with<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> more<00:02:10.860> power<00:02:11.190> power<00:02:11.640> booze

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
with the more power power booze

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.270 
with the more power power booze
tell<00:02:13.049> me<00:02:13.140> about<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.830> seems<00:02:14.069> like<00:02:14.190> you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
tell me about that it seems like you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.770 
tell me about that it seems like you
guys<00:02:14.370> got<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.610> new<00:02:14.790> capacitor<00:02:15.239> technology

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
guys got a new capacitor technology

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.360 
guys got a new capacitor technology
happening<00:02:16.170> here<00:02:16.349> right<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.040> wanted<00:02:17.310> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
happening here right so we wanted to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.250 
happening here right so we wanted to
cars<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.879> more<00:02:18.180> efficient<00:02:18.629> as<00:02:18.720> well<00:02:18.930> this

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
cars to be more efficient as well this

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.990 
cars to be more efficient as well this
is<00:02:19.319> Maxwell<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.159> efficient<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.700> we<00:02:20.760> wanted

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
is Maxwell is so efficient so we wanted

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.330 
is Maxwell is so efficient so we wanted
to<00:02:21.060> make<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> power<00:02:22.250> matching<00:02:23.250> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
to make the power matching the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.009 
to make the power matching the
performance<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.849> Maxwell<00:02:24.269> so<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> power

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
performance of Maxwell so with the power

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.630 
performance of Maxwell so with the power
plus<00:02:25.319> we're<00:02:25.590> using<00:02:25.799> solid<00:02:26.310> type<00:02:26.489> of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
plus we're using solid type of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.699 
plus we're using solid type of
capacitors<00:02:27.180> okay<00:02:27.690> where<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.500> previous

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
capacitors okay where the previous

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.559 
capacitors okay where the previous
generation<00:02:29.310> you're<00:02:29.459> using<00:02:29.640> electrolytic

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
generation you're using electrolytic

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.240 
generation you're using electrolytic
capacitors<00:02:31.049> they<00:02:31.319> have<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> liquid<00:02:32.069> inside

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
capacitors they have a liquid inside

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.089 
capacitors they have a liquid inside
where<00:02:32.730> with<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.480> salt<00:02:33.720> capacitors<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:34.890> all

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
where with the salt capacitors it's all

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.190 
where with the salt capacitors it's all
solid<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.180> means<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.900> will<00:02:36.989> have

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
solid so that means that it will have

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.899 
solid so that means that it will have
higher<00:02:37.530> resistance<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.340> temperature<00:02:38.640> and

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
higher resistance to temperature and

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.300 
higher resistance to temperature and
noise<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.989> also<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.560> will<00:02:40.650> reduce<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.099> lot<00:02:41.250> of

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
noise and also it will reduce a lot of

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.039 
noise and also it will reduce a lot of
the<00:02:41.370> power<00:02:41.549> ripple<00:02:41.970> for<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.209> more<00:02:42.420> stable<00:02:42.870> and

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
the power ripple for a more stable and

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.780 
the power ripple for a more stable and
efficient<00:02:43.440> power<00:02:43.950> delivery<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.459> your<00:02:44.549> video

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
efficient power delivery to your video

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.610 
efficient power delivery to your video
card<00:02:45.000> okay<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.599> those<00:02:45.810> are<00:02:45.870> they're<00:02:46.260> solid

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
card okay so those are they're solid

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.380 
card okay so those are they're solid
aluminum<00:02:47.010> capacitors<00:02:47.549> that's<00:02:48.030> right<00:02:48.209> not

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
aluminum capacitors that's right not

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.119 
aluminum capacitors that's right not
mistake<00:02:48.690> okay<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.170> with<00:02:49.379> those<00:02:49.530> it'll<00:02:49.980> give

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
mistake okay so with those it'll give

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.000 
mistake okay so with those it'll give
you<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.700> 10<00:02:51.150> times<00:02:51.359> more<00:02:51.599> lifespan<00:02:52.470> from<00:02:52.829> a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
you up to 10 times more lifespan from a

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.309 
you up to 10 times more lifespan from a
traditional<00:02:53.609> right<00:02:53.910> investor<00:02:54.660> okay<00:02:55.109> so<00:02:55.170> you

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
traditional right investor okay so you

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.770 
traditional right investor okay so you
get<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.040> longevity<00:02:56.220> much<00:02:57.030> better<00:02:57.390> power

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
get like the longevity much better power

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.890 
get like the longevity much better power
usage<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.829> also<00:02:59.540> reliability<00:03:00.540> which<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.870> a

so<00:03:13.739> this<00:03:14.099> is<00:03:14.159> based<00:03:14.549> on<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> USB<00:03:15.060> feature<00:03:15.359> where

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
so this is based on a USB feature where

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.839 
so this is based on a USB feature where
only<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.230> Omega<00:03:16.470> n<00:03:16.739> machine<00:03:17.069> will<00:03:17.190> have<00:03:17.340> ok

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
only the Omega n machine will have ok

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.030 
only the Omega n machine will have ok
the<00:03:18.150> cars<00:03:18.419> to<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> USB<00:03:19.470> header<00:03:19.739> on<00:03:19.919> your

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
the cars to to a USB header on your

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.500 
the cars to to a USB header on your
motherboard<00:03:20.250> ok<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.060> you'll<00:03:21.239> run<00:03:21.450> the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
motherboard ok and you'll run the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.909 
motherboard ok and you'll run the
firestone<00:03:22.049> software<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.560> included<00:03:22.829> with

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
firestone software it's included with

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:23.930 
firestone software it's included with
our<00:03:23.069> video<00:03:23.310> cards<00:03:23.579> uh-huh

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
our video cards uh-huh

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.539 
our video cards uh-huh
it'll<00:03:24.239> give<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.690> with<00:03:24.959> OC<00:03:25.260> plus<00:03:25.500> access<00:03:26.370> to

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
it'll give you with OC plus access to

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.490 
it'll give you with OC plus access to
one<00:03:26.880> setting<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.049> software

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
one setting on the software

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.710 
one setting on the software
it's<00:03:28.739> called<00:03:29.069> gamer<00:03:29.340> mode<00:03:29.910> ok<00:03:30.180> once<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.599> have

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
it's called gamer mode ok once you have

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.240 
it's called gamer mode ok once you have
that<00:03:30.870> steady<00:03:31.109> you<00:03:31.379> can<00:03:31.410> adjust<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.950> voltage

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
that steady you can adjust the voltage

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.460 
that steady you can adjust the voltage
you<00:03:32.459> can<00:03:32.940> also<00:03:33.120> get<00:03:33.510> real-time<00:03:33.900> data<00:03:34.139> on<00:03:34.319> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
you can also get real-time data on the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.869 
you can also get real-time data on the
power<00:03:34.680> delivery<00:03:35.129> as<00:03:35.220> well<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:35.669> know<00:03:35.790> how

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
power delivery as well so you know how

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.949 
power delivery as well so you know how
much<00:03:35.970> power<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.299> actually<00:03:36.389> going<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.930> and

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
much power is actually going in and

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.629 
much power is actually going in and
however<00:03:37.260> your<00:03:37.470> video<00:03:37.680> guy<00:03:37.829> right<00:03:38.459> that

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
however your video guy right that

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.220 
however your video guy right that
instant<00:03:39.120> feedbacks<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.660> really<00:03:40.079> really

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
instant feedbacks is really really

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.349 
instant feedbacks is really really
valuable<00:03:40.440> for<00:03:40.949> a<00:03:40.980> lot<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.160> people<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.730> also

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
have a dual light situation where it was

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.289 
have a dual light situation where it was
running<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.859> low<00:04:02.010> power<00:04:02.250> mode<00:04:02.519> okay<00:04:03.030> will<00:04:03.180> be

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
running on low power mode okay will be

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.330 
running on low power mode okay will be
in<00:04:03.419> green<00:04:03.629> but<00:04:04.410> if<00:04:04.530> you're<00:04:04.680> running<00:04:04.799> more<00:04:05.069> in

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
in green but if you're running more in

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.740 
in green but if you're running more in
intensive<00:04:05.790> game<00:04:05.970> like<00:04:06.209> when<00:04:06.449> you're<00:04:06.569> gaming

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
intensive game like when you're gaming

intensive game like when you're gaming
it'll<00:04:07.139> run<00:04:07.319> in<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.620> red

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
it'll run in and red

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.010 
it'll run in and red
as<00:04:08.350> well<00:04:08.770> mm-hmm<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.450> we<00:04:10.450> also<00:04:10.600> introduced

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
as well mm-hmm and we also introduced

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.720 
as well mm-hmm and we also introduced
the<00:04:11.140> ability<00:04:11.200> where<00:04:11.800> with<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.310> fire<00:04:12.490> swim

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
the ability where with the fire swim

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.250 
the ability where with the fire swim
software<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.300> can<00:04:13.420> disable<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.930> lighting

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
software you can disable that lighting

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.320 
software you can disable that lighting
feature<00:04:14.410> if<00:04:14.740> it<00:04:14.950> if<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:15.730> keep<00:04:15.910> serious<00:04:16.239> it

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
feature if it if you keep serious it

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.350 
feature if it if you keep serious it
don't<00:04:16.480> like<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.780> okay<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:18.519> think<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.120> have

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
don't like it okay and I think you have

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.870 
don't like it okay and I think you have
a<00:04:19.530> demonstration<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:20.920> software<00:04:21.489> for<00:04:21.730> me

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
a demonstration of that software for me

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.670 
a demonstration of that software for me
right<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.420> we<00:04:22.570> brought<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.810> live<00:04:23.050> demo<00:04:23.290> system

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
right so we brought a live demo system

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.730 
right so we brought a live demo system
running<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.190> amp<00:04:24.340> extreme<00:04:24.670> right<00:04:25.090> now<00:04:25.330> it's

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
running the amp extreme right now it's

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.470 
running the amp extreme right now it's
breathing<00:04:26.740> yeah<00:04:27.160> green<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.790> then<00:04:27.880> render<00:04:28.180> 2d

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
breathing yeah green and then render 2d

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.020 
breathing yeah green and then render 2d
mode<00:04:28.690> where<00:04:29.080> it's<00:04:29.200> going<00:04:29.410> low<00:04:29.890> load<00:04:30.160> I'm<00:04:30.850> go

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
mode where it's going low load I'm go

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.550 
mode where it's going low load I'm go
ahead<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.300> run<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.630> firm<00:04:31.840> mock<00:04:32.020> software<00:04:32.470> to

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
ahead and run the firm mock software to

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.710 
ahead and run the firm mock software to
stress<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.950> video<00:04:33.160> card<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:34.120> immediately

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
stress the video card and immediately

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.210 
stress the video card and immediately
it's<00:04:34.990> going<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.290> turn<00:04:35.380> red<00:04:35.620> so<00:04:35.680> I'll<00:04:35.950> let<00:04:36.070> you

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
it's going to turn red so I'll let you

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.920 
it's going to turn red so I'll let you
know<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.640> it's<00:04:36.880> more<00:04:37.090> there's<00:04:37.510> more<00:04:37.570> power

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
know that it's more there's more power

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.090 
know that it's more there's more power
of<00:04:38.020> one<00:04:38.170> through<00:04:38.350> there<00:04:38.470> in<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.710> video<00:04:38.920> card

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
of one through there in the video card

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.560 
of one through there in the video card
it's<00:04:39.430> going<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.790> more<00:04:40.000> loads

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
it's going to more loads

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.660 
it's going to more loads
so<00:04:41.140> let's<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:41.770> know<00:04:41.950> and<00:04:42.160> other<00:04:42.280> people<00:04:42.370> know

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
so let's you know and other people know

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.190 
so let's you know and other people know
that<00:04:42.820> when<00:04:42.970> you're<00:04:43.120> looking<00:04:43.420> at<00:04:43.510> your<00:04:43.690> system

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
that when you're looking at your system
