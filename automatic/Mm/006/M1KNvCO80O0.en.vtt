00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.500 
so I was recently asked by this person
to<00:00:11.280> do<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.700> Raspberry<00:00:12.510> Pi<00:00:13.549> video<00:00:14.549> see<00:00:15.240> if<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.360> can

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
to do a Raspberry Pi video see if I can

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.519 
to do a Raspberry Pi video see if I can
focusing<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.110> the<00:00:16.199> Raspberry<00:00:16.680> Pi<00:00:16.740> logo<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:18.529> so

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
focusing on the Raspberry Pi logo and so

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.189 
focusing on the Raspberry Pi logo and so
here<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.460> now<00:00:20.820> they<00:00:21.510> want<00:00:21.690> an<00:00:21.779> operating

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and so what the software looks like

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.380 
and so what the software looks like
after<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.899> downloaded<00:01:19.259> pop<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.189> SD<00:01:20.939> card<00:01:20.969> it

going to plop it into my fast berry pie
hardware<00:01:51.479> we're<00:01:51.840> gonna<00:01:51.959> plug<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.380> our

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
hardware we're gonna plug in our

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.760 
hardware we're gonna plug in our
Raspberry<00:01:53.280> Pi<00:01:53.429> for<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> first<00:01:54.389> time<00:01:54.770> there's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
Raspberry Pi for the first time there's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.899 
Raspberry Pi for the first time there's
the<00:01:56.039> power<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:58.590> should<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.859> booting<00:01:59.310> on

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the power and it should be booting on

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.929 
the power and it should be booting on
our<00:02:00.149> screen<00:02:01.340> perfect<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> am<00:02:05.549> using<00:02:05.579> the

our screen perfect so I am using the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.990 
our screen perfect so I am using the
hdmi<00:02:06.389> cable<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:08.929> there<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.050> booting<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
hdmi cable and there it's booting and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.760 
hdmi cable and there it's booting and
it's<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> request<00:02:12.900> updates<00:02:13.440> over<00:02:13.680> the
