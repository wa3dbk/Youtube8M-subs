00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.360
 here we are in detroit weapon game 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.310
 We are going to deliver here safely 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.869
 payment or was this game I was 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.490
 playing with flow first I put in 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.499
 situation and I wanted to tell you one thing 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.299
 very important, so they will be very 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.889
 attentive because it is important what 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.020
 I have to say and well, it's a 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.480
 game that I played like that random and I was 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.920
 recording flow and bng to the center and such and 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.490
 then I was recording and all the 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.490
 story and the truth is that I'm not going to 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.190
 overtake but death at the end is 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.249
 that is amazing I liked it very much 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.140
 he left it there after we are attentive to 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:39.199
 the game and well I'll tell you 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.670
 the important thing and I wanted to tell you 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.069
 it's worth the important thing that I wanted you 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.050
 To say is that well, I've already been seeing 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:46.519
 Well since we are no 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.949
 living in castellón you already know that 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.229
 we were no longer blond or frank nor 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.999
 tower I had living in Castellón that 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.519
 I imagine you already know and then 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.039
 Well, some things have happened 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.229
 not that there have been hoaxes and stories of 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.989
 Well, well, I was very bad 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.270
 everything is so good that we had 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.490
 removed the matter is the end of a series 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.100
 of things there that people can 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.649
 and well, in a way, some 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.420
 they are true and others are lies I am not going to 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.250
 go into details for nothing or not 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.799
 I will go into details but if what 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.009
 I wanted to tell you something easy and simple 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:26.750
 that is, the fault is neither a tweet nor is it 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:29.030
 of a video or anything like that is worth or 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.369
 it is neither the fault is mine nor is it from robinho 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.520
 neither is frank or basically because 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.979
 We were there living together and for the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.450
 reason that is or really is not 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.549
 I'm going to make another video about this 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.539
 nor am I going to tell more things simply 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:47.179
 because for whatever reason it was decided if 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.950
 each one felt by his side that is me 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.750
 Obviously, he keeps talking and 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.119
 playing with frank and such but with a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.789
 ball not for the reason that it is worth but 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:01.069
 I think it 's the best honestly be 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.289
 this does not hate him or have him there is a 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.049
 tremendous theory and such but good 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.310
 basically that's what everyone has thrown 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.459
 by his side 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.830
 and that's it or there is no more or is not 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.860
 look for more because he or can you 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.140
 see it twitters you can see comments on 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.569
 videos on your channel I imagine in mine 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.150
 in others you know that for example I have seen 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.769
 today in a video fagan a career 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.500
 that has gone up that has a tad of 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.519
 time and bone you can do the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.250
 speculations that you want but 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.860
 really, there is nothing, I won 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.019
 least we will not say anything of what has 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.940
 gone because it has not been a thing either 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.850
 serious or anything like that simply 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.970
 because each one has gone by his side and already 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.640
 that is, there is nothing true 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.780
 nothing nothing 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.150
 that then well then basically 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.069
 that's what I had to tell you that it was 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.830
 very important because I saw that good 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.870
 Well, I had said some, but it's not 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.780
 They were already angry there, not because 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.940
 if it was messy not because it was such a 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.920
 because he put a tweet and there are banks what 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.080
 who put a tweet that he was angry 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.310
 that day and such and the truth that then what 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.430
 better I should not have put of that 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.080
 tweet but not for nothing or for 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.390
 you neither for anything but for myself 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.820
 it's because those things like I do not know 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.190
 they do and I do not like doing things wrong 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.290
 or that I try badly then put 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.709
 things like that or the best is always 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.019
 speak it not like normal people or not 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.209
 shut up thinking or doing things 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.810
 that they are but good because that is wrong the 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:40.550
 true not then then basically it is 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.260
 that and that 's it or that is no no no really 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.760
 there is nothing else but that each one 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.760
 he has thrown his way 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.220
 2 do not really look for it or not 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.620
 bother to search then you see the 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.420
 comments that you put and all the things 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.550
 what are you going to put and I guess that 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.260
 well, many of you, well, in 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.340
 some way maybe you do not know what 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.150
 it's happened but maybe you can 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:10.220
 understand but it's really that healthy that 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:13.070
 is already finished no no we do not take what 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.760
 we recorded together or anything like that and 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.370
 It is done 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.200
 I am speaking for myself in this I want that 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.519
 be super clear, I'm talking 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.470
 for me obviously I'm not talking 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.360
 neither by frank nor even by 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.400
 what you do not know what I'm talking about 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.650
 just for me so you do not get out 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.570
 conclusions then then to what 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.460
 better the frank maybe not no no no no 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.300
 no no or be sure because over 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.150
 It is not like this 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.430
 and good in each one is each one 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.750
 It's worth kids so nothing basically 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.150
 was that has a very important thing 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.880
 I saw a lot of comments by 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.520
 there good people and every time this is 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.560
 like everything or at first it seems 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.760
 that if you count more or less what you have 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.680
 past 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.360
 or in quotes what has happened or what 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.520
 that can think and then already 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.350
 start to make a ball a ball and a 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.750
 football there is a ball and you say but good 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.340
 we're going to see that those lunge dips 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.710
 savage out there that puts people 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.889
 who obviously invent it because 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.810
 really or this is how everything is 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.449
 you can say when you really 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:16.430
 you know the story or have you been there 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.090
 even notice even knowing my 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.279
 words 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.080
 imagine what could happen what 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.560
 be and then let him say something robinho and 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.370
 such 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.539
 or is obviously be two versions 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.409
 different 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:32.060
 or really he who does not know is therefore 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.370
 who has been there or ourselves 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.909
 even where well then 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.439
 basically that's it and nothing because it's already 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:43.879
 each one by his side and really that 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:46.520
 not much better because it could be 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:49.669
 much worse is not that either, but 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.150
 Well, everyone has decided that and already 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.770
 is 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.870
 it's worth kids, so do not give it more 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.860
 Really, I 'm really happy 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.650
 tell me how good that fuck 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.689
 re- record with rubinho and all that or 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.210
 be he end like me the truth that the 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.810
 aluminum what to say has been 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.210
 recording with me a lot of time 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.760
 sincerely, it's good and well 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.550
 I spent many things together 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.620
 trips we have lived together and such and such 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.360
 a tremendous experience and really not 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.760
 I repent for nothing or for nothing 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.310
 I really tell you the only thing that's good 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.500
 because each one is going to go by his side and such 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.510
 and that 's it, or you have to give it more 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.010
 turns of the sheet obviously neither 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.140
 take out the world or anything I imagine that what 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.810
 you will ask for knowing it because 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.360
 you are used to it and not already 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.480
 No, well, ladies, I had to tell you 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.440
 say that and well then nothing is changing 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.550
 a little subject 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.270
 you have already seen that I am in the final 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.420
 I'm in the last phase threw it by strip 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.180
 of kids and it was stuck or I was left 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.090
 that is to say pc with game from which one 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.460
 also we were in call by 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.470
 what set or be the opportunity tir 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.020
 because I had seen two out there and it gives the 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.940
 chance and exalts one happens and the 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.890
 hit or is the truth that was a very 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.830
 good ending and dance is worth that trick os 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:11.400
 I liked a greeting and you know until 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.400
 then chao
