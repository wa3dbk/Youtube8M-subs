00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.339
 I repeat the Lord 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.429
 we started the game well among other areas 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.089

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.469
 working with Brazil being talked about about their positions at 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:34.890
 respect 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.810
 study of the structures of the contemporary world of order or conjuncture 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 plaice 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.070
 no company 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.330

 the translation for you that is in trouble 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 the same problem 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 the construction company 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 I want to know if our interviewee 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.550
 we are growing 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.310
 is translate from 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.310
 Taking Portuguese is not yet the wing. 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 If you have to discuss the tournament 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.300
 among them passable 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.300
 keep going 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.150
 foot the first 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.900
 I believe it's true. 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.749
 the relationship 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.589
 Forgot your password? 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.839
 after the visit of the president of pmdb jader 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.069
 not only improve a lot 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.369
 by the agreements had two signed today 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:25.719
 but everything and everything by prospect of entrance of klose the minister of science 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.459
 and agriculture technology 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.459
 every industry and trade and of mines and energy 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.999
 coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.959
 we can do work until our visit 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.109
 to iran 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.589
 ah 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.589
 possibly in April the name of May 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.269
 are two large nations a nation with 80 million inhabitants high 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.150
 hidden steel 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.539
 190 million people with the power of development 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.259
 with similarity in the development model 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.119
 and we need to explore this 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:07.389
 loop like many like practitioner hence why 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.139
 my optimism 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.539
 visit the relations 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:16.779
 I retired Brazil could improve it if I registered and the mind 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.249
 already at the beginning of April 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:24.649
 the minister miguel jorge and the industry and trade iraci make a visit in 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:27.649
 loco a delegation of Brazilian businessmen 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.209
 plus 7 billion and the month of April 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.949
 I hope the technicians of our ministry on your site 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.499
 can i get visits from iran 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.719
 He will anticipate Iran. 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.019
 so that we can set a more daring goal 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.169
 commercial balance notebooks 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.539
 so I'm very optimistic 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.699
 the correlation to perspective 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.699
 already for the future I have 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.439
 two certainties 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.519
 took 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.519
 the colloquial my last year in office 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.379
 is that after the world economic crisis 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.379
 certainly the world economic order 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:18.349
 will not be too much of it in the face of the crisis 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.819
 for a simple reason 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:24.499
 there are already many people believing that the market alone 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.349
 will not solve the problem 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:28.500
 hence society 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.879
 This will lead us to the program. 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.599
 countries and therefore 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:38.120
 necessary that the state has an important role on one side of it inductor 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.409
 on the other side of it tests carried out the flying apoel 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.039
 especially of your forearm 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.119
 according to the world gave work for the construction of peace 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.789
 I firmly believe 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.189
 from us 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.210
 we can have the world of paetÃª 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.009
 why the idea does not lead to development does not lead the southern program 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.009
 does not lead to an improvement in people's quality of life 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.339
 therefore 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:13.059
 tel belonging to peace in the Middle East defend 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.509
 is a Palestinian state must be from the state of Israel leaving 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.289
 or this 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:19.999
 everybody can live 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:22.099
 and harmony 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.099
 the contemporary world needs a lot of dishes 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.170
 human action a 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.219
 a position in Brazil 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.509
 and that's exactly why we have 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.900
 perceived over the last 15 years 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.699
 the need for change 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.520
 of the united nations with the prostitute reform in the security council 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.400
 as a permanent member to be here all the different continents not 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.629
 represented 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.469
 in the security council 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.400
 and for decisions to be taken 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.729
 based 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.159
 in a contemporary reality 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.919
 and not taken in reality from a political world of 1948 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.240
 therefore 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.580
 if the Iranian journalist wants 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.330
 cam from brazil 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.490
 the image of the most optimistic president in the world 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.740
 can lead to bin majid enjoy 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.699
 actions spawned 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.080
 to believe 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.729
 with great optimism 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.720
 if we are going to build a much more just world 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.710
 the next years
