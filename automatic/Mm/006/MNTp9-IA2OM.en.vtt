00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.915
Honeycrisp!

00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:01.680
Gala!

00:00:01.724 --> 00:00:02.560
Junami!

00:00:02.613 --> 00:00:04.560
Who knew there were so many types of apples?!

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.040
Bismarck!

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.742
PiÃ±ata!

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:06.417
Matsu!

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:07.928
What your favorite type of apple?

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:08.471
Empire!

00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:09.342
Granny Smith!

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:10.302
Ginger Golden!

00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:12.115
Mine is the Pink Lady!

00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:19.217
Hey guys!

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:21.368
Ray Pajar from Get Crafty Crafty!!

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:23.493
And today I'm going to show you guys

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.044
how to make

00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:25.902
flower apple blossom tarts!

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:27.697
Using a few simple ingredients 

00:00:27.724 --> 00:00:28.951
we're going to turn an apple

00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:31.386
into something that looks like a rose

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.380
and is actually a really tasty treat!

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:34.800
Let's go ahead and get started 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.800
with todays project!

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:37.982
The items that you'll need

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:39.600
 for todays project include:

00:00:39.742 --> 00:00:40.880
a small mixing bowl,

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:41.760
rolling pin,

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:42.720
parchment paper,

00:00:42.773 --> 00:00:44.168
access to an oven,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.306
a muffin tray,

00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:46.737
1 puff pastry sheet,

00:00:46.782 --> 00:00:48.515
I found this at the frozen section 

00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:49.520
of the grocery market,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.284
cinnamon, 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.768
any type of fruit preserve, 

00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:53.306
today we're using apricot,

00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:54.604
1-2 apples,

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:56.453
depending on the size of your apple

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:58.088
I suggest either using

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.524
a Gala apple or a Delicious Red apple,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.715
and some flour

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:02.951
for dusting your surface.

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:04.444
Before starting this project

00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:05.955
make sure your surface,

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:07.440
your cutting board and your hands

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.471
are thoroughly cleaned. 

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:09.937
After washing your apple

00:01:10.142 --> 00:01:11.955
carefully cut it in half

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:14.417
and then decore your apple.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.893
You want to make sure the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.244
core of your apple

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.248
has been taken off

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:19.911
before you start slicing your apple.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:21.591
After you've decore your apple

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.235
you want to carefully slice it

00:01:23.306 --> 00:01:25.306
from the top to the bottom of your apple.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:27.911
You want to have really thin slices

00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:30.604
So that when you put them into your puff pastry

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.840
they'll be able to be folded. 

00:01:31.893 --> 00:01:33.235
Make sure your apple slices

00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:35.377
are cut evenly an thin.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.370
Depending on the size of your apple

00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:39.511
you might need to use 1-2 apples.

00:01:39.564 --> 00:01:41.146
To keep your apples from browning 

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:42.675
place them in a small bowl,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.408
add some water,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.666
and the juice of half a lemon,

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.800
and this will prevent them from turning brown.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.320
Continue to cut your apples.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.835
You want to have 40 to 50 slices. 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.830
After you've sliced all of your apples

00:01:55.022 --> 00:01:57.102
you want to place them in the microwave,

00:01:57.155 --> 00:01:58.088
in the water,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.662
for about 3 minutes. 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.777
This will allow your apples to tenderize

00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:02.915
so they wont snap

00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.048
when you fold them into your apple rose.

00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:07.040
After 3 minutes in the microwave

00:02:07.102 --> 00:02:09.928
your apples will be ready for the puff pastries.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:11.840
Be very careful when you're taking it out

00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:13.840
since the water will be very hot!

00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:15.751
Your apples should be flexible enough 

00:02:15.777 --> 00:02:16.826
so when you fold them in

00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:17.520
they wont snap.

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:18.924
Set your apples aside 

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:20.920
so that you can prep your parchment paper.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.408
Cut out 6 rectangular pieces of parchment paper.

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:25.902
And then from the corner

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:27.528
to the center of your paper

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:29.520
your going to cut a few inches into it

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.520
but not all the way.

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:33.520
Just so that your parchment paper

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.097
will be able to fold into your muffin tray.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.346
Do this to 6 of your pieces.

00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:39.555
Take your fruit preserves 

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:40.515
and mix in

00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.510
about 4 tablespoons of fruit preserve

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:44.160
to one tablespoon of water.

00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:45.875
You want to mix it in together

00:02:45.902 --> 00:02:47.982
until its a liquidly consistency. 

00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:49.893
Set all your ingredients aside

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:51.626
so that we can start working with

00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:52.533
our puff pastry. 

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:54.293
You want to have all your ingredients 

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:55.226
ready to go,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.220
so when we cut out pastry

00:02:57.253 --> 00:02:59.220
they'll be ready to put into the muffin tray.

00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:01.220
Make sure your surface is clean

00:03:01.351 --> 00:03:03.220
and add a light sprinkle 

00:03:03.288 --> 00:03:04.062
of flour.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.213
Carefully take your puff pastry

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:07.422
and unroll it

00:03:07.457 --> 00:03:08.622
onto the flour.

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.026
Add a small amount of flour

00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:11.893
to the top of your puff pastry

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:13.493
and then carefully

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:14.746
cut it into thirds.

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:16.062
Set 2 pieces

00:03:16.088 --> 00:03:17.795
of your puff pastry aside.

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.262
Using your rolling pin

00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:20.862
You want to gently roll out 

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:22.213
your puff pastry

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.893
so that it expands

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.262
to about 3 inches.

00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:27.617
Once it's expanded

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:29.226
you're going to take your knife

00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:30.684
and your going to cut it

00:03:30.808 --> 00:03:32.053
down the middle

00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:34.050
so that you have 2 strips.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.248
Repeat this to all the other pieces.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.035
Once you've rolled out and cut

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.493
all of your puff pastry

00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:41.120
it's ready to assemble!

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:43.324
Take your fruit preserve 

00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:45.946
and add a small amount 

00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:46.906
down the center

00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:48.622
of your puff pastry

00:03:48.684 --> 00:03:50.620
and then take your apple slices

00:03:50.782 --> 00:03:52.275
and carefully

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.995
overlay them on top of your puff pastry.

00:03:55.262 --> 00:03:56.693
You want to have them stick out

00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:58.480
of your puff pastry by

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.893
about half an inch

00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:01.890
and you want to put about

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:04.293
8 to 9 pieces of apple

00:04:04.364 --> 00:04:05.555
overlaying each other

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:06.568
from side to side.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.560
Once you've laid out all your apples

00:04:08.702 --> 00:04:11.075
gently fold the other half

00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:13.070
of your puff pastry over your apples

00:04:13.102 --> 00:04:15.013
and then starting from one side

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:17.324
carefully roll your apples

00:04:17.475 --> 00:04:19.013
and your puff pastry

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:21.010
so that it creates your rose.

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:23.271
You want to do this very slowly

00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:24.791
and carefully

00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:26.915
so that your apple won't snap

00:04:27.342 --> 00:04:30.231
and everything stays in place.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.800
Once you have that

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.226
you'll have your apple rose.

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:38.168
As an optional step

00:04:38.284 --> 00:04:40.195
you can place some cinnamon either on the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.448
inside or on the outside

00:04:41.466 --> 00:04:42.684
of your apple rose

00:04:43.928 --> 00:04:45.582
and then once you have that

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.333
place it in the center

00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:48.755
of your parchment paper

00:04:49.617 --> 00:04:51.093
and then place it

00:04:51.377 --> 00:04:53.090
inside your muffin tray.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.048
Repeat this until you've made

00:04:59.084 --> 00:05:01.040
all 6 of your apple roses.

00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:04.160
Place this inside a 375 degree oven

00:05:04.311 --> 00:05:06.284
for 40 to 45 minutes

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:08.160
or until the puff pastry

00:05:08.213 --> 00:05:09.137
is golden brown.

00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:11.128
for the last 10 minutes of the cooking period

00:05:11.182 --> 00:05:13.448
you want to pay attention to your roses

00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:16.071
because if your oven is too hot

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.466
the apples might burn.

00:05:17.697 --> 00:05:19.848
If you notice they start to burn

00:05:19.893 --> 00:05:21.600
place in on a lower interval 

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:23.368
or bring it down to 350.

00:05:23.484 --> 00:05:25.155
go ahead and place this into your oven.

00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:27.777
After baking for 40 to 45 minutes

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:29.013
you want to give them  

00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:30.764
about 5 to 10 minutes to cool

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:33.128
before you take them out of the muffin tray

00:05:33.253 --> 00:05:35.777
and remove the parchment paper

00:05:35.893 --> 00:05:37.351
from your apple rose.

00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:38.622
After you've removed them

00:05:38.684 --> 00:05:39.911
from the parchment paper

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:41.591
you can individually plate them

00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:44.071
and add a little bit of powered sugar

00:05:44.106 --> 00:05:45.982
just to make it a little more special.

00:05:46.204 --> 00:05:47.626
After you guys have added

00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:48.355
powdered sugar 

00:05:48.408 --> 00:05:49.511
or just decided to just 

00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:50.328
skip that step

00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:52.817
you're ready to eat you apple blossom.

00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:55.057
It taste just like an apple pie

00:05:55.102 --> 00:05:56.186
and if you want to

00:05:56.204 --> 00:05:57.831
you can serve it with a side of

00:05:57.866 --> 00:05:58.808
side of ice cream.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.124
This is a fun

00:06:00.168 --> 00:06:01.475
and really tasty

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.470
pretty special treat.

00:06:03.502 --> 00:06:05.470
And I found this on pinterest 

00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:07.671
Super excited to actually try it out

00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:08.373
and eat it!

00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:10.657
Hopefully you guys make this project

00:06:10.693 --> 00:06:11.822
and if you do

00:06:11.857 --> 00:06:13.040
make sure you share it with me

00:06:13.084 --> 00:06:13.537
either on my

00:06:13.591 --> 00:06:15.297
facebook, instagram or twitter

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.511
using the #GetCraftyCrafty hashtag

00:06:17.617 --> 00:06:19.573
and check out our last two videos:

00:06:19.608 --> 00:06:20.746
out Lady Rainicorn

00:06:20.782 --> 00:06:22.444
inspired unicorn horn,

00:06:22.577 --> 00:06:24.346
and our paracord bracelet
