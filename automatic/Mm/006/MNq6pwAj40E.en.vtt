crazy<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.830> definitely<00:02:08.250> got<00:02:08.549> the<00:02:08.610> black<00:02:08.789> one

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
crazy but I definitely got the black one

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.959 
crazy but I definitely got the black one
because<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.349> always<00:02:10.679> always<00:02:11.430> wear<00:02:11.939> black

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
because I always always wear black

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.449 
because I always always wear black
eyeliners<00:02:12.659> so<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.019> thought<00:02:13.409> I<00:02:13.650> start<00:02:14.249> with<00:02:14.310> this

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
eyeliners so I thought I start with this

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.580 
eyeliners so I thought I start with this
one<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.849> could<00:02:15.029> always<00:02:15.359> order<00:02:15.389> ones<00:02:15.840> online

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
one and I could always order ones online

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.710 
one and I could always order ones online
but<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.489> either<00:02:18.950> number<00:02:19.950> one<00:02:20.160> or<00:02:20.220> 0<00:02:21.120> l<00:02:21.450> I'm

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
but this is either number one or 0 l I'm

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.900 
but this is either number one or 0 l I'm
not<00:02:21.900> sure<00:02:22.170> how<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.099> color<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.819> just
