00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.640
 hello to everyone then 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.100
 today I will explain 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.679
 how to make a bow tie in 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.620
 origami so for that you need not 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.370
 delay a perfect square 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:20.630
 you will come and bend the first 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:25.510
 diagonal and the second diagonal of the 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.510
 square so that's it 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.930
 so that's okay the second one has 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.870
 folded you will come flap one of 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.480
 spikes of yours that they stop from me 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.129
 you seem to be careful of 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.920
 well put the tip in the center mir 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.579
 to pay here is to make fault with their 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:00.489
 side take the opposite tip so that 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 which is opposite nickel after we say to 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:09.670
 take the edges back to the folded 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.530
 like sexy always compared to a 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.530
 diagonals of canada 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.360
 nickel so once here you go 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.610
 come looting in relation to the middle as 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.300
 if so to coffee all the folds towards 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.840
 the interior of which is well to force 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.290
 on the fold lines because it's origami 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.540
 has many layers of paper 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.350
 is what makes folding the paper 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.630
 quite difficult for this organism 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.410
 so we just fold all the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.410
 layers of paper like this so a 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:02.630
 times here in the future folded this side 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.320
 in the center so in the trend of 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.679
 socket here is the better wood there so 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.280
 we do not come to the dead center well the 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:21.530
 fold line did exactly the same 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:27.860
 thing in front to mark another 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:32.120
 several voices Monday she so a 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.230
 times the marked trio we open we unfold 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.030
 we open so read this inward 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.630
 so we just loot their inside if 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.480
 you have some of my good and like 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.430
 this pose is therefore complicate their 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:59.470
 inside here one she sees there a 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.470
 side of those guys do the other side 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:13.050
 we open a map inside here 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:17.640
 michael you give us site forms 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.270
 geometric there perfect so after we 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.730
 just bend here to the outside so we 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.360
 comes we say and I felt that when 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.800
 you slip the sheet that comes block 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.920
 so once it comes to block we 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.960
 stop and we mark the safest line 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:41.670
 so we return exactly the same 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:43.920
 thing to fart here but it's to do 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.709
 coincide the two figures the most 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.490
 possible what will render you a rendering 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.280
 final cleanest possible so here 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.540
 the hardest the bend because for 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.900
 come flip this side down in the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.720
 center and it's quite difficult who 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.930
 had a lot of layers of paper on 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.420
 will not speak towards the center we will fold those 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.670
 towards the center we do the same thing for 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.930
 the other four 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.180
 for the other two now on one side 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.609
 exactly the same thing 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.609
 the other side we flap in the center 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:35.020
 you can not smell it but here a 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:40.639
 sacred layer of butterflies so here we go 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:43.460
 once the last plaice g you need 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.550
 simply open it not for 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.990
 do not open on or towards the pretty side so 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.240
 the side that has no figure 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.639
 and as we open we realize that there is 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.560
 a little tip here who are we going 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.690
 have to turn into squares to make 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.440
 of our best not pay so you 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.090
 go shoot push that had grown 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.950
 so that it makes you a square 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.020
 so we shoot we shoot we shoot at our 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.680
 clients gently here we push him 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.030
 in the center we shoot at newsstands 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.169
 until then to have incarnated in the 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.450
 center like these nickel that you 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.970
 gives an origami bow tie 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:26.020
 I hope my life will not please you 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.020
 tell you very soon hi
