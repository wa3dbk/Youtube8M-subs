00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 again demanded and sometimes 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.029
 Paul or Pleasure July will ultimately contribute heavily 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.749
 yes, I've already planned to do that already 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.080
 but then I have one 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.069
 that by the way solved the world 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:33.420
 Peterburg was of course all the way and I had Dix overtime now 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.780
 I'm a new one that is here is the world 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.870
 around 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.420
 I have not built too much yet, but what I built so far 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.680
 I'll show you that now quite simply times you see the consequences 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.440
 here probably all this has been built with aisles 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.210
 So it will be there who comes as a second break and Ufuk 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.870
 to Shoot 'em only the people played the arcane 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.140
 Here's my little modest cabin at the Bachelor's 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.260
 trip 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.760
 and then dares Werkbank and Hama but then separate e 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.220
 so 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.870
 but then here 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.720
 Möhle to be heard and because second house and 2 shoe I only briefly saw her 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.180
 the entrance to the cave so it's nothing special I got you all over 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.430
 expanded so that you have access here 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.960
 And then it is just the height shows you which funding go right 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.649
 great 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.170
 I have not yet completely explored them 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.630
 I do not have a recession and a diamond in this game, either 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.660
 found 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.590
 Of course, earlier in my old game, order books already resembled the world 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.150
 then prefer to keep shoes to Toom Targets to check 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.930
 The Ticino we will see the same as the second house here 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.750
 there are also 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.550
 Euros 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.369
 trip 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.810
 and here it goes in the tower rows 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.160
 he still looks very empty from the inside so far I have so far 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.800
 yes, just built high 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.370
 before I call it that, too 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.760
 Here's how to create and change, I've met a bit down here 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.460
 I just built a tree 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.460
 then eavesdropped and then again so close 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.149
 in the party action 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:12.409
 yes say fast 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.519
 should arouse the US every already these things rowing trees grow trend 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.319
 around 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.480
 And yes, so far 2 shoe looks so that's just such a huge one 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.010
 tour 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.360
 for the people who do not know what to Shoot is 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.830
 2 shoe is a huge tree from Hakan Japan fix here a roleplayer himself 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.149
 also tells about it 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.059
 Unia taz here is just my action right next to trans- and watches 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:37.549
 Dr 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.579
 the wooden built to mix the budget policy Offense dealership Pokemon 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:42.629
 Meinert 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.649
 Percent of those who are outside the house so at stake 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.789
 but well no idea I compare them quite well at night 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.399
 So-so 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:56.669
 I'll show you one thing I'll show you and Barnetta 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.639
 will land but 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.639
 there must have been here now 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.329
 here is my small modest hut and so that it again the Belsch one 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.040
 Third of this Ulrich small describe goals 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.339
 bed for all the stuff 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.439
 Percent Still Nature and a York Workbench 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.169
 and here in Bulle is already culinary 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.589
 was offered a Dieter Teicher spot showing weakness now 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.519
 if I've built exactly there Koelbl had built over 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.649
 keep it up 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:50.649
 When I made her son move and off - and Kleinert Holman met full per year in part 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:51.199
 still 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.669
 I still have smaller ones 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.109
 Bardot again 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.549
 Thing just built here from the top can still look nice in glass but 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.669
 I'll show city from below now as we from below will 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.819
 really cool 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.219
 and to that 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.730
 Just jump for us 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.609
 there around Roman Küper 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.199
 this should happen 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.169
 besides, I still managed to escape power 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.039
 yes you can still see here or I know Herbert Quandt pulls in the video here 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.090
 but here SoFFin of unnecessary 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.240
 the goods Latif small did they do it as a first team I'm not quite 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.260
 arrived down there than believes Alsmann it does not take more 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.560
 So a thing once built my old world but said the city 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.240
 wanted what you see 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.919
 Utah Jazz 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.300
 if I have degrees so where 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.539
 and hit this beautiful land walls 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.620
 and these then I have one in the 2 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.770
 Dana surely not what I am that she will be with Aurich 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.189
 and he was already everything I built here in this world but where is 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.729
 this kvitova 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.960
 Best we sleep them ourselves 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.960
 but it is true I had heard, I know exactly 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.159
 So the abebben 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.819
 and threw so many years already with this network as I said I've got in 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.689
 This world has not built too much 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.839
 as soon as I re-id number means full tours 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:12.050
 2 shooting star from hidden and behind you can see 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.029
 around fires of the station wagon 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.029
 Armin Pikl I can show one thing for a moment 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.550
 it was here but it is now nothing worth seeing to actually drawing 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.550
 planted at the end of the Licher Michel Giant forest 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:39.589
 Percent just fail 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.550
 and want to take with them for the children 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.900
 RWE can get you forever around anywhere forest return 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.400
 everything full of trees and cows of course the Simon Wiesenthal 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.990
 are 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.199
 But it should have been about sales as well 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.279
 this last rose at Spremberg has built new and this with 2 Schufa me 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.680
 I'm with my goal but was with him 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.809
 which make a video again 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:04.889
 around 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:05.719
 Euro 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:06.999
 clear by then
