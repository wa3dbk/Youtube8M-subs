00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
itself to crazy gameplay which I really

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.319

enjoyed<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.219> called<00:00:32.489> quarantine<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.239> I

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
enjoyed so it's called quarantine and I

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.549 
enjoyed so it's called quarantine and I
think<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.050> don't<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.350> there<00:00:34.500> was

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
think it's I don't know if there was

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.830 
think it's I don't know if there was
some<00:00:34.739> kind<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.100> outbreak<00:00:35.520> or<00:00:36.360> things

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
some kind of outbreak or things

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.709 
some kind of outbreak or things
something<00:00:37.739> bad<00:00:38.040> happened<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.969> no<00:00:39.210> idea

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.299 
something bad happened I have no idea

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
there was some kind of outbreak of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.299 
there was some kind of outbreak of
something<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> basically<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.200> map<00:00:43.469> goes

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
something and basically the map goes

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
something and basically the map goes
into<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.300> crazy

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
into like this crazy

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.869 
into like this crazy
I<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.710> know<00:00:46.770> time<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.370> don't<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> lady

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
I don't know time I don't know the lady

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.430 
I don't know time I don't know the lady
will<00:00:48.210> come<00:00:48.360> over<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> speaker<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.260> she's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
will come over the speaker and she's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.229 
will come over the speaker and she's
like<00:00:49.649> middle<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.489> math<00:00:50.610> about<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.059> disappear

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
like middle of math about to disappear

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.540 
like middle of math about to disappear
basically<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:52.680> happens<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
basically and so that's what happens the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.880 
basically and so that's what happens the
the<00:00:54.149> tree<00:00:54.480> swing<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> middle<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> map

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the tree swing in the middle of the map

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.290 
the tree swing in the middle of the map
has<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> floor<00:00:56.670> around<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.210> beginning

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
has a floor around it at the beginning

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.869 
has a floor around it at the beginning
but<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.870> once<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.320> event<00:00:58.859> happens<00:00:59.370> it's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
but then once this event happens it's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.520 
but then once this event happens it's
kind<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.390> there's<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> hole<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.050> with

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
kind of like there's a hole there with

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.959 
kind of like there's a hole there with
only<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.980> tree<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> middle<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> can

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
only the tree in the middle so you can

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.399 
only the tree in the middle so you can
fall<00:01:03.239> down<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.660> middle<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:03.989> yeah<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
fall down in the middle which yeah it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.660 
fall down in the middle which yeah it
actually<00:01:04.589> made<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> pretty<00:01:05.159> funny<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:05.610> we

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
actually made it pretty funny when we

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually made it pretty funny when we
were<00:01:05.790> playing<00:01:06.030> uplink<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.020> middle

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
were playing uplink because the middle

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.810 
were playing uplink because the middle
is<00:01:07.350> obviously<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.950> uplink<00:01:08.400> drone<00:01:08.670> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
is obviously where the uplink drone is

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820 
is obviously where the uplink drone is
so<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.869> there<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
so you have to go in there and you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.950 
so you have to go in there and you
sometimes<00:01:11.070> fall<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.640> definitely<00:01:12.360> fell<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.810> mean

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
sometimes fall I definitely fell I mean

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
I really like this map I could see it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.929 
I really like this map I could see it
being<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> favorites<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> pack

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
being one of the favorites in the pack

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.730 
being one of the favorites in the pack
for<00:01:50.939> shirt<00:01:51.329> also<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.079> map<00:01:52.259> there<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.710> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
for shirt also on this map there is I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.100 
for shirt also on this map there is I
think<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.460> map<00:01:53.729> specific<00:01:54.390> scorestreak<00:01:54.990> I

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
think a map specific scorestreak I

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
think a map specific scorestreak I
wasn't<00:01:55.470> able<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.710> capture<00:01:56.040> gameplay<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
wasn't able to capture gameplay of it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.969 
wasn't able to capture gameplay of it
but<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> care<00:01:58.500> package

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
but I think it's one of the care package

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.730 
but I think it's one of the care package
ones<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> map<00:02:00.840> based<00:02:01.020> scorestreak

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
ones it's a it's a map based scorestreak

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.649 
ones it's a it's a map based scorestreak
that<00:02:02.009> basically<00:02:02.490> has<00:02:03.000> ship<00:02:03.360> fired<00:02:03.689> missiles

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
that basically has ship fired missiles

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.240 
that basically has ship fired missiles
like<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.810> ship<00:02:05.079> fired<00:02:05.290> missile<00:02:05.740> strike<00:02:05.979> which

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
like a ship fired missile strike which

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.999 
like a ship fired missile strike which
actually<00:02:06.759> sounds<00:02:07.149> pretty<00:02:07.270> crazy<00:02:08.200> which<00:02:08.860> would

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
actually sounds pretty crazy which would

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.499 
actually sounds pretty crazy which would
actually<00:02:09.220> be<00:02:09.489> really<00:02:09.580> good<00:02:09.819> because<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.360> map

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
actually be really good because the map

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.809 
actually be really good because the map

always<00:02:34.269> liked<00:02:34.569> smaller<00:02:35.050> Maps<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.800> one

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
always liked smaller Maps and this one

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.009 
always liked smaller Maps and this one
it<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.519> spa<00:02:36.730> but<00:02:36.970> it's<00:02:37.120> definitely<00:02:37.630> not<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.780> bad

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
it is spa but it's definitely not a bad

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.210 
it is spa but it's definitely not a bad
thing<00:02:38.260> because<00:02:38.470> there<00:02:38.590> are<00:02:38.680> three<00:02:39.010> lanes

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
thing because there are three lanes

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.500 
thing because there are three lanes
there<00:02:39.430> are<00:02:39.519> escape<00:02:39.790> points<00:02:40.269> there<00:02:40.390> are

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
there are escape points there are

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.539 
there are escape points there are
definitely<00:02:41.019> multiple<00:02:41.620> entrances<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.190> this

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
definitely multiple entrances to this

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.120 
definitely multiple entrances to this
middle<00:02:42.880> area<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.170> think<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.500> just<00:02:44.530> makes<00:02:44.830> for

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
middle area so I think it just makes for

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.920 
middle area so I think it just makes for
a<00:02:45.190> really<00:02:45.370> fun<00:02:45.489> play<00:02:46.000> that's<00:02:46.239> personally<00:02:46.780> my
