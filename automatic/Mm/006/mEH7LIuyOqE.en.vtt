featured on a previous episode

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.530 
featured on a previous episode
whitewashing<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.880> but<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.150> think<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.420> can

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
whitewashing the a but I think you can

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.470 
whitewashing the a but I think you can
only<00:03:26.660> see<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.709> back<00:03:27.739> of<00:03:28.040> my<00:03:28.160> head<00:03:28.430> which<00:03:29.390> is

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
only see the back of my head which is

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.940 
only see the back of my head which is
ridiculous<00:03:29.660> by<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.260> way<00:03:31.930> but<00:03:32.930> yeah<00:03:33.470> at<00:03:33.709> least

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
ridiculous by the way but yeah at least

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.560 
ridiculous by the way but yeah at least
we're<00:03:34.220> not<00:03:34.250> like<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.670> CAS<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.209> have<00:03:35.330> two

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
we're not like the CAS you have two

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.630 
we're not like the CAS you have two
weeks<00:03:35.720> of<00:03:35.930> data<00:03:36.350> tubing<00:03:36.709> train<00:03:37.040> yeah<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:40.100> yeah

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
weeks of data tubing train yeah so yeah

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.030 
weeks of data tubing train yeah so yeah
I<00:03:40.670> guess<00:03:40.880> that<00:03:41.209> was<00:03:41.330> our<00:03:41.510> scholar<00:03:41.959> episode<00:03:42.560> day

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040
