00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
just gave the post incorporated Italian

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.760 
just gave the post incorporated Italian
but<00:03:39.310> what<00:03:40.310> do<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:40.400> think<00:03:40.490> about<00:03:41.770> population

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
but what do you think about population

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.590 
but what do you think about population
world<00:03:43.130> population<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.790> completely<00:03:44.450> out<00:03:44.570> of

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
world population is completely out of

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.630 
world population is completely out of
control<00:03:46.810> multiplied<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:48.230> think<00:03:48.950> we<00:03:49.040> did<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.250> I

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
control multiplied I think we did that I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.090 
control multiplied I think we did that I
think<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.510> think<00:03:50.750> we<00:03:50.870> achieved<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.410> goal<00:03:51.770> and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
think I think we achieved that goal and

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.770 
think I think we achieved that goal and
it's<00:03:52.220> time<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.460> move<00:03:52.700> on<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.060> something<00:03:53.300> else<00:03:53.540> I

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
it's time to move on to something else I

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.210 
it's time to move on to something else I
mean<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:54.080> just<00:03:54.290> gonna<00:03:54.410> get<00:03:54.620> worse<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.160> worse

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
mean it's just gonna get worse and worse

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.930 
mean it's just gonna get worse and worse
and<00:03:55.460> worse

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
and worse

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.330 
and worse
like<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.810> think<00:03:57.110> we<00:03:57.260> need<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.650> kind<00:03:57.800> of<00:03:57.950> curb<00:03:58.160> the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
like I think we need to kind of curb the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.400 
like I think we need to kind of curb the
babies<00:03:58.700> for<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.940> minute<00:03:59.210> let's<00:04:00.020> an<00:04:00.170> older

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
babies for a minute let's an older

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.310 
babies for a minute let's an older
people<00:04:00.710> die<00:04:00.920> off<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.670> know<00:04:01.820> and<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.570> don't<00:04:03.110> know

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
people die off you know and I don't know

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.750 
people die off you know and I don't know

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
I think I could good numbers about I

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.970 
I think I could good numbers about I
don't<00:04:04.970> know<00:04:05.030> about<00:04:05.210> 500<00:04:05.750> million<00:04:05.930> oh<00:04:06.260> really

medicine all these diseases we're trying
to<00:04:30.710> stop<00:04:30.950> is<00:04:31.190> nature<00:04:31.550> actually<00:04:31.760> keeping<00:04:32.240> us<00:04:32.360> in

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
to stop is nature actually keeping us in

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.260 
to stop is nature actually keeping us in
check<00:04:32.720> but<00:04:33.020> we<00:04:33.140> can<00:04:33.320> contemplate<00:04:33.910> like<00:04:34.910> love

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
check but we can contemplate like love

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.640 
check but we can contemplate like love
and<00:04:36.460> loss<00:04:37.460> in<00:04:37.820> our<00:04:38.240> own<00:04:38.450> mortality<00:04:38.750> so<00:04:39.500> we

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
and loss in our own mortality so we

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.290 
and loss in our own mortality so we
think<00:04:39.830> these<00:04:39.980> diseases<00:04:40.430> are<00:04:40.670> bad<00:04:40.910> they<00:04:41.150> are

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300
