absolutely<00:00:14.940> not<00:00:15.089> absolutely<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.740> did<00:00:16.800> not<00:00:17.100> see

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
absolutely not absolutely I did not see

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.840 
absolutely not absolutely I did not see
this<00:00:17.430> coming

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this coming

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.080 
this coming
um<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:19.400> sort<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.460> figured<00:00:21.470> that<00:00:22.880> there<00:00:23.880> would<00:00:24.060> be

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
um I sort of figured that there would be

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.420 
um I sort of figured that there would be
maybe<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.140> were<00:00:25.230> lucky<00:00:25.410> about<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> million

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
maybe if we were lucky about a million

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.390 
maybe if we were lucky about a million
comic<00:00:27.240> book<00:00:27.390> fans<00:00:27.660> maybe<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.830> US<00:00:29.099> who

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
comic book fans maybe in the US who

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.910 
comic book fans maybe in the US who
would<00:00:29.580> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.109> keep<00:00:31.109> us<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.619> until<00:00:31.740> we

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
would kind of keep us going until we

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.900 
would kind of keep us going until we
were<00:00:32.009> cancelled<00:00:32.430> halfway<00:00:32.669> through<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
were cancelled halfway through the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.410 
were cancelled halfway through the
second<00:00:33.210> season<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.750> know<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:35.420> thought

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
second season you know and I thought

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.610 
second season you know and I thought
well<00:00:36.570> let's<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.020> something<00:00:37.350> we're<00:00:37.500> proud

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
well let's just do something we're proud

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.200 
well let's just do something we're proud
of<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.190> gonna<00:00:38.250> fail<00:00:38.520> let's<00:00:38.790> fail<00:00:39.000> big

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
of it if we're gonna fail let's fail big

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.340 
of it if we're gonna fail let's fail big
and<00:00:39.950> take<00:00:40.950> risks<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.960> more<00:00:43.200> people

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and take risks and a lot more people

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.680 
and take risks and a lot more people
have<00:00:43.559> come<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> journey<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:45.360> us<00:00:45.390> than<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
have come on the journey with us than I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.990 
have come on the journey with us than I
ever<00:00:45.840> expected<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.590> been<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.250> humbling<00:00:47.850> it's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
ever expected it's been so humbling it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.180 
ever expected it's been so humbling it's
incredible

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.520 

no<00:00:52.910> actually<00:00:53.450> I<00:00:53.480> think<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:53.930> does<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:54.260> reverse

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
no actually I think it does the reverse

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.580 
no actually I think it does the reverse
I<00:00:54.770> think<00:00:55.040> it<00:00:55.160> gives<00:00:55.460> us<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:56.150> license<00:00:56.630> to<00:00:57.440> take

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
I think it gives us the license to take

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.710 
I think it gives us the license to take
even<00:00:57.890> bigger<00:00:58.070> risks<00:00:58.610> because<00:00:59.270> you<00:00:59.360> kind<00:00:59.630> of

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
even bigger risks because you kind of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.620 
even bigger risks because you kind of
get<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.900> sense<00:00:59.960> I<00:01:00.730> mean<00:01:01.730> this<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.090> not<00:01:02.270> at<00:01:02.480> least

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
get a sense I mean this is not at least

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.200 
get a sense I mean this is not at least
to<00:01:02.810> me<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:02.960> show<00:01:03.260> that<00:01:03.410> on<00:01:03.530> paper<00:01:03.890> you<00:01:04.880> think<00:01:05.090> is

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
to me a show that on paper you think is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.920 
to me a show that on paper you think is
going<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.420> appeal<00:01:05.980> to<00:01:06.980> as<00:01:07.420> wide<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.450> demographic

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
going to appeal to as wide a demographic

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.280 
going to appeal to as wide a demographic
as<00:01:09.440> it<00:01:09.590> appears<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.280> have<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.930> so<00:01:11.930> you<00:01:12.050> sort<00:01:12.230> of

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
as it appears to have and so you sort of

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.360 
as it appears to have and so you sort of
think<00:01:12.470> well<00:01:12.590> if<00:01:12.650> people<00:01:12.920> are<00:01:13.010> going<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.160> go

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
think well if people are going to go

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.360 
think well if people are going to go
there<00:01:13.550> with<00:01:13.730> us<00:01:13.910> and<00:01:14.660> let's<00:01:15.560> really<00:01:15.830> go<00:01:16.130> there

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
there with us and let's really go there

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.070 
there with us and let's really go there
and<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:16.670> think<00:01:16.730> that<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:17.210> think<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.630> very<00:01:17.750> much<00:01:17.960> of

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
and I think that I think is very much of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.870 
and I think that I think is very much of
what<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.380> third<00:01:18.560> season<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:19.040> about<00:01:19.280> it's<00:01:19.520> sort

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
what the third season is about it's sort

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.219 
what the third season is about it's sort
of<00:01:19.910> looking<00:01:20.240> around<00:01:20.360> at<00:01:20.720> what's<00:01:20.870> happened<00:01:21.170> to

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
of looking around at what's happened to

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.770 
of looking around at what's happened to
last<00:01:21.380> two<00:01:21.560> seasons<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.070> gone<00:01:22.190> okay<00:01:22.690> well<00:01:23.690> if

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
last two seasons and gone okay well if

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.900 
last two seasons and gone okay well if
they<00:01:23.870> let<00:01:24.050> us<00:01:24.140> get<00:01:24.320> away<00:01:24.350> with<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:24.910> then

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
they let us get away with that then

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.280 
they let us get away with that then
let's<00:01:26.150> see<00:01:26.330> what<00:01:26.420> happens<00:01:26.720> if<00:01:26.869> we<00:01:26.990> go<00:01:27.110> over

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
let's see what happens if we go over

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.690 
let's see what happens if we go over
there<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:28.990> it's<00:01:29.990> exciting<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.979> gives<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.400> I

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
there and it's exciting it gives you I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.300 
there and it's exciting it gives you I
think<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:32.930> gives<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:33.830> little<00:01:33.979> bit<00:01:34.130> more

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
think it gives you a little bit more

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.140 
think it gives you a little bit more
free<00:01:34.580> rein

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.500 

I<00:01:38.240> think<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.290> bomb<00:01:39.890> went<00:01:40.160> off<00:01:40.220> between<00:01:41.030> Rick<00:01:41.330> and

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
I think a bomb went off between Rick and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.000 
I think a bomb went off between Rick and
Lorie<00:01:41.660> at<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.960> end<00:01:42.080> of<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.230> last<00:01:42.410> season<00:01:42.620> and

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
Lorie at the end of the last season and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.130 
Lorie at the end of the last season and
it<00:01:43.100> what's<00:01:43.790> interesting<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.360> me<00:01:44.390> is<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.750> wasn't

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
it what's interesting to me is it wasn't

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.550 
it what's interesting to me is it wasn't
because<00:01:45.730> Rick<00:01:46.730> killed<00:01:47.030> Shane<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.080> it<00:01:48.410> wasn't

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
because Rick killed Shane and it wasn't

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.680 
because Rick killed Shane and it wasn't
because<00:01:48.770> Laurie<00:01:49.190> told<00:01:49.730> him<00:01:49.970> he<00:01:50.150> might<00:01:50.300> have<00:01:50.510> to

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
because Laurie told him he might have to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.230 
because Laurie told him he might have to
do<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.980> because<00:01:51.980> that<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.760> all<00:01:52.910> worked<00:01:53.120> out

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
do it because that that all worked out

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.460 
do it because that that all worked out
rather<00:01:53.390> well<00:01:53.540> they<00:01:53.840> both<00:01:54.020> knew<00:01:54.230> that<00:01:54.260> it<00:01:54.410> had

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
rather well they both knew that it had

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.430 
rather well they both knew that it had
to<00:01:54.590> happen<00:01:54.830> mission<00:01:55.490> accomplished

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
to happen mission accomplished

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.500 
to happen mission accomplished
it<00:01:57.440> hurts<00:01:57.650> it's<00:01:57.830> painful<00:01:58.220> but<00:01:58.400> we<00:01:58.730> got<00:01:59.210> it<00:01:59.360> I

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
it hurts it's painful but we got it I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.660 
it hurts it's painful but we got it I
think<00:01:59.810> what<00:02:00.230> happened<00:02:00.680> is<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:03.160> in<00:02:04.160> telling

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
think what happened is that in telling

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.520 
think what happened is that in telling
Laurie<00:02:05.090> about<00:02:05.390> how<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.720> happened<00:02:05.870> he<00:02:06.260> said<00:02:06.290> I

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
Laurie about how it happened he said I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.290 
Laurie about how it happened he said I
wanted<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.070> do<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.460> wanted<00:02:07.820> him<00:02:07.910> out<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
wanted to do it I wanted him out of the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.020 
wanted to do it I wanted him out of the
way<00:02:08.420> I<00:02:08.450> was<00:02:08.750> sick<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.110> him<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:10.580> think<00:02:10.790> Laurie

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
way I was sick of him and I think Laurie

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.170 
way I was sick of him and I think Laurie
gets<00:02:11.240> very<00:02:12.280> her<00:02:13.280> heart<00:02:13.520> sort<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.790> turns<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.120> ice

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
gets very her heart sort of turns to ice

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.720 
gets very her heart sort of turns to ice
for<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.570> minute<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:14.930> she<00:02:14.990> thinks<00:02:15.459> he's<00:02:16.459> turned

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
for a minute and she thinks he's turned

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.330 
for a minute and she thinks he's turned
into<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.120> man<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.630> he<00:02:17.930> just<00:02:18.170> killed<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.040> she

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
into the man that he just killed and she

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.420 
into the man that he just killed and she
recoils<00:02:19.850> from<00:02:20.060> him<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:21.650> think<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:22.070> that

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
recoils from him and I think it's that

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.880 
recoils from him and I think it's that
it's<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.720> moment<00:02:24.140> where<00:02:24.350> rather<00:02:24.709> than

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
it's that moment where rather than

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.920 
it's that moment where rather than
putting<00:02:25.820> my<00:02:25.940> arms<00:02:26.150> around<00:02:26.240> him<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.660> saying

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
putting my arms around him and saying

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.260 
putting my arms around him and saying
you're<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:27.800> good<00:02:28.070> man<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.430> love<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.090> did

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
you're a good man I love you you did

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.040 
you're a good man I love you you did
what<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.480> had<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.630> do

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
what you had to do

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.230 
what you had to do
I<00:02:30.560> back<00:02:31.010> off<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.490> he<00:02:31.640> backs<00:02:31.850> off<00:02:32.060> and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
I back off and then he backs off and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.670 
I back off and then he backs off and
it's<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.959> have<00:02:33.050> two<00:02:33.200> people<00:02:33.380> on<00:02:33.560> an

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
it's like you have two people on an

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.880 
it's like you have two people on an
iceberg<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.250> crack<00:02:34.550> just<00:02:35.709> comes<00:02:36.709> through

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
iceberg and a crack just comes through

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.320 
iceberg and a crack just comes through
the<00:02:36.980> middle<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.459> think<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.820> journey<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.270> the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
the middle so I think the journey of the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.510 
the middle so I think the journey of the
second<00:02:38.690> season<00:02:39.020> with<00:02:39.140> these<00:02:39.260> two<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.860> trying

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
second season with these two is trying

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.400 
second season with these two is trying
to<00:02:40.820> where<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.300> third<00:02:41.480> season<00:02:41.840> excuse<00:02:42.080> me<00:02:42.230> it's

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
to where the third season excuse me it's

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.860 
to where the third season excuse me it's
trying<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.860> find<00:02:43.390> their<00:02:44.390> way<00:02:44.600> back<00:02:44.630> together

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
trying to find their way back together

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.630 
trying to find their way back together
I'm<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:48.050> big<00:02:48.410> believer<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.860> Ricki<00:02:49.130> Laurie<00:02:49.430> I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
I'm a big believer in Ricki Laurie I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.100 
I'm a big believer in Ricki Laurie I
think<00:02:49.880> these<00:02:49.970> two<00:02:50.209> belong<00:02:50.510> together<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:51.019> think

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
think these two belong together I think

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.509 
think these two belong together I think
they<00:02:51.350> love<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.739> living<00:02:52.010> daylights<00:02:52.160> out<00:02:52.489> of

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
they love the living daylights out of

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:52.990 
they love the living daylights out of
each<00:02:52.700> other

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
each other

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.210 
each other
neither<00:02:53.570> remembers<00:02:54.200> their<00:02:54.410> life<00:02:54.620> without<00:02:55.070> the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
neither remembers their life without the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.780 
neither remembers their life without the
other<00:02:55.340> one<00:02:56.410> but<00:02:57.410> there<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.709> such<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.100> huge<00:02:58.580> space

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
other one but there is such a huge space

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.360 
other one but there is such a huge space
of<00:03:00.250> not<00:03:01.250> only<00:03:01.459> grief<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.910> loss<00:03:02.060> but

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
of not only grief and loss but

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.449 
of not only grief and loss but
self-loathing<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.930> shame<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.350> each<00:03:07.100> has<00:03:07.340> to

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
self-loathing and shame that each has to

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.979 
self-loathing and shame that each has to
cross<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.850> themselves<00:03:07.970> before<00:03:08.480> they<00:03:08.810> can

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
cross and themselves before they can

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.580 
cross and themselves before they can
reach<00:03:09.140> out<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.590> other<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:11.140> think<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.230> story

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
reach out to the other I think the story

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.199 
reach out to the other I think the story
of<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.769> third<00:03:12.980> season<00:03:13.220> for<00:03:13.519> us<00:03:13.550> is<00:03:13.820> how<00:03:14.060> on

and then there's that and then there's

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:20.869 
and then there's that and then there's
the<00:03:19.950> fact<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.310> may<00:03:20.519> or<00:03:20.579> may<00:03:20.640> not<00:03:20.760> be

because it's now not just about let's

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.259 
because it's now not just about let's
find<00:03:37.859> a<00:03:37.980> place<00:03:38.099> where<00:03:38.430> we<00:03:38.579> can<00:03:38.730> run<00:03:38.909> and<00:03:39.090> hide

whole<00:03:53.760> new<00:03:53.819> set<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.359> challenges<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:55.319> this

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
whole new set of challenges for this

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.020 
whole new set of challenges for this
group<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:57.680> think<00:03:58.680> Lori's<00:03:59.159> central<00:03:59.609> concern

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
group and I think Lori's central concern

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.569 
group and I think Lori's central concern
is<00:04:00.359> that<00:04:00.420> she<00:04:01.109> be<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.290> burden<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.680> no<00:04:01.980> one<00:04:02.159> to

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
is that she be a burden to no one to

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.580 
is that she be a burden to no one to
never<00:04:02.909> say<00:04:03.209> I'm<00:04:03.359> hungry<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.930> never<00:04:04.200> say<00:04:04.439> I'm

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
never say I'm hungry to never say I'm

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.470 
never say I'm hungry to never say I'm
tired<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:05.159> never<00:04:05.400> say<00:04:05.639> I<00:04:05.670> can't<00:04:06.000> lift<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.299> or<00:04:06.420> I

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
tired to never say I can't lift it or I

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.830 
tired to never say I can't lift it or I
can't<00:04:06.720> do<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.019> or<00:04:07.139> I'm<00:04:07.260> afraid<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.569> Rick<00:04:09.569> puts

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
can't do it or I'm afraid and Rick puts

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.440 
can't do it or I'm afraid and Rick puts
an<00:04:10.079> incredible<00:04:10.650> burden<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:10.980> himself<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:12.239> try

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
an incredible burden on himself to try

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.119 
an incredible burden on himself to try
and<00:04:12.569> protect<00:04:12.870> her<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.680> you've<00:04:13.829> got<00:04:13.859> these

and protect her and so you've got these

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.349 
and protect her and so you've got these
people<00:04:14.430> doing<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:14.730> sort<00:04:14.879> of<00:04:14.939> a<00:04:15.030> Gift<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.299> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.120 
killing himself to take care of her and
yet<00:04:23.490> there's<00:04:23.729> this<00:04:23.940> cold<00:04:24.240> war<00:04:24.479> between<00:04:24.690> them

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
yet there's this cold war between them

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.129 
yet there's this cold war between them
where<00:04:26.130> while<00:04:26.789> everything<00:04:27.389> we<00:04:27.510> do<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.840> for<00:04:28.020> each

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
where while everything we do is for each

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.510 
where while everything we do is for each
other<00:04:28.349> we<00:04:28.800> can't<00:04:29.010> look<00:04:29.099> at<00:04:29.220> each<00:04:29.340> other

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
other we can't look at each other

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.360 
other we can't look at each other
because<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.360> hurts<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.530> much

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.000 

in<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.390> very<00:04:36.660> literal<00:04:36.870> sense<00:04:37.170> it<00:04:37.380> turns<00:04:37.560> us<00:04:37.770> all

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
in a very literal sense it turns us all

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.040 
in a very literal sense it turns us all
into<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.760> walking<00:04:39.120> dead<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.510> know<00:04:39.600> realizing

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
into the walking dead you know realizing

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.390 
into the walking dead you know realizing
there's<00:04:40.410> no<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:43.530> realize<00:04:43.920> that<00:04:44.100> at<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.280> end

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
there's no you realize that at the end

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.110 
there's no you realize that at the end
of<00:04:44.520> your<00:04:44.610> life<00:04:44.820> is<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.630> transition<00:04:47.090> into<00:04:48.090> a

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
of your life is a transition into a

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.530 
of your life is a transition into a
monstrosity<00:04:48.740> that<00:04:49.740> is<00:04:50.090> unavoidable<00:04:51.090> now<00:04:51.270> and

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
monstrosity that is unavoidable now and

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.270 
monstrosity that is unavoidable now and
I<00:04:51.960> think<00:04:52.020> until<00:04:52.530> then<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.710> lot<00:04:52.890> of<00:04:52.920> us<00:04:53.070> were

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
I think until then a lot of us were

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.430 
I think until then a lot of us were
living<00:04:53.520> our<00:04:53.640> lives<00:04:53.790> just<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.930> avoid<00:04:55.170> that

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
living our lives just to avoid that

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.850 
living our lives just to avoid that
moment<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:56.000> being<00:04:57.440> trapped<00:04:58.440> in<00:04:58.680> your<00:04:58.800> own

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
moment of being trapped in your own

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.370 
moment of being trapped in your own
brain<00:04:59.370> as<00:04:59.670> it<00:04:59.940> wakes<00:05:00.180> up<00:05:00.420> and<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.870> become

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
brain as it wakes up and you become

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.130 
brain as it wakes up and you become
something<00:05:01.650> horrifying<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:03.750> there's<00:05:03.930> that

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
something horrifying so there's that

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.990 
something horrifying so there's that
which<00:05:04.620> i<00:05:04.770> think<00:05:04.830> is<00:05:05.040> demoralizing<00:05:05.310> also<00:05:05.910> you

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
which i think is demoralizing also you

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.720 
which i think is demoralizing also you
know<00:05:06.090> for<00:05:06.300> Laurie<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:06.660> think<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:08.580> has<00:05:08.700> a

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
know for Laurie I think it it has a

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.390 
know for Laurie I think it it has a
great<00:05:09.030> deal<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.720> do<00:05:09.840> with<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:09.990> pregnancy

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
great deal to do with the pregnancy

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.930 
great deal to do with the pregnancy
because<00:05:11.400> if<00:05:11.520> she<00:05:11.670> loses<00:05:11.790> that<00:05:12.090> baby<00:05:12.300> that<00:05:13.940> baby

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
because if she loses that baby that baby

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.040 
because if she loses that baby that baby
wakes<00:05:15.570> up<00:05:15.810> inside<00:05:16.530> her<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:17.600> that's<00:05:18.600> a<00:05:18.780> very

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
wakes up inside her and that's a very

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.410 
wakes up inside her and that's a very
quiet<00:05:19.410> fear<00:05:19.980> that<00:05:20.640> I<00:05:20.670> don't<00:05:20.880> think<00:05:21.030> she's<00:05:21.180> even

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
quiet fear that I don't think she's even

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.390 
quiet fear that I don't think she's even
open<00:05:21.630> her<00:05:21.690> mouth<00:05:21.810> about<00:05:22.200> but<00:05:22.950> I<00:05:22.980> think<00:05:23.070> it's

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
open her mouth about but I think it's

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.140 
open her mouth about but I think it's
the<00:05:23.490> elephant<00:05:23.700> in<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:23.910> room<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.120> think

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
the elephant in the room I think

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150 
the elephant in the room I think
everybody<00:05:24.690> one<00:05:24.930> by<00:05:24.960> one<00:05:25.320> at<00:05:25.470> some<00:05:25.650> point<00:05:25.980> in

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
everybody one by one at some point in

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.270 
everybody one by one at some point in
the<00:05:26.400> intervening<00:05:26.700> months<00:05:26.850> has<00:05:27.210> gone<00:05:27.420> oh<00:05:28.280> god

the intervening months has gone oh god
we<00:05:30.030> could<00:05:30.180> wake<00:05:30.390> up<00:05:30.420> in<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.870> middle<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.170> the

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
we could wake up in the middle of the

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.980 
we could wake up in the middle of the
night<00:05:31.440> with<00:05:31.890> this<00:05:32.370> thing<00:05:33.210> going<00:05:33.660> you<00:05:33.840> know

doing an alien's on us it's possible

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.790 
doing an alien's on us it's possible
that<00:05:36.480> this<00:05:36.600> is<00:05:36.750> inevitable<00:05:37.170> in<00:05:37.260> anything<00:05:37.440> Gale

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
that this is inevitable in anything Gale

that this is inevitable in anything Gale
Anne<00:05:37.890> Hurd<00:05:37.920> produces<00:05:38.630> eventually<00:05:39.740> although<00:05:40.740> I

Anne Hurd produces eventually although I

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.629 

when<00:05:46.810> it<00:05:46.900> comes<00:05:47.080> to<00:05:47.199> somebody<00:05:47.410> like<00:05:47.680> Shane<00:05:47.949> you

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
when it comes to somebody like Shane you

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
know from the comic books that he's

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.860 
know from the comic books that he's
going<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.410> go<00:05:50.790> but<00:05:51.790> it's<00:05:52.120> devastating

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
going to go but it's devastating

going to go but it's devastating
personally<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.800> mean<00:05:53.860> this<00:05:54.130> is<00:05:54.280> an<00:05:54.400> incredibly

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
personally I mean this is an incredibly

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.420 
personally I mean this is an incredibly
close<00:05:55.330> cast<00:05:55.690> especially<00:05:56.470> those<00:05:56.800> of<00:05:56.949> us<00:05:57.070> who've

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
close cast especially those of us who've

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.810 
close cast especially those of us who've
been<00:05:57.460> around<00:05:57.820> since<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.330> pilot<00:05:58.540> and<00:06:00.900> and

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
been around since the pilot and and

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.469 
been around since the pilot and and
losing<00:06:04.620> losing<00:06:05.620> Dale<00:06:06.070> and<00:06:06.430> losing<00:06:06.880> Shane

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
losing losing Dale and losing Shane

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.260 
losing losing Dale and losing Shane
I<00:06:09.720> think<00:06:10.720> it's<00:06:10.810> courageous<00:06:11.110> TV<00:06:11.740> and<00:06:11.979> I<00:06:12.850> think<00:06:13.150> I

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
I think it's courageous TV and I think I

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.760 
I think it's courageous TV and I think I
think<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.600> audience<00:06:13.930> needs<00:06:14.199> to<00:06:14.290> believe<00:06:14.620> at

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
think the audience needs to believe at

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.920 
think the audience needs to believe at
any<00:06:14.830> second<00:06:15.340> that<00:06:15.490> any<00:06:15.940> major<00:06:16.120> character<00:06:16.720> can

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
any second that any major character can

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.550 
any second that any major character can
go<00:06:17.080> otherwise<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:18.880> story<00:06:19.060> has<00:06:19.270> no<00:06:19.419> teeth<00:06:19.630> so<00:06:20.530> I

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
go otherwise the story has no teeth so I

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.320 
go otherwise the story has no teeth so I
understand<00:06:21.130> creatively<00:06:21.699> why<00:06:21.820> they<00:06:21.940> had<00:06:22.090> to<00:06:22.180> do

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
understand creatively why they had to do

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.870 
understand creatively why they had to do
