like that of course you get you get a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.459 
like that of course you get you get a
free<00:00:09.330> return<00:00:09.630> Trickett<00:00:10.910> the<00:00:12.290> actually<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.380> I

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
free return Trickett the actually that I

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.289 
free return Trickett the actually that I
mean<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.730> has<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.940> debate<00:00:15.179> about

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
mean that this one has a debate about

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.279 
mean that this one has a debate about
going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.109> Mars<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.590> way<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.640> whether<00:00:17.910> that

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
going to Mars one way and whether that

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.290 
going to Mars one way and whether that
makes<00:00:19.289> things<00:00:19.500> easier<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.160> think<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
makes things easier and I think for the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.820 
makes things easier and I think for the
initial<00:00:21.570> fights<00:00:21.810> perhaps<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> long

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
initial fights perhaps but for the long

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.259 
initial fights perhaps but for the long
term<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> cost<00:00:23.640> down<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.000> need<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
term to get the cost down you need the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.060 
term to get the cost down you need the
spacecraft<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:25.050> whether<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.650> people<00:00:25.920> come

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
spacecraft back whether the people come

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.900 
spacecraft back whether the people come
back<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.400> irrelevant<00:00:28.250> but<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.519> must<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
back is irrelevant but you must have the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.820 
back is irrelevant but you must have the
ship<00:00:30.179> back<00:00:30.420> because<00:00:31.109> those<00:00:31.529> things<00:00:31.740> are

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
ship back because those things are

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.520 
ship back because those things are
expensive<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.930> anyone<00:00:34.230> who<00:00:34.320> wants<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
expensive so so anyone who wants to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
expensive so so anyone who wants to
return<00:00:34.829> will<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.250> jump<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:37.340> maybe<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
return will just jump on maybe so I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.979 
return will just jump on maybe so I
could<00:00:38.700> stab<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.329> bloody<00:00:39.570> thinking<00:00:39.870> through

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
could stab that bloody thinking through

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.069 
could stab that bloody thinking through
the<00:00:40.110> heart<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.800> know<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.670> want<00:00:42.079> SpaceX

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the heart you know I really want SpaceX

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.830 
the heart you know I really want SpaceX
to<00:00:43.200> help<00:00:43.379> make<00:00:43.590> life<00:00:43.770> multiplanetary<00:00:44.840> you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
to help make life multiplanetary you

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.209 
to help make life multiplanetary you
know<00:00:45.930> I'd<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.379> see<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> self-sustaining

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
know I'd like to see a self-sustaining

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:58.060 
know I'd like to see a self-sustaining
base<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.640> Mars

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.139 

wait<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> climate<00:00:59.700> debate<00:00:59.820> is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
wait like the climate debate is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.660 
wait like the climate debate is
interesting<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:03.710> certainly<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> ask<00:01:05.339> any

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
interesting one certainly if you ask any

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.899 
interesting one certainly if you ask any
scientist

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
scientist

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.890 
scientist
are<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.180> sure<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:11.270> human<00:01:12.270> activity<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
are you sure that human activity is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.469 
are you sure that human activity is
causing<00:01:13.259> global<00:01:13.500> warming<00:01:14.240> any<00:01:15.240> any

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
causing global warming any any

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.680 
causing global warming any any
scientists<00:01:16.229> should<00:01:17.190> say<00:01:17.430> no<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
scientists should say no because you

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.490 
scientists should say no because you
can't<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:19.050> sharp<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.899> on<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:21.990> other<00:01:22.080> hand<00:01:22.320> if

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
can't be sharp so on the other hand if

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.880 
can't be sharp so on the other hand if
you<00:01:22.649> said<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.180> should<00:01:24.740> put<00:01:25.740> an

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you said do you think we should put an

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.630 
you said do you think we should put an
arbitrary<00:01:26.750> number<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> trillions<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.490> tons<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
arbitrary number of trillions of tons of

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.609 
arbitrary number of trillions of tons of
co2<00:01:29.850> into<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> atmosphere<00:01:30.660> and<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.380> keep

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
co2 into the atmosphere and just keep

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.080 
co2 into the atmosphere and just keep
doing<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.920> until<00:01:31.979> something<00:01:32.399> bad<00:01:32.520> happens

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
doing it until something bad happens

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.810 
doing it until something bad happens
I<00:01:33.119> probably<00:01:33.509> say<00:01:33.750> no<00:01:33.929> to<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.869> idea<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.820> like

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
I probably say no to the idea of like

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.930 
I probably say no to the idea of like
lying<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.179> beach<00:01:39.330> as<00:01:39.600> my<00:01:39.960> main<00:01:40.170> thing<00:01:40.440> I

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
lying on a beach as my main thing I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.040 
lying on a beach as my main thing I
sounds<00:01:41.940> like<00:01:42.179> it<00:01:42.330> worse<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.690> sounds

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
sounds like it worse that sounds

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.590 
sounds like it worse that sounds
horrible<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.410> me

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
horrible to me

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.540 
horrible to me
I<00:01:44.630> would<00:01:45.350> go<00:01:45.470> paupers<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:46.040> would<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:46.640> know<00:01:46.780> I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
I would go paupers I would you know I

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.920 
I would go paupers I would you know I
would<00:01:49.550> have<00:01:49.760> to<00:01:49.880> be<00:01:49.940> on<00:01:50.030> serious<00:01:50.420> drugs<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.900> mean

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
would have to be on serious drugs I mean

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.150 
would have to be on serious drugs I mean
I<00:01:52.479> went<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.570> Russia<00:01:53.780> three<00:01:54.560> times<00:01:54.800> to

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
I went to Russia three times to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.640 
I went to Russia three times to
negotiate<00:01:55.820> purchasing<00:01:56.390> purchasing<00:01:56.870> and<00:01:57.830> ICBM

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
negotiate purchasing purchasing and ICBM

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.680 
negotiate purchasing purchasing and ICBM
20<00:02:00.650> launches<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.070> year<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.460> not<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.700> not<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.450> crazy

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
20 launches a year is not a not a crazy

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.100 
20 launches a year is not a not a crazy
number<00:02:02.930> at<00:02:03.140> all<00:02:03.729> we<00:02:04.729> expect<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.660> occur

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
number at all we expect that to occur

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.340 
number at all we expect that to occur
with<00:02:07.070> without<00:02:07.640> any<00:02:07.700> miracles<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.539> think<00:02:09.259> it'd

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
with without any miracles I think it'd

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.590 
with without any miracles I think it'd
be<00:02:09.440> great<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.920> be<00:02:10.070> born<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.429> earth<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.880> die<00:02:11.450> on

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
be great to be born on earth and die on

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.150 
be great to be born on earth and die on
Mars<00:02:12.070> just<00:02:13.150> probably
