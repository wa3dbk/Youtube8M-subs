our thunder 100 retriever launcher I use

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.070 
our thunder 100 retriever launcher I use
home<00:00:18.060> plate<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:19.789> keep<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.970> dog<00:00:21.180> steady<00:00:21.720> there

home plate to keep the dog steady there
so<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:22.980> where<00:00:23.369> he's<00:00:23.699> at

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
so I can see where he's at

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.339 
so I can see where he's at
I<00:00:25.880> like<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.090> always<00:00:27.630> use<00:00:28.349> markers<00:00:29.130> if<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.699> dog<00:00:29.970> is

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
I like to always use markers if a dog is

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.049 
I like to always use markers if a dog is
stationary<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.650> kind<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.520> marking

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
stationary it's kind of like marking

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.790 
stationary it's kind of like marking
your<00:00:33.210> golf<00:00:33.480> ball<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:34.020> that's<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> spot<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
your golf ball if that's the spot that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.530 
your golf ball if that's the spot that
they're<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.660> this<00:00:36.660> becomes<00:00:37.020> habit<00:00:37.290> quickly

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
they're in this becomes habit quickly

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
they're in this becomes habit quickly
thunder<00:00:39.540> 100<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> great<00:00:40.590> launching<00:00:41.280> device

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
thunder 100 is a great launching device

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.240 
thunder 100 is a great launching device
because<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.510> use<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.260> about

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
because you can use it just about

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.580 
because you can use it just about
anywhere<00:00:45.710> in<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.430> situation

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.139 

it's<00:00:53.590> easier<00:00:53.980> for<00:00:54.190> me<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.309> throw<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.820> because

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
it's easier for me to throw it because

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.600 
it's easier for me to throw it because
I'm<00:00:55.300> looking<00:00:55.750> for<00:00:56.079> placement<00:00:56.980> right<00:00:57.250> along

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
I'm looking for placement right along

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.910 
I'm looking for placement right along
the<00:00:58.210> first<00:00:58.480> base<00:00:58.719> line<00:00:58.899> it<00:00:59.289> would<00:00:59.350> be<00:00:59.410> hard<00:00:59.710> for

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
the first base line it would be hard for

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.439 
the first base line it would be hard for
me<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.040> launch<00:01:00.339> it<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:00.730> get<00:01:00.879> it<00:01:00.969> right<00:01:01.210> where<00:01:01.420> I

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
me to launch it and get it right where I

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.930 
me to launch it and get it right where I
want<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.110> it's<00:01:02.739> just<00:01:02.829> another<00:01:03.579> piece<00:01:03.879> of

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
want it so it's just another piece of

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.730 
want it so it's just another piece of
how<00:01:04.180> versatile<00:01:04.570> this<00:01:04.750> is<00:01:04.900> I'm<00:01:05.080> lining<00:01:05.259> myself

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
how versatile this is I'm lining myself

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.300 
how versatile this is I'm lining myself
up<00:01:05.920> now<00:01:06.100> with<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.460> second<00:01:06.820> base

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.340 

and<00:01:12.310> again<00:01:13.030> throwing<00:01:13.390> it<00:01:13.630> makes<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:14.020> easier

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
and again throwing it makes it easier

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.100 
and again throwing it makes it easier
for<00:01:14.409> placement<00:01:15.189> but<00:01:15.399> I<00:01:15.430> still<00:01:15.700> get<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.750> sound

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
for placement but I still get the sound

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.039 
for placement but I still get the sound
of<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.530> shotgun<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:19.420> could<00:01:19.659> walk<00:01:19.869> around

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
of the shotgun you could walk around

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.410 
of the shotgun you could walk around
with<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.350> 22<00:01:20.860> starter<00:01:21.310> pistol<00:01:21.759> but<00:01:22.000> you've<00:01:22.270> got

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
with a 22 starter pistol but you've got

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.200 
with a 22 starter pistol but you've got
to<00:01:22.539> keep<00:01:22.659> loading<00:01:23.140> them<00:01:23.229> and<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:24.520> simulated

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
to keep loading them and this simulated

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.719 
to keep loading them and this simulated
shotgun<00:01:25.869> sound<00:01:26.259> keeps<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.890> dog<00:01:27.069> excitement

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
shotgun sound keeps a dog excitement

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.800 
shotgun sound keeps a dog excitement
level<00:01:28.030> high<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:29.280> I'm<00:01:30.280> purposely<00:01:30.880> walking

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
level high and I'm purposely walking

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.219 
level high and I'm purposely walking
this<00:01:32.049> drill<00:01:32.409> because<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.159> takes<00:01:33.579> longer<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
this drill because it takes longer to

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.100 
this drill because it takes longer to
walk<00:01:35.469> it<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.219> dog<00:01:36.460> has<00:01:36.939> to<00:01:36.969> remain<00:01:37.569> steady

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
walk it and the dog has to remain steady

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.550 
walk it and the dog has to remain steady
longer<00:01:38.679> I<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.240> run<00:01:40.450> this<00:01:40.630> drill<00:01:41.049> with<00:01:41.530> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
longer I like to run this drill with a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.429 
longer I like to run this drill with a
bumper<00:01:42.009> in<00:01:42.039> his<00:01:42.280> mouth<00:01:42.899> he<00:01:43.899> has<00:01:44.140> to

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
bumper in his mouth he has to

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.210 
bumper in his mouth he has to
concentrate<00:01:44.860> harder<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:46.229> use<00:01:47.229> second<00:01:47.740> base<00:01:47.920> as

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
concentrate harder I use second base as

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.399 
concentrate harder I use second base as
a<00:01:48.280> marker<00:01:48.880> as<00:01:49.090> something<00:01:49.569> that<00:01:49.599> he<00:01:49.780> has<00:01:49.959> to<00:01:49.990> run

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
a marker as something that he has to run

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.550 
a marker as something that he has to run
over<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:51.130> keep<00:01:51.909> him<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.240> line<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.840> then<00:01:53.289> I<00:01:53.319> have

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
over to keep him in line and then I have

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.929 
over to keep him in line and then I have
him<00:01:53.679> exchange<00:01:54.280> him<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.610> have<00:01:54.789> him<00:01:54.939> drop<00:01:55.270> one<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
him exchange him I have him drop one and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.940 
him exchange him I have him drop one and
pick<00:01:57.939> up<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.270> other<00:01:58.299> one<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:59.500> way<00:01:59.709> there's

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
pick up the other one that way there's

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.100 
pick up the other one that way there's
always<00:02:00.310> one<00:02:00.909> out<00:02:01.090> there<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.630> I<00:02:01.689> could<00:02:01.750> run

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
always one out there and I could run

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.949 
always one out there and I could run
this<00:02:02.319> drill<00:02:02.679> for<00:02:03.009> as<00:02:03.789> long<00:02:04.090> as<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:04.420> want<00:02:04.689> he's

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
this drill for as long as I want he's

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.410 
this drill for as long as I want he's
also<00:02:05.170> got<00:02:05.439> a<00:02:05.470> visual<00:02:06.039> target<00:02:06.670> there<00:02:06.849> so<00:02:07.209> when<00:02:07.390> I

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
also got a visual target there so when I

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.789 
also got a visual target there so when I
give<00:02:07.750> him<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:08.019> right<00:02:08.319> come<00:02:09.130> in<00:02:09.310> cast<00:02:10.170> he<00:02:11.170> can<00:02:11.380> see

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
give him a right come in cast he can see

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.339 
give him a right come in cast he can see
and<00:02:12.160> line<00:02:12.519> that<00:02:12.790> up<00:02:12.819> with<00:02:13.269> where<00:02:13.840> he's<00:02:14.049> coming

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
and line that up with where he's coming

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.090 
and line that up with where he's coming
in<00:02:15.090> I'm<00:02:16.090> running<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.630> again<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.799> so<00:02:17.889> you<00:02:17.980> can

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
in I'm running it again just so you can

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.370 
in I'm running it again just so you can
see<00:02:18.310> him<00:02:18.400> go<00:02:18.519> over<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.910> base<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.810> can<00:02:20.019> see

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
see him go over the base and you can see
