00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.630
 bissau vÃ¡rzea large and how many people 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.940
 could not use paypal is so then 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.109
 making a video about the exclusion was 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.539
 This I did a lot of things we show and 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.310
 Anyone who wants to download low 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.800
 willingness to leave the application 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.320
 a lot of people prevented me from leaving all 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:31.590
 they who do not want to exclude some and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:35.130
 also then it was just that much 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.059
 people asked me to do or teach 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.030
 to do is highlight that this is my 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.190
 pp that otto and ear texture 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.390
 many people asked me to teach 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.480
 do 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.629
 If you want tutorial I'll go 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.980
 teach the photoshop to the saw 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.440
 many basic things because it teaches 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.210
 that's does not have a specific thing 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.320
 You need to know how to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.809
 several things 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.930
 so I can do a tutorial on 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.040
 photoshop and that goes to help but in 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.890
 textures 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.280
 so if you make between the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.290
 photoshop not to make pp as just 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.189
 comments how to teach a little to 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.600
 you 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.720
 and that's right 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.939
 16 in the description there and if I do 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.030
 somebody in the audience here also that I 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:38.600
 I just did it then if you want 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:41.790
 download and comment on the real and that's it 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.810
 I had a video I posted to 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.899
 you send me a sword in my email 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.070
 looks the title of the video is the third of 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.189
 you for you 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.409
 so who did not make the expected one yet 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.689
 in each time the book first need 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.719
 to understand well that was just it 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.719
 and so far
