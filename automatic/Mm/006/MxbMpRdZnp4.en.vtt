those birds cavity nesters so
historically<00:00:50.940> they<00:00:51.780> would<00:00:51.960> find<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.350> dead<00:00:52.829> tree

there since the wood duck used it but
we'll<00:01:51.869> check<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:53.939> what's

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
we'll check this one and and see what's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:07.840 
we'll check this one and and see what's
there

hollow<00:03:03.959> tree<00:03:04.170> I've<00:03:04.890> never<00:03:05.100> seen<00:03:05.310> him<00:03:05.400> come<00:03:05.550> out

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
hollow tree I've never seen him come out

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.479 
hollow tree I've never seen him come out
but<00:03:05.940> I've<00:03:06.060> checked<00:03:06.930> nets<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.500> spring<00:03:07.800> and

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
but I've checked nets in the spring and

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.009 
but I've checked nets in the spring and
a<00:03:08.610> number<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.910> times<00:03:09.120> had<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.480> hand<00:03:09.660> on<00:03:09.870> the

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
a number of times had to hand on the

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.350 
a number of times had to hand on the
nest<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.560> effective<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.580> remove<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.150> nest

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
nest it's effective if I remove the nest

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.170 
nest it's effective if I remove the nest
carefully<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.860> know<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.370> get<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.550> down<00:03:14.730> and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
carefully you know I can get it down and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.880 
carefully you know I can get it down and
pop<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.570> top<00:03:15.750> up<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.560> hen<00:03:16.680> will<00:03:16.830> be

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
pop the top up and the hen will be

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.100 
pop the top up and the hen will be
sitting<00:03:17.160> on<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> eggs<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.780> I've<00:03:18.870> been<00:03:18.989> with

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
sitting on the eggs and I've been with

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.979 
sitting on the eggs and I've been with
somebody<00:03:19.530> else<00:03:19.680> I'll<00:03:20.489> hand<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> hen<00:03:21.120> to

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
somebody else I'll hand in the hen to

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.880 
somebody else I'll hand in the hen to
count<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.350> eggs<00:03:22.500> when<00:03:22.920> we're<00:03:23.100> done

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
count the eggs when we're done

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:59.150 
count the eggs when we're done
sometimes<00:03:25.890> she<00:03:26.070> stands<00:03:26.340> there

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.640 

you<00:03:59.850> can<00:04:00.000> see<00:04:00.120> there's<00:04:00.270> an<00:04:00.390> exit<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.960> think<00:04:01.500> back

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
you can see there's an exit I think back

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.240 
you can see there's an exit I think back
to<00:04:01.770> thinkers<00:04:02.070> too<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.830> an<00:04:04.920> egg<00:04:05.070> that

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
to thinkers too so this is an egg that

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.660 
to thinkers too so this is an egg that
for<00:04:05.400> some<00:04:05.580> reason<00:04:05.610> didn't<00:04:06.570> hatch<00:04:07.490> do<00:04:08.490> you<00:04:08.550> know

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
for some reason didn't hatch do you know

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.720 
for some reason didn't hatch do you know
how<00:04:08.940> many<00:04:09.090> eggs<00:04:09.300> would<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.780> usually<00:04:09.930> find<00:04:13.730> I

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
how many eggs would you usually find I

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.000 
how many eggs would you usually find I
think<00:04:15.720> there's<00:04:16.019> just<00:04:16.170> one<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.590> didn't<00:04:16.830> hatch

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
think there's just one that didn't hatch

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.130 
think there's just one that didn't hatch
so<00:04:17.459> these<00:04:18.090> birds<00:04:18.359> away<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:20.820> know<00:04:20.940> between<00:04:21.150> 5

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
so these birds away you know between 5

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.070 
so these birds away you know between 5
and<00:04:22.530> 20<00:04:22.950> eggs<00:04:23.100> I<00:04:23.340> suppose<00:04:23.670> depending<00:04:24.600> on<00:04:24.960> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
and 20 eggs I suppose depending on the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.260 
and 20 eggs I suppose depending on the
nest<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:26.040> it's<00:04:26.250> not<00:04:26.430> unusual<00:04:26.640> for<00:04:27.090> a

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
nest and it's not unusual for a

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.590 
nest and it's not unusual for a
Merganser<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:32.760> cancer<00:04:33.120> will<00:04:33.270> lay<00:04:33.419> her

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
Merganser and the cancer will lay her

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.020 
Merganser and the cancer will lay her
eggs<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.140> wood<00:04:34.350> duck<00:04:34.500> nest<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.700> then<00:04:35.910> the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
eggs in a wood duck nest and then the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.330 
eggs in a wood duck nest and then the
hen<00:04:36.180> would<00:04:36.330> duck<00:04:36.570> will<00:04:36.780> raise<00:04:37.020> her<00:04:38.010> brood<00:04:38.250> of

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
hen would duck will raise her brood of

00:04:38.340 --> 00:05:00.250 
hen would duck will raise her brood of
wood<00:04:38.490> ducks<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:41.540> it's<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.690> rotten<00:04:43.200> egg<00:04:43.380> so<00:04:44.310> I

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.430 

can<00:05:01.260> tell<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:02.960> there<00:05:03.960> were<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.080> number<00:05:04.290> of

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
can tell that there were a number of

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.700 
can tell that there were a number of
birds<00:05:05.070> hatched<00:05:05.400> out<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.669> this<00:05:05.880> nest<00:05:06.470> yeah<00:05:07.470> so

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
birds hatched out of this nest yeah so

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.110 
birds hatched out of this nest yeah so
there's<00:05:07.890> at<00:05:08.010> least<00:05:08.040> four<00:05:08.400> eggs<00:05:08.580> one<00:05:08.850> of<00:05:08.970> which

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
there's at least four eggs one of which

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.880 
there's at least four eggs one of which
didn't<00:05:09.450> hatch<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:09.930> I'll<00:05:09.990> kind<00:05:10.650> of<00:05:10.710> route

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
didn't hatch and I'll kind of route

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.610 
didn't hatch and I'll kind of route
through<00:05:11.160> here<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:12.620> other<00:05:13.620> ones<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:13.950> can<00:05:14.100> find

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
through here and other ones I can find

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.650 
through here and other ones I can find
it's<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.680> good<00:05:16.710> conservation<00:05:17.220> project<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:18.570> I

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
it's a good conservation project and I

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.180

gets started in terms of how you get
involved<00:05:22.350> with<00:05:22.500> these<00:05:22.650> nests<00:05:22.919> well<00:05:23.490> yeah<00:05:24.150> I've

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
about wildlife biology and got out in

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.810 
about wildlife biology and got out in
the<00:05:40.380> woods<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:41.040> know<00:05:41.070> early<00:05:41.460> in<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.640> spring

of<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.620> projects<00:05:54.039> so<00:05:54.550> far<00:05:55.389> so<00:05:55.810> good

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
of the projects so far so good

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:57.779 
of the projects so far so good
then<00:05:56.860> one<00:05:57.069> of<00:05:57.129> these<00:05:57.219> days<00:05:57.400> they<00:05:57.520> go<00:05:57.610> be<00:05:57.759> a

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
then one of these days they go be a

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.159 
then one of these days they go be a
brand<00:05:58.090> kids<00:05:58.330> I'm<00:05:58.539> sure

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
brand kids I'm sure

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.369 
brand kids I'm sure
then<00:05:59.349> the<00:05:59.500> torch<00:05:59.740> will<00:05:59.919> be<00:06:00.039> 12<00:06:00.250> eggs<00:06:01.259> one<00:06:02.259> of

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
then the torch will be 12 eggs one of

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.089 
then the torch will be 12 eggs one of
which<00:06:02.530> did<00:06:02.770> not<00:06:02.919> catch<00:06:04.500> and<00:06:05.500> then<00:06:05.710> after<00:06:06.009> the

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
which did not catch and then after the

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.939 
which did not catch and then after the
woods<00:06:06.280> ex<00:06:06.460> was<00:06:06.639> through<00:06:06.849> with<00:06:06.939> the<00:06:07.060> nest<00:06:07.949> as

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
woods ex was through with the nest as

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.129 
woods ex was through with the nest as
wellö<00:06:09.189> came<00:06:09.460> in<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:10.330> built<00:06:10.659> her<00:06:10.750> nest<00:06:10.780> on<00:06:11.110> top

and we know there would be more any more
nesting<00:06:18.039> until<00:06:18.310> spring<00:06:18.669> and<00:06:19.449> the<00:06:19.659> Ducks<00:06:19.900> will

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.619 
nesting until spring and the Ducks will
come<00:06:20.680> in<00:06:20.800> here<00:06:20.979> before<00:06:21.159> the<00:06:21.430> swallows<00:06:21.759> can<00:06:22.029> can

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:22.629 
come in here before the swallows can can

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.119 
come in here before the swallows can can
get<00:06:22.750> their<00:06:22.900> nest<00:06:23.110> built<00:06:23.379> you<00:06:23.710> can<00:06:23.860> see<00:06:23.979> that
