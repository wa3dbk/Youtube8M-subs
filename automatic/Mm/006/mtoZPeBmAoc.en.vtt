his<00:02:03.689> team<00:02:03.990> number<00:02:04.649> three<00:02:04.680> trundled<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:05.579> poke

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
his team number three trundled what poke

down<00:02:06.000> during<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.390> last<00:02:06.630> wave<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.229> has<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.560> run

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
down during the last wave and has to run

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
down during the last wave and has to run
back<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.039> base<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.429> heal<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.179> harder<00:02:09.479> for

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
back to base to heal so it's harder for

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.720 
back to base to heal so it's harder for
a<00:02:09.660> rocket<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.140> counter<00:02:10.530> engage<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.160> finally

number four he's built pure girls
in<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.980> game<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.490> even<00:02:14.850> though<00:02:14.940> he's<00:02:15.150> a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
in this game so even though he's a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.150 
in this game so even though he's a
jungler<00:02:15.630> he<00:02:15.840> actually<00:02:16.050> split<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.710> mid<00:02:16.890> farm

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
jungler he actually split the mid farm

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.890 
jungler he actually split the mid farm
with<00:02:17.370> Pantheon<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.150> he's<00:02:18.360> still<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.600> major

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
with Pantheon so he's still a major

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.690 
with Pantheon so he's still a major
threat<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.890> reason<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.250> gets<00:02:20.460> turned

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
threat the reason this gets turned

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.490 
threat the reason this gets turned
around<00:02:20.820> though<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.510> because<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.230> Thresh

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
around though is because of a Thresh

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.440 
around though is because of a Thresh
lantern<00:02:22.950> at<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> last<00:02:23.430> second<00:02:23.940> which<00:02:24.120> allows

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
lantern at the last second which allows

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.120 
lantern at the last second which allows

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
want to point out is a pillar right here

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.950 
want to point out is a pillar right here
which<00:02:56.610> zones<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.060> rest<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.450> fanatic<00:02:57.840> from

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
which zones the rest of fanatic from

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.080 
which zones the rest of fanatic from
coming<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.560> trundle<00:02:59.280> could<00:02:59.460> have<00:02:59.580> used<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.940> to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
coming in trundle could have used it to

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.030 
coming in trundle could have used it to
pin<00:03:00.270> mundo<00:03:00.630> further<00:03:00.990> in<00:03:01.290> which<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.800> probably

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
pin mundo further in which is probably

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.190 
pin mundo further in which is probably
the<00:03:02.190> normal<00:03:02.850> play<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.480> by<00:03:03.630> doing<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:04.020> this<00:03:04.050> way

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the normal play but by doing it this way

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.230 
the normal play but by doing it this way
it<00:03:04.680> means<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.010> fanatic<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.610> no<00:03:05.910> way<00:03:06.090> of

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
it means the fanatic have no way of

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.030 
it means the fanatic have no way of
reengage<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.020> an<00:03:07.140> Oriana<00:03:07.530> ultimate

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
reengage in with an Oriana ultimate

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.980 
reengage in with an Oriana ultimate
because<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.490> can't<00:03:08.760> get<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.030> range<00:03:09.240> once

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
because you can't get in range once

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.690 
because you can't get in range once
window<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.470> dead<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.920> gives<00:03:11.190> rock<00:03:11.400> out<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
going to pause this here because this is

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.240 
going to pause this here because this is
another<00:03:18.930> really<00:03:19.230> important<00:03:19.680> part<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.040> the

fight so Oriana right now is split from
her<00:03:22.709> team<00:03:22.980> because<00:03:23.340> she<00:03:23.490> tried<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.850> dodge<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.150 
as well and now that fanatic are split
it<00:03:36.690> means<00:03:36.870> they<00:03:37.020> have<00:03:37.170> no<00:03:37.410> choice<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.040> run

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
it means they have no choice but to run

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.980 
it means they have no choice but to run
away<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.970> Gregor's<00:03:39.300> did<00:03:39.450> have<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.720> go<00:03:39.840> and

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
away the Gregor's did have to go and

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.720 
away the Gregor's did have to go and
heal<00:03:40.230> because<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.800> first<00:03:41.070> fight<00:03:41.370> but

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
heal because of the first fight but

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.580 
heal because of the first fight but
because<00:03:42.060> Oriana<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.050> left<00:03:43.230> hand<00:03:43.470> side

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
because Oriana is on the left hand side

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.830 
because Oriana is on the left hand side
now<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.250> makes<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.760> full<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.150> 34<00:03:45.630> rocker

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
now this makes it a full we 34 rocker

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.870 
now this makes it a full we 34 rocker
and<00:03:46.170> remember<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.860> jinx<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.310> Annie<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.670> no

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.699 
and remember that jinx and Annie have no
ultimate<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.690> it's<00:03:48.840> hard<00:03:49.050> for<00:03:49.230> them<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.380> turn

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.800 
right onto her face this katelyn flash
actually<00:04:20.459> turns<00:04:20.700> out<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.910> be<00:04:21.060> really<00:04:21.540> bad

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
actually turns out to be really bad

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.600 
actually turns out to be really bad
because<00:04:22.080> Oriana<00:04:22.740> comes<00:04:23.070> from<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.370> side

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
because Oriana comes from the side

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.370 
because Oriana comes from the side
something<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.360> she<00:04:24.540> probably<00:04:24.750> should<00:04:25.200> have

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
something that she probably should have

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.050 
something that she probably should have
expected<00:04:25.770> but<00:04:26.040> in<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.430> heat<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.640> them

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
expected but in the heat of them

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.820 
expected but in the heat of them
it'd<00:04:27.330> be<00:04:27.450> really<00:04:27.780> hard<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.200> remember<00:04:28.530> that

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
it'd be really hard to remember that

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.530 
it'd be really hard to remember that
she's<00:04:29.010> going<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.250> come<00:04:29.400> from<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.730> side<00:04:29.970> now

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
she's going to come from that side now

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.790 
she's going to come from that side now
in<00:04:30.660> hindsight<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.320> would<00:04:31.440> have<00:04:31.530> been<00:04:31.590> much

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
in hindsight it would have been much

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.800 
in hindsight it would have been much
better<00:04:31.860> if<00:04:32.280> she<00:04:32.700> had<00:04:32.910> flash<00:04:33.270> one<00:04:33.510> I'm<00:04:33.600> showing

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
better if she had flash one I'm showing

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.870 
better if she had flash one I'm showing
you<00:04:33.960> now<00:04:34.230> instead<00:04:34.770> because<00:04:35.280> she<00:04:35.460> still<00:04:35.700> would

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
you now instead because she still would

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.520 
you now instead because she still would
have<00:04:35.910> been<00:04:36.060> able<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.419> attack<00:04:36.720> jinx<00:04:37.169> but<00:04:37.380> she

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
have been able to attack jinx but she

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.930 
have been able to attack jinx but she
wouldn't<00:04:37.860> be<00:04:37.919> in<00:04:38.010> range<00:04:38.220> for<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.550> Oriana

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
wouldn't be in range for the Oriana

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.090 
wouldn't be in range for the Oriana
ultimate<00:04:39.540> now<00:04:39.870> Oriana<00:04:40.290> actually<00:04:40.740> makes<00:04:40.919> a

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
ultimate now Oriana actually makes a

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.710 
ultimate now Oriana actually makes a
really<00:04:41.430> good<00:04:41.490> play<00:04:41.820> here<00:04:42.090> even<00:04:42.389> though<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.600> may

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
really good play here even though it may

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.629 
really good play here even though it may
not<00:04:42.750> seem<00:04:42.900> like<00:04:43.139> it<00:04:43.350> her<00:04:43.860> ultimate<00:04:44.040> catches

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
not seem like it her ultimate catches

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.280 
not seem like it her ultimate catches
both<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:45.030> them<00:04:45.150> here<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.600> it<00:04:45.810> results<00:04:46.200> in

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
both of them here and it results in

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.320 
both of them here and it results in
pantheon<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.919> Caitlyn<00:04:47.370> dying<00:04:47.639> now<00:04:48.120> if<00:04:48.210> she

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
pantheon and Caitlyn dying now if she

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.760 
pantheon and Caitlyn dying now if she
doesn't<00:04:48.630> come<00:04:48.750> in<00:04:48.930> here<00:04:49.110> then<00:04:49.260> rock<00:04:49.440> out<00:04:49.620> would

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
doesn't come in here then rock out would

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.680 
doesn't come in here then rock out would
have<00:04:49.889> won<00:04:50.070> this<00:04:50.220> fight<00:04:50.460> without<00:04:50.730> anyone<00:04:51.389> dying

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
have won this fight without anyone dying

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.360 
have won this fight without anyone dying
and<00:04:51.990> definitely<00:04:52.470> would<00:04:52.650> have<00:04:52.680> got<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.010> open

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
and definitely would have got the open

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
mid inhibitor the final thing I really

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.440 
mid inhibitor the final thing I really
want<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.830> point<00:04:56.010> out<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.220> why<00:04:56.700> rock<00:04:56.970> I<00:04:57.120> engage<00:04:57.419> a

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
want to point out is why rock I engage a

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.120 
want to point out is why rock I engage a
second<00:04:58.080> fight<00:04:58.260> when<00:04:58.500> they<00:04:58.530> would<00:04:58.740> have<00:04:58.860> known

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
second fight when they would have known

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.370 
second fight when they would have known
the<00:04:59.370> Oriana<00:04:59.700> would<00:04:59.940> loop<00:05:00.120> back<00:05:00.330> around<00:05:00.380> even

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
the Oriana would loop back around even

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.110 
the Oriana would loop back around even
though<00:05:01.410> fanatic<00:05:01.919> loses<00:05:02.160> fight<00:05:02.639> right<00:05:03.090> now

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
don't need to have amazing mechanics or

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.250
