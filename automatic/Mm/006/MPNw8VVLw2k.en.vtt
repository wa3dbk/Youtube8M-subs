him really dig a little deeper that's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.900 
him really dig a little deeper that's
one<00:00:58.379> mistake<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.070> think<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.460> has<00:00:59.579> made<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> lot

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
one mistake I think that has made a lot

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.020 
one mistake I think that has made a lot
of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> times<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.570> dating<00:01:00.899> his<00:01:01.379> people<00:01:02.030> they

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
of the times in dating his people they

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.000 
of the times in dating his people they
and<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.570> actually<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> rap

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and I actually I think a lot of the rap

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580 
and I actually I think a lot of the rap
with<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.180> bad<00:01:06.360> rap<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.810> young<00:01:07.020> marriage<00:01:07.290> has

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
with the bad rap that young marriage has

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.500 
with the bad rap that young marriage has
is<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.760> many<00:01:08.880> people<00:01:09.270> make<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
is because so many people make the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.060 
is because so many people make the
mistake<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.780> dating<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.470> digging<00:01:10.680> deep

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
mistake of dating and not digging deep

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
mistake of dating and not digging deep
and<00:01:11.220> getting<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> know<00:01:11.700> each<00:01:11.850> other<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.510> they
