00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.969
[Toddy:] Greggers, you half-witted hipster!

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.230
Get your ass in here!

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.870
All right, stupid, now toss in the ferret sphincters!

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.580
[Greggers:] Mustelid buttholes, check!

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.700
[Toddy:] Yes, yes, yes!

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.300
Top o' the world, ma!
Nyuuh-huhuhu-hu-hu-hu-hu!

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.180
[Greggers:] Whoa.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.290
Did it work, sir?

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.810
[Toddy:] With this power in my hand,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.690
there shall be none to oppose my will!

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.840
[Greggers:] It's just a gun?

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.670
[Toddy:] Well after takin' like a bajillion shots 
to the face, it was about time I wised up!

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.250
I've decided to fight fire with fire.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.750
That idiot Gundarr al-

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.090
[Greggers:] AaaaAAGH God!

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.400
(Greggers whimpering)
[Toddy:] Oooh.

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.900
(Greggers whimpering)
Boy, this thing's really got a hair trigger, huh?

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.190
Now, come on, it's not that bad.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.330
Just rub a little dirt on it, you wuss.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.450
[Greggers:] Aag- Everything's going black -

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.440
*cough* I can see a tunnel of 
*cough* white light...

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.180
[Toddy:] Well, I guess we know the gun works, huh?

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.680
Oh, and that bullet's comin' 
out of your paycheck, Greggers.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.060
Greggers?

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.950
*gasp*

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.360
Whoa! I'm like, totally passed away!

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.590
[Voice:] Greggers the Goblin.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.300
Welcome to the Hipster Hereafter!

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.630
[Greggers:] Ah, total mind blower!

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.800
But who are youh?

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.310
[Voice:] Bow before your lord and savior,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.990
Ironicles!

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.030
[Greggers:] Oh, hey Ironicles.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920
[Ironicles:] Yah, I'm pretty underground.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.640
You've probably never heard of me.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.730
[Greggers:] So do I get a harp, and wings,
and white robes and stuff?

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.810
[Ironicles:] Pffft. Please.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.520
That stuff is so mainstream.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.490
We give out fixed-gear bicycles 
and painter hats in hipster heaven.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.710
Harps are pretty "in" right now though.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.210
Have you ever heard of Joanna Newsom?

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.870
[Greggers:] No.
[Ironicles:] Oh, I have to send you a couple of links.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.150
She's great.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.860
But it is not yet your time, Greggers the Goblin!

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.170
You must return to the mortal plane.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.800
[Greggers:] What? W-w-wait, I'm not ready yet!

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.310
[Ironicles:] Return, Greggers! Return!

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.420
[Greggers:] But I wanted to go to heaven 
before it was cool!

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.810
[Toddy:] Ah, Greggers, thank goodness you're back.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.490
I thought I was gonna have to hire another intern!

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.930
[Greggers:] Oh, Mr. Toddy, 
I was just in the most amazing place!

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.990
It was all white-
and so ahead of the curve in terms of culture.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.720
I was at complete peace with-

00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:41.750
WAAAAAAH!

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.360
Yeah, I had to pop your head 
onto a chester white hog for a bit.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.580
Your new body should be ready in - mmm -
six to twelve months.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.460
