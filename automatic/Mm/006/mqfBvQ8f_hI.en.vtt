00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.029
 this program is presented to you in 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:21.550
 partnership with the saint mutual 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:24.600
 martin best smuggler of the commando 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.600
 can not get them to grow 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.850
 assets - and choose to have less than one 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.850
 some side 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.239
 it's forcing oneself to make choices 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.340
 renunciations 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.480
 the choice of the house for example the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.820
 choice of the house it was a 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.460
 path that lasted two years for us 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.110
 we visited maybe in all 40 and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.989
 the one we bought after the fact was 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.550
 not at all the favorite and the one at 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.140
 plural that we would have liked to acquire 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.629
 was not in our means 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.519
 in fact we did not want to change our 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.600
 financial mode of operation because 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.420
 of buying a house 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.009
 we did not want to feel ceret all 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.920
 least because we had a new 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:15.430
 home is not living more 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.280
 poorly who is important the important 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.649
 it's creating places and man and after 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.110
 everything else is settled through everything 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.479
 we do not have it to have more 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.539
 money more is to find a way 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.690
 of life the more we are together we eat 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:35.080
 and we are in touch with the neighbors and 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.899
 cetera after the goal maybe 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.539
 different but the important what has this 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.149
 feeling that we love each other and that 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.160
 we are not excluded from others and 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.929
 everyone is welcomed 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.179
 when we think sobriety for this not 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.590
 inevitably decrease oaths 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.289
 go back no it's just 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.229
 may know how to impose limits 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.830
 and that it limits ensuring that the property 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.009
 common remains at all times 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.440
 the orientation of our acts to know that 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.420
 we're not here to make sure 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.580
 just a number is doing well 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.230
 okay because these are the most 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.630
 armed to live in today's world 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.849
 but all of our brothers and sisters 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.750
 and their place in today's world I 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.690
 know what you would like wears a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.720
 anniversary 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.930
 we saw that no, but you have to know 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.840
 well 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.220
 you have to choose a gift 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.600
 announce ok but I was not there 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.710
 when we go shopping with 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.450
 my daughter who is 5 years old and she often 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.140
 said at one point I would like this I 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.090
 would like this is where moms and we are 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.550
 I always very sensitive within the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.370
 desires of our children buy and that's 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.069
 a pleasure too and 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.500
 and I think we have to live these 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.290
 pleasures peacefully but it is not necessary 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.659
 return to the pleasures at each 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.959
 minute and every day and at every 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.790
 moment 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.540
 no it's not possible we sing 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.629
 always this call to poverty something 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.120
 so I say it like that to it is not 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.970
 to be poor for you the expense but to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.049
 poverty maybe kennel learns 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.049
 the gospel is a retention that I 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.329
 see if the tension too so that the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.769
 children and all we have 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:31.010
 received before the tensions to appear 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.420
 fayat and a tension because the desire 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.930
 to have more money 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.450
 fecamp the months the house in etc 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.459
 there is a danger difficulty 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.739
 today it's the dispersion of the 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.099
 family through television to 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.590
 through social but the important thing is 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.079
 even though family life is 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.019
 well protected and died but not 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:57.109
 closed on itself with others with 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.540
 other children and talk about them 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.720
 suffering situations of our 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.700
 world to help children also to 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.540
 cultivate their own conscience 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.540
 personal 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.570
 working on it very concretely 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.220
 means to earn less to earn less than 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.990
 for equivalent work in a 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.720
 other structure is a healthy tension 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.030
 must be honest it's not easy to 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.710
 choose it will be chosen it is decided we have 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.990
 children we had needs like 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.890
 anyone is left dispossessed of 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.100
 material wealth 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.480
 I am more in domestic availability 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.640
 like to open then to live soberly 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.290
 now does not impose material all of 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.910
 less c will be more available the 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.050
 human relationship and that's a 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.540
 wealth that I find much more 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.700
 interesting in fact you're more than a 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.780
 depth that tends the world of 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.750
 competition rivalry where I have to 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.140
 to prove from the social point of view but 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.930
 let's open our hearts to tenderness 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.780
 to wisdom and everything is settled 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.720
 do you have to be m and people 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.560
 wise you have to know the practice of 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.820
 listening to take time for that 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.620
 it's a little that the sobriety happy 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.660
 if you mean I'm happy because 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:24.050
 that I'm running at a pace that's 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.140
 allows me to register in the duration 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:31.650
 I'm not late nor in advance I 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.880
 am in my time I live your said live 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.230
 the kingdom of god I begin with the 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.550
 office today that's it it takes 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.560
 actually introduce a space of 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.780
 certainly more free 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.100
 important is to free up time 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.430
 is not directly productive 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.040
 because there are revelations that 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.140
 can be as strong and fruitful as 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.780
 in silence but the important thing is 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.260
 the quality of love the quality of 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.230
 opening to neighbors and to others this 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.710
 does not create closed places where we 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.600
 think only of yourself and blood well-being 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.050
 no it's something wider 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.780
 that the economy was at the 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.200
 folate cosmology of enough touch 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.710
 to open up more for a world where 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.430
 there is more love 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.430
 I 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.620
 I dunno 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.680
 the
