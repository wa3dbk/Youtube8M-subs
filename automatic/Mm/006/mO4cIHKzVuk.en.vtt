and<00:00:01.520> the<00:00:02.520> substance<00:00:02.939> of<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.060> tree<00:00:03.240> is<00:00:03.360> carbon

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
and the substance of the tree is carbon

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.150 
and the substance of the tree is carbon
where<00:00:03.990> did<00:00:04.110> that<00:00:04.230> come<00:00:04.500> from

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
where did that come from

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.789 
where did that come from
that<00:00:05.730> comes<00:00:05.970> from<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.299> air<00:00:06.440> it's<00:00:07.440> carbon

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
that comes from the air it's carbon

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.350 
that comes from the air it's carbon
dioxide<00:00:08.280> from<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.460> air<00:00:08.519> people<00:00:08.970> who<00:00:09.090> look<00:00:09.210> at

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
dioxide from the air people who look at

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.940 
dioxide from the air people who look at
trees<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.840> they<00:00:09.929> think<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.349> comes<00:00:10.559> out<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
trees and they think it comes out of the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.950 
trees and they think it comes out of the
ground<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.880> plants<00:00:12.210> crawl<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
ground but plants crawl out of the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.600 
ground but plants crawl out of the
ground<00:00:13.200> but<00:00:13.440> if<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.620> ask<00:00:13.740> where<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
ground but if you ask where the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.359 
ground but if you ask where the
substance<00:00:15.179> comes<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:16.260> find<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:16.740> where<00:00:17.279> does

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
substance comes you find out where does

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.040 
substance comes you find out where does
it<00:00:17.520> come<00:00:17.640> from<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.330> trees<00:00:18.570> come<00:00:18.750> out<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
it come from the trees come out of the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.439 
it come from the trees come out of the
yeah<00:00:19.460> they<00:00:20.460> surely<00:00:20.730> come<00:00:21.000> out<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.300> no

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
yeah they surely come out of here no

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.050 
yeah they surely come out of here no
they<00:00:21.720> come<00:00:21.900> out<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> air<00:00:22.910> become<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
they come out of the air become the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.089 
they come out of the air become the
oxide<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.630> air<00:00:24.930> goes<00:00:25.170> into<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.590> tree<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
oxide in the air goes into the tree and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.370 
oxide in the air goes into the tree and
it<00:00:26.910> changes<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.510> kicking<00:00:28.019> out<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.170> oxygen<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
it changes it kicking out the oxygen and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.840 
it changes it kicking out the oxygen and
pushing<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> oxygen<00:00:31.949> away<00:00:32.070> from<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> carbon

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
pushing the oxygen away from the carbon

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.090 
pushing the oxygen away from the carbon
and<00:00:33.030> leaving<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.140> carbon<00:00:34.559> substance<00:00:34.950> with

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and leaving the carbon substance with

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.850 
and leaving the carbon substance with
water<00:00:35.630> water<00:00:36.630> comes<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.290> ground<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
water water comes out of the ground you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.160 
water water comes out of the ground you
see<00:00:37.890> only<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> get<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:39.870> came

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
see only to have to get in there came

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.600 
see only to have to get in there came
out<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> air<00:00:40.680> didn't<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> he<00:00:41.250> came<00:00:41.430> down

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
out of the air didn't it he came down

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.330 
out of the air didn't it he came down
from<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> sky<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> never<00:00:43.170> fact<00:00:43.649> most<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
from the sky so I never fact most of a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.889 
from the sky so I never fact most of a
tree<00:00:44.579> almost<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> tree<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:45.870> of

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
tree almost all of the tree is out of

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.900 
tree almost all of the tree is out of
the<00:00:46.050> air<00:00:46.200> there's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the air there's a little bit from the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.819 
the air there's a little bit from the
ground<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.510> minerals<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.320> forth<00:00:50.510> now<00:00:51.829> of

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
ground some minerals and so forth now of

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.560 
ground some minerals and so forth now of
course<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.309> told<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> oxygen<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.360> we

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
course I told you the oxygen and we

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.660 
course I told you the oxygen and we
treasons<00:00:54.989> know<00:00:55.320> dioxygen<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> carbon<00:00:56.430> stick

treasons know dioxygen and carbon stick

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.599 
treasons know dioxygen and carbon stick
together<00:00:56.850> bet<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:57.539> tight<00:00:58.160> how<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
together bet very tight how is it the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
together bet very tight how is it the
tree<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.239> smart<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.170> manage<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.590> take

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
tree is so smart is to manage to take

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.830 
tree is so smart is to manage to take
the<00:01:02.100> carbon<00:01:02.489> dioxide<00:01:03.120> which<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> carbon

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the carbon dioxide which is the carbon

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.350 
the carbon dioxide which is the carbon
oxygen<00:01:04.260> nicely<00:01:04.739> combined<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.460> undo<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:05.909> so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
oxygen nicely combined and undo that so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.410 
oxygen nicely combined and undo that so
easy<00:01:06.600> ah<00:01:07.100> life<00:01:08.100> life<00:01:08.580> has<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:09.119> mysterious

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
easy ah life life has some mysterious

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.219 
easy ah life life has some mysterious
force<00:01:09.869> no<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.070> sun<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.460> shining<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
force no the sun is shining and it's the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.990 
force no the sun is shining and it's the
sunlight<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.890> comes<00:01:14.130> down<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.520> knocks<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
sunlight that comes down and knocks the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.300 
sunlight that comes down and knocks the
oxygen<00:01:15.600> away<00:01:15.720> from<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> carbon<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> takes

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
oxygen away from the carbon so it takes

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.090 
oxygen away from the carbon so it takes
sunlight<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> plant<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.600> work<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.200> so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
sunlight to get the plant to work and so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.010 
sunlight to get the plant to work and so
the<00:01:20.250> Sun<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.030> time<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.509> doing<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.900> work

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the Sun all the time is doing the work

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.749 
the Sun all the time is doing the work
of<00:01:22.200> separating<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> oxygen<00:01:23.280> away<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
of separating the oxygen away from the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.219 
of separating the oxygen away from the
cob<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> oxygen<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.720> some<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
cob and the oxygen is some kind of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.800 
cob and the oxygen is some kind of
terrible<00:01:25.530> by-product<00:01:26.430> which<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:27.210> spits<00:01:27.570> back

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
terrible by-product which it spits back

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.289 
terrible by-product which it spits back
into<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> air<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.770> leaving<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> carbon<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
into the air and leaving the carbon and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
into the air and leaving the carbon and
water<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.900> stuff<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.380> make<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> substance<00:01:32.100> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
water and stuff to make the substance of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.670 
water and stuff to make the substance of
the<00:01:32.310> tree<00:01:32.840> then<00:01:33.840> when<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.049> take<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> substance

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the tree then when we take the substance

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.380 
the tree then when we take the substance
of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> tree<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.790> stick<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
of the tree and stick it in the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.219 
of the tree and stick it in the
fireplace<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> holy<00:01:39.659> oxygen

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
fireplace and the is the holy oxygen

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.160 
fireplace and the is the holy oxygen
made<00:01:40.409> by<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:40.680> trees<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.570> all<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> copy<00:01:42.930> wood

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
made by these trees and all a copy wood

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
made by these trees and all a copy wood
would<00:01:43.350> much<00:01:43.649> prefer<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.490> close<00:01:44.729> together

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
would much prefer to be close together

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.170 
would much prefer to be close together
again<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.780> once<00:01:46.740> she'd<00:01:46.950> let<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.610> heat<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.030> get

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
again and once she'd let the heat to get

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.410 
again and once she'd let the heat to get
it<00:01:48.299> started<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.560> continues<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> makes<00:01:51.270> an

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it started it continues and makes an

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.090 
it started it continues and makes an
awful<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.810> activity<00:01:52.439> while<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.860> going

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
awful lot of activity while it's going

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100 
awful lot of activity while it's going
back<00:01:53.250> together<00:01:53.460> again<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.869> nice

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
back together again and all this nice

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.450 
back together again and all this nice
light<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.470> everything<00:01:55.770> comes

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
light and everything comes

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.460 
light and everything comes
and<00:01:56.880> everything<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.480> being<00:01:57.630> undone<00:01:58.200> you're

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
and everything is being undone you're

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.290 
and everything is being undone you're
going<00:01:58.710> back<00:01:58.890> from<00:01:59.040> carbon<00:01:59.490> oxygen<00:01:59.820> back<00:02:00.120> to

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
going back from carbon oxygen back to

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.380 
going back from carbon oxygen back to
carbon<00:02:00.660> dioxide<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.880> light<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> heat

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
carbon dioxide and the light and heat

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.670 
carbon dioxide and the light and heat
that's<00:02:03.570> coming<00:02:03.660> out<00:02:04.020> that's<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.380> light<00:02:04.530> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that's coming out that's the light and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.660 
that's coming out that's the light and
heat<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> Sun<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.580> went<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:08.490> it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
heat of the Sun that went in so it's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.650 
heat of the Sun that went in so it's
sort<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:08.970> stored<00:02:09.560> Sun<00:02:10.560> that's<00:02:11.130> coming<00:02:11.490> out

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
sort of stored Sun that's coming out

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.170 
sort of stored Sun that's coming out
when<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.780> burn<00:02:12.990> it
