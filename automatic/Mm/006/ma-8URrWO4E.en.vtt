00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
so much but I think it was a pretty cool

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.990 
so much but I think it was a pretty cool
song<00:00:21.869> by<00:00:22.170> God<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.340> was<00:00:23.400> pretty<00:00:23.550> decent

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
song by God I think I was pretty decent

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.939 
song by God I think I was pretty decent
just<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.480> my<00:00:24.660> personal<00:00:25.199> favorites<00:00:25.500> so
