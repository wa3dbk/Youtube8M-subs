whatever you want then that is easy

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.770 
whatever you want then that is easy
enough<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:50.340> well<00:01:50.369> I'll<00:01:51.240> say<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.540> is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
enough to do so as well I'll say this is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.840 
enough to do so as well I'll say this is
one<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> most<00:01:52.079> affordable<00:01:52.409> options<00:01:52.850> again

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
one of the most affordable options again

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.340 
one of the most affordable options again
in<00:01:53.970> terms<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.299> protection<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.290> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
in terms of protection it's not going to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.999 
in terms of protection it's not going to
be<00:01:55.439> amazing

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
be amazing

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.319 
be amazing
but<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.250> will<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.490> better<00:01:56.640> than<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> rocks<00:01:57.090> fit

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
but it will be better than the rocks fit

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.280 
but it will be better than the rocks fit

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
just a really small type in angle then

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.570 
just a really small type in angle then
the<00:03:20.390> other<00:03:20.570> option<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.140> there<00:03:21.709> as<00:03:21.920> well<00:03:22.130> which

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
the other option is there as well which

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.229 
the other option is there as well which
is<00:03:22.640> on<00:03:22.820> there

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239
