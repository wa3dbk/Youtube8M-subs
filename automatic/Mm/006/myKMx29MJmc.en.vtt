might be looking familiar this is called
the<00:00:14.730> G<00:00:15.240> mag<00:00:15.480> unit<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.590> saltwater<00:00:16.920> battery

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the G mag unit it's a saltwater battery

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.730 
the G mag unit it's a saltwater battery
charger<00:00:17.880> actually<00:00:18.779> short<00:00:19.020> for<00:00:19.050> green<00:00:19.500> evade

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
charger actually short for green evade

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.730 
charger actually short for green evade
of<00:00:19.859> magic<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> mouthful<00:00:21.300> there<00:00:21.330> um<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.320> did

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
of magic so a mouthful there um I did

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.099 
of magic so a mouthful there um I did
per<00:00:22.949> episode<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.789> guy<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> long<00:00:24.750> time<00:00:24.960> I'm

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
per episode on this guy a long time I'm

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.900 
per episode on this guy a long time I'm
probably<00:00:25.260> two<00:00:25.800> years<00:00:25.830> ago<00:00:26.250> or<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
probably two years ago or so one of the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.480 
probably two years ago or so one of the
very<00:00:27.150> very<00:00:27.330> first<00:00:27.599> ones<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.340> able

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
very very first ones and I was not able

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
very very first ones and I was not able
to<00:00:29.730> get<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:29.970> work<00:00:30.150> too<00:00:30.539> well<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.170> know

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to get it to work too well I don't know

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.959 
to get it to work too well I don't know
if<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.590> operator<00:00:31.980> error<00:00:32.070> or<00:00:32.640> if<00:00:32.700> there<00:00:32.850> was

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
if it was operator error or if there was

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.040 
if it was operator error or if there was
maybe<00:00:33.090> something<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.809> particular

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
maybe something up with that particular

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
maybe something up with that particular
unit<00:00:34.739> um<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.910> manufacturers<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:37.430> sold<00:00:38.430> tons

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
unit um the manufacturers have sold tons

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.850 
unit um the manufacturers have sold tons
of<00:00:38.850> them<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.329> had<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.989> know<00:00:40.079> nothing

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
of them and have had you know nothing

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.470 
of them and have had you know nothing
but<00:00:41.010> great<00:00:41.219> things<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.520> say<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.969> good

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
but great things to say and good

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.380 
but great things to say and good
feedback<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> stuff<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.230> customers<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.829> they

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
feedback and stuff in customers so they

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.490 
feedback and stuff in customers so they
noticed<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> my<00:00:45.719> original<00:00:46.140> video<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
noticed that my original video is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200 
noticed that my original video is
getting<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.800> lot<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:46.980> views<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> they<00:00:47.789> asked<00:00:48.090> if

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
getting a lot of views and they asked if

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.410 
getting a lot of views and they asked if
I<00:00:48.360> would<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.980> try<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.940> again<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I would like to try to do it again and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
I would like to try to do it again and
maybe<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.289> some<00:00:52.440> better<00:00:52.559> results<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.610> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
maybe have some better results this is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.209 
maybe have some better results this is
again<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.149> G<00:00:54.420> mag<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.870> uses<00:00:55.199> saltwater<00:00:55.739> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
again the G mag it uses saltwater to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.430 
again the G mag it uses saltwater to
charge<00:00:56.640> batteries<00:00:57.090> these<00:00:57.270> are<00:00:57.390> normal<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
charge batteries these are normal you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.010 
charge batteries these are normal you
know<00:00:58.559> double-a<00:00:59.190> these<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.719> nickel<00:01:00.719> metal

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
know double-a these are nickel metal

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.959 
know double-a these are nickel metal
hydride<00:01:01.140> batteries<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.430> rechargeable

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
hydride batteries so just rechargeable

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.200 
hydride batteries so just rechargeable
batteries<00:01:03.359> 1.2<00:01:04.320> volts<00:01:04.769> 14<00:01:05.670> hundred<00:01:05.760> million

batteries 1.2 volts 14 hundred million
per<00:01:06.360> hours<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.500> throw<00:01:07.710> these<00:01:07.890> guys<00:01:08.130> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
per hours you can throw these guys in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.910 
per hours you can throw these guys in
here<00:01:08.549> mix<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> saltwater<00:01:09.510> solution<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
here mix up a saltwater solution and in

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.899 
here mix up a saltwater solution and in
about<00:01:11.520> 40<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.590> 120<00:01:14.490> minutes<00:01:14.760> later

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
about 40 to you know 120 minutes later

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600 
about 40 to you know 120 minutes later
basically<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> two<00:01:16.259> hours<00:01:16.490> depending<00:01:17.490> on

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
basically one to two hours depending on

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
basically one to two hours depending on
how<00:01:17.700> many<00:01:17.759> batteries<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
how many batteries you do you have a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
how many batteries you do you have a
full<00:01:19.470> charge<00:01:19.710> through<00:01:20.220> two<00:01:20.549> batteries<00:01:20.939> at<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
full charge through two batteries at a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.260 
full charge through two batteries at a
time<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.630> 40<00:01:22.020> minutes<00:01:22.320> 24<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.520> roughly<00:01:24.060> 80

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
time is 40 minutes 24 is roughly 80

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
time is 40 minutes 24 is roughly 80
minutes<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.780> say<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.290> mostly<00:01:25.770> empty<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
minutes they say if it's mostly empty to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190 
minutes they say if it's mostly empty to
get<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.670> basically<00:01:27.090> full<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
get it to basically full and then if you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.630 
get it to basically full and then if you
want<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:28.680> six<00:01:28.950> batteries<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.520> here

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
want to do all six batteries in here

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.999 
want to do all six batteries in here
it's<00:01:29.759> 120<00:01:30.360> minutes<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:30.960> hours<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.979> I

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it's 120 minutes or two hours so I

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.620 
it's 120 minutes or two hours so I
thought<00:01:32.340> we'd<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.790> fun<00:01:33.119> maybe<00:01:33.420> be

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
thought we'd have a little fun maybe be

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
thought we'd have a little fun maybe be
a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.720> bit<00:01:34.049> scientific<00:01:34.590> i<00:01:34.710> went<00:01:34.920> ahead<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
a little bit scientific i went ahead and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.100 
a little bit scientific i went ahead and
labeled<00:01:35.700> each<00:01:35.880> battery<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.470> i<00:01:37.500> wrote<00:01:37.799> ABCD<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
labeled each battery so i wrote ABCD on

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.600 
labeled each battery so i wrote ABCD on
depending<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> battery<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
depending on what the battery was and I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
depending on what the battery was and I
thought<00:01:41.640> we'd<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.710> multimeter<00:01:43.710> read

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
thought we'd do a little multimeter read

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.609 
thought we'd do a little multimeter read
here<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:45.000> existing<00:01:45.509> battery<00:01:46.049> charge<00:01:46.350> so

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
here on the existing battery charge so

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.899 
here on the existing battery charge so
that<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.799> guys<00:01:46.890> could<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.579> could<00:01:47.729> just

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
that you guys could see we could just

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.310 
that you guys could see we could just
you<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:48.869> scientific

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you know be a little more scientific

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.340 
you know be a little more scientific
it's<00:01:49.829> opening<00:01:50.220> charge<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.820> battery<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
it's opening charge on battery a and

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.639 
it's opening charge on battery a and
this<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.710> measuring<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> current<00:01:53.280> here<00:01:53.579> 2.8

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
this is measuring the current here 2.8

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.810 
this is measuring the current here 2.8
so<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.610> down<00:01:56.790> as<00:01:57.200> 2.8<00:01:58.369> ok<00:01:59.369> same<00:01:59.640> thing

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
so a is going down as 2.8 ok same thing

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.709 
so a is going down as 2.8 ok same thing
on<00:01:59.939> B<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.420> 2.9<00:02:02.630> see<00:02:03.630> looks<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
on B is 2.9 see looks like it is

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.210 
on B is 2.9 see looks like it is
three-point<00:02:06.719> oh

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
three-point oh

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:19.590 
three-point oh
on<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.370> multimeter<00:02:09.910> here<00:02:10.860> d<00:02:14.490> showing<00:02:18.600> 2.8

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
on the multimeter here d showing 2.8

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.400 
on the multimeter here d showing 2.8
22.9<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.830> roughly<00:02:21.100> there<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:23.200> I'm<00:02:23.260> going<00:02:23.290> to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
22.9 and roughly there so I'm going to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.350 
22.9 and roughly there so I'm going to
put<00:02:23.560> these<00:02:23.680> all<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.100> add<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.640> salt<00:02:24.850> solution

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
put these all in add the salt solution

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.360 
put these all in add the salt solution
and<00:02:25.540> start<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.080> clock

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.940 

so<00:02:30.370> again<00:02:30.610> all<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:30.880> need<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.210> charge<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:32.440> power

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
so again all you need to charge to power

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.090 
so again all you need to charge to power
this<00:02:33.190> charger<00:02:33.670> rather<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.210> salt<00:02:34.800> their<00:02:35.800> salt

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
this charger rather is salt their salt

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.890 
this charger rather is salt their salt
mixture<00:02:36.430> here<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.880> then<00:02:37.030> water<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.720> make

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
mixture here and then water so you make

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.559 
mixture here and then water so you make
a<00:02:37.930> little<00:02:38.170> solution<00:02:38.560> out<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.800> it

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.780 

so<00:02:43.439> there's<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.680> hole<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.129> top<00:02:44.159> right<00:02:44.549> there

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
so there's a hole on the top right there

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.789 
so there's a hole on the top right there
it's<00:02:45.450> actually<00:02:45.569> stopped<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:46.379> with<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> little

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
it's actually stopped up with a little

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.530 
it's actually stopped up with a little
rubber<00:02:47.010> stopper<00:02:47.459> when<00:02:47.609> you<00:02:47.700> first<00:02:47.969> get<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.329> you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
rubber stopper when you first get it you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.530 
rubber stopper when you first get it you
just<00:02:48.659> take<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:48.930> out<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.439> then<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:51.269> guy

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
just take that out and then this guy

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.590 
just take that out and then this guy
right<00:02:51.659> here

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.120 

we're<00:02:57.080> going<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.260> go<00:02:57.380> ahead<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.650> call<00:02:57.920> it

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
we're going to go ahead and call it

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.170 
we're going to go ahead and call it
starting<00:02:58.640> at<00:02:59.620> 649<00:03:00.730> alright<00:03:01.730> guys<00:03:01.820> so<00:03:02.000> at<00:03:02.090> this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
starting at 649 alright guys so at this

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.110 
starting at 649 alright guys so at this
point<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.600> actually<00:03:02.780> been<00:03:03.050> in<00:03:03.140> full<00:03:04.120> 82

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
point it is actually been in full 82

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.780 
point it is actually been in full 82
minutes<00:03:05.420> 11<00:03:06.290> instead<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.590> 8<00:03:06.710> 09<00:03:06.860> why<00:03:07.610> don't<00:03:07.760> I

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
minutes 11 instead of 8 09 why don't I

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.370 
minutes 11 instead of 8 09 why don't I
pull<00:03:08.000> these<00:03:08.120> guys<00:03:08.330> out<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:08.810> we'll<00:03:09.050> just<00:03:09.170> see

pull these guys out and we'll just see

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.010 
pull these guys out and we'll just see
how<00:03:09.500> they<00:03:09.620> did<00:03:09.800> here<00:03:10.210> so<00:03:11.210> final<00:03:11.600> read<00:03:11.780> on

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
how they did here so final read on

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.260 
how they did here so final read on
battery<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.970> 3.7<00:03:14.860> not<00:03:15.860> too<00:03:16.040> shabby<00:03:16.280> write<00:03:17.240> that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
battery a 3.7 not too shabby write that

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.540 
battery a 3.7 not too shabby write that
down<00:03:19.270> battery<00:03:20.270> be<00:03:20.510> also<00:03:20.800> 3.7<00:03:21.880> battery<00:03:22.880> see

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
down battery be also 3.7 battery see

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.940 
down battery be also 3.7 battery see
also<00:03:25.550> 3.7<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:28.250> after<00:03:28.370> seeing<00:03:28.700> those<00:03:29.000> four

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
also 3.7 so after seeing those four

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.440 
also 3.7 so after seeing those four
results<00:03:30.950> they're<00:03:31.100> coming<00:03:31.550> into<00:03:31.700> 3.7<00:03:32.330> I'm

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
results they're coming into 3.7 I'm

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.330 
results they're coming into 3.7 I'm
actually<00:03:32.630> not<00:03:32.900> sure<00:03:32.960> if<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.830> particular

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
actually not sure if this particular

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.640 
actually not sure if this particular
battery<00:03:34.760> if<00:03:35.630> that's<00:03:35.810> if<00:03:36.200> that's<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.470> full

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
battery if that's if that's a full

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.290 
battery if that's if that's a full
charge<00:03:36.890> for<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.250> could<00:03:37.580> very<00:03:37.940> well<00:03:37.970> could<00:03:38.270> be

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
charge for it could very well could be

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.020 
charge for it could very well could be
in<00:03:38.660> any<00:03:38.870> case<00:03:39.170> we<00:03:39.890> started<00:03:40.190> off<00:03:40.310> at<00:03:40.460> 2.8<00:03:40.880> and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
in any case we started off at 2.8 and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.160 
in any case we started off at 2.8 and
2.9<00:03:41.390> in<00:03:41.860> in<00:03:42.860> just<00:03:43.760> 80<00:03:44.270> minutes<00:03:44.660> an<00:03:44.750> hour<00:03:44.810> 20

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
2.9 in in just 80 minutes an hour 20

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.300 
2.9 in in just 80 minutes an hour 20
minutes<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.500> be<00:03:45.590> sitting<00:03:45.860> here<00:03:45.950> doing<00:03:46.100> some

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
minutes and be sitting here doing some

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.850 
minutes and be sitting here doing some
work<00:03:46.550> with<00:03:46.820> this<00:03:47.360> little<00:03:47.570> puppy<00:03:47.870> purring<00:03:48.260> got

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
work with this little puppy purring got

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.850 
work with this little puppy purring got
these<00:03:49.070> guys<00:03:49.250> up<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:50.080> 3.7<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.440> pretty<00:03:51.740> cool

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
these guys up to 3.7 so pretty cool

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.460 
these guys up to 3.7 so pretty cool
technology<00:03:52.430> guys<00:03:52.580> I<00:03:52.820> think<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:54.110> know<00:03:54.230> if<00:03:54.350> we

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
technology guys I think you know if we

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.020 
technology guys I think you know if we
don't<00:03:54.590> have<00:03:54.680> power<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.340> need<00:03:55.490> to<00:03:55.670> power

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
don't have power and you need to power

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.670 
don't have power and you need to power
your<00:03:56.210> small<00:03:56.510> double<00:03:57.020> a<00:03:57.110> type<00:03:57.350> devices

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
your small double a type devices

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.520 
your small double a type devices
flashlights<00:03:58.490> things<00:03:58.700> like<00:03:58.820> that<00:03:59.380> this<00:04:00.380> is

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
flashlights things like that this is

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.320 
flashlights things like that this is
something<00:04:00.800> that<00:04:00.860> can<00:04:01.010> make<00:04:01.040> some<00:04:01.280> sense<00:04:01.460> what

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
something that can make some sense what

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.970 
something that can make some sense what
I<00:04:02.360> also<00:04:02.510> think<00:04:02.780> is<00:04:02.960> really<00:04:03.200> interesting<00:04:03.230> is

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
I also think is really interesting is

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.490 
I also think is really interesting is
when<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:04.880> start<00:04:04.940> blowing<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.840> out<00:04:06.050> to<00:04:06.470> a
