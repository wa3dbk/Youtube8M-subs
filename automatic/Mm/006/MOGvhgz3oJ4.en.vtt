00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.830 
go with gold and you know the stripes
are<00:02:10.069> pretty<00:02:10.369> clean<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:11.209> part<00:02:11.450> over<00:02:11.629> here<00:02:11.780> is

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
are pretty clean this part over here is

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.229 
are pretty clean this part over here is
pretty<00:02:12.140> ok<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.950> alright<00:02:13.370> there's<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:14.180> know

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
pretty ok it's alright there's you know

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.970 
pretty ok it's alright there's you know
some<00:02:14.599> parts<00:02:14.870> where<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.140> gets<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.440> little<00:02:15.590> I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
some parts where it gets a little I

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.440 
some parts where it gets a little I
don't<00:02:16.099> know<00:02:16.190> sketchy<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.940> could<00:02:17.120> see<00:02:17.269> some

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
don't know sketchy you could see some

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.369 
don't know sketchy you could see some
white<00:02:17.659> coming<00:02:17.959> through<00:02:18.140> from<00:02:18.260> underneath

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
white coming through from underneath

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.199 
white coming through from underneath
there<00:02:18.890> looks<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:19.459> they<00:02:19.580> painted<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.060> white

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
there looks like they painted it white

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.550 
there looks like they painted it white
and<00:02:20.390> then<00:02:20.480> painted<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.900> yellow<00:02:21.080> over<00:02:21.440> it

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
and then painted the yellow over it

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.679 
and then painted the yellow over it
which<00:02:21.709> i<00:02:21.830> think<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.159> good<00:02:22.430> move<00:02:22.730> but<00:02:23.390> you

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
which i think is a good move but you

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.600 
which i think is a good move but you
know<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.930> stripes<00:02:24.260> overall<00:02:25.159> are<00:02:25.310> pretty

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
know the stripes overall are pretty

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.399 
know the stripes overall are pretty
clean<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.000> then<00:02:26.299> this<00:02:26.510> right<00:02:26.720> here<00:02:26.959> is<00:02:27.080> yellow

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
clean and then this right here is yellow

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.440 
clean and then this right here is yellow
plastic<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.159> it<00:02:28.280> does<00:02:28.430> not<00:02:28.730> match<00:02:29.150> with<00:02:29.390> the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
plastic and it does not match with the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.149 
plastic and it does not match with the
rest<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.959> figure<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.739> can<00:02:30.920> see<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
rest of the figure so you can see the

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.470 
rest of the figure so you can see the
color<00:02:31.340> difference<00:02:31.430> right<00:02:31.849> there<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.420> is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
color difference right there this is

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.080 
color difference right there this is
definitely<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.319> much<00:02:33.739> darker<00:02:34.069> yellow<00:02:34.640> than

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
definitely a much darker yellow than

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.880 
definitely a much darker yellow than
this<00:02:35.330> over<00:02:35.690> here<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.170> stripes<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:36.740> this

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890
