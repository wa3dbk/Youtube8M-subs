00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
actually flew from Ethiopia up to Rome

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.670 
actually flew from Ethiopia up to Rome
and<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.270> plane<00:04:43.509> refueled<00:04:44.169> because<00:04:44.470> when<00:04:44.590> we

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
and the plane refueled because when we

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.290 
and the plane refueled because when we
sit<00:04:44.860> from<00:04:45.039> Toronto<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.370> Addis<00:04:45.759> it<00:04:45.940> took<00:04:46.060> 12

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
sit from Toronto to Addis it took 12

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.719 
sit from Toronto to Addis it took 12
hours<00:04:46.419> but<00:04:47.139> to<00:04:47.289> fly<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.530> back<00:04:47.590> it<00:04:48.039> takes<00:04:48.280> 16

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
hours but to fly it back it takes 16

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.309 
hours but to fly it back it takes 16
hours<00:04:48.879> because<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.569> earth<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:49.960> rotating

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
hours because the earth is rotating

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.610 
hours because the earth is rotating
underneath<00:04:51.009> us<00:04:51.340> while<00:04:51.970> we<00:04:52.180> fly<00:04:52.360> so<00:04:53.169> it<00:04:53.319> takes

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
underneath us while we fly so it takes

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.520 
underneath us while we fly so it takes
longer<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:54.340> fly<00:04:54.580> west<00:04:55.419> than<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:55.990> does<00:04:56.169> to<00:04:56.349> fly

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
longer to fly west than it does to fly

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.240 
longer to fly west than it does to fly
east<00:04:56.830> which<00:04:57.639> is<00:04:57.900> annoying<00:04:58.900> but<00:04:59.740> you<00:05:00.009> know

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.560
