questions about this requirement so
we'll<00:03:59.470> just<00:03:59.500> go<00:03:59.799> over<00:03:59.920> an<00:04:00.100> example<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.610> better

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
we'll just go over an example to better

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.870 
we'll just go over an example to better
explain<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.620> for<00:04:02.620> example<00:04:03.130> let's<00:04:03.280> look<00:04:03.640> at<00:04:03.850> a

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
explain it for example let's look at a

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.810 
explain it for example let's look at a
student<00:04:04.330> who's<00:04:04.510> taking<00:04:04.930> 12<00:04:05.170> units<00:04:05.610> based<00:04:06.610> on

our financial aid requirements they are

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.140 
our financial aid requirements they are
expected<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.130> complete<00:04:09.519> at<00:04:09.730> least<00:04:09.880> eight

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
expected to complete at least eight

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.420 
expected to complete at least eight
point<00:04:10.540> five<00:04:10.780> units<00:04:11.260> or<00:04:11.410> more<00:04:11.590> without<00:04:12.100> least

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
point five units or more without least

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.949 
point five units or more without least
these<00:04:12.610> are<00:04:12.790> better<00:04:12.940> in<00:04:13.239> order<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.600> stay<00:04:13.660> on

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
these are better in order to stay on

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.830 
these are better in order to stay on
good<00:04:14.140> financial<00:04:14.769> aid<00:04:14.860> standing<00:04:15.630> 8.5<00:04:16.630> is

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
good financial aid standing 8.5 is

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.880 
good financial aid standing 8.5 is
basically<00:04:17.350> sixty-seven<00:04:17.950> percent<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.459> 12<00:04:19.890> so

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
basically sixty-seven percent of 12 so

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.529 
basically sixty-seven percent of 12 so
let's<00:04:21.099> say<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.340> student<00:04:21.640> drops<00:04:22.030> out<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.270> there

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
let's say a student drops out of there

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.120 
let's say a student drops out of there
for<00:04:22.750> unit<00:04:23.110> class<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.650> receives<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.130> w<00:04:24.460> grade

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
for unit class and receives a w grade

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.340 
for unit class and receives a w grade
withdrawal<00:04:25.490> great<00:04:25.820> this<00:04:26.690> means<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.200> the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
withdrawal great this means that the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.380 
withdrawal great this means that the
student<00:04:27.830> would<00:04:28.130> now<00:04:28.370> be<00:04:28.610> enrolled<00:04:28.970> at<00:04:29.150> eight

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
student would now be enrolled at eight

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.170 
student would now be enrolled at eight
remaining<00:04:29.870> units<00:04:30.430> because<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> student<00:04:31.940> fell

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
remaining units because the student fell

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.590 
remaining units because the student fell
below<00:04:32.390> 67%<00:04:33.310> requirement<00:04:34.310> or<00:04:34.460> basically<00:04:35.360> fell

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
below 67% requirement or basically fell

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.380 
below 67% requirement or basically fell
below<00:04:35.780> 8.5<00:04:36.590> units<00:04:37.100> then<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.910> student<00:04:38.240> would

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
below 8.5 units then the student would

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.270 
below 8.5 units then the student would
automatically<00:04:39.020> placed<00:04:39.440> on<00:04:39.620> probation<00:04:39.860> or

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
automatically placed on probation or

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.300 
automatically placed on probation or
suspension<00:04:40.460> status<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.360> following<00:04:41.690> semester

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
suspension status the following semester

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.100 
suspension status the following semester
so<00:04:43.310> this<00:04:43.490> shows<00:04:43.700> how<00:04:43.970> much<00:04:44.120> getting<00:04:44.510> w<00:04:44.840> grades

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
so this shows how much getting w grades

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.630 
so this shows how much getting w grades
and<00:04:45.320> dropping<00:04:45.800> out<00:04:45.890> of<00:04:46.010> classes<00:04:46.220> can

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
and dropping out of classes can

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.330 
and dropping out of classes can
