much<00:02:46.240> what<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.420> does<00:02:46.690> now<00:02:47.320> moving<00:02:47.890> on<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.160> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
much what that does now moving on to the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.460 
much what that does now moving on to the
amplifier<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:49.150> works<00:02:49.600> in<00:02:49.870> conjunction<00:02:50.050> with

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
amplifier this works in conjunction with

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.590 
amplifier this works in conjunction with
the<00:02:50.620> guitars<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.550> guitars<00:02:51.910> when<00:02:52.240> you<00:02:52.360> play<00:02:52.540> it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
the guitars the guitars when you play it

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.960 
the guitars the guitars when you play it
normally<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.320> sounds<00:02:53.560> like<00:02:53.650> bad<00:02:53.860> but<00:02:54.670> if<00:02:54.850> you

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
normally it sounds like bad but if you

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.850 
normally it sounds like bad but if you
turn<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.360> amplifier<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:56.290> right<00:02:56.710> click

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
turn on the amplifier and right click

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.920 
turn on the amplifier and right click
with<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.160> guitar<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:57.640> press<00:02:57.820> G<00:02:58.120> it'll<00:02:58.750> say

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
with the guitar and press G it'll say

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.450 
with the guitar and press G it'll say
distorted<00:02:59.470> when<00:02:59.680> you<00:02:59.770> play<00:03:00.010> it

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:16.410 

every<00:03:07.460> metal<00:03:07.820> that<00:03:08.060> fire

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.580 

so<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.900> pretty<00:03:18.020> much<00:03:18.200> what<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.440> does

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
so that is pretty much what it does

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.130 
so that is pretty much what it does
it'll<00:03:18.860> turn<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.160> into<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.490> a<00:03:20.140> electric

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
it'll turn it into like a electric

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.980 
it'll turn it into like a electric
guitar<00:03:21.440> heavy<00:03:21.980> bass<00:03:22.850> sounding<00:03:23.600> thing<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:23.930> don't
