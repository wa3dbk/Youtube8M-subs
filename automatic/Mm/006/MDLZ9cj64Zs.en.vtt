oh<00:00:00.030> yeah<00:00:00.269> just<00:00:00.659> relax<00:00:00.900> Pete<00:00:01.560> here<00:00:01.860> with<00:00:02.010> the

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
oh yeah just relax Pete here with the

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.329 
oh yeah just relax Pete here with the
gate<00:00:03.060> torque<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:03.840> wanted<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.740> make<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.920> review<00:00:05.250> of

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
gate torque I wanted to make a review of

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.589 
gate torque I wanted to make a review of
this<00:00:05.430> head<00:00:06.080> first<00:00:07.080> off<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.490> fairly<00:00:08.940> flexi

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
this head first off it is a fairly flexi

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.150 
this head first off it is a fairly flexi
head<00:00:10.460> that's<00:00:11.460> flexible<00:00:11.700> some<00:00:12.269> others<00:00:12.540> but

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
head that's flexible some others but

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.540 
head that's flexible some others but
definitely<00:00:14.160> has<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> little<00:00:14.870> wax<00:00:15.870> at<00:00:16.170> some<00:00:16.550> one

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
definitely has a little wax at some one

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.710 
definitely has a little wax at some one
say<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:17.940> flimsy<00:00:19.340> because<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.609> top<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.300> not

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
say it's flimsy because the top is not

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.570 
say it's flimsy because the top is not
too<00:00:21.990> flexy<00:00:22.820> which<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.970> good<00:00:25.369> useful<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> lot

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
too flexy which is good useful for a lot

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.800 
too flexy which is good useful for a lot
of<00:00:26.699> different<00:00:26.849> things<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.420> get<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> little

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
of different things you get a little

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.179 
of different things you get a little
more<00:00:27.930> power<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.560> shot<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> little

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
more power on your shot if it's a little

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.440 
more power on your shot if it's a little
buggy<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.150> flexing<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> top<00:00:32.450> wall

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
buggy it's not flexing on the top wall

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.319 
buggy it's not flexing on the top wall
as<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.170> bottom<00:00:35.000> also<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.090> kind<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
as it is on the bottom also it kind of

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.500 
as it is on the bottom also it kind of
has<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:38.030> don't<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:39.090> what's<00:00:39.239> called<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
has that I don't know what's called the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.270 
has that I don't know what's called the
other<00:00:39.690> extra<00:00:40.230> track<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> call<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
other extra track I like to call it the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.600 
other extra track I like to call it the
second<00:00:41.760> dimension<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> head<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.610> that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
second dimension of the head and that

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.860 
second dimension of the head and that
gives<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.180> training<00:00:45.690> options

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
gives you a little more training options

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.729 
gives you a little more training options
and<00:00:46.410> stuff<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:48.079> it<00:00:49.079> even<00:00:49.320> makes<00:00:49.559> it

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and stuff like that and it even makes it

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.510 
and stuff like that and it even makes it
a<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:49.980> more<00:00:51.469> pinched<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> top<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.280> guess

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a little more pinched at the top I guess

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.299 
a little more pinched at the top I guess
you<00:00:53.640> could<00:00:53.699> say<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.710> gives<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> little<00:00:56.010> more

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
you could say or gives it a little more

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.740 
you could say or gives it a little more
of<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> channel<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.559> head<00:00:59.359> also<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
of a channel to the head also one of the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.979 
of a channel to the head also one of the
best<00:01:00.899> things<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> talk<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.949> scoop<00:01:02.989> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
best things out the talk is the scoop it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.250 
best things out the talk is the scoop it
has<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> very<00:01:04.799> very<00:01:05.400> defined<00:01:05.790> Scoob<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.140> it's

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
has a very very defined Scoob so it's

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.640 
has a very very defined Scoob so it's
nice<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.740> ground<00:01:08.010> balls<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.650> it'll

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
nice for ground balls is just like it'll

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.969 
nice for ground balls is just like it'll
come<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.130> underneath<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.890> it's<00:01:13.890> kind

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
come right underneath it and it's kind

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.780 
come right underneath it and it's kind
of<00:01:14.159> perfect<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:16.369> mean<00:01:17.369> by<00:01:17.520> gate

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
of perfect for that I mean by gate

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.980 
of perfect for that I mean by gate
obviously<00:01:18.720> says<00:01:19.290> gate<00:01:19.619> torque<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
obviously says gate torque but a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.210 
obviously says gate torque but a
sidewall<00:01:21.990> design<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.770> lot<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> holes

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
sidewall design they have a lot of holes

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.210 
sidewall design they have a lot of holes
and<00:01:23.520> they<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.479> pretty<00:01:24.840> big<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and they are pretty big which can be a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.460 
and they are pretty big which can be a
little<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.549> annoying<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.110> rather<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.320> them

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
little bit annoying but rather have them

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
little bit annoying but rather have them
big<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.060> small<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.490> sidewall

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
big like that and small and sidewall

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.300 
big like that and small and sidewall
design<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.909> kind<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.270> nice<00:01:33.420> um<00:01:34.310> nothing

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
design it's kind of nice um nothing

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.359 
design it's kind of nice um nothing
special<00:01:35.759> data<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:37.290> overall<00:01:37.979> love

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
special data really but overall love

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.399 
special data really but overall love
this<00:01:38.520> head<00:01:38.720> we're<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> put<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
this head we're going to put on the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.679 
this head we're going to put on the
scale<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.310> 5<00:01:45.299> ounces

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
scale and it is right at about 5 ounces

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.100 
scale and it is right at about 5 ounces
my<00:01:46.409> camera<00:01:47.009> can't<00:01:47.549> really<00:01:47.689> give<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.930> full

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
my camera can't really give you the full

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.880 
my camera can't really give you the full
view<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.670> probably<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.890> four

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
view on that but it's probably like four

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
view on that but it's probably like four
point<00:01:53.250> nine<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:55.259> five<00:01:55.530> ounces<00:01:58.759> on<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.719> that's<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
point nine to five ounces on so that's a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.840 
point nine to five ounces on so that's a
pretty<00:02:01.200> lightweight<00:02:01.500> head<00:02:04.520> yeah<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
pretty lightweight head yeah it's a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.609 
pretty lightweight head yeah it's a
really<00:02:06.060> nice<00:02:06.210> head<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.829> recommend<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:09.619> it's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
really nice head I recommend it it's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.280 
really nice head I recommend it it's
sort<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.340> really<00:02:11.610> unique

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
sort of a really unique

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.990 
sort of a really unique
