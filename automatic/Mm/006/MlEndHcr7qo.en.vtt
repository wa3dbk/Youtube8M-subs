the e 1 15 project and today I'm going

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.390 
the e 1 15 project and today I'm going
to<00:00:03.990> show<00:00:04.110> you<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.259> brand<00:00:04.529> new<00:00:04.589> glitz<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.130> found

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
to show you a brand new glitz I found

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.400 
to show you a brand new glitz I found
trying<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.819> get<00:00:05.940> under<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> map<00:00:06.330> but<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.960> pretty

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
trying to get under the map but I pretty

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.830 
trying to get under the map but I pretty
much<00:00:07.500> failed<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.250> but<00:00:08.849> while<00:00:09.120> failing<00:00:09.480> at

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
much failed it but while failing at

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.270 
much failed it but while failing at
getting<00:00:09.870> onto<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.349> map<00:00:10.500> because<00:00:10.590> really<00:00:11.040> hard

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
getting onto the map because really hard

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.310 
getting onto the map because really hard
i<00:00:11.370> found<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.759> also<00:00:12.090> barrier<00:00:12.420> glitch<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.929> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
i found it also barrier glitch in the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.220 
i found it also barrier glitch in the
tunnel<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.250> quite<00:00:14.580> easy<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.969> do<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.750> if

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
tunnel that is quite easy to do so if

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.720 
tunnel that is quite easy to do so if
you<00:00:16.500> guys<00:00:16.680> don't<00:00:16.890> know<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> way<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.310> get<00:00:17.550> under

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
you guys don't know the way to get under

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.790 
you guys don't know the way to get under
the<00:00:17.820> map<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.510> keep<00:00:18.750> swapping<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.350> turbine

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
the map is to keep swapping the turbine

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.010 
the map is to keep swapping the turbine
and<00:00:20.039> their<00:00:20.189> zombie<00:00:20.490> shield<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.390> actually<00:00:21.720> push

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
and their zombie shield to actually push

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.300 
and their zombie shield to actually push
you<00:00:22.140> under<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> map<00:00:22.650> as<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.160> I'm<00:00:23.279> trying

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
you under the map as you see I'm trying

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.939 
you under the map as you see I'm trying
to<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.760> here<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.900> do<00:00:25.320> what<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.890> do

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
to do it here but if you do what I do

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.790 
to do it here but if you do what I do
and<00:00:26.400> actually<00:00:26.880> get<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> zombie<00:00:28.230> shield<00:00:28.470> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
and actually get the zombie shield to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.529 
and actually get the zombie shield to
actually<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.279> go<00:00:29.460> flac<00:00:29.760> against<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.210> wall<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
actually not go flac against a wall and

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.240 
actually not go flac against a wall and
to<00:00:30.720> go<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.140> pretty<00:00:31.439> much<00:00:31.500> an<00:00:31.800> angle<00:00:32.130> from

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
to go with I pretty much an angle from

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.170 
to go with I pretty much an angle from
the<00:00:32.340> wall<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.360> meat<00:00:33.570> gap<00:00:34.170> from<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
the wall of like a meat gap from the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
the wall of like a meat gap from the
shield<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.960> yellow<00:00:37.559> railing<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
shield to the yellow railing to the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.850 
shield to the yellow railing to the
right<00:00:38.790> then<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.540> will<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:39.809> form<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
right then you will actually form a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.290 
right then you will actually form a
zombie<00:00:41.160> barrier<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.149> right

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
zombie barrier as you see I do it right

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
zombie barrier as you see I do it right
now<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.320> zombie<00:00:43.620> turns<00:00:43.829> around<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
now and the zombie turns around and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
now and the zombie turns around and
unlike<00:00:44.489> able<00:00:44.879> screaming<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.899> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
unlike able screaming all that can I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
unlike able screaming all that can I
stand<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> corner<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.940> do

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
stand right in the corner and if you do

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.119 
stand right in the corner and if you do
it<00:00:48.149> correctly<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.200> forms<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.649> zombie<00:00:49.950> bear

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it correctly then it forms a zombie bear

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.100 
it correctly then it forms a zombie bear
as<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.550> there's<00:00:50.730> always<00:00:51.030> crawling<00:00:51.960> away

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
as you see there's always crawling away

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.380 
as you see there's always crawling away
from<00:00:52.440> me<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> thought<00:00:53.489> I'd<00:00:53.670> actually<00:00:53.820> upload

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
from me so I thought I'd actually upload

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
from me so I thought I'd actually upload
disc<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.840> quite<00:00:55.050> easy<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.860> did<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
disc is quite easy to do I did do it a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
disc is quite easy to do I did do it a
couple<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.879> times<00:00:56.969> by<00:00:57.449> pretty<00:00:57.719> much<00:00:57.809> doing<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
couple of times by pretty much doing the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.450 
couple of times by pretty much doing the
same<00:00:58.320> technique<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.039> you're<00:00:59.190> failing

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
same technique so if you're failing

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.849 
same technique so if you're failing
getting<00:00:59.910> under<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> mat<00:01:00.390> by<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:01.469> means<00:01:01.649> try

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
getting under the mat by all means try

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
getting under the mat by all means try
this<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.550> lot<00:01:02.699> easier<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.390> forms

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
this because it's a lot easier it forms

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.920 
this because it's a lot easier it forms
a<00:01:04.199> zombie<00:01:04.530> barrier<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> said

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
a zombie barrier and it's like I said

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.359 
a zombie barrier and it's like I said
it's<00:01:07.200> very<00:01:07.409> easy<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:09.180> pretty<00:01:09.780> much

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
it's very easy to do and it pretty much

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
it's very easy to do and it pretty much
like<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.610> don't<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.270> stress<00:01:12.600> from<00:01:12.810> trying

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
like you don't like stress from trying

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.420 
like you don't like stress from trying
to<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.200> under<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> map<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.920> is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to get under the map because that is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.789 
to get under the map because that is
very<00:01:14.640> hard<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.659> very<00:01:15.720> easy<00:01:16.110> was

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
very hard but this one is very easy was

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.310 
very hard but this one is very easy was
found<00:01:17.070> by<00:01:17.250> me<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> e<00:01:17.640> 1<00:01:17.939> 15<00:01:18.360> project<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.200> you
