eating you know normal food because this

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.490 
eating you know normal food because this
barbell<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.400> really<00:03:11.670> long<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.300> makes<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.230> hard

barbell is really long it makes it hard

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.120 
barbell is really long it makes it hard
to<00:03:14.780> kind<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:15.900> eat<00:03:16.230> anything<00:03:16.560> because<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
to kind of eat anything because the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.740 
to kind of eat anything because the
barbell<00:03:17.490> so<00:03:17.700> long<00:03:17.880> in<00:03:18.210> your<00:03:18.360> tongue<00:03:18.540> so

swollen<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:22.010> my<00:03:23.010> advice<00:03:23.310> would<00:03:23.820> be

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
swollen so my advice would be

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.100 
swollen so my advice would be
to<00:03:26.720> eat<00:03:26.930> anything<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:28.480> soft<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:29.990> want

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
to eat anything that soft and you want

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.160 
to eat anything that soft and you want
to<00:03:30.260> chew<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:31.540> don't<00:03:32.540> eat<00:03:32.690> anything<00:03:32.960> with

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
to chew and don't eat anything with

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.020 
to chew and don't eat anything with
dairy<00:03:33.560> because<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.340> can<00:03:34.550> get<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.790> yeast

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
dairy because you can get a yeast

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.270 
dairy because you can get a yeast
infection<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.840> tongue<00:03:36.080> because<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.190> it

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280
