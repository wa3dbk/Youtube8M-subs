00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
anyway the peach trees are just

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.020 
anyway the peach trees are just
absolutely<00:00:48.170> loaded<00:00:49.170> down<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.700> flavor

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
absolutely loaded down and the flavor

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.990 
absolutely loaded down and the flavor
can't<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.629> beat<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.199> been<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:52.579> very<00:00:53.579> dry

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
can't be beat it's been very very dry

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
can't be beat it's been very very dry
here<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:55.140> makes<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.770> better

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
here and that actually makes a better

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.520 
here and that actually makes a better
peach<00:00:56.280> there's<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> little<00:00:57.840> bit<00:00:58.020> smaller

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
peach there's there a little bit smaller

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
peach there's there a little bit smaller
than<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:59.190> there's<00:00:59.399> been<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> lot<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> rain<00:01:00.239> but

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
than if there's been a lot of rain but

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
than if there's been a lot of rain but
the<00:01:01.020> flavor<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.440> incredibly<00:01:02.160> intense<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the flavor is incredibly intense and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600
