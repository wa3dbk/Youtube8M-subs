00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
using the nine tails chakra um I guess

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.189 
using the nine tails chakra um I guess
yeah<00:04:50.250> from<00:04:50.820> I<00:04:50.909> mean<00:04:51.060> at<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.330> point<00:04:51.389> carbon<00:04:51.960> so

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
yeah from I mean at this point carbon so

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.830 
yeah from I mean at this point carbon so
has<00:04:52.460> become<00:04:53.460> or<00:04:53.820> has<00:04:54.030> joined<00:04:54.330> forces<00:04:54.449> with

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
Madhava if you guys haven't noticed

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.510 
Madhava if you guys haven't noticed
already<00:04:57.199> monitor<00:04:58.199> of<00:04:58.349> course<00:04:58.620> has<00:04:58.919> gotten

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
already monitor of course has gotten

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.320 
already monitor of course has gotten
Naga<00:05:00.509> those

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
Naga those

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.790 
Naga those
and<00:05:02.569> now<00:05:03.409> he's<00:05:03.800> um<00:05:04.069> I<00:05:04.479> guess<00:05:05.479> stronger<00:05:05.990> because

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
and now he's um I guess stronger because

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.540 
and now he's um I guess stronger because
now<00:05:07.220> he<00:05:07.280> has<00:05:07.699> I<00:05:08.030> guess<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:09.680> ocular<00:05:10.129> powers<00:05:10.430> of

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
now he has I guess to ocular powers of

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.360 
now he has I guess to ocular powers of
his<00:05:10.669> own<00:05:10.819> he<00:05:11.150> has<00:05:11.360> I<00:05:11.659> test<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.370> eternal

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
his own he has I test the eternal

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.270 
his own he has I test the eternal
ommegang<00:05:13.789> go<00:05:14.030> shooting<00:05:14.990> gun<00:05:15.139> and<00:05:15.379> the<00:05:15.770> running

gun so I'm not sure what the other
ocular<00:05:20.360> part<00:05:20.659> yes<00:05:20.810> or<00:05:21.020> I<00:05:21.349> guess<00:05:21.409> we<00:05:21.770> just<00:05:21.800> say

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
ocular part yes or I guess we just say

ocular part yes or I guess we just say
he<00:05:22.310> just<00:05:22.460> has<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.639> sitting<00:05:23.030> gun<00:05:23.210> in<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:23.539> ring

but uh anyway he does have both of the

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.740 
but uh anyway he does have both of the
ocular<00:05:27.590> powers<00:05:27.919> and<00:05:28.159> you<00:05:28.819> know<00:05:28.909> he's<00:05:29.180> I<00:05:29.389> guess

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750
