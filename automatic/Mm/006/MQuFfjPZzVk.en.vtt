00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
 Stravinsky ballet premiere 

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.240
 parsley was held in paris in 1910 surrendered 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.960
 they came to the delight of Russian to 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.280
 Essentially the size of such artists is wonderful 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.299
 scenery and modern music 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.179
 but Russian musicians 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.980
 most were discouraged 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.359
 especially their angered respect 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.419
 stravinsky to folk music 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.549
 instead of noble old tunes 

00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:22.509
 Stravinsky used chastushki 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.029
 and urban songs all that decent 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.769
 musician considered rubbish 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.229
 let's try to figure out why 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:30.569
 stravinsky did it and what price he 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.569
 paid for this musical garbage 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.810
 on the assurances come and go 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.140

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.260
 periodically repression 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.140
 and use them professional 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.970
 music 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.350
 so bequeathed to their followers 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.050
 the composer of the mighty handful 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.860
 musorgsky 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.340
 Rimsky-Korsakov 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.420
 Igor Stravinsky as nobody should have 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.940
 follow this rule 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.370
 beat his teacher was deeply respected 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.280
 Nikolai Andreevich Roman Korsakov 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.610
 view of treatment stravinsky so and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.580
 entered in his first ballet fever 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.190
 he included a bird in the score two 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.920
 ancient songs collections compiled 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.410
 his surplus 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.670
 but a year later in his second ballet 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.470
 Stravinsky dramatically changed the rules of the game 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.300
 the reason for this was 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.260
 parsley actions took place on 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.870
 Admiralty Square in St. Petersburg 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.420
 at carnival it is no longer fabulous or 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.560
 Ancient Russia 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 and the life of the nineteenth century metropolis 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.650
 his personality and those fellow characters

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.830
 a bear 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.990
 Stravinsky himself wrote last 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.060
 ballet scene 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.270
 continuously and fast rates of majors gives 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.659
 what is the Russian land leading role

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.370
 if you wanted this picture together with 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.969
 they were absolutely not borne if you sit and 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.389
 he will hold against the rules 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.289
 but for an art project 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.179
 he fill his ballet with the very same 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:24.209
 music that can be heard on 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.099
 ordinary Petersburg theater 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.870
 here and urban romances 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 and Shrovetide zaklichki and round dances 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.810
 songs and even ditties 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.810
 so beloved Russian people 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.969
 they say the second 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.329
 in the role 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.329
 here 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.059
 in sign language there was a place and 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.340
 close compilation 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.849
 roman korsakov 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.480
 but it seems to mock old 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.519
 rules 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.279
 Easter song talalykin performed 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.469
 did not make countries sharpened 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.869
 so they could only be embarrassed 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.869
 tipsy to walk 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.069

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.139
 views took this game with russian 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.529
 folklore with a bang 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.109
 but in Russia the music 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.759
 the public has been detained 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.569
 writer he was considered to be sacred to you 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.199
 Stravinsky parsley like 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.219
 put parsley like mocked 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:34.889
 showed us the great traditions of Russian 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.649

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.149
 with skolkovsky alcohol 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:39.689

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.269
 as for russian folk music ton 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.979
 days straight Stravinsky mocks 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.379
 if roman korsakov could hear 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:48.849
 clipping 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.889
 she caused such a blatant 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.949
 he would feel insulted in it 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.209
 Russian folk song is so expensive 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:55.979
 Dima 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.349
 but which stravinsky 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.279
 obviously not at all expensive 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:01.859
 otherwise he would not let himself be dumped in 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.389
 one bag authentic russian on white and 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.389
 barges only and fired rough thousand 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.529
 Well, July Sergei Prokofiev way too 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:12.189
 textbook of roman korsakov 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.429
 introduction of such innovations 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.319
 I didn't give in to charm for a minute 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.079
 the fight may 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.840
 what can there 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.650
 one tube 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.860
 It will not be one year before the Russians 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.240
 musicians are aware that breaking old 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.480
 traditions stravinsky opened new fluff in 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.279
 understanding of folklore 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.019
 on the shelf when the partner appeared in 

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:36.860
 all its diversity 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.159
 old patters old 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.810
 equally expensive for Russian composers 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.810
 like the ancient ritual songs 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.389
 on stage came ragged children 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.630
 sharp center rather Kiev position 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.470
 all that reflects the soul 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.570
 Russian people 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.150
 and what then became general directions 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.150
 in european music called to experience 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.039
 luggage 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.039
 tsahal 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.839
 he 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.629
 on the street 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.629
 percent 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.899
 sometimes they set the task that their affairs are not 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:27.620
 popular Russian less 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.030
 continued to change with 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.499
 European 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:33.749
 barely living images soulless who had 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:34.280
 money 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.780
 he made not to waltz 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.889
 Austrian composer and Joseph 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:38.569
 okay 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:40.520
 and not without success 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.810
 graceful ballroom dancing Ostrovetsky sounded 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.789
 like old street organ 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.089
 stravinsky skillfully fighters witty 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:50.169
 lightning fast 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.300
 the tenge itself cheated exactly 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.300
 barbarovka 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.229
 while writing ballet he lived in 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.699
 small french town 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.840
 every day under his windows organ-grinder 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.949
 played the same 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.949
 in the end the melodies are already 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.039
 was to install the sculpture decided 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.990
 use its capital 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.539
 it was a children's song called 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.839
 she had wood the other day 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.479
 say this song was dedicated 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.180
 great actress sara bernard 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.030
 the goddess of the theatrical scene played a 13 year old 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.669
 same 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.949
 at the age of 70 and unsuccessfully fell on 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.580
 touring in rio de janeiro 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.580
 resulting in a leg injury 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:38.530
 there were even rumors 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.770
 that she had to use 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.059
 by process 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:44.090
 as often is a cruel song on 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:45.300
 grudge of the day 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.300
 quickly became popular 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.110
 near the triumphal premiere of the ballet 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.189
 parsley in paris representative 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:03.399
 enjoyed well-deserved glory 

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.539
 once the postman brought him a letter 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:07.849
 which unpleasantly surprised 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.149
 instead of compliments some unknown to him 

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:11.440
 have a hide 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.939
 expressed claims 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.059
 it turned out that the song of the competition 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:17.300
 is an essay by this mister 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.159
 and since the author that I am alive and well he 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.659
 requires royalties well 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:23.980
 if you don't throw the words out 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.390
 so do not come out on the first results 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.399
 unfinished object 

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.509
 PE occurred in the performance of ballet

 parsley soviet had to pay

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:40.300
 the policeman went to court on 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.550
 conference 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.300
 certainly not greed for gas 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.050
 internal creative reasons 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.060
 but there is still a mass serving 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.189
 co-op now more 

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:53.189
 no whim 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:56.249
