00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
this is a bog is a future video blog so

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.620 
this is a bog is a future video blog so
we're<00:00:08.220> doing<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.490> post<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.940> beam<00:00:09.090> thing<00:00:09.360> here

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
we're doing the post and beam thing here

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.310 
we're doing the post and beam thing here
I've<00:00:09.750> completed<00:00:10.139> these<00:00:10.730> up<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:12.240> pre<00:00:12.840> cut<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
I've completed these up here pre cut the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.860 
I've completed these up here pre cut the
slots<00:00:13.830> where<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.460> boards<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.540> are<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
slots where the boards that are going to

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.670 
slots where the boards that are going to
go<00:00:15.960> across<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.650> like<00:00:16.859> lean-to<00:00:17.340> roof<00:00:18.350> will<00:00:19.350> fit

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
go across the like lean-to roof will fit

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.019 
go across the like lean-to roof will fit
then<00:00:19.890> I'm<00:00:19.980> also<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> cut<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> boards

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
then I'm also going to cut the boards

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.429 
then I'm also going to cut the boards
we're<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.359> fit<00:00:21.510> together<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:21.900> Lincoln

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
we're going to fit together like Lincoln

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.679 
we're going to fit together like Lincoln
locks<00:00:25.550> I've<00:00:26.550> been<00:00:26.640> very<00:00:26.789> very<00:00:27.240> interested<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
locks I've been very very interested in

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.960 
locks I've been very very interested in
posting<00:00:27.840> beam<00:00:28.320> where<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.279> don't<00:00:29.369> use<00:00:29.550> metal

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
posting beam where you don't use metal

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.440 
posting beam where you don't use metal
use<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:31.850> pins<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.120> see<00:00:33.360> if

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
use like what pins you can see if

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.139 
use like what pins you can see if
there's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> pin<00:00:34.020> there<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:35.149> start

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
there's a pin there it's in there start

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.160 
there's a pin there it's in there start
making<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.719> own<00:00:36.750> pins<00:00:37.170> and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
making my own pins and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.459 
making my own pins and
so<00:00:39.890> maybe<00:00:40.160> when<00:00:40.640> I<00:00:40.699> go<00:00:40.879> put<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.210> last<00:00:41.420> couple<00:00:41.719> a

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.549 

no-show<00:00:45.469> that<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:46.100> um<00:00:47.140> gonna<00:00:48.140> have<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.409> put

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
no-show that but um gonna have to put

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.669 
no-show that but um gonna have to put
some<00:00:48.739> screws<00:00:48.979> in<00:00:49.250> here<00:00:49.460> just<00:00:49.489> because<00:00:49.789> I

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
some screws in here just because I

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.410 
some screws in here just because I
should<00:00:51.679> have<00:00:51.769> probably<00:00:52.059> dug<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:53.089> little<00:00:53.210> deeper

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
should have probably dug a little deeper

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.529 
should have probably dug a little deeper
groove<00:00:53.989> for<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.649> boards<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.219> fit<00:00:55.430> in<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.510> I

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
groove for the boards to fit in so I

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.000 
groove for the boards to fit in so I
could<00:00:56.659> make<00:00:56.839> sure<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.229> depends<00:00:57.769> where<00:00:57.920> I'm

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
could make sure the depends where I'm

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.979 
could make sure the depends where I'm
going<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.190> split<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.579> wood<00:00:58.729> and<00:00:59.059> you're

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
going to split the wood and you're

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.969 
going to split the wood and you're
strong<00:01:03.009> but<00:01:04.009> uh<00:01:05.229> I'm<00:01:06.229> happy<00:01:06.560> with<00:01:06.649> it<00:01:06.710> looks

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
strong but uh I'm happy with it looks

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.249 
strong but uh I'm happy with it looks
nice<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:07.549> it's<00:01:07.729> going<00:01:08.090> well<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:08.539> it'll<00:01:09.170> be

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
nice and it's going well and it'll be

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.130 
nice and it's going well and it'll be
nice<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.439> sturdy<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.780> morning<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.020> good

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
nice and sturdy and the morning a good

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.600 
nice and sturdy and the morning a good
thing<00:01:12.289> about<00:01:12.409> using<00:01:12.710> wood<00:01:13.069> is<00:01:13.250> all<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.490> wood

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
thing about using wood is all the wood

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.240 
thing about using wood is all the wood
expands<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.270> contracts<00:01:14.659> together<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.409> you

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
expands and contracts together so you

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.090 
expands and contracts together so you
can<00:01:16.280> give<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:16.640> room<00:01:17.060> for<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:17.929> you<00:01:18.920> know

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
can give it room for that and you know

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.999 
can give it room for that and you know
it's<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:20.470> natural<00:01:21.470> living<00:01:21.920> sort<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.460> surface

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
it's a natural living sort of surface

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.029 
it's a natural living sort of surface
not<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.190> live<00:01:25.369> in<00:01:25.549> media<00:01:26.200> so<00:01:29.860> my<00:01:30.860> other

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
not to live in media so my other

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.149 
not to live in media so my other
buildings<00:01:31.549> we<00:01:31.700> use<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.619> different<00:01:33.619> sort<00:01:33.979> of<00:01:34.069> a

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
buildings we use the different sort of a

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.639 
buildings we use the different sort of a
hardware<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:35.509> take<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:36.020> know<00:01:36.110> there's<00:01:36.350> some

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
hardware to take you know there's some

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.410 
hardware to take you know there's some
different<00:01:37.100> hurricane<00:01:37.580> ties<00:01:37.789> we<00:01:37.970> use<00:01:38.179> that

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
different hurricane ties we use that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.930 
different hurricane ties we use that
would<00:01:38.509> clay<00:01:38.750> up<00:01:38.869> on<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.319> the<00:01:40.190> post<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.759> then

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
would clay up on to the post and then

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.709 
would clay up on to the post and then
hold<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:43.069> whatever<00:01:43.609> boards<00:01:44.180> we<00:01:44.329> used<00:01:46.719> you

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
hold the the whatever boards we used you

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.709 
hold the the whatever boards we used you
know<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.289> post<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.539> there<00:01:50.539> are<00:01:50.600> some

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
know on to the post and there are some

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.389 
know on to the post and there are some
difficulties<00:01:51.469> with<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.859> there<00:01:52.189> are<00:01:52.250> some

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
difficulties with that there are some

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.160 
difficulties with that there are some
gaps<00:01:52.609> because<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.030> wanted<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.689> do<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.899> on<00:01:53.990> an

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
gaps because I wanted to do it on an

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.340 
gaps because I wanted to do it on an
angle<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.520> forth<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.630> they're<00:01:56.990> expensive

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
angle and so forth and they're expensive

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.950 
angle and so forth and they're expensive
so<00:01:57.859> you<00:01:58.070> know<00:01:58.850> what<00:01:59.030> I've<00:01:59.119> done<00:01:59.149> is<00:01:59.450> carve<00:01:59.780> out

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
so you know what I've done is carve out

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.830 
so you know what I've done is carve out
this<00:02:00.729> inside<00:02:01.729> of<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.909> board<00:02:02.179> if<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.509> had<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.719> do

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
this inside of the board if I had to do

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.840 
this inside of the board if I had to do
it<00:02:02.979> again<00:02:03.979> I<00:02:04.009> would<00:02:04.159> carve<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.579> out<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.700> lot

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
it again I would carve it out a lot

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.729 
it again I would carve it out a lot
deeper<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:06.439> then<00:02:06.799> just<00:02:07.429> drill<00:02:07.700> with<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.909> 5-inch

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
deeper and then just drill with a 5-inch

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.009 
deeper and then just drill with a 5-inch
bit<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.039> byte<00:02:10.220> 58<00:02:12.160> down<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.540> turn<00:02:14.780> them<00:02:14.900> into

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
bit and byte 58 down and turn them into

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.590 
bit and byte 58 down and turn them into
pegs<00:02:15.609> now<00:02:16.609> these<00:02:16.760> boards<00:02:17.120> are<00:02:17.180> all<00:02:17.269> hold<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
pegs now these boards are all hold the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.240 
pegs now these boards are all hold the
held<00:02:17.870> by<00:02:18.079> wooden<00:02:18.410> pegs<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:22.040> that's

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
held by wooden pegs and so that's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.740 
held by wooden pegs and so that's
something<00:02:22.579> very<00:02:22.730> happy<00:02:23.269> about<00:02:23.359> because<00:02:23.600> the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
something very happy about because the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.599 
something very happy about because the
wood<00:02:23.930> all<00:02:24.109> expands<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.769> contracts<00:02:25.160> together

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
wood all expands and contracts together

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.610 
wood all expands and contracts together
and<00:02:26.269> so<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> other<00:02:26.660> thing<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:27.019> we're<00:02:27.440> going<00:02:27.560> to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and so the other thing I we're going to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.259 
and so the other thing I we're going to
do<00:02:27.769> is<00:02:27.950> when<00:02:28.100> we<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.519> boards<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.060> run

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
do is when we get the boards that run

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.809 
do is when we get the boards that run
across<00:02:29.390> then<00:02:29.900> are<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:31.040> boards<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.459> hold<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
across then are the boards that hold the

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.920 
across then are the boards that hold the
roof<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:35.000> way<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.209> come<00:02:35.389> to<00:02:35.480> understand<00:02:35.840> is

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
roof the way to come to understand is

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.800 
roof the way to come to understand is
that<00:02:35.959> these<00:02:36.230> posts<00:02:36.650> are<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.829> load-bearing

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
that these posts are the load-bearing

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.150 
that these posts are the load-bearing
posts<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.079> other<00:02:39.410> they<00:02:39.620> bear<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.859> load

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
posts for the other they bear the load

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.640 
posts for the other they bear the load
of<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.400> roof<00:02:40.609> and<00:02:41.510> if<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.139> see<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.470> you'll

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
of the roof and if you see that you'll

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.960 
of the roof and if you see that you'll
get<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:42.859> roof<00:02:43.100> you'll<00:02:43.340> see<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:43.609> there's<00:02:43.819> all

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
get a roof you'll see that there's all

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.660 
get a roof you'll see that there's all
these<00:02:44.120> boards<00:02:44.650> going<00:02:45.650> across<00:02:46.010> holding<00:02:46.579> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
these boards going across holding the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.180 
these boards going across holding the
roof<00:02:46.850> off<00:02:47.030> at<00:02:47.269> an<00:02:47.390> angular<00:02:47.629> roof<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.260> what<00:02:49.099> I'm

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
roof off at an angular roof and what I'm

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.090 
roof off at an angular roof and what I'm
going<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.340> use<00:02:49.519> is<00:02:49.730> probably<00:02:50.239> a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
going to use is probably a

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.460 
going to use is probably a
this<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> six<00:02:52.330> inch<00:02:52.570> board<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:53.200> all<00:02:53.350> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
this is a six inch board and so all the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.370 
this is a six inch board and so all the
weight<00:02:53.590> goes<00:02:53.710> into<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.160> board<00:02:55.020> in<00:02:56.020> all<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
weight goes into the board in all the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.630 
weight goes into the board in all the
weight<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.800> roof<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.310> we<00:02:57.460> have<00:02:57.580> a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
weight of the roof and so we have a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.980 
weight of the roof and so we have a
living<00:02:57.970> roof<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.630> know<00:02:58.720> people<00:02:58.840> are

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
living roof and you know people are

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.150 
living roof and you know people are
going<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.230> able<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.410> get<00:02:59.500> on<00:02:59.590> top<00:02:59.800> of<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.130> and

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
going to be able to get on top of it and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.600 
going to be able to get on top of it and
so<00:03:00.460> forth<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.940> want<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:01.810> it's

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
so forth I want to have it so it's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.340 
so forth I want to have it so it's
getting<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:03.700> know<00:03:03.820> bear<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.090> lot<00:03:04.300> of<00:03:04.450> weight<00:03:04.600> so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
getting you know bear a lot of weight so

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.840 
getting you know bear a lot of weight so
these<00:03:05.440> posts<00:03:05.830> are<00:03:05.890> very<00:03:06.070> strong<00:03:06.400> do<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.730> have

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
these posts are very strong do you have

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.240 
these posts are very strong do you have
everything<00:03:07.120> going<00:03:07.570> all<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.560> way<00:03:08.680> going<00:03:08.710> all

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
everything going all the way going all

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.610 
everything going all the way going all
the<00:03:09.370> way<00:03:09.460> down<00:03:09.640> into<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.060> post<00:03:10.300> these<00:03:11.200> boards

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
the way down into the post these boards

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.620 
the way down into the post these boards
are<00:03:11.710> six<00:03:11.950> inch<00:03:12.130> boards<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.940> they're<00:03:13.060> put<00:03:13.450> you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
are six inch boards and they're put you

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.970 
are six inch boards and they're put you
know<00:03:13.720> attach<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.170> post<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:14.710> all<00:03:14.830> this

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
know attach the post and so all this

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.800 
know attach the post and so all this
weight<00:03:15.160> goes<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.490> to<00:03:15.580> here<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.270> then<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.660> roof

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
weight goes it to here and then the roof

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.550 
weight goes it to here and then the roof
will<00:03:17.050> go<00:03:17.170> again<00:03:18.750> on<00:03:19.750> these<00:03:19.960> boards<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.440> so

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
will go again on these boards and so

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.070 
will go again on these boards and so
this<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.460> cut<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:21.850> an<00:03:22.030> angle<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.750> is<00:03:22.900> cut

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
this is cut in an angle and this is cut

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.430 
this is cut in an angle and this is cut
at<00:03:23.170> an<00:03:23.260> angle<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:25.270> have<00:03:25.630> your<00:03:25.870> exact<00:03:26.170> way<00:03:26.380> to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
at an angle and have your exact way to

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.280 
at an angle and have your exact way to
calculate<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:27.040> precise<00:03:27.520> angle<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.000> need<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
calculate the precise angle I need and

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.020 
calculate the precise angle I need and
if<00:03:29.500> there's<00:03:29.740> a<00:03:29.860> way<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.040> do<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.430> but<00:03:30.700> I<00:03:30.730> don't

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
if there's a way to do that but I don't

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.240 
if there's a way to do that but I don't
have<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.230> ability<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.650> it's<00:03:32.770> going<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:32.950> fit<00:03:33.100> in

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
have the ability so it's going to fit in

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.370 
have the ability so it's going to fit in
like<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.970> might<00:03:34.810> get<00:03:34.960> a<00:03:34.990> little<00:03:35.170> bit<00:03:35.350> of

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
like this I might get a little bit of

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.060 
like this I might get a little bit of
bigger<00:03:35.620> board<00:03:35.920> here<00:03:36.160> but<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:37.330> so<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.890> that's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
bigger board here but and so and that's

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.410 
bigger board here but and so and that's
going<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.280> bear<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.640> level<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.240> roof

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
going to bear the level of the roof

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.530 
going to bear the level of the roof
these<00:03:41.170> things<00:03:41.290> are<00:03:41.470> all<00:03:41.560> be<00:03:41.740> able<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:43.450> know

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
these things are all be able to you know

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.240 
these things are all be able to you know
spin<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:44.260> contract<00:03:45.600> with<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.750> weather<00:03:47.250> so

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
spin and contract with the weather so

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.920 
spin and contract with the weather so
pretty<00:03:48.460> happy<00:03:48.790> about<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.120> system<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.660> think<00:03:49.690> I

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
pretty happy about the system I think I

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.950 
pretty happy about the system I think I
have<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.080> good<00:03:50.140> angle<00:03:50.410> they<00:03:50.710> are<00:03:50.830> on<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.840> I'll

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
have a good angle they are on so I'll

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.570 
have a good angle they are on so I'll
get<00:03:53.350> more<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.650> sense<00:03:53.800> of<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.100> after<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.340> do<00:03:54.460> a

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
get more of a sense of it after I do a

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.130 
get more of a sense of it after I do a
couple<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:55.420> get<00:03:55.540> these<00:03:55.690> boards

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
couple I just have to get these boards

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.920 
couple I just have to get these boards
they're<00:03:56.700> 16<00:03:57.700> foot<00:03:57.970> boards<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:58.450> i<00:03:58.570> need<00:03:58.750> i

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
that's you know the system we're going

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.580 
that's you know the system we're going
to<00:04:03.700> use<00:04:03.790> down<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.150> very<00:04:04.300> happy<00:04:04.510> with<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:04.810> it's

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
to use down and very happy with it it's

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.900 
to use down and very happy with it it's
something<00:04:05.800> that<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.040> know<00:04:06.310> we've<00:04:06.460> evolved

something that you know we've evolved

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.750 
something that you know we've evolved
into<00:04:07.180> it's<00:04:07.500> less<00:04:08.500> expensive<00:04:08.800> and<00:04:09.400> it's<00:04:09.520> you

through the setup so um I'm happy with
this<00:04:24.130> roof<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.610> I'd<00:04:24.670> like<00:04:24.790> to<00:04:24.910> continue

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
this roof and I'd like to continue

working on you doing that I like I said
it<00:04:27.490> would<00:04:27.580> carve<00:04:27.760> this<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.970> little<00:04:28.120> bit<00:04:28.330> deeper

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
it would carve this a little bit deeper

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.490 
it would carve this a little bit deeper
into<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.160> post<00:04:30.400> next<00:04:30.730> time<00:04:31.230> that's<00:04:32.230> some

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
into the post next time that's some

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.760 
into the post next time that's some
issues<00:04:33.310> with<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.490> post<00:04:34.120> cracking<00:04:34.690> here<00:04:34.960> and

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
issues with the post cracking here and

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.080 
issues with the post cracking here and
so<00:04:35.980> forth<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.460> I'm<00:04:36.550> going<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.730> have<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:36.910> put

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
so forth so I'm going to have to put

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.800 
so forth so I'm going to have to put
some<00:04:37.300> metal<00:04:37.710> over<00:04:38.710> some<00:04:38.950> of<00:04:38.980> these<00:04:39.160> as<00:04:39.820> extra

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
some metal over some of these as extra

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.270 
some metal over some of these as extra
support<00:04:41.230> to<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.470> board<00:04:41.710> but<00:04:41.920> other<00:04:42.070> than<00:04:42.220> that

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
support to the board but other than that

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.950 
support to the board but other than that
it's<00:04:42.520> going<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:42.730> be<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:42.880> good<00:04:43.090> sturdy<00:04:43.360> roof<00:04:43.660> and

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
it's going to be a good sturdy roof and

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.780 
it's going to be a good sturdy roof and
I'm<00:04:44.650> looking<00:04:44.890> forward<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.250> finishing<00:04:45.460> this

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
I'm looking forward to finishing this

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.400 
I'm looking forward to finishing this
this<00:04:46.120> part<00:04:46.810> of<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.960> project<00:04:47.140> up<00:04:47.700> so<00:04:48.700> this<00:04:48.880> is<00:04:49.030> a

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
this part of the project up so this is a

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.570 
this part of the project up so this is a
probably<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.500> better<00:04:50.770> example<00:04:50.920> sour<00:04:51.400> chicken

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
probably a better example sour chicken

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.600 
probably a better example sour chicken
shed<00:04:51.910> but<00:04:52.120> going<00:04:52.870> in<00:04:53.050> there<00:04:53.400> talking<00:04:54.400> about

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
shed but going in there talking about

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.710 
shed but going in there talking about
the<00:04:54.940> these<00:04:55.540> are<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.810> hurricane<00:04:56.290> ties<00:04:57.600> that<00:04:58.600> I

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
the these are the hurricane ties that I

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.909 
the these are the hurricane ties that I
used<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.260> you<00:04:59.380> see<00:04:59.530> there's<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.740> piece<00:04:59.890> of

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
used and you see there's a piece of

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.140 
used and you see there's a piece of
metal<00:05:00.160> here<00:05:00.310> that<00:05:00.669> goes<00:05:00.790> on<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.660> cross<00:05:01.930> board

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
metal here that goes on the cross board

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.030 
metal here that goes on the cross board
this<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.540> board<00:05:03.810> that<00:05:03.870> zero<00:05:04.410> supports<00:05:04.860> the

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
this is the board that zero supports the

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.910 
this is the board that zero supports the
roof<00:05:05.220> of<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.810> problem<00:05:07.320> bead<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:09.680> it's<00:05:10.680> not

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
roof of the problem bead that it's not

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.680 
roof of the problem bead that it's not
so<00:05:11.100> much<00:05:11.160> here<00:05:11.610> but<00:05:11.670> there's<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.030> little<00:05:12.150> gap<00:05:12.420> is

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
so much here but there's a little gap is

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.590 
so much here but there's a little gap is
a<00:05:12.720> little<00:05:12.900> space<00:05:13.230> here<00:05:13.910> because<00:05:14.910> this<00:05:15.450> is

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
a little space here because this is

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.270 
a little space here because this is
supposed<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:16.020> be<00:05:16.110> used<00:05:16.470> at<00:05:16.710> a<00:05:16.800> flat<00:05:17.160> situation

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
supposed to be used at a flat situation

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.220 
supposed to be used at a flat situation
this<00:05:20.280> is<00:05:20.460> an<00:05:20.580> angle<00:05:21.000> so<00:05:21.180> on<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.630> back<00:05:21.870> end<00:05:22.140> you

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
this is an angle so on the back end you

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.900 
this is an angle so on the back end you
can<00:05:22.350> see<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.650> big<00:05:22.920> gap<00:05:23.160> here<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.790> know

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
can see is a big gap here so you know

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.240 
can see is a big gap here so you know
some<00:05:27.360> of<00:05:27.390> the<00:05:27.570> way<00:05:27.690> its<00:05:28.230> resting<00:05:28.950> on<00:05:29.100> the
