00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.000
 Pope 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.150
 Enduro friends welcome back to the 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.060
 second day of the red bull competition 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.220
 six days the weather is pleasant shines a 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.960
 beautiful sun and temperatures are higher 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.940
 compared to yesterday we have to thank the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.380
 strong wind that blew this night 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.540
 think of the local civil protection 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.800
 had launched a weather alert a 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.900
 about 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.120
 while I'm talking, the pilots are leaving 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.950
 from the paddock of the sachsenring the best 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.720
 they are all ahead since the order today 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.000
 of departure is established by the health of 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.460
 game for which we will find the blues 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.170
 all in the very first positions at 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.479
 my shoulders you see the beginning of what 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.970
 yesterday was the most challenging special 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.509
 the enduro test a line of other times 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.250
 we leave as you can see almost with a 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.410
 trial an indoor enduro a field 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.710
 artificial then pilots enteranno in 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.990
 woods and the real pitfalls will start there 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.270
 pebble roots and above all a lot of mud and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.390
 let's enjoy the images of the results of 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.390
 race 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.820
 the riders of the experience of yesterday and 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.860
 of a decidedly more excavated terrain 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.930
 easy limit errors and on average 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.610
 they repeat if not even improve i 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.960
 times of the first day 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.000
 unfortunately, however, the mechanical means 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.789
 subjected to two days of stress a lot 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.619
 heavy can make jokes and points 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.149
 so it happened at the distance of a few 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.130
 minutes from each other 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.259
 oldrati first better than the Italians 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.210
 until that moment and in the morning immediately 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.590
 the man who created a good race but who 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.510
 alone by an error constraint in the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.910
 second special is the Italian vase 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.500
 to today's and unfortunately compromised a 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.420
 shame because until then 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.100
 the Azzurri were increasing the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.110
 their advantage to see the ranking 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.330
 Today with the Great Britain first and the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.670
 france second at just 38 seconds 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.350
 despite only three drivers not competing 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.820
 does nothing but increase the regret that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.320
 it is said very clearly by words 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.960
 of the manager of the alexandre india 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.180
 bad luck as everyone saw the day 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.540
 positive of yesterday with a great victory 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.240
 I do n't say unexpected but we believed it 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.980
 a lot also because we had a nice 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.320
 advantage already from the first day 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.690
 pity as soon as I heard the news myself 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.370
 I was in the enduro in their heads 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.340
 just heard the news that i am 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.710
 stop is very sorry because there 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.410
 I kept both for the boys but also for me 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.980
 same so a satisfaction that there 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.630
 in short, I wanted it to go well 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.520
 gianluca morning in italy of the junior 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.760
 from the stars to the stables we have lost 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.520
 two pilots first oldrati what is there 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.070
 tales if we were starting the big one 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.500
 echo a great victory yesterday 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.950
 today the first one had started quietly 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.870
 around salty all the forts and then first 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.430
 hydrates has had a motorcycle problem e 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.430
 then already there we are a bit 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.430
 then demoralized the revenge of the tirano 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.130
 forward we did the last special 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.470
 I'm pretty strong we always had it there 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.150
 in front of them because they also love them 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.300
 pilots to sign 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.140
 then I also had a problem with the bike 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.900
 in the transfer that the water wanted me 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.150
 continuously then you are the broken the engine is 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.430
 I was also due to retire 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.320
 they were off to the great we are sorry a 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.040
 lot because this item that really of 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.820
 win and now there is a mouth to mouth at 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.820
 wolf to the trophy that succeeds arrives on 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.820
 podium 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.890
 but fortunately it was a day 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.080
 two faces the other is definitely more 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.850
 shirt is positive in its world 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.310
 blue and dragged by the usual feeling 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.280
 each recovery has recovered positions up 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.560
 positions 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.300
 so much to get back on the podium he took off 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.280
 at one stroke be Finland now 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.990
 fourth who could not benefit from the 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.030
 usual contribution in itself rimini 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.980
 renato from mechanical wives that spain 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.800
 who lost his cristobal star 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.990
 guerrero in front of the blues there is now 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.270
 Australia pushed by a big price a 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.520
 almost five minutes 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.770
 many but not too many for not being able to 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.720
 hope to recover something again 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.669
 far away from all the france that with 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.169
 the trophy practically at home appears 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.080
 more interested in understanding who among the 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.460
 four musketeers three neo nambo ten e 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.139
 roberto will make his absolute individual his own 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.879
 we are with manuel monni we start from 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.849
 team result Italy has closed 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:50.190
 third the day is virtually on 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:54.150
 the lady's podium is the result 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.849
 very positive for six days very 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.639
 long then we will have to work hard 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.090
 but in the next few days it is a lot for us 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.190
 important to be in the first three races 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.569
 was today but today we say it was 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.690
 a little more peaceful race 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.340
 compared to yesterday's result mine 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.280
 staff finally went 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.889
 quite good pity for the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.520
 the paddock cross that I was a 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:23.669
 a little slow though all in all 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.289
 it was the positive day what we did 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.800
 awaits in the next two days in the 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.740
 shop out area but definitely of the 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.039
 challenging tests 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:38.129
 it will be important not to make mistakes that the 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:41.810
 team joined and succeeded 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.810
 to the common sense
