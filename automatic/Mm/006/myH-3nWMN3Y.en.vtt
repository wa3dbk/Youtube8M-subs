00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello guys this is interactive medicine 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.890
 and today we will talk about mitosis 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.110
 first we must know what is the 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.480
 mitosis 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.599
 mitosis is the name given to 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.730
 the asexual cell division that 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.680
 produces in somatic cells 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.380
 after the duplication of the material 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.779
 genetic and in this process you get to 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.720
 from a single diploid stem cell 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.100
 two daughter cells also with the same 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.219
 genetic load that is diploid 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.219
 we must then know what it means 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.260
 really diploid this means that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.230
 is equipped with two sets of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.690
 chromosomes in a set of chromosomes 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.329
 we will find 23 chromosomes what 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.969
 it means that by being double game of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.680
 chromosomes we will have a total charge of 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.020
 46 chromosomes 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.800
 and while we're talking about chromosomes 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.300
 we must take into account and know what is 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.880
 a chromosome 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.280
 the chromosome is the compact form of 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.110
 genetic material to understand the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.690
 mitosis we must know certain 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.390
 specific portions of the chromosome as 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.660
 for example the arm short arm 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.000
 long a central portion that is known 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.730
 as a mere center and within which 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.600
 watch the movie tokoro 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.610
 besides this we must know that the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.250
 short arm set with arm 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.980
 long chromatic shape 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.620
 even though we usually observe 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.080
 the chromosome in this form only gets 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.270
 this form defined when the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.460
 mitotic process before it starts 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.200
 the mitotic process the genetic material 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.120
 It is arranged 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.120
 disorganized as seen here 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.649
 in this way we arrive at mitosis as 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:05.350
 such mitosis is made up of phases 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:09.399
 they are four phases pro phase goal phase 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.140
 anna phase and telo phase the profa 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.599
 corresponds to the first stage in the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.640
 process of asexual or mitotic division 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.290
 for the understanding of the profa it 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.970
 we must point out certain 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.220
 important cellular features 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.140
 such as a core that contains 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.810
 the genetic material in a start 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.540
 disorganized intracellular structures 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.709
 that are known as centers and all this 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.980
 turn contained in a membrane 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.590
 cellular in the profa are deployed 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.049
 important characteristics within 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.970
 which we observe firstly the 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.610
 condensation or organization of the material 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.099
 genetic in chromosomes that are 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.730
 structures with traditionally shaped 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.519
 of x in addition in the profa a 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.099
 migration process of the centers 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.910
 these intracellular structures are going 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.470
 to mobilize, denoting in this way the 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.560
 cellular poles 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.390
 project to the equator of the cell 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.760
 tubular structures known as 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.620
 Mythical spindles that allow anchoring 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.530
 of the chromosomes to said structures 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.590
 also in the profa is at the beginning the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.300
 genetic material observed in the form of 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.880
 chromosomes is contained in the membrane 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.460
 nuclear and for him culminated from the profa 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.860
 the nuclear membrane disintegrates 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.840
 leveling chromosomes free 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.930
 of the cytoplasm and it is at this moment 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.130
 where the profa culminates and the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.210
 goal pass 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.310
 in the goal phase we must remember the 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.460
 features described above 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.230
 of the chromosome as for example we said 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.670
 that we were going to find a portion 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.500
 centric known as center mere and that 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.550
 inside we find the stump cinema 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.700
 in the meta phase the mythical uses are 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.140
 anchor to the movie stump allowing the 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.930
 chromosomes have a positioning 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.580
 fixed 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.400
 to culminated from the prov 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.800
 we had free chromosomes at the level of 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.640
 cytoplasm as the image that can 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.430
 observe just now however 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.010
 the meta phase these chromosomes are 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.230
 organize at the level of the equator of the 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.380
 cell and this is the particularity more 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.600
 important meta phase chromosomes in 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.350
 the equator of the cell highly 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.350
 visible 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.099
 so we come to the anna phase the anna phase 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.729
 corresponds to the third stage in the 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.680
 process of asexual or mitotic division 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.080
 to understand the phase we must remember 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.419
 the characteristics of the chromosome more 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.190
 important as for example that the 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.349
 chromosome is a structure formed 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.990
 by a short arm and a long arm and 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.479
 that together they form the chromatic ones in 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.759
 the Havana phase each chromosome is divided 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.669
 in two chromatics in this way it 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.009
 duplicates the genetic material of the 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.749
 cell 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.460
 the chromatic ones that at the beginning 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:09.129
 found at the equator of the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.289
 cell start in the process phase 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.289
 migratory to the poles of it 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.790
 the chromatic ones of this form approach 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.980
 little by little to the centers and because of the 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.920
 previous duplication the material 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.920
 genetic for this moment has already been 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.920
 duplicate 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.419
 in this way the phase e will culminate 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.469
 start the TV or phase at the moment in 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:40.639
 which the chromatic reach the 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:43.520
 cellular poles ie they reach the 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:47.169
 centers the TV or phase is characterized 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.629
 by two important events the first 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:53.599
 will be the restitution of the integrity of 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:56.270
 the nuclear membrane that now with the DNA 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:59.539
 or duplicate genetic material will form 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.120
 two independent cores and the second 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:05.240
 eventuality is the elongation and then 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.360
 widening of the cytoplasm that 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.909
 culminates with the formation of two cells 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.310
 totally independent giving the 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:15.530
 result then to two daughter cells to 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.490
 from a stem cell and culminating 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.490
 so mitosis 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:24.809
 this has been all denle I like and 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:27.990
 share this video if I help you 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:31.459
 thank you very much for watching and luck 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.459
 have a nice day
