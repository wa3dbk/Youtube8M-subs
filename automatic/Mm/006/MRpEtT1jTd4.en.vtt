00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
so how do you tell if your water inlet

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.860 
so how do you tell if your water inlet
needs<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.060> be<00:00:03.210> replaced<00:00:04.879> well<00:00:05.879> you<00:00:06.390> can<00:00:06.569> empty

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
needs to be replaced well you can empty

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.370 
needs to be replaced well you can empty
the<00:00:07.049> line<00:00:08.000> from<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.059> icemaker<00:00:09.570> that's<00:00:10.080> at<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the line from the icemaker that's at the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.160 
the line from the icemaker that's at the
top<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:11.400> there's<00:00:11.580> no<00:00:11.700> water<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.179> switch<00:00:12.929> off

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
top so there's no water and switch off

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.079 
top so there's no water and switch off
your<00:00:13.309> ice<00:00:14.309> maker

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
your ice maker

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.990 
your ice maker
by<00:00:15.210> putting<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:16.049> position<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:17.000> then

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
by putting in the up position and then

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.810 
by putting in the up position and then
turning<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.660> water<00:00:19.189> now<00:00:20.189> if<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.520> line

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
turning on the water now if this line

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.820 
turning on the water now if this line
fills<00:00:21.210> up<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.449> water<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> icemaker

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
fills up with water with the icemaker

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.839 
fills up with water with the icemaker
off<00:00:23.750> that<00:00:24.750> means<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.529> valve<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.340> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
off that means that this valve here is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.540 
off that means that this valve here is
faulty<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:27.800> needs<00:00:28.800> replacing

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
faulty or needs replacing

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.400 
faulty or needs replacing
I'll<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.210> replace<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.720> whole<00:00:30.840> unit<00:00:30.869> it's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
I'll just replace the whole unit it's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.630 
I'll just replace the whole unit it's
cheap<00:00:31.650> enough<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:35.070> will<00:00:35.250> not<00:00:35.430> fill<00:00:35.610> up

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
cheap enough and this will not fill up

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.119 
cheap enough and this will not fill up
with<00:00:35.850> water<00:00:35.910> meaning<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.899> ice<00:00:37.079> maker<00:00:37.440> won't

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
with water meaning your ice maker won't

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.049 
with water meaning your ice maker won't
overfill<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.120> water<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.750> Rec<00:00:42.620> okay<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
overfill with water and Rec okay so the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.470 
overfill with water and Rec okay so the
water<00:00:45.300> valve<00:00:45.930> inlet<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.559> behind<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.550> what

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
water valve inlet is behind here so what

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.000 
water valve inlet is behind here so what
you<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.020> remove<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> hoses<00:00:49.800> I've

you want to do is remove the hoses I've

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
you want to do is remove the hoses I've
already<00:00:50.280> removed<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.700> one<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.750> pull<00:00:52.079> them

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
already removed this one you pull them

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.660 
already removed this one you pull them
up<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> same<00:00:53.010> time<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.399> push<00:00:53.640> down

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
up but at the same time you push down

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.049 
up but at the same time you push down
that<00:00:54.090> little<00:00:55.039> wet<00:00:56.039> hair<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.430> allows<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.969> to

pull now leave this one infinite but

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.040 
pull now leave this one infinite but
push<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> way

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
find a few screws around there you just

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.390 
find a few screws around there you just
easily<00:01:03.989> undo<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:08.220> last<00:01:08.369> screw<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.880> me<00:01:09.229> now

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
easily undo the last screw for me now

easily undo the last screw for me now
mark<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.479> which<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.140> where<00:01:13.530> they

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
mark these down on which one where they

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.270 
mark these down on which one where they
go<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.750> with<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> bit<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.020> sticky<00:01:16.409> tape<00:01:16.439> but

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
go and with a bit of sticky tape but

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.120 
go and with a bit of sticky tape but
it's<00:01:17.549> fairly<00:01:17.790> simple<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.650> marking

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it's fairly simple but I like marking

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
it's fairly simple but I like marking
everything<00:01:20.400> always<00:01:20.790> need<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> move<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.259> by<00:01:22.409> one

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
everything always need to move it by one

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.320 
everything always need to move it by one
screw<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.189> side<00:01:25.820> things<00:01:26.820> should<00:01:27.000> pop<00:01:27.180> out

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
screw on this side things should pop out

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.920 
screw on this side things should pop out
very<00:01:27.750> simply<00:01:28.640> also<00:01:29.640> remove<00:01:29.970> these<00:01:30.180> hoses<00:01:30.750> like

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
very simply also remove these hoses like

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.719 
very simply also remove these hoses like
so<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.040> well<00:01:33.200> just<00:01:34.200> push<00:01:34.530> down<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.070> pull<00:01:35.520> out

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
so as well just push down and pull out

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.810 
so as well just push down and pull out
at<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> same<00:01:36.299> time<00:01:36.680> anyways<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.610> new

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
at the same time anyways this is my new

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.179 
at the same time anyways this is my new
unit<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.210> I've<00:01:39.420> already<00:01:39.600> installed<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.380> I'm

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
unit that I've already installed so I'm

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.460 
unit that I've already installed so I'm
going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> continue<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> swap<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.409> over

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
going to continue and you swap it over

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.380 
going to continue and you swap it over
and<00:01:43.680> that's<00:01:43.740> how<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> go

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and that's how you do it so when you go

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.630 
and that's how you do it so when you go
to<00:01:45.450> put<00:01:45.659> them<00:01:45.750> back<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.640> push<00:01:47.640> nice<00:01:48.860> all<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
to put them back in push nice all the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.179 
to put them back in push nice all the
way<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.780> before<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.259> screw<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.710> all<00:01:52.829> up<00:01:53.009> you

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
way and before you screw it all up you

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.679 
way and before you screw it all up you
might<00:01:53.399> want<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> test<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.030> there's<00:01:54.299> no<00:01:54.450> water

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
might want to test that there's no water

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.050 
might want to test that there's no water
leaks<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.409> by<00:01:55.950> playing<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
leaks just by playing it all in all the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
leaks just by playing it all in all the
switches<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.479> turning<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> water<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.290> making

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
switches and turning the water on making

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.700 
switches and turning the water on making
sure<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.369> not<00:01:59.460> leaking<00:01:59.729> from<00:02:00.030> anywhere<00:02:00.710> but

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
sure it's not leaking from anywhere but

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.959 
sure it's not leaking from anywhere but
in<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> meantime<00:02:02.070> I'll<00:02:02.880> continue<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.070> go<00:02:05.820> back

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
in the meantime I'll continue so go back

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:20.030 
in the meantime I'll continue so go back
to<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.240> side<00:02:06.829> put<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> screw

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.480 

that<00:02:21.040> bomb<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:21.730> place<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:26.490> slide

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
that bomb is that in place you slide

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:39.229 
that bomb is that in place you slide
