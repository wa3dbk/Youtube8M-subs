00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.789 
beginning we expect to lose many a game
at<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> beginning<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:03.899> expect<00:02:04.049> everyone

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
at the beginning but we expect everyone

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.370 
at the beginning but we expect everyone
to<00:02:05.159> think<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.090> work<00:02:06.659> hard<00:02:07.079> to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to think that we can work hard to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.669 
to think that we can work hard to
improve<00:02:07.439> our<00:02:07.770> game

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
improve our game

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.440 
improve our game
and<00:02:08.799> perhaps<00:02:09.369> we<00:02:09.700> can<00:02:09.789> give<00:02:09.969> that<00:02:10.000> level

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
and perhaps we can give that level

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.809 
and perhaps we can give that level
sometime<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.049> future<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.650> as<00:02:12.549> a<00:02:12.609> last

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
sometime in the future and as a last

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.229 
sometime in the future and as a last
note<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.120> promise<00:02:13.629> it's<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.840> last<00:02:13.930> thing<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.439> say
