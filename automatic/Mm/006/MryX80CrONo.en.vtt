00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
black obviously not getting power but

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.050

also that a lot of people don't know is

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
also that a lot of people don't know is
if<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> look<00:01:51.060> at<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.210> coloration<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
if you look at the coloration of the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.969 
if you look at the coloration of the
redstone<00:01:52.979> wire<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:55.020> gets<00:01:55.200> towards<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.770> end

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
redstone wire as it gets towards the end

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.640 
redstone wire as it gets towards the end
and<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.790> power<00:01:57.030> starts<00:01:57.450> getting<00:01:58.290> lower<00:01:58.530> and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
and the power starts getting lower and

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.830 
and the power starts getting lower and
lower<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:59.580> wire<00:01:59.790> starts<00:02:00.180> fading<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
lower the wire starts fading into a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.870 
lower the wire starts fading into a
different<00:02:01.229> color<00:02:01.470> until<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.460> turns<00:02:02.640> black

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
different color until it turns black

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.670 
different color until it turns black
that<00:02:03.660> means<00:02:03.840> there's<00:02:04.020> no<00:02:04.080> power<00:02:04.350> being

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that means there's no power being

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.190 
that means there's no power being
provided<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.430> well<00:02:06.030> at<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.390> point<00:02:06.509> we

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
provided to it well at this point we

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.460 
provided to it well at this point we
would<00:02:07.320> create<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.800> those<00:02:07.979> big<00:02:08.190> bulky<00:02:09.470> what

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
would create one of those big bulky what

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.310 
would create one of those big bulky what
do<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.590> call<00:02:10.790> boosters<00:02:11.810> but<00:02:12.810> instead<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
do you call boosters but instead of

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.000 
do you call boosters but instead of
creating<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.769> big<00:02:13.980> bulky<00:02:14.489> booster<00:02:15.830> here's<00:02:16.830> what

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
creating a big bulky booster here's what

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.310 
creating a big bulky booster here's what
we<00:02:17.130> can<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:18.600> let's<00:02:18.750> come<00:02:18.930> over<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
we can do so let's come over to the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.080 
we can do so let's come over to the
workbench<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.980> I'm<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.850> show<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.030> how

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
workbench and I'm going to show you how

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.509 
workbench and I'm going to show you how
to<00:02:21.209> create<00:02:21.420> these<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.620> redstone<00:02:23.070> repeaters

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
to create these the redstone repeaters

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.640 
to create these the redstone repeaters
so<00:02:24.450> we<00:02:24.600> can<00:02:24.690> eat<00:02:24.870> stone<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.220> bottom<00:02:27.650> we're

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
so we can eat stone on the bottom we're

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.460 
so we can eat stone on the bottom we're
going<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.980> need<00:02:29.100> red<00:02:29.340> stone<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.060> middle

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
going to need red stone in the middle

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.140 
going to need red stone in the middle
two<00:02:31.470> redstone<00:02:31.830> torches<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> side<00:02:32.940> and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
two redstone torches on the side and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.220 
two redstone torches on the side and
there's<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.200> redstone<00:02:34.590> repeater<00:02:35.100> now<00:02:36.110> let's<00:02:37.110> go

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
there's a redstone repeater now let's go

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.630 
there's a redstone repeater now let's go
ahead<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.470> collect<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:38.010> stuff<00:02:38.070> here<00:02:38.640> and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
ahead and collect this stuff here and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.160 
ahead and collect this stuff here and
we're<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.820> put<00:02:42.000> one<00:02:42.209> down<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.019> we're

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
we're going to put one down so we're

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.890 
we're going to put one down so we're
going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.350> put<00:02:43.410> one<00:02:43.530> down<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:44.549> now<00:02:45.150> one

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
going to put one down here now one

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.509 
going to put one down here now one
thing's<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.230> wanted<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.620> wanted<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.130> say<00:02:47.310> also

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
thing's I wanted I wanted to say also

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.759 
thing's I wanted I wanted to say also
was<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:49.500> redstone<00:02:50.400> repeater<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:52.470> way<00:02:52.620> it

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
was the redstone repeater the way it

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.890 
was the redstone repeater the way it
works<00:02:53.040> when<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.459> play<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.850> down<00:02:54.030> if<00:02:54.329> you're

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
works when you play it down if you're

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.720 
works when you play it down if you're
facing<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.560> direction<00:02:55.890> if<00:02:56.100> I'm<00:02:56.220> facing<00:02:56.459> this

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
facing a direction if I'm facing this

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.640 
facing a direction if I'm facing this
direction<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.329> I<00:02:57.420> lay<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.690> down<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:58.440> going

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
direction and I lay it down it's going

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.800 
direction and I lay it down it's going
to<00:02:58.709> work<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.310> direction<00:02:59.489> only<00:02:59.970> as<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
to work in this direction only as you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.509 
to work in this direction only as you
can<00:03:00.870> see<00:03:01.110> there's<00:03:01.290> an<00:03:01.410> arrow<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.010> right

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
can see there's an arrow on it right

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.560 
can see there's an arrow on it right
there<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.000> points<00:03:03.299> in<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.480> direction

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
there and it points in the direction

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.150 
there and it points in the direction
that<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.049> lay<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.230> down<00:03:04.440> it's<00:03:04.709> real<00:03:04.890> easy<00:03:04.920> to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
that you lay it down it's real easy to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.680 
that you lay it down it's real easy to
pick<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:05.940> hit<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.120> once<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.630> it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
pick up you just hit it once and it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.720 
pick up you just hit it once and it
comes<00:03:06.930> up<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.769> whichever<00:03:08.070> direction<00:03:08.610> you're

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
comes up so whichever direction you're

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.460 
comes up so whichever direction you're
pointing<00:03:09.180> that's<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.690> direction<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.350> going

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
pointing that's the direction it's going

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.460 
pointing that's the direction it's going
to<00:03:10.620> work<00:03:10.799> so<00:03:11.760> just<00:03:12.019> some<00:03:13.019> food<00:03:13.230> for<00:03:13.410> thought

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
to work so just some food for thought

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.470 
to work so just some food for thought
okay<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.310> now<00:03:14.610> we're<00:03:15.060> going<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.209> lay<00:03:15.329> it<00:03:15.360> right

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
okay so now we're going to lay it right

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.449 
okay so now we're going to lay it right
there<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.049> now<00:03:16.829> we're<00:03:16.950> going<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.100> step<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
there and now we're going to step on the

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.100 
there and now we're going to step on the
block<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.079> now<00:03:19.079> everything<00:03:19.739> has<00:03:19.829> power<00:03:20.070> now

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
block and now everything has power now

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.030 
block and now everything has power now
one<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> things<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.650> was<00:03:22.680> going<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:22.980> show

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
one of the things I was going to show

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.650 
one of the things I was going to show
you<00:03:23.220> let's<00:03:24.030> go<00:03:24.180> ahead<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.420> pick<00:03:24.870> all<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.170> up

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660

you let's go ahead and pick all this up
so<00:03:27.660> now<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.110> just<00:03:28.350> took<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.710> place<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:28.950> those

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
so now this just took the place of those

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.760 
so now this just took the place of those
bulky<00:03:32.510> boosters<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:33.930> used<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.260> make<00:03:34.380> all

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
bulky boosters that we used to make all

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.440 
bulky boosters that we used to make all
right<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.070> let's<00:03:35.160> leave<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.400> there<00:03:35.700> okay<00:03:36.390> so

lay<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:38.010> out<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.640> put<00:03:38.700> two<00:03:39.060> there<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.660> then

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
lay this out and put two there and then

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.550 
lay this out and put two there and then
we're<00:03:40.200> going<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.350> put<00:03:40.410> our<00:03:41.150> note<00:03:42.150> block<00:03:42.560> right

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
we're going to put our note block right

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.450 
we're going to put our note block right
there<00:03:43.590> we'll<00:03:44.340> say<00:03:46.490> let's<00:03:47.490> get<00:03:47.640> something<00:03:48.000> cool

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
there we'll say let's get something cool

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.370 
there we'll say let's get something cool
okay<00:03:50.460> that's<00:03:50.670> cool<00:03:50.910> all<00:03:51.600> right<00:03:51.720> some<00:03:51.960> wind<00:03:52.260> do

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
okay that's cool all right some wind do

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.040 
okay that's cool all right some wind do
is<00:03:52.470> we're<00:03:52.590> going<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.740> lay<00:03:52.890> down<00:03:53.750> repeater<00:03:54.750> 1

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
is we're going to lay down repeater 1

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.280 
is we're going to lay down repeater 1
Peter<00:03:55.890> 2<00:03:56.180> o.c<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.420> didn't<00:03:57.840> face<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.170> right

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
Peter 2 o.c I didn't face the right

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.210 
Peter 2 o.c I didn't face the right
direction<00:03:58.700> Peter<00:03:59.700> to<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.860> repeater<00:04:01.860> three

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
direction Peter to and repeater three

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.310 
direction Peter to and repeater three
and<00:04:02.430> then<00:04:02.910> we'll<00:04:03.000> lay<00:04:03.120> some<00:04:03.420> redstone<00:04:03.630> right

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
and then we'll lay some redstone right

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.670 
and then we'll lay some redstone right
there<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.400> at<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.490> point<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.930> repeater<00:04:07.350> has

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
there so at this point the repeater has

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.199 
there so at this point the repeater has
four<00:04:08.070> settings<00:04:09.770> let's<00:04:10.770> see<00:04:11.220> let's<00:04:11.640> set<00:04:12.060> all

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
four settings let's see let's set all

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.270 
four settings let's see let's set all
these<00:04:12.420> back<00:04:12.750> matter<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.709> fact<00:04:13.860> I'm<00:04:14.070> actually

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
these back matter of fact I'm actually

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.980 
these back matter of fact I'm actually
going<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:14.610> do<00:04:14.760> something<00:04:14.970> different<00:04:15.060> go<00:04:15.690> fast

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
going to do something different go fast

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.740 
going to do something different go fast
rid<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:16.950> rid<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.400> okay<00:04:17.940> cool<00:04:18.090> let's

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
rid of that rid of that okay cool let's

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.060 
rid of that rid of that okay cool let's
go<00:04:18.930> ahead<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.109> put<00:04:19.290> this<00:04:19.410> down<00:04:19.620> there<00:04:19.920> and

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
go ahead and put this down there and

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.830 
go ahead and put this down there and
they're<00:04:20.250> all<00:04:20.820> right<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.090> right<00:04:21.239> now<00:04:21.299> it's<00:04:21.690> at

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
they're all right so right now it's at

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.570 
they're all right so right now it's at
the<00:04:22.019> highest<00:04:22.320> settings<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.100> we<00:04:23.220> want<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.460> put

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
the highest settings so we want to put

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.240 
the highest settings so we want to put
it<00:04:23.670> there<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:24.390> if<00:04:24.480> I<00:04:24.540> step<00:04:24.780> on<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.250> pressure

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
it there so if I step on the pressure

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.770 
it there so if I step on the pressure
plate<00:04:26.400> it's<00:04:27.270> almost<00:04:27.480> interested<00:04:29.780> instant

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
plate it's almost interested instant

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.000 
plate it's almost interested instant
okay<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.710> if<00:04:31.770> we<00:04:31.890> set<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.100> back<00:04:32.280> one<00:04:33.890> she<00:04:34.890> is

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
okay so if we set it back one she is

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.129 
okay so if we set it back one she is
smaller

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
smaller

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:44.020 
smaller
smaller<00:04:38.129> delay<00:04:38.460> set<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.210> back<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:41.300> see<00:04:42.300> that

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
smaller delay set it back to see that

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.189 
smaller delay set it back to see that
and<00:04:45.030> set<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.389> back<00:04:45.509> to<00:04:45.719> the<00:04:45.810> last<00:04:46.020> 14<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:48.199> there

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
and set it back to the last 14 and there

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.439 
and set it back to the last 14 and there
we<00:04:49.349> go<00:04:49.379> so<00:04:50.189> now<00:04:50.370> as<00:04:50.669> you<00:04:50.819> see<00:04:51.029> that<00:04:51.210> right<00:04:51.389> there

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
we go so now as you see that right there

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.499 
we go so now as you see that right there
that's<00:04:51.949> just<00:04:52.949> that's<00:04:53.159> the<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.879> four<00:04:54.210> settings

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
that's just that's the the four settings

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.320 
that's just that's the the four settings
of<00:04:54.689> delays<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:56.550> more<00:04:56.819> and<00:04:56.969> more<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.210> you

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
of delays so the more and more that you

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.969 
of delays so the more and more that you
put<00:04:57.479> it<00:04:57.569> back<00:04:57.719> the<00:04:58.139> more<00:04:58.379> and<00:04:58.469> more<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.770> delay

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
put it back the more and more the delay

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.589 
put it back the more and more the delay
is<00:04:59.159> this<00:04:59.610> is<00:04:59.699> probably<00:04:59.909> going<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.180> be<00:05:00.270> really

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
is this is probably going to be really

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.689 
is this is probably going to be really
good<00:05:00.779> for<00:05:00.990> creating<00:05:01.379> songs<00:05:01.620> because<00:05:02.460> then<00:05:02.610> it

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
good for creating songs because then it

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.249 
good for creating songs because then it
can<00:05:02.909> be<00:05:02.999> laid<00:05:03.150> on<00:05:03.210> note<00:05:03.509> blocks<00:05:03.779> instead<00:05:04.110> of

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
can be laid on note blocks instead of

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.499 
can be laid on note blocks instead of
using<00:05:04.469> all<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:05.039> different<00:05:05.370> repeaters<00:05:06.330> and

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
using all the different repeaters and

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.570 
using all the different repeaters and
delays<00:05:07.430> okay<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:09.120> what<00:05:09.599> we're<00:05:09.750> going<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:10.050> do

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
delays okay so what we're going to do

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.950 
delays okay so what we're going to do
show<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.669> that<00:05:11.759> again<00:05:11.819> okay<00:05:12.509> now<00:05:12.750> we're<00:05:12.900> going

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960
