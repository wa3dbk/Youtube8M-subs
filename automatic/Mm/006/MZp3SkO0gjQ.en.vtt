how<00:00:00.659> many<00:00:00.840> folks<00:00:01.079> are<00:00:01.560> on<00:00:02.270> currently<00:00:03.529> I<00:00:04.529> should

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
how many folks are on currently I should

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:17.930 
how many folks are on currently I should
count<00:00:05.400> before<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.240> go

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.090 

can<00:00:18.450> range<00:00:18.660> anywhere<00:00:18.780> between<00:00:19.110> 25<00:00:19.950> to<00:00:19.980> 35

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:32.089 

shapes<00:00:24.970> sizes<00:00:25.390> flavors

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 

I<00:00:32.160> would<00:00:32.820> say<00:00:33.000> probably<00:00:33.329> 80%<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
I would say probably 80% of it it's to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.520 
I would say probably 80% of it it's to
add<00:00:34.800> flavor<00:00:35.809> drinks<00:00:36.809> rather<00:00:37.199> than<00:00:37.410> add

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
add flavor drinks rather than add

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.529 
add flavor drinks rather than add
dilution<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.460> instead<00:00:38.789> of<00:00:38.850> having<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
dilution so instead of having a

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.259 
dilution so instead of having a
margarita<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.250> daring<00:00:41.610> gets

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
margarita that it's if daring gets

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.180 
margarita that it's if daring gets
watery<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.019> put<00:00:43.230> ours<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.559> Fresnel<00:00:44.070> ice

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
watery and we put ours on Fresnel ice

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.160 
watery and we put ours on Fresnel ice
cubes<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.210> instead<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.480> getting<00:00:45.780> water<00:00:45.930> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
cubes so instead of getting water it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.709 
cubes so instead of getting water it
gets<00:00:46.320> spicy<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.699> changes<00:00:48.089> a<00:00:48.120> drink<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
gets spicy it changes a drink but it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.250 
gets spicy it changes a drink but it
adds<00:00:48.899> another<00:00:49.350> element<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.640> melts<00:00:50.909> the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
adds another element as it melts the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.289 
adds another element as it melts the
program<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> aviary<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.039> certainly<00:00:53.579> one

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
program at the aviary is certainly one

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.840 
program at the aviary is certainly one

you have to start with good water in
order<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.240> make<00:01:38.299> good<00:01:38.420> ice

our ice the ice room is I'd say it's

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.459 
our ice the ice room is I'd say it's
kind<00:01:50.789> of<00:01:50.819> like<00:01:50.969> a<00:01:51.000> studio<00:01:51.479> kitchen<00:01:52.079> when<00:01:52.319> we

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
kind of like a studio kitchen when we

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:53.899 
kind of like a studio kitchen when we
show<00:01:52.649> people<00:01:52.829> around<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.369> always<00:01:53.640> show<00:01:53.759> them

make one single hollow ice cube and from
that<00:02:32.790> point<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.269> decide<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.719> as<00:02:33.840> possible<00:02:34.260> we

that point we decide that as possible we

that point we decide that as possible we

never think about oh can we do this for
100<00:02:36.930> people<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:38.010> we<00:02:38.189> serve<00:02:38.430> 300<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
100 people can we serve 300 and the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.199 
100 people can we serve 300 and the
rocks<00:02:39.750> at<00:02:40.019> night<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.890> always<00:02:41.159> is<00:02:41.609> it<00:02:41.969> good

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
rocks at night it's always is it good

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.179 
rocks at night it's always is it good
once<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.870> then<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.349> long<00:02:43.530> as<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:43.829> good<00:02:44.010> once

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
once and then as long as it's good once

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.540 
once and then as long as it's good once
we'll<00:02:44.790> figure<00:02:44.969> out<00:02:45.090> how<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.329> make<00:02:45.540> it

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
we'll figure out how to make it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:58.400 
we'll figure out how to make it
or<00:02:48.540> 10,000<00:02:49.200> times<00:02:49.350> you

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.470 

it's<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.530> same<00:02:59.740> machine<00:03:00.100> that's<00:03:00.310> used<00:03:00.550> by<00:03:00.790> ice

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
it's the same machine that's used by ice

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.660 
it's the same machine that's used by ice
