00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.629
 welcome everyone that is now from the fifth 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.210
 delivery of wild edible plants 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.490
 was worked but the best part is that 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.000
 you again and continue to shine and come along 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.000
 to look work we can find 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.240
 where before I forget 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.240
 www.kvk.nl 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.270
 but back in beautiful plan 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.280
 is flower and the best thing about it is that 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.930
 whole planet tube 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.930
 to browse the watchers 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.129
 well maud the flower buds and the blossoms 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.329
 It is a bit of a mess for the swivel itself 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.980
 late 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.659
 Some people think its capable 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.760
 this customer is not tasty 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.579
 but these people do a big mistake 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.559
 because it is important that the carrot 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.229
 is dug up in front of the plant 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.809
 flowers the flower buds may be correct 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.660
 vegetables awake or something 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.700
 or in making the blossoms you can like 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.160
 the momentum as your beautiful decoration 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.110
 use salads 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.600
 the leaves for the leaves goat it 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.789
 remains and as for the cotton they can 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.950
 just be harvested at for the 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.420
 has developed flowering stems 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.039
 for anas 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.039
 are too spicy in taste 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.570
 evening primrose drives you tomorrow 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.240
 can with all back flowers it is 5 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.240
 do to the beast brother said no dad 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.940
 franc known to everyone and yet must 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.750
 you watch out if your father is in the neighborhood of 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.979
 It also has quite a bit of collection 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.860
 double glass 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.479
 like for example the small flat it 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.170
 small butterbur is their way too 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.720
 simplicity but also offering that 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.899
 yes warm we think that can be small 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.690
 other things can be done for business too 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.410
 as well where you succeeded well that you 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.899
 are sure and garde is green for the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.260
 people of your work and life 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.530
 Of course it contains a large 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 pretty nice metal you can do the best 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.400
 chair or you can caramelize them and then 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.590
 give his salad that is quite tasty 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.550
 also leaves of the plane tree against me 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.600
 logical 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.480
 eta was perhaps you already they 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.480
 having time is not every plant that 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.510
 and to take macs as the earth 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.320
 bring 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.320
 here you can see it 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.380
 notebook is closed so few flowers 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.700
 fuck me fed up i don't give one 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.670
 explain factual langrijk but yes me 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.150
 think then dad went for nothing 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.800
 be careful if you have to 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:08.950
 yes that nothing can happen to the 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:12.340
 children and no blouse is left 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.310
 flower buds but early spring there 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.070
 insists and is weird to post 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.620
 seem to make the and here shelter and 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.600
 can not use the flower bud because 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.600
 grains make our delicious 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.550
 ok from there something about club place that 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.520
 with regard to heavy metals and 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.010
 other pollution of nature or god 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.280
 and with 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.680
 well touched heavy metal that 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.530
 Of course we never know Ekama's 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.630
 a recommendation not to scam 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.950
 Pick those really close to a street 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.000
 stand 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.920
 but on the other hand how often do you see 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.870
 farmland with corn and other things 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.360
 a template that for human 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.280
 consumption are grown immediately 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.780
 stand the snow away but that's one 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.040
 different story 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.489
 then of course you have others 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.830
 pollutants such as a lot of water that from the 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.260
 industry comes or other things it 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.330
 can contaminate vegetables 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.570
 well, so we never know 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.430
 exactly to we you can pay attention so 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.730
 no industry is nearby 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.120
 where you have will succeed what their hope 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.310
 and their 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.750
 is of spice you naturally never go on 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.790
 picking an outlet the route but yes too 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.530
 you never know that for a week 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.570
 I have a recommendation for that for you 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.310
 pickers just go to the rain 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.500
 probability its high that the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.500
 nature has something to wash 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.229
 but of course you have to watch out for 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.050
 yes also to prevent illnesses say 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.310
 that your winter thesis least yo much 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.370
 club 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.280
 yes it was good but also important 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.539
 actually 13 bankrupt okay sometimes you want 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.490
 something to eat 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.120
 but of course that is everyone 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.259
 his own responsibility so much 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.259
 having fun doing it 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.220
 that's cool is lemon balm you come 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.860
 not often against 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.620
 because usually this van wants it 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.479
 actually not here at home and yes 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.000
 Moreover, your accelerated interest cannot 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.880
 for attacks if she is in between 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.789
 but fairly easy to recognize as you 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.360
 a leaf bruises to what you do one 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:31.240
 I get to use lemon solid 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.530
 then you can make ice cream or other 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.810
 desserts 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.780
 We as a lemon flavor is 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:42.190
 of course always soak in sweet 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:45.099
 things really you can also do this 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.409
 use her dishes as you 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.630
 For example, think of and even one 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.539
 white sauce or something with fish or 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.139
 time liked yes that I can and me 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.139
 propose 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.030
 unfortunately last tab for of data again 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.290
 so hope to see you next time 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.290
 see you soon
