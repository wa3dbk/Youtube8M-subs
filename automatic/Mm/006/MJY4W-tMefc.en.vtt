00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
got Tottenham here and this is this is a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.710 
got Tottenham here and this is this is a
system<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> High<00:00:23.369> Line<00:00:23.669> like<00:00:24.419> they<00:00:24.570> play

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
system with the High Line like they play

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
system with the High Line like they play
in<00:00:24.779> real<00:00:24.869> life<00:00:25.109> under<00:00:25.769> vs<00:00:26.009> Boas<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.089> I'm

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
in real life under vs Boas so I'm

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.880 
in real life under vs Boas so I'm
pushing<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.689> center<00:00:27.960> box<00:00:28.079> right<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.829> you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
pushing the center box right up and you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.790 
pushing the center box right up and you
can<00:00:29.880> note<00:00:30.089> this<00:00:30.269> position<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.019> here<00:00:31.289> it's

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
can note this position just here it's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.490 
can note this position just here it's
quite<00:00:32.250> away<00:00:32.610> from<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> box<00:00:33.150> so<00:00:34.110> basically

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
quite away from the box so basically

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.110 
quite away from the box so basically
they're<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.680> pushing<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.489> opposition

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
they're just pushing out the opposition

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.400 
they're just pushing out the opposition
and<00:00:36.239> keeping<00:00:36.570> them<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.780> far<00:00:36.989> away<00:00:37.079> from<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and keeping them as far away from the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.580 
and keeping them as far away from the
goal<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.770> possible<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.449> know<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.660> in

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
goal as possible and they know that in

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
goal as possible and they know that in
baton<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.250> cabal<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.820> defenders<00:00:42.210> off<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
baton going cabal the defenders off and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.069 
baton going cabal the defenders off and
I've<00:00:42.750> pasted<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.699> too<00:00:44.699> to<00:00:45.420> catch<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:45.930> any

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I've pasted it too to catch up with any

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.950 
I've pasted it too to catch up with any
players<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.859> the<00:00:46.980> offside<00:00:47.309> trap<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.960> this

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
players you be the offside trap and this

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.689 
players you be the offside trap and this
means<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.350> midfielders<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.340> closer<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
means that midfielders can get closer to

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.970 
means that midfielders can get closer to
the<00:00:50.879> attack<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:52.019> especially<00:00:52.320> useful<00:00:52.500> e<00:00:52.859> we

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the attack it's especially useful e we

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
the attack it's especially useful e we
got<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.519> guy<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.699> Jemaine<00:00:54.269> Dafoe<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
got a little guy like Jemaine Dafoe and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.279 
got a little guy like Jemaine Dafoe and
you<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.679> this<00:00:55.829> system<00:00:56.429> here<00:00:57.359> defensive

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you just see this system here defensive

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.099 
you just see this system here defensive
line<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> 18<00:00:59.519> so<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
line is right up to 18 so you

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
line is right up to 18 so you
complements<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> positioning<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
complements the positioning of the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.860 
complements the positioning of the
players<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.269> we're<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.539> gonna<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
players and we're just gonna have a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.040 
players and we're just gonna have a
quick<00:01:04.080> look<00:01:04.410> now<00:01:04.440> I'll<00:01:04.860> blimp<00:01:05.190> view<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
quick look now I'll blimp view and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.080 
quick look now I'll blimp view and
deliberately<00:01:07.050> give<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.440> ball<00:01:07.620> away<00:01:07.910> just<00:01:08.910> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
deliberately give the ball away just so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.910 
deliberately give the ball away just so
you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.300> see<00:01:09.540> where<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.990> defenders<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.650> when

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you can see where the defenders go when

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.680 
you can see where the defenders go when
they<00:01:11.010> don't<00:01:11.160> have<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> ball<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.540> they're

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
they don't have the ball you see they're

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.490 
they don't have the ball you see they're
trying<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> push<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:15.500> they've

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
trying to push right up and they've

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.360 
trying to push right up and they've
always<00:01:16.760> right<00:01:17.760> on<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.120> tail<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.190> attacker

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.690 

and<00:01:23.370> so<00:01:23.850> that's<00:01:24.180> oh<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.440> we<00:01:26.370> go<00:01:26.520> for

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and so that's oh now this is we go for

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.630 
and so that's oh now this is we go for
more<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.940> an<00:01:27.030> orthodox

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
more of an orthodox

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.950 
more of an orthodox
defensive<00:01:29.640> positioning<00:01:30.120> here<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.570> AC<00:01:30.720> Milan

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
defensive positioning here with AC Milan

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
defensive positioning here with AC Milan
so<00:01:31.890> I'll<00:01:32.280> push<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.960> just<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.860> much<00:01:35.040> here

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
so I'll push it up just not so much here

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.620 
so I'll push it up just not so much here
just<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.340> they're<00:01:38.340> not

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
just so you know they they're not

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.690 
just so you know they they're not
absorbing<00:01:39.630> too<00:01:39.810> much<00:01:39.960> pressure<00:01:40.430> but<00:01:41.430> at<00:01:41.580> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
absorbing too much pressure but at the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.020 
absorbing too much pressure but at the
same<00:01:41.910> time<00:01:42.410> for<00:01:43.410> not<00:01:43.980> so<00:01:44.160> quick<00:01:44.370> defenders

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
same time for not so quick defenders

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.240 
same time for not so quick defenders
they're<00:01:45.780> not<00:01:45.960> finding<00:01:46.710> themselves<00:01:46.860> in

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
they're not finding themselves in

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
they're not finding themselves in
positions<00:01:47.700> where<00:01:48.030> they're<00:01:48.600> always<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:49.080> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
positions where they're always going to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.160 
positions where they're always going to
have<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> threat<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.860> behind<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:51.170> important

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
have a threat in behind and important

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.590 
have a threat in behind and important
here<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.010> gap<00:01:53.670> between<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.120> defensive

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
here that the gap between the defensive

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.560 
here that the gap between the defensive
midfield<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.830> always<00:01:56.190> small<00:01:56.580> this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.120> all<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
midfield is always small this is all a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.890 
midfield is always small this is all a
big<00:01:57.780> concern<00:01:58.230> for<00:01:58.530> any<00:01:59.460> system<00:01:59.760> where<00:02:00.600> however

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
big concern for any system where however

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.900 
big concern for any system where however
you<00:02:01.020> want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.260> line<00:02:01.410> up<00:02:01.440> if<00:02:02.220> it's<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.490> big<00:02:02.670> gap

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
you want to line up if it's a big gap

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.490 
you want to line up if it's a big gap
between<00:02:02.940> defence<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.720> midfield<00:02:03.810> you're<00:02:04.410> in

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
between defence and midfield you're in

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.580 
between defence and midfield you're in
trouble<00:02:04.710> more

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
trouble more

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.559 
trouble more
so<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:08.099> give<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.550> right<00:02:08.789> here<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.360> see

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
so just give all right here you can see

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.830 
so just give all right here you can see
is<00:02:10.229> there's<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.739> healthier<00:02:11.160> little<00:02:11.459> pocket<00:02:11.910> so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
is there's a healthier little pocket so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.270 
is there's a healthier little pocket so
the<00:02:12.989> defenders<00:02:13.410> have<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> bit<00:02:13.800> more<00:02:13.980> space<00:02:14.220> to

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the defenders have a bit more space to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.009 
the defenders have a bit more space to
anticipate<00:02:14.760> what's<00:02:15.209> going<00:02:15.269> on<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.660> front<00:02:15.690> of

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
anticipate what's going on in front of

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.009 
anticipate what's going on in front of
them<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.819> final<00:02:18.150> example<00:02:18.480> here<00:02:18.660> is

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
them and the final example here is

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.830 
them and the final example here is
England<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.129> this<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.550> more<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:21.120> rawhide

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
England and this is more of a rawhide

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.320 
England and this is more of a rawhide
chimp<00:02:22.349> Park<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.860> Buffs<00:02:23.040> kind<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.580> system<00:02:23.970> so

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
chimp Park the Buffs kind of system so

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.940 
chimp Park the Buffs kind of system so
putting<00:02:25.050> them<00:02:25.170> right<00:02:25.349> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> edge<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
putting them right on the edge of the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.339 
putting them right on the edge of the
box<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.700> we're<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.900> bring<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
box and we're going to bring the

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.440 
box and we're going to bring the
full-back<00:02:28.890> seem<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> bit<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.940> team<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.180> nice

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
full-back seem a bit so the team is nice

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.500 
full-back seem a bit so the team is nice
and<00:02:30.660> compact<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:33.030> should<00:02:33.209> bring<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
and compact and we should bring the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.350 
and compact and we should bring the
center<00:02:33.870> midfielders<00:02:34.470> back<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:36.209> I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
center midfielders back so that like I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.870 
center midfielders back so that like I
said<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.750> gap<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.170> nice<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.620> small

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
said that gap is nice and small

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.759 
said that gap is nice and small
note<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.450> they're<00:02:39.900> playing<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.349> long<00:02:40.500> ball

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
note that they're playing the long ball

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.860 
note that they're playing the long ball
system<00:02:41.060> which<00:02:42.060> means<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.510> team<00:02:42.720> is

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
system which means that the team is

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.380 
system which means that the team is
generally<00:02:43.290> more<00:02:43.470> compact<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:45.180> gap

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
generally more compact and the gap

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.500 
generally more compact and the gap
between<00:02:45.420> defense<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.650> attack<00:02:46.739> could<00:02:47.340> be

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
between defense and attack could be

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.120 
between defense and attack could be
compensated<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:48.989> by<00:02:49.049> playing<00:02:49.470> long<00:02:49.650> passes

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
compensated for by playing long passes

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.720 
compensated for by playing long passes
up<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.519> Randy<00:02:50.970> Carroll<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.400> would<00:02:53.610> give

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
up to Randy Carroll and this would give

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.729 
up to Randy Carroll and this would give
a<00:02:53.970> roll<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> ball<00:02:54.660> up<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.989> give<00:02:55.140> time<00:02:55.440> for<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
a roll the ball up and give time for the

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.850 
a roll the ball up and give time for the
likes<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.190> box<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:57.000> Chamberlain<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.720> Milner<00:02:58.590> to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860
