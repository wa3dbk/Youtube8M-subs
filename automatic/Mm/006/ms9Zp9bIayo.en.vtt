video or my first subscriber world

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.460 
video or my first subscriber world
obviously<00:02:11.390> because<00:02:11.840> obviously<00:02:12.019> I<00:02:12.230> would<00:02:12.319> put

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
obviously because obviously I would put

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.949 
obviously because obviously I would put
that<00:02:12.500> on<00:02:12.680> youtube<00:02:12.920> subscriber<00:02:13.430> world<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.930> I

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
that on youtube subscriber world but I

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.360 
that on youtube subscriber world but I
don't<00:02:15.200> think<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.440> actually<00:02:15.620> ever<00:02:15.920> recorded

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
don't think I actually ever recorded

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.129

this<00:02:16.430> one<00:02:16.640> on<00:02:16.790> YouTube<00:02:17.569> however<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.900> do<00:02:18.019> think

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.139 
this one on YouTube however I do think

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.360 
this one on YouTube however I do think
that<00:02:18.349> it's<00:02:18.529> kind<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:18.739> interesting<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.129> take<00:02:19.340> a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
that it's kind of interesting to take a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.610 
that it's kind of interesting to take a
look<00:02:19.549> at<00:02:19.730> because<00:02:20.299> obviously<00:02:20.719> this<00:02:21.049> is<00:02:21.290> like

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
look at because obviously this is like

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.500 
look at because obviously this is like
the<00:02:21.769> very<00:02:22.099> very<00:02:22.459> very<00:02:22.730> beginning<00:02:22.969> what

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the very very very beginning what

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.270 
the very very very beginning what
I was<00:02:23.689> doing<00:02:23.930> when<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.080> first<00:02:24.379> started<00:02:25.129> in

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
I was doing when I first started in

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.559 
I was doing when I first started in
Minecraft<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:25.879> I<00:02:25.939> think<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:26.360> really

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
Minecraft and I think this is really

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.780 
Minecraft and I think this is really
really<00:02:26.810> cool<00:02:27.170> now<00:02:27.620> I'm<00:02:27.799> awful<00:02:28.280> I'm<00:02:28.430> go<00:02:28.670> ahead

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
really cool now I'm awful I'm go ahead

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.490 
really cool now I'm awful I'm go ahead
say<00:02:28.970> right<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.299> I<00:02:29.480> think<00:02:29.569> what<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.230> just

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
say right now that I think what I just

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.750 
say right now that I think what I just
glanced<00:02:30.739> at<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:30.980> world<00:02:31.189> earlier<00:02:31.549> it<00:02:31.730> was

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
glanced at this world earlier it was

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.479 
glanced at this world earlier it was
really<00:02:32.360> really<00:02:32.689> really<00:02:32.959> bad<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.799> um<00:02:34.099> obviously

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
really really really bad so um obviously

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.369 
really really really bad so um obviously
here<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:34.879> have<00:02:35.180> like<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> little<00:02:35.629> mining<00:02:36.019> camp

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
here I have like a little mining camp

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.899 
here I have like a little mining camp
and<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.560> actually<00:02:36.799> remember<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.459> like

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
and I actually remember this like

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.520 
and I actually remember this like
thinking<00:02:38.269> back<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.480> when<00:02:38.599> our<00:02:38.750> sort<00:02:38.989> of<00:02:39.049> lies<00:02:39.409> i

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
thinking back to when our sort of lies i

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.380 
thinking back to when our sort of lies i
can<00:02:39.680> remember<00:02:39.950> building<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.519> world<00:02:40.790> but<00:02:41.329> i

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
can remember building this world but i

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.940 
can remember building this world but i
really<00:02:41.750> don't<00:02:41.780> remember<00:02:42.140> anything<00:02:42.560> else<00:02:42.829> so

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
really don't remember anything else so

diamond I ever found on minecraft oh my
gosh<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.540> just<00:02:56.569> thought<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.049> wow<00:02:57.519> how<00:02:58.519> cool

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
this might be it honestly I think this

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.830 
this might be it honestly I think this
seriously<00:03:02.060> might<00:03:02.209> be<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.359> first<00:03:02.599> diamond

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840

seriously might be the first diamond

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
mines like what i was looking at it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.399 
mines like what i was looking at it
earlier<00:03:26.030> i<00:03:26.120> just<00:03:26.389> i<00:03:26.510> blocked<00:03:26.810> off<00:03:27.079> certain

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
earlier i just i blocked off certain

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.900 
earlier i just i blocked off certain
passageways<00:03:27.859> probably<00:03:28.280> because<00:03:28.549> there<00:03:28.730> was<00:03:28.879> a

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
passageways probably because there was a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.729 
passageways probably because there was a
like<00:03:29.690> creepers<00:03:30.109> are<00:03:30.260> things<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.590> were

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
like creepers are things that were

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.650 
like creepers are things that were
trying<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.129> kill<00:03:31.310> me<00:03:31.489> at<00:03:31.579> some<00:03:31.790> point<00:03:31.819> and<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.629> I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
trying to kill me at some point and so I

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.000 
trying to kill me at some point and so I
had<00:03:32.840> blocked<00:03:33.139> it<00:03:33.319> off<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:33.620> obviously<00:03:33.889> they

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
had blocked it off so obviously they

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.979 
had blocked it off so obviously they
couldn't<00:03:34.250> kill<00:03:34.370> me<00:03:34.519> uh<00:03:34.639> I'm<00:03:35.389> not<00:03:35.540> sure<00:03:35.599> how<00:03:35.959> I

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
couldn't kill me uh I'm not sure how I

no updates minecraft the you know just

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
the stock version that you can get if

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.789 
the stock version that you can get if

I did this 00 thinking back on it I feel
like<00:05:25.179> a<00:05:25.240> spider<00:05:25.659> was<00:05:25.809> chasing<00:05:26.199> me<00:05:26.229> i<00:05:26.469> sear<00:05:26.949> oh<00:05:27.099> I

know you guys think I just made that up

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.449 
know you guys think I just made that up
because<00:05:29.199> I<00:05:29.349> would<00:05:29.619> think<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:29.830> if<00:05:30.039> I<00:05:30.129> if<00:05:30.339> I

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:30.459 
because I would think that if I if I

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.249 
because I would think that if I if I
heard<00:05:30.639> somebody<00:05:30.819> say<00:05:31.059> that<00:05:31.269> but<00:05:31.749> I<00:05:31.779> seriously

heard somebody say that but I seriously

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:33.509 
heard somebody say that but I seriously
think<00:05:32.379> that<00:05:32.469> a<00:05:32.559> spider<00:05:32.889> was<00:05:33.069> chasing<00:05:33.369> me<00:05:33.399> or

think that a spider was chasing me or

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:35.070 
think that a spider was chasing me or
something<00:05:33.759> and<00:05:33.819> so<00:05:33.909> I<00:05:33.969> blocked<00:05:34.269> it<00:05:34.389> off<00:05:34.539> so

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
something and so I blocked it off so

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.779 
something and so I blocked it off so
that<00:05:35.110> uh<00:05:35.619> and<00:05:35.919> it<00:05:36.009> was<00:05:36.099> nighttime<00:05:36.339> when<00:05:36.639> I<00:05:36.699> came
