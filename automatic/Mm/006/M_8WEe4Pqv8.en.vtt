00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.950
 kennedy someone who cripples the summer months as a whole so we are 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.799
 delighted to find this evening according to will take a little mention to do 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.780
 a kind of return to the future transfer are not cold to the eyes in 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.340
 bitter almond of the means of transport of tomorrow 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.600
 % and the car that drives itself by the thought it is possible with bare hands I 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.910
 do not know if it existed we had talked here about a car that was 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.910
 autonomous who behaves alone 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.830
 they are the same German university researchers rewarding a good 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.980
 car driving m 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.120
 by the thought one is a little ikea on his head he analyzes the nave of 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.700
 brain activity and when one thinks turn-to-left is well of 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.570
 steering for the left for the right at the 80th left first on the right the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.730
 flying for the right and the car was obviously here on a road 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.430
 closed to avoid accidents and we'll see the driver like that 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.580
 thinking go left we see too much left when we think the right 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.570
 the steering wheel three hours of rush is that we see on the pictures there is a small 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.720
 shift of a serge thinks on the left it puts a few seconds 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.530
 before speaking to the left so this report is still in the case of a 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.160
 young donation 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.070
 by interest 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.500
 not really interested researchers 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.980
 we think about the question they said to themselves but rather than weak 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.000
 rate that is totally that we are not there that we rather made a taxi 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.950
 autonomous the idea is that the car barrel bit like in everything does not have 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.220
 been a gift to behave alone except that it's a taxi when 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.880
 he arrives at the intersection mosimann finally I changed my mind I want 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.810
 turn right instead of turning left and so there we think and nature 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 turns alone in the right direction so 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.160
 thank you god we expect it does not matter we found in a taxi 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.100
 okay then in a taxi still move ahead so technologies for them 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.960
 pedestrians that varies a lot there too a certain discomfort right at the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.810
 performance yet what message had you talked about in them talking about 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.230
 segway the segway is a small device that sketch stabilized rate 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.610
 thanks to a unosa autonomous autosa a gyroscope in every sense 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.170
 which allows to move easily then the advantage that it is still 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.720
 successful we consolidated the steps need to be an expert percent all the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.280
 world 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.220
 and obvious that this saying that says ok we can take with you or at the office when 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.810
 we were sure action if it exists today it's called feeds 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.950
 she fights for me that's the parliamentary winterkorn she prefers 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.540
 pay 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.720
 for the future
