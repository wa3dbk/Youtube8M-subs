correcting<00:00:03.250> a<00:00:03.370> crooked<00:00:03.880> horizon<00:00:04.360> line<00:00:04.510> is

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:04.540 
correcting a crooked horizon line is

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.840 
correcting a crooked horizon line is
another<00:00:04.930> common<00:00:05.230> problem<00:00:05.410> and<00:00:05.710> camera<00:00:06.520> makes

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
another common problem and camera makes

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.000 
another common problem and camera makes
it<00:00:06.970> easy<00:00:07.180> to<00:00:07.300> make<00:00:07.870> that<00:00:08.110> kind<00:00:08.290> of<00:00:08.410> fix<00:00:08.620> as<00:00:08.799> well

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
it easy to make that kind of fix as well

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.740 
it easy to make that kind of fix as well
so<00:00:09.610> here<00:00:09.820> I<00:00:09.850> have<00:00:10.059> my<00:00:10.210> image<00:00:10.480> you<00:00:10.570> can<00:00:10.720> see

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
so here I have my image you can see

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.720 
so here I have my image you can see
there's<00:00:11.110> a<00:00:11.170> horizon<00:00:11.950> line<00:00:11.980> here<00:00:12.309> that's<00:00:12.490> not

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
there's a horizon line here that's not

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.640 
there's a horizon line here that's not
horizontal<00:00:13.389> it's<00:00:13.540> actually<00:00:13.809> crooked<00:00:14.110> so

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
horizontal it's actually crooked so

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.900 
horizontal it's actually crooked so
let's<00:00:14.830> open<00:00:14.920> up<00:00:15.130> this<00:00:15.190> image<00:00:15.429> in<00:00:15.610> Camera<00:00:15.639> Raw

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
let's open up this image in Camera Raw

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.490 
let's open up this image in Camera Raw
we'll<00:00:16.270> click<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.660> open<00:00:16.990> in<00:00:17.140> Camera<00:00:17.349> Raw

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
we'll click the open in Camera Raw

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.710 
we'll click the open in Camera Raw
button<00:00:18.009> to<00:00:18.190> do<00:00:18.310> so<00:00:18.460> and<00:00:18.880> once<00:00:19.060> this<00:00:19.240> is<00:00:19.420> in<00:00:19.539> RAW

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
button to do so and once this is in RAW

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.650 
button to do so and once this is in RAW
we<00:00:20.440> actually<00:00:20.770> have<00:00:20.949> two<00:00:21.460> different<00:00:21.940> ways<00:00:22.119> to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
we actually have two different ways to

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.870 
we actually have two different ways to
correct<00:00:22.930> this<00:00:23.080> problem<00:00:23.250> one<00:00:24.250> method<00:00:24.580> is<00:00:24.730> more

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
correct this problem one method is more

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.670 
correct this problem one method is more
of<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.060> free-form<00:00:25.660> method<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:26.529> other

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
of a free-form method and the other

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.380 
of a free-form method and the other
method<00:00:27.070> is<00:00:27.100> more<00:00:27.400> precise<00:00:27.850> so<00:00:28.150> I'm<00:00:28.210> going<00:00:28.330> to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
method is more precise so I'm going to

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.090 
method is more precise so I'm going to
teach<00:00:28.539> you<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.720> freeform<00:00:29.109> method<00:00:29.439> first<00:00:29.619> and

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
teach you the freeform method first and

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.769 
teach you the freeform method first and
that<00:00:30.340> involves<00:00:30.730> using<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.269> crop<00:00:31.449> tool<00:00:31.660> I'm

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
that involves using the crop tool I'm

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.450 
that involves using the crop tool I'm
going<00:00:31.810> to<00:00:31.930> press<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.230> letter<00:00:32.410> C<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:33.010> switch<00:00:33.280> to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
going to press the letter C to switch to

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.340 
going to press the letter C to switch to
the<00:00:33.550> crop<00:00:33.730> tool<00:00:33.940> and<00:00:34.150> I'm<00:00:34.930> gonna<00:00:35.019> go<00:00:35.140> ahead<00:00:35.260> and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
the crop tool and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.610 
the crop tool and I'm gonna go ahead and
drag<00:00:35.530> out<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:35.920> crop<00:00:36.339> box<00:00:36.670> here<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.500> vertical<00:00:38.500> one

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
drag out a crop box here a vertical one

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
drag out a crop box here a vertical one
by<00:00:38.800> dragging<00:00:39.159> down<00:00:39.339> in<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:39.760> downward<00:00:40.059> direction

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
by dragging down in a downward direction

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.360 
by dragging down in a downward direction
now<00:00:41.140> in<00:00:41.229> this<00:00:41.350> particular<00:00:41.620> crop<00:00:42.010> I<00:00:42.220> actually

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
now in this particular crop I actually

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.420 
now in this particular crop I actually
want<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.699> include<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.870> sand<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.309> horizon

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
want to include the sand and the horizon

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.219 
want to include the sand and the horizon
line<00:00:45.850> as<00:00:46.059> part<00:00:46.330> of<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.479> composition<00:00:46.720> so<00:00:46.989> that

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:47.229 
line as part of the composition so that

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.049 
line as part of the composition so that
actually<00:00:48.040> makes<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.309> kind<00:00:48.489> of<00:00:48.519> easy<00:00:48.729> to<00:00:48.850> do

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
actually makes it kind of easy to do

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.810 
actually makes it kind of easy to do
this<00:00:49.210> if<00:00:49.720> I<00:00:49.900> put<00:00:50.110> my<00:00:50.199> mouse<00:00:50.470> outside<00:00:51.010> of<00:00:51.760> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
this if I put my mouse outside of the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.030 
this if I put my mouse outside of the
crop<00:00:52.030> bounding<00:00:52.449> box<00:00:52.659> you'll<00:00:53.290> see<00:00:53.320> that<00:00:53.619> cursor

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
crop bounding box you'll see that cursor

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.250 
crop bounding box you'll see that cursor
changes<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.549> a<00:00:54.699> rotate<00:00:55.210> icon<00:00:55.330> and<00:00:55.900> I<00:00:55.989> can<00:00:56.110> just

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
changes to a rotate icon and I can just

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.700 
changes to a rotate icon and I can just
simply<00:00:56.500> click<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:56.949> drag<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:57.549> rotate<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.180> box

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
simply click and drag and rotate the box

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.490 
simply click and drag and rotate the box
to<00:00:59.710> kind<00:00:59.890> of<00:00:59.949> match<00:01:00.220> visually<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.600> horizon

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
to kind of match visually the horizon

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.109 
to kind of match visually the horizon
line<00:01:02.680> there<00:01:02.949> just<00:01:03.400> kind<00:01:03.549> of<00:01:03.580> make<00:01:03.729> these<00:01:03.850> two

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
line there just kind of make these two

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.330 
line there just kind of make these two
edges<00:01:04.650> perpendicular<00:01:05.650> with<00:01:05.799> each<00:01:05.950> other<00:01:06.130> and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
edges perpendicular with each other and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.060 
edges perpendicular with each other and
then<00:01:07.180> when<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.299> press<00:01:07.539> return<00:01:07.719> or<00:01:07.899> enter<00:01:08.109> you'll

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
then when I press return or enter you'll

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.249 
then when I press return or enter you'll
see<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.340> does<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.609> crop<00:01:09.789> and<00:01:10.000> rotate<00:01:10.180> in<00:01:10.630> one

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
see it does the crop and rotate in one

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.590 
see it does the crop and rotate in one
fluid<00:01:11.469> step<00:01:11.799> there<00:01:12.009> so<00:01:12.789> not<00:01:12.939> bad<00:01:13.090> it's<00:01:13.390> not

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
fluid step there so not bad it's not

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.569 
fluid step there so not bad it's not
necessarily<00:01:14.500> guaranteed<00:01:15.009> to<00:01:15.159> be<00:01:15.250> straight

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
necessarily guaranteed to be straight

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.359 
necessarily guaranteed to be straight
but<00:01:15.789> pretty<00:01:16.659> close<00:01:16.899> now<00:01:17.770> I<00:01:17.829> want<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.039> undo<00:01:18.340> this

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
but pretty close now I want to undo this

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.639 
but pretty close now I want to undo this
to<00:01:18.729> get<00:01:18.850> back<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:20.049> original<00:01:20.350> image<00:01:20.439> so<00:01:20.619> I

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
to get back to the original image so I

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.679 
to get back to the original image so I
can<00:01:20.799> show<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.070> more<00:01:21.189> precise<00:01:21.490> method<00:01:21.880> now

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
can show you the more precise method now

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.870 
can show you the more precise method now
Photoshop<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:23.859> Camera<00:01:24.250> Raw<00:01:24.369> are<00:01:24.670> very

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
Photoshop and Camera Raw are very

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.849 
Photoshop and Camera Raw are very
similar<00:01:25.119> in<00:01:25.359> their<00:01:25.479> undo<00:01:25.840> mentality<00:01:26.560> here<00:01:26.770> if

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
similar in their undo mentality here if

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.010 
similar in their undo mentality here if
I<00:01:26.920> do<00:01:26.979> command-z<00:01:27.460> or<00:01:27.549> control-z<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.840> only

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
I do command-z or control-z it only

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.169 
I do command-z or control-z it only
undoes<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.799> last<00:01:30.070> thing<00:01:30.429> you<00:01:30.609> did<00:01:30.759> so<00:01:30.969> it's<00:01:31.119> a

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
undoes the last thing you did so it's a

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.779 
undoes the last thing you did so it's a
toggle<00:01:31.450> command<00:01:31.990> Z<00:01:32.109> command<00:01:32.409> Z<00:01:32.590> ctrl<00:01:32.829> Z<00:01:33.189> ctrl<00:01:33.609> Z

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
toggle command Z command Z ctrl Z ctrl Z

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.819 
toggle command Z command Z ctrl Z ctrl Z
to<00:01:34.299> go<00:01:34.420> back<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.810> forth<00:01:35.020> between<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
to go back and forth between the

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.940 
to go back and forth between the
previous<00:01:36.039> and<00:01:36.429> last<00:01:36.820> step<00:01:37.030> there<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.409> how<00:01:38.770> do<00:01:38.829> I

those things where you actually have to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.020 
those things where you actually have to

memorize the keyboard shortcuts because

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.910 
memorize the keyboard shortcuts because
there's<00:01:52.210> no<00:01:52.329> menu<00:01:52.509> commands<00:01:52.899> for<00:01:53.229> camera<00:01:53.649> it's

all self enclosed in this dialogue box

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.129 
all self enclosed in this dialogue box
here<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.049> command<00:01:56.799> option<00:01:57.130> Z<00:01:57.179> undoes<00:01:58.179> more
