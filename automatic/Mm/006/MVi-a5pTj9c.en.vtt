00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
previous dogmas you can see some

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.120 
previous dogmas you can see some
asymmetry<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.550> ceased<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.359> yoke

much<00:00:31.050> everything<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.650> bike<00:00:31.890> as<00:00:32.790> they

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
much everything on this bike as they

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
much everything on this bike as they
said<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.510> symmetry<00:00:34.020> built<00:00:34.290> into<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.010> help

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
said a symmetry built into it to help

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.020 
said a symmetry built into it to help
just<00:00:36.120> balance<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.809> ride<00:00:37.579> other<00:00:38.579> features

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
just balance out the ride other features

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.190 
just balance out the ride other features
would<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.640> fact<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.120> use<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.660> new

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
would be the fact that they use a new

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.330 
would be the fact that they use a new
composite<00:00:44.160> from<00:00:44.520> turay<00:00:45.079> called<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> t<00:00:46.410> 1100

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
composite from turay called the t 1100

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.090 
composite from turay called the t 1100
so<00:00:48.149> right<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.539> Pinarello<00:00:49.230> always<00:00:49.710> call<00:00:49.950> out

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
so right here Pinarello always call out

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
so right here Pinarello always call out
there<00:00:51.079> which<00:00:52.160> carbon<00:00:53.160> they're<00:00:53.520> using<00:00:53.960> over

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
there which carbon they're using over

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.240 
there which carbon they're using over
the<00:00:55.050> years<00:00:55.199> they've<00:00:55.410> developed<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.039> really

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the years they've developed a really

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
the years they've developed a really
good<00:00:56.370> relationship<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:57.270> turay<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
good relationship with turay the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.330 
good relationship with turay the
Japanese<00:00:58.260> manufacturer<00:00:58.980> carbon<00:01:01.010> in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> end

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
Japanese manufacturer carbon in the end

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.210 
Japanese manufacturer carbon in the end
that<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.670> helped<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> make<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.710> best

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
that just helped to make the best

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.330 
that just helped to make the best
quality<00:01:05.729> frame<00:01:06.330> other<00:01:07.080> features<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.070> kind

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
quality frame other features that kind

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
quality frame other features that kind
of<00:01:08.400> stand<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> me<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.299> bike<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.930> they

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of stand out to me on this bike and they

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.990 
of stand out to me on this bike and they
may<00:01:10.619> seem<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:10.860> minor<00:01:11.250> months<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.729> really

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
may seem like minor months but I really

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.200 
may seem like minor months but I really
like<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.979> means<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.729> both

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
like the think to means this both

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.950 
like the think to means this both
electronic<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:15.960> mechanical<00:01:16.460> friendly<00:01:17.960> so

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
electronic and mechanical friendly so

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.940 
electronic and mechanical friendly so
simple<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:21.110> also<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> threaded

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
simple to do I also like the threaded

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.450 
simple to do I also like the threaded
Italian<00:01:23.520> bottom<00:01:23.820> bracket<00:01:24.090> shell<00:01:24.920> I'm<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.310> day

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
Italian bottom bracket shell I'm the day

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.819 
Italian bottom bracket shell I'm the day
of<00:01:26.610> 40<00:01:27.540> million<00:01:27.750> different<00:01:28.229> bottom<00:01:28.530> bracket

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
of 40 million different bottom bracket

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.740 
of 40 million different bottom bracket
standards<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.150> that's<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.390> easy

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
standards this is one that's really easy

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.770 
standards this is one that's really easy
to<00:01:30.960> work<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.490> will<00:01:32.490> limit<00:01:32.790> your<00:01:32.909> crank

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
to work with will limit your crank

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
to work with will limit your crank
choices<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.710> bit<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> still<00:01:35.640> think

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
choices a little bit but I still think

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
choices a little bit but I still think
if<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> Shimano<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> canopy<00:01:37.590> fan

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
if you're like a Shimano or a canopy fan

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.760 
if you're like a Shimano or a canopy fan
or<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> use<00:01:39.060> an<00:01:39.210> SRM<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> really

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
or like to use an SRM this is a really

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.980 
or like to use an SRM this is a really
great<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:43.490> more<00:01:44.490> importantly<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.750> thing<00:01:45.899> I

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
great way more importantly the thing I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.890 
great way more importantly the thing I
really<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.409> about<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.740> bike

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
really like about this bike

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.750 
really like about this bike
it's<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.230> much<00:01:48.560> better<00:01:48.830> right<00:01:49.160> bike<00:01:49.460> than<00:01:49.640> the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
it's a much better right bike than the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.220 
it's a much better right bike than the
previous<00:01:50.150> dogless<00:01:52.510> what<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.630> attribute<00:01:54.050> that

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
previous dogless what to attribute that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.200 
previous dogless what to attribute that
to<00:01:54.290> is<00:01:54.680> hard<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.070> say<00:01:55.280> but<00:01:55.340> what<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.940> end

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
to is hard to say but what the end

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.840 
to is hard to say but what the end
result<00:01:56.570> is<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.020> test<00:01:57.230> riding<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.680> bike<00:01:57.950> is

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
result is and test riding this bike is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.700 
result is and test riding this bike is
it's<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.240> more<00:01:59.420> compliant<00:01:59.810> ride<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.470> more

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
it's a more compliant ride it's a more

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.940 
it's a more compliant ride it's a more

do a tall bike than the previous Dogma
the<00:02:03.950> previous<00:02:04.250> demo<00:02:04.430> is<00:02:04.760> known<00:02:04.940> for<00:02:05.210> just

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
the previous demo is known for just

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.920 
the previous demo is known for just
being<00:02:06.230> really<00:02:06.590> stiff<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.160> really<00:02:07.899> you<00:02:08.899> know

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
being really stiff and really you know

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.930
