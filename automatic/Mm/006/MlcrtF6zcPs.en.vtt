00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 welcome to another video friends i am 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.520
 jaypee or jose pokemon and good in the day 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.500
 today I bring you another small tutorial 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.210
 here to the channel and good today 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.950
 I bring you a pretty special tutorial 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.410
 and I'm sure a lot of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.059
 people will serve you infinitely and in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.100
 today I come to show you the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.039
 method to get a pokemon 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.230
 saint and how he likes to say good 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.840
 go apart with good nature by 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.510
 well to say it a pokemon totally 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.580
 perfect to my voice it's hard to clear that 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.470
 it is, but it is also clear that it is possible 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.899
 so several of the pokemon that can 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.730
 see and that they see sinisi that they see that they are 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.739
 competitive and apart with good ships 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.719
 you do not necessarily have to believe that they are 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.210
 illegal pokemon but there is a way 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.430
 pretty easy so to speak in this 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.500
 sixth generation to be able to get 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.239
 pokemon with these features that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.160
 I am mentioning them and today 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.710
 I come to show you a small tutorial 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.090
 to see more or less how you can 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.850
 get a pokemon from this one 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.740
 such as good friends before anything else 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.690
 who say they think they can destroy that 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.510
 button I like and we can reach 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.700
 at least 300 I like you for this 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.650
 video because I know it's worth it and I know that 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.510
 we can get to that small number 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.460
 first of all what is it that we have 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.260
 to make my friends they have to 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.570
 be here at the pokemon nursery that 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.060
 is more or less in the risk for 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.710
 battle they can access after 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.350
 of having passed the league and having 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.000
 finished the high episode 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.130
 they will need a lot in their team 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.660
 of things that are quite difficult to 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.170
 get the truth for example 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.110
 they need what would be a pokemon already with 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.369
 five hits and obviously good nature 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.080
 that I already showed a tutorial for 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.060
 get one to which if you have not seen it 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.649
 they have it down here in the description 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.930
 this time let's say that I want 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.450
 create a frame because I want a camper 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.610
 shiny and apart that is competitive then 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.060
 good first of all this matter 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.909
 have 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.490
 Five jeeps in attack in defense defense 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.140
 special speed and hp apart can 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.320
 see that it came with a firm nature and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.420
 that brings the eternal stone as its object 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.310
 that will always go out with nature 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.960
 firm and there is a great possibility that 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.939
 I inherited some of the tips of this 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.220
 pokemon and as you well know has a 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.250
 bunch of yves good so maybe you can 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.720
 I inherited those and that's what interests me 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.239
 second thing they need is going to be 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.550
 sunk on this occasion the myth that they go 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.100
 You need it will be very difficult 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.970
 truth of getting since you have to 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.260
 be a milestone with six or five if you can 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.420
 that is Japanese because Japanese jbic for 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.940
 what Japanese rays because you put it so 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.380
 difficult is very simple friends is what 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.140
 I 'm going to teach you at this time is going to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.209
 be the most sweat method and for this 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.930
 method what they need is a pokémon 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.350
 Have your hotel 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.510
 or I do not agree how it's called 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.450
 ie you can see that this pokemon itself 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.550
 I thought hers this pokemon I 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.920
 believed so this pokemon or corresponds 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.750
 to my region runs that corresponds to the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.490
 American region since in my 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.860
 console is within the region 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.390
 American so we need a data the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.160
 which corresponds to another region by 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.580
 example I can already use one that is 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.710
 German one that is from austria one that 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.510
 be Spanish or whatever is Italian one 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.490
 that is Japanese one that is Korean 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.220
 North Korea not because there they do not have 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.350
 pokemon so that's not worth but they can 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.940
 see in itself that this editor is Japanese what 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.670
 What I need is a Pokémon from my region 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.620
 preferably with my joe and apart 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.330
 also a data which is of another 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.310
 region so that always the pokemon that 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.530
 leave for credit you can create with all 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.590
 the pokemon making this pokemon 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.060
 can inherit the part quite if it is 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.880
 good because they can see that what 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.230
 has meditated is the destiny tie for 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.240
 all the people who do not know how 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.860
 get the destiny tie know that 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.330
 it also has a unique down here in the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.260
 description where they upload tutorial for 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.780
 see how this object was achieved ok ya 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.459
 once commented that friends 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.459
 what they have to do is going to be what 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.890
 next they will need to raise eggs and 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.720
 too many of us will have to talk to the 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.580
 in charge of the nursery and we will leave you 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.590
 to our two pokemon first of all 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.510
 the pokemon of which we want breeding that 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.850
 is going to be matip who already has five children 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.220
 and apart from what my son has and apart from 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.560
 is American and brings the eternal stone 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.239
 so that I always inherited nature and 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.760
 the next thing we're going to need is going to 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.760
 be the rite of the six or five jeeps 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.700
 coming from another country or at least 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.300
 another region you can get little fingers 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.550
 the rest 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.340
 yves inside blond pokemon me and sapphire 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.400
 alpha so you can friends like there are 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.470
 an island in which you can access you and 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.150
 on this island there's going to be you data 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.680
 this is going to be an island of screams and 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.990
 thanks to what would be the landslide 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.780
 we could get to get data from 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.370
 four or even five no extra tips from 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.420
 tutorial because I still can not get into 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.800
 this island so 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.050
 because at the moment I could not 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.760
 get it but very soon when I can 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.710
 concentrate on this island believe me that 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.150
 they will have a tutorial after this 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.880
 we will have to do what would be the 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.070
 trick to spin endless 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.470
 which by the way and also upload 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.180
 tutorial so really friends all 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.920
 what they need from blond pokemon mary 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.660
 alpha schapiro do not have here on my channel 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.520
 they have to look for it more since everything 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.250
 what I am telling you, I have already 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.940
 gone up previously so they're going to 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.220
 need then to do create a lot of 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.980
 eggs and believe me there is a 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.360
 great a great possibility of 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.070
 that any of the ones that come out go to 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.410
 be a mobile obviously with good 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.440
 nature with the possibility of being 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.830
 shiny and apart that also have the 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.260
 five hits that friends need to 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.940
 something difficult will be honestly going to be 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.360
 create a lot of eggs but now 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.580
 every time they see some uncompetitive 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.160
 they do not necessarily have to believe that 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.040
 this is illegal but it is obviously 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.840
 easy to get them after that 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.640
 how are we going to be able to open so many eggs 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.840
 very simple we are going to need to be here 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.060
 circling 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.010
 we are going to need the power of incubation 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.440
 Remember that what this power does 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.260
 is that it makes the eggs open with 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.449
 Easier friends like I get the 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.880
 powers how do I get that power of 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.070
 incubation very easy friends here is my 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.960
 egg by the way every time the child 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.460
 is turning around here is that you already have 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.889
 the egg ready and keep turning towards 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.130
 the nursery is that the egg is not yet 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.500
 they have it ok in itself and now we have 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.510
 the first egg could now put 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.580
 perfectly the power of incubation 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.770
 so that my egg opened faster 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.919
 I certainly do not have it here here do not 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.360
 I have true friends but you know that 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.340
 if they want to get all the powers 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.960
 alone on my channel they also have a 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.940
 tutorial where I show how they can 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.510
 get all the powers alone to 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.919
 have them all equally we are going to 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.450
 comment quickly everything I said 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:47.030
 for all people who have not 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.280
 understood very well we are going to need a 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.630
 pokémon already with 5 ipsi with good 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.120
 natural which we had to have 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.830
 previously created us after 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.930
 have this pokemon what we have to 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.680
 to do is to get a rite that 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.810
 have another region which has 6 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.759
 or in its defect 5 those that we want 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.830
 then we are going to have to get to 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.860
 create and there is a possibility that 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.479
 because the pokemon that appears is 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.900
 the pokemon as we search with the 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:17.350
 nature with tics and apart that is without 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.960
 and it can be difficult to clear that it will be 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.520
 difficult but of course it will also be 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.139
 possible friends but well I think it would be 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.270
 everything for this video obviously I'm not going 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:27.270
 to open because if there is a job 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:32.080
 infinitely great to have to try to 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.870
 get that pokemon but believe me that 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.070
 that can be confirmed that it 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.110
 can and it is but good here
