00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello sure that more than once you've 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.910
 listened to that phrase I said something 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.799
 as well as if you want results 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.010
 different do things one way 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.720
 is different or if we obtain 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.429
 different results now that we get 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.230
 every day doing the things that 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.029
 We are used to doing it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.759
 we have to put small habits 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.039
 small changes in our life that to 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.079
 see if you suddenly pose a lot 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.390
 of changes include the exercise in your 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.860
 daily life change of routine change of 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350
 customs change habits 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.420
 feeding, it will seem like a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.030
 giant mountain that is going to be very 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.890
 difficult to climb up because you're going 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 to raise all these changes as a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.500
 everything that I propose in this series 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.090
 of small videos is to go incorporating 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.730
 small changes in your day to day that you 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.269
 make you feel better than with every little one 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 change is a step towards some more habits 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.339
 healthy from both exercise and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.129
 life as a food and you can 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.289
 feel really better 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.200
 the change that I propose for today is 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.600
 very simple if in your breakfast you are 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.630
 used to take wheat bread fans 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.640
 As we normally do, I propose that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 change the bread wheat bread 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.979
 rye the rye to say it of some 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.340
 way is a little kinder to you 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.960
 digestive system and it will fit you better 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.899
 this change is just going to cost you 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 effort because the wheat flour and the 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.280
 rye flour does not have a flavors 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.459
 very different 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.439
 so the change is going to be almost 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.390
 imperceptible so it's going to be a change 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.580
 very easy to include in your daily routine 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.380
 besides the rye bread you can 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.110
 buy it in a lot of big 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.509
 surfaces or in small bakeries 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.030
 because it is already quite common that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.950
 have in many places good once 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.110
 that you get used to the rye bread that 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.729
 I already tell you it's going to be very easy 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.340
 I propose that you change it for a bread 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.709
 integral if I do not tell you anything new if 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.750
 I tell you that whole wheat bread is much more 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.590
 healthy because it contains fiber that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.860
 goes very well to our body 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.050
 to round a healthy breakfast this bread 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.700
 integral risk it with a little bit of 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.950
 olive oil we have an oil 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.209
 excellent in our land and we have 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.580
 to include it in our diet 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.680
 Forget daily butter 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.700
 forget about the jam that has a 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.849
 lots of sugar and uses the oil of 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.370
 olive also if you want some slices of 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:38.890
 tomato over you'll see how rich you get 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.890
 you know and people this breakfast
