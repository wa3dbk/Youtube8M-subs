00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.639
 there was a lot of talk this night when change occurred from 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.389
 daughter's biggest Italian industry 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.999
 if you manage to recover from a difficult period to create launch into the market 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.539
 there is also a lot of talk 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.429
 new 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.429
 I got from the web agenda leadership in this review 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.280
 exactly what's behind this change 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.950
 what was the winning formula so to speak 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.079
 it is as it happens in the natural selection of living organisms 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.790
 also this is an organism that industrial must know how to transform itself for 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.880
 respond to the challenges of a singing environment and it is very interesting to look 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.250
 to understand how this is open 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.910
 there have been some changes 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.970
 essential that they allowed to appreciate has a mutation 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.420
 lorenzo pinna tried to summarize in 5 points in the service 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.810
 made together and andrea pasquini 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.850
 an entity that allows us to understand how to act in certain sensitive points of the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.920
 so it is possible to change the DNA of a company 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.650
 2 years ago the fiat lives 2 million euros a day 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.340
 today nikon 85 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.940
 the European market share that had fallen below 7% 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.510
 today it has risen above 8%, surpassing various verify competitors and becoming 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.729
 painted car manufacturers and text industrial vehicles. 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.760
 how this change was possible considering the times and costs 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.220
 Of course many people say the merit from the new leadership 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.250
 but what was the recipe for putting a group back on track 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.570
 industrial that employs 172,000 employees in 180 establishments stars in 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.570
 five north continents 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.869
 it may be interesting to look closely at the case of the fiat 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.189
 to understand what are the problems facing a company today 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.109
 facing growing competition on the markets 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.109
 consumption sensitive points on cheeses 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.449
 the first step for a company and of course fruit juice 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.000
 and concentrate its efforts on the type of products that it believes can be 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:36.459
 winning 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.859
 the profession of piety is cars and trucks and tractors 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.040
 and it is in this sector that it possesses the knowledge and experience of capacity 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.899
 to win a challenge now find 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.439
 the first choice was to concentrate all the effort on this 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.399
 sector 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:55.769
 once it is established that the car together with industrial vehicles and machines 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.189
 agriculture is the strength of businesses 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.679
 Piacenza bank 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:02.620
 first. 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.369
 the company structure 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:08.609
 some senior managers responsible for the lackluster management of the past are 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.739
 been relieved of their duties 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.909
 but there was no large earthquake 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.510
 however, many levels and numerous bureaucratic mazes have been eliminated 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.659
 various directors may report directly to the managing director 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:23.519
 not only 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.559
 the managers of the various divisions now have more responsibility 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.919
 make the decisions they think are right 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.919
 their choices will be judged by the results obtained 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:38.849
 a line destined to reward merit is talent, the initiative's favors e 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.719
 the speed of decisions 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.989
 indeed one of the new rules is that there should be no more than three meetings 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.989
 to reach the decision 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.099
 second. 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.249
 a great injection of new technologies that today represents a crucial point 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.989
 for competitiveness for every company 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.489
 the most important example is the new vehicle design system 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.859
 a completely computerized system that allows the vehicle to be subjected 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.250
 still virtual to every kind of head and therefore to be able to skip mine 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.089
 long and expensive phase of the prototypes 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:19.239
 for example instead of actually building a first example in the background to 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.199
 crash test can at the wear tests you can do everything on the calculator 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.199
 getting the same results more quickly 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.280
 is a new design method already tested on the latest models of the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.099
 Turin home and that has allowed considerable savings in terms of time and costs 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.020
 this completely new system has been put. thanks to various IT companies 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.210
 European organizations that possessed the necessary knowledge 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.490
 small lesson 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.080
 if someone is better at it, it's better to join instead of trying 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.080
 retrace yourself in the sense if 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.199
 cost control 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.020
 in the structure of an enterprise especially if large is important 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.279
 avoid duplication which causes waste of time and money 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.360
 here, for example, the design and construction of the engines was 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.270
 unified in one company 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.599
 those who deal with both cars and industrial vehicles and machines 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:16.749
 agricultural 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.979
 same goes for the center that deals with the purchase of the parts more 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.029
 other than external suppliers 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.529
 that too has been 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:26.460
 to jump to another sector 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.420
 finance 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.610
 here too many procedures have been simplified 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.960
 for example thanks to an agreement with a large European bank 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.650
 the Turin-based company offers customers the same financial conditions for 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.650
 the purchase of cars in every country of the old continent 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.210
 naturally 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.830
 volume the largest allow you to submit competitive bids 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.759
 the strategy of international alliances 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.080
 a strategy that we could call free hands 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.889
 exactly the opposite of what in the past had denied the fiat has a 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.919
 American giant 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.090
 alliances are made on individual projects without foreclosure 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.469
 possible ally 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.379
 so in the coming years the stone will build in its flying plants 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.469
 a new small car for the ford 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.989
 with the Indian giant Nanny will build a car for the Indian baby i market 

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:24.050
 dogs killed in Argentina for the South American market 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.849
 instead, with the Chinese they are the fat canon of course 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:32.289
 while the vans are part of another agreement with a French house that 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.719
 their constructions all 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.300
 is to seize the opportunities where the accounts are presented 

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:44.580
 presents without long-term agreements and without internal loyalty with anyone 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.580
 thus maintaining maximum flexibility 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.590
 these are the main points 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.590
 unity also to an external and internal image renewal 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.960
 on which the company acted to recover competitiveness 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.360
 focus on products that represent the strong point 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.629
 avoid duplication 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:09.580
 streamline internal bureaucracy rewarding merit injecting technologies 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.729
 innovative to adopt a variable geometry of alliances with others 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.729
 builders 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.830
 It took only two years to get it back on track 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.809
 this only time can, finally 

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:30.550
 but in the face of global competition all companies are not just fiat 

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:34.220
 today called for almost biological mutations for 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.270
 is a completely new environment 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.199
 an acceleration on efficiency that is crucial not only for individual companies 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:42.419
 the master in economic fabric of the country 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:45.419
 and that means safeguarding income and employment 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.319
 last note 

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:49.490
 apply some of those rules 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.480
 also to the Italian system to accelerate exit from the Paleolithic
