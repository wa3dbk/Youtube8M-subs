00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.040
 Hello everybody 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.650
 the film factory today I have you the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.750
 movie mandela the long way to freedom 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.130
 brought along and the movie comes in january 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.890
 in the cinemas and is now right now 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 very up to date after the 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.279
 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Nelson Mandela 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.020
 yes, it died last week 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.119
 is the life story of him like him 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.490
 in the 60s as civil rights 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.769
 fighters in south africa have a name 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.410
 had made but then too 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.540
 life imprisonment 1964 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.800
 was sentenced 27 years later 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.800
 was released 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.930
 won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.030
 a year later for the first black one 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.100
 president of his country 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.660
 is like in the life story 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.660
 visualized that would have been here 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.620
 We will never be a wife again or again 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.620
 child 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.980
 you become a star what can one do 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.260
 alone together we are strong 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.670
 you think you know what was going on 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.670
 I would not be otherwise I would not be here 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.750
 shows is angry we are all angry 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.630
 for me the film was on the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.090
 cinema viewers one of the hardest 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.250
 KinogÃ¤nger ever then the message 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.979
 the death of mandela came and on 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.530
 same morning, the film was then synonymous 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.659
 the movie shows he really shows that 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.399
 That's why you can get full life from it 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.710
 of course, that's what he does, too 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.009
 is longer because the good man has yes 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.580
 very very much experienced 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.009
 but at the same time they are also 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.570
 Main actor fantastic selected 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.470
 So there you can only 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.060
 Bow 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.520
 and it is very very dignified 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.500
 become just with such films 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.409
 biographies it is always very difficult 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.840
 it will just be such a slaughter 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.310
 as a film itself or are the actors 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.649
 just very dignified that works 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.330
 Fantastic really just hat off 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.739
 a terrific performance also the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.959
 soundtrack is great and used 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.000
 in general, like the whole interplay 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.430
 working is more than convincing 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.780
 So Nelson Mandela had the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.730
 film very much liked with security 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.190
 even if the film is very dignified his 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.140
 but you have to say that is figured 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.299
 yes just too long so the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.769
 stories are very interesting 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.660
 and it's just really 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.670
 Stunning what the man has done 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.190
 but it could be in a something 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.260
 compressed and film suitable 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.970
 version but rather come to the cinema that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.860
 But is not the big problem of the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.340
 films which I honestly something 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.959
 disturbing is that the figure 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.549
 invariably so exaggeratedly positive 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.079
 I'm showing I have 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.269
 Great respect for the man is out 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.310
 in my opinion one of the biggest or the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.410
 greatest personality of our time 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.730
 Nevertheless, I just want to corner 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.340
 and he then has edges of humans 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.590
 just forgive everything really everyone 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.019
 and it is almost over 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.230
 drawn godlike and that's it 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.090
 really a bit exhausting you could 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.700
 just a few private moments 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.519
 show wherever nelson mandela man 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.250
 says so in serious construction that's just possible 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.450
 not that is unfortunately such a criticism 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.280
 that's a bit too smooth for me 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.450
 it has indeed been a tribute 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.920
 but also with friends you 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.050
 You had the say once when 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.940
 something does not fit and that's what's missing 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.629
 me just in the film is too smooth 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.790
 become 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.530
 to the Hollywood moderate but it is after all 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.330
 well played and well worth seeing 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.430
 but unfortunately there was much more 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.470
 potential who should mandela now im 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.120
 cinema are definitely the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.250
 People who say I want his 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.690
 Life story very detailed 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.819
 get told then you are here 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.470
 in any case, the people are just right 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.900
 say that twice or get 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.790
 but also roughly knows the story but therefore 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.470
 Now that's the current topic as well 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.910
 is very strong topic in the media 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.230
 then have a look 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.420
 What does this man really have 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.040
 who should not be the film 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.420
 But they are already looking at each other 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.280
 very strong with nelson mandela 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.470
 have set apart and the but 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.390
 at the same time hey say if you do that 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.099
 I would like to do that, too 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.900
 see something more critical and not 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.819
 critical in the sense of there's then must 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.269
 yes have something negative but shows 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.250
 but smooth him not only as the 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.560
 That's not what Strahlemann was 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.280
 that is , none of us would have 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.200
 like a bit more humanity 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.120
 yet seen on another level 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.320
 would be honest opinion he is looking 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.270
 maybe change yourself better 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.030
 not my personal rating 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.190
 are rock solid are of 10 points 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.169
 the film shows a great picture of 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.990
 mandela it is fantastic 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.660
 but too little too clean on the whole 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.919
 too few edges I would like something 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.419
 more personal something more human 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.419
 seen and not something godlike it 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.850
 but altogether a dignified farewell 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.370
 in film form by nelson mandela 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.620
 That's why I score 7 out of 10 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.270
 was my review to mandela of you 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.370
 I would like to know now what are 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.870
 for you personalities either 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.440
 have died or still today 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.669
 he truly reveres and lives as 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.200
 you see great role models you write 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.820
 the comments will interest me 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.200
 but who still from the trailer 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.539
 want to convince look down here
