00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.250
 the camera was made in france by 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.739
 louis daguerre invented 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.780
 he succeeded previous inventions so too 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.170
 improve that he sharp images 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.300
 got fixed on a movie 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.720
 thanks to the invention of photography 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.440
 we take pictures of memories and emotions 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.440
 hold on forever 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.980
 The bike was made in Germany by 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.280
 Karl von Drais invented the first one 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.370
 prototype of a bicycle made of wood and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.260
 thanks to the invention of the pedals 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.530
 We can bike in the city 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.730
 fast clean and without the use of 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.730
 move animals 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.370
 the phone was from antonio meucci 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.800
 invented 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.960
 an italian engineer who after 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.900
 numerous studies and complex 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.479
 experiments as the first understanding like the 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.140
 voice through electricity 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.840
 can be 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.550
 thanks to the invention of the phone 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.740
 We have great distances within 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.610
 speak with each other for an instant 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.610
 communicate now 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.970
 The electric tram was built and 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.480
 spread thanks to the use of the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.120
 electricity the tram can become 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.040
 clean and quietly move through the city 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.040
 a kind of train for shorter distances 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.549
 The rocket was made in Germany by 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.129
 later invented by brown 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.010
 why did you find a way to develop 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.840
 Rockets fly and thousands too 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.540
 kilometers away 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.669
 thanks to the rocket could the 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.209
 human beings fly into space and on the 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.209
 land in the moon
