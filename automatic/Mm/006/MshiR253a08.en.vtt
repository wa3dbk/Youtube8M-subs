doing
so<00:01:31.860> there's<00:01:32.189> holes<00:01:32.540> see<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> holes<00:01:33.840> right

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so there's holes see the holes right

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.399 
so there's holes see the holes right
there<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.299> goes<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
there in there that actually goes that

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.420 
there in there that actually goes that
metal<00:01:37.950> tab<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.540> metal<00:01:39.720> tab<00:01:40.049> has<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.280> go

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
metal tab and this metal tab has to go

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.050 
metal tab and this metal tab has to go
into<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:43.130> when<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> slide<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.850> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
into here so when you slide it in you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.819 
into here so when you slide it in you
have<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> slide<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.720> kinda<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.350> so
