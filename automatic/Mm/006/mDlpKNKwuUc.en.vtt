answered your own question just by your

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
answered your own question just by your
post<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.890> haven't<00:00:47.760> been<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> gym<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
post you haven't been to the gym in a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
post you haven't been to the gym in a
while<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.989> feel<00:00:49.140> weaker<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.590> smaller

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
while and you feel weaker and smaller

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
while and you feel weaker and smaller
that's<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.430> way<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.629> don't<00:00:51.750> place

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that's the way it is if you don't place

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260 
that's the way it is if you don't place
stress<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.949> demands<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.670> muscle<00:00:54.000> then

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
stress and demands on your muscle then

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.930 
stress and demands on your muscle then
there's<00:00:54.480> no<00:00:54.690> reason<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.980> muscle<00:00:56.190> in

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
there's no reason to have that muscle in

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
there's no reason to have that muscle in
order<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.480> bigger<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.989> stronger<00:00:58.320> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
order to get bigger and stronger you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.680 
order to get bigger and stronger you
need<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> play<00:00:59.399> stress<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.030> demands<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
need to play stress and demands on the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.599 
need to play stress and demands on the
muscle<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.469> give<00:01:01.680> them<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> reason<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> grow

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
muscle to give them a reason to grow

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.429 
muscle to give them a reason to grow
bigger<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.000> stronger<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.049> don't<00:01:04.229> use<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
bigger and stronger if you don't use it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.580 
bigger and stronger if you don't use it
you<00:01:04.769> will<00:01:05.070> lose<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.700> absolutely<00:01:06.330> true

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
you will lose it that is absolutely true

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.580 
you will lose it that is absolutely true
now<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.920> good<00:01:08.040> news<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:09.330> easier<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
now the good news is it's easier to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.670 
now the good news is it's easier to
regain<00:01:11.159> muscle<00:01:12.060> than<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.080> gain<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.500> in

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
regain muscle than it is to gain it in

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
regain muscle than it is to gain it in
the<00:01:13.799> first<00:01:14.010> place<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.210> you've<00:01:15.360> been

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the first place so if you've been

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.969 
the first place so if you've been
working<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.229> while<00:01:16.409> let's<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.860> say

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
working out for a while let's just say

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.770 
working out for a while let's just say
you've<00:01:17.159> worked<00:01:17.520> out<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> year<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.420> you've

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you've worked out for a year and you've

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.270 
you've worked out for a year and you've
got<00:01:18.960> yourself<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> certain<00:01:19.860> level<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
got yourself up to a certain level of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.219 
got yourself up to a certain level of
development<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.930> course<00:01:22.140> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
development and then of course you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.200 
development and then of course you
stopped<00:01:22.439> working<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.220> lost<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.670> it's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
stopped working out and you lost it it's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.890 
stopped working out and you lost it it's
easier<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.350> regain<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.189> previously<00:01:27.119> reached

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
easier to regain a previously reached

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.990 
easier to regain a previously reached
level<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> muscular<00:01:28.799> development<00:01:28.950> than<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
level of muscular development than it is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.969 
level of muscular development than it is
to<00:01:30.210> gain<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.570> first<00:01:30.780> place<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.680> while<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
to gain it in first place so while it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 
to gain it in first place so while it
may<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.220> took<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> year<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.360> build<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.930> to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
may have took you a year to build up to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.749 
may have took you a year to build up to
that<00:01:34.170> level<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.950> may<00:01:35.130> only<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> couple

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that level it may only take you a couple

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.330 
that level it may only take you a couple
months<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.720> back<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.229> level<00:01:37.650> so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
months to get back to that level so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.429 
months to get back to that level so
that's<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> good<00:01:38.759> news<00:01:38.990> however<00:01:39.990> ultimately
