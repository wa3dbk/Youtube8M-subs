00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.099
 Hello and welcome back to an accident 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.870
 Of course, Elsenfeld Nazgul remained 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.749
 in progress 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.789
 to be flank station 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.539
 and now I am already in the middle of it and she herself is quite dark about it 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.309
 always made a bit of light 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.419
 with our voices 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.189
 you can also call those facts I unfortunately have none 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.770
 now it is a bit problematic since the 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.029
 are named 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.899
 directly from time to time by itself I do not know exactly why area 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.300
 SÃ¼dstadt breeze inside or 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.180
 no air so the flames smothered or 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.930
 maybe but also Mosers emanates I have no idea why that 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 last puzzle plattling 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510
 I have to go here now 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.780
 Dr 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.710
 the readers have 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.750
 That's why we have many beautiful experiences 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.410
 that's because we have a small one right now 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.180
 Bielefeld 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.180
 to solve 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.740
 Nevertheless, there is not much to heal 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.110
 these are 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.850
 here are many different ones 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.850
 different rooms 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 small diversion 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.500
 Tino l 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.220
 to visit the things summerly because 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 Mum 2 is not possible 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.000
 really many thousand visitors 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.259
 at one or the other almost at the end 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.170
 this is a little something but 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.550
 not really much anymore 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.490
 that's what the examining magistrates knew 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.340
 After exactly where protocol occurs so Alba meets so the promi-lawyer practically 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.920
 but does not understand why has not been abrupt 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.039
 the owner of humility, yes, sometimes so'n percent discarded 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.500
 So it's always at night 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.650
 Museums Beaver Life 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.770
 has found a forest have really gotten us 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.970
 one is not seen 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.970
 MemoRight that includes signs of the flames station 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.069
 Businessman bit 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.069
 Rank slipped 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.459
 Marcel advised 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.399
 that belongs 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.629
 it came in the Renault speak here 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.730
 under that was a live-switch, so to speak 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.849
 out of the loss zone 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:31.999
 this means 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.999
 where will someone say 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.849
 yes I have to search for this release 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.779
 Eat a bit more subjects 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.779
 and kicked out 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.529
 Prof next 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.689
 in the cev cup 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.689
 Objectivity Chances are bad 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:03.479
 Aberdeen 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.699
 that's not the case 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.499
 Ambrosius points too 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.499
 is unusual 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:13.980
 what goal of this 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.369
 Hounds too 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:16.799
 were used 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.799
 no idea 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.809
 something that has all been put into operation for sick experiments 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.849
 It almost looks like weapon stations are expressing 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.929
 There is no smoky Rheine 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.799
 at the bottom of the league Earth is what 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.339
 the plane is lying 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.509
 Who would have Eco eV without a big brother over it 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.509
 the program does not, of course, only the fans 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:06.170
 yes and then there was the one or the third season where 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.049
 Jack and crustaceans are out there this year 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.509
 Kissing prisoner in soil samples, yes, not always 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:13.949
 Station monitors 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.289
 if they have 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.109
 or that the network expansion should look there times 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.610
 Simon Aboud had us back then and offered flashbacks 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.340
 if that means too soon 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.340
 Carer honest 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.530
 - registered 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.530
 Tour de Suisse 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.909
 a farmer chairman Dr 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.379
 Points 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.840
 I hope the help up 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.919
 I still have a little bit 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.919
 Sibylle buys a magical loaded in Schonach 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.680
 I think you should also be out in the near future 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.979
 too long 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.719
 they are already 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:04.879
 must go through here 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.469
 but this one 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.839
 and they are allowed to tact 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:12.289
 2 I now get their lamps off 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.669
 okay then we want to 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.419
 the enjoyment wall 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.710
 does not mean that it will be easy 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.400
 Percent like 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.510
 how do we do that pattern now or do we have to do a lot? 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.590
 Tatort not the whole thing 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.749
 also a lot 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:30.629
 she 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.710
 such a structure of a protein and 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.110
 in a team 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.919
 thus changes and 2 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.909
 8 percent 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.259
 not least because that our satisfied 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.259
 so there must be quite a bit of power reading it often 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.889
 Trichet should increase again 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.259
 Frustration and 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.949
 and promptly were already too old and to teach 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.249
 4 It looks that way too 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:10.249
 I can theoretically continue from up here 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.559
 pretty much going on under Chief 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:16.839
 Tour de France in the Alps 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:18.150
 Rome 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
 that might have been it already 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.900
 James Murdoch's son Tim Henman saves 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.379
 here 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.719
 the success 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.889
 Soya around 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.500
 the time is eleven percent 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.110
 I have a little time 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.669
 but the deputy head 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.160
 high quality and that is unexpected also does not take really long and the in 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:43.689
 this year is over again 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.229
 Percent would say a bit and you can not mix it 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.550
 revise percent 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.719
 in the completed episodes 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:52.749
 So overall view
