00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.280
 Welcome to epic enemy number 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.740
 One you have many comments 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.080
 under the last epic veit 0 video 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.640
 written with insanely interesting 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 troop compilations I have mine 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.930
 really all looked through and got me 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.910
 now 1 picked out with some 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.560
 thumb up, blend it down here 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.000
 again, that one for one 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.740
 ever before the compilation 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.550
 sees and that one too 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.910
 can be happy 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.059
 his idea now becomes less 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.100
 was implemented was really interesting 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.620
 the first time troops train the again 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.239
 significantly more elixir cost 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.160
 Of course I want you too now 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.149
 show what we are printing it are for 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.270
 a two golems level 12 kite level 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.430
 3 2 packers on level 1 then I have 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.520
 still the wall breakers eight times on level 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.190
 5 and the rest are barbarous 34 pieces 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.930
 at level 5 except for Golem and Becker 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.350
 So everything is currently on the highest 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.879
 step 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.680
 I do not even have to go back 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.340
 spells decided or how 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.010
 desired case dreyfus magic on level 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.560
 4 value currently in the lab on level 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.670
 fifth upgraded so currently with 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.770
 level 4 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.090
 then I just want to say we look 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.060
 we'll have a strong one right away 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.380
 Opponents find in the Klamm castle 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 of course, interesting to mention 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.820
 I have five level 5 and one level 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.360
 another dragon level 3 because it is still here 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.020
 times a little extra power I say 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.460
 from the opponent 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.770
 I will, of course, I would say the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.610
 find a healthy mix on the one hand should 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.409
 resources have to be his 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.850
 the best use of resources 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.619
 gets back a dark elixir 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 Although difficult there the two golems alone 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.920
 already 900 have cost but just the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.509
 here for example and out is but 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.299
 maybe a bit in the east moment 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.560
 uninteresting with the distribution the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.420
 defense maybe a bit 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.520
 although it has weak town hall level 9 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.770
 I knew how to focus the air defense 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.890
 but as normal clicks continue here 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.280
 have the theme the level 10 also with 2x 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.349
 boss but all in all yes I know 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.239
 if that's so interesting can not 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.480
 without still quite below levels 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.430
 Schaumann even further from the attack ago 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.780
 I'm probably the packers the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.340
 golems in the beginning put more or 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.310
 less than tank then possible 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.060
 fast will be well clean and criminal 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.360
 combine so that the fast 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.620
 fortress would come 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.390
 probably already outside the beginning 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.319
 first distribute around the clan troops 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.930
 to lure out 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.060
 and then the air defense at least 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.840
 turned off a certain area 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.760
 has been 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.650
 then comes my clear castle with the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.099
 kites and my two more 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.330
 dragon and with the two other rage 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.040
 magic and I will be there more or 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.690
 less pave gone inward 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.330
 Now let's see what you can do that too 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.250
 somebody will find that reasonably 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.190
 interesting mix between a strong one 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.050
 fortress is a lot of resources we see 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.819
 here where he has a lot of resources 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.340
 it might ago by a fortress 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.959
 instrument not so impressive but there 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.120
 I can not say no 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.620
 say 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.420
 I would always say that even if that 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.670
 as I said not the top of mixed 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.400
 but base has a challenge 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.720
 maybe we can make the 100 now 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.120
 first let's see if he's the one 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.349
 klamauk what is that nothing in it has 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.450
 not played that for a while now 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.140
 is called master golden helix helix in the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.629
 I would be mine and in the pumps 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.940
 say everything rest us the true king 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.030
 At the town hall up there more or less away 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.230
 we turn off cannons he has yes 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.299
 level 89 make some barbarians there 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.840
 above I would say so that one the 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.280
 then barbarian king can turn off 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.379
 and then also the golems and the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.540
 packers afterwards combine the then 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.040
 with a hat magic and is right 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.030
 quickly masonry breaker that we can 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.010
 inside come in 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.110
 the rest of the time I set now 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.720
 out here to obenrum loss ever 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.879
 destroyed and now the golems are allowed 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.189
 packers and the barbarians a hardworking 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.569
 make a job with walls and break 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.370
 I'm already inside 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.900
 That went pretty fast , we will say 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.939
 make a second hat 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.340
 conjure so pecker here and golem 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.810
 continues to hurt and the air defense 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.060
 is turned off that means we can 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.850
 it with our kites around with ours 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.980
 clear castle follow 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.959
 the ipad is unfortunately all the way up 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.390
 We have a farewell down here 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.330
 second of it is almost down the kites 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.340
 roll on the right and on the upper left in the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.980
 picture have the two fight together 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.110
 because unfortunately so golems grab the 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.030
 defense units to the kites 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.860
 arbitrarily grab those we have it here 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.000
 give the third hat a try with it 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.740
 do a good job 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.810
 Unfortunately, pedersen is already both 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.600
 turned off that we have the 50th 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.900
 cracked and make the branches holmes 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.370
 it is also hard to work alone 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.480
 almost constantly so that will be soon 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.280
 be divided into two small ones each 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.440
 and our kites are doing that 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.760
 most harm and fight each other 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.560
 really diligent 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.060
 So I think synonymous generally something 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.560
 kites are among the top players 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.790
 are you the strongest and 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.200
 most effective units 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.520
 if you look that we have the 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.740
 Air purity as fast as possible 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.080
 turns off and to the dragons ever 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.570
 after having magic with healing spells 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.490
 or has squeaky clean he combined 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.380
 really a very effective attack 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.030
 combo because of busk that day 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.230
 be attacked by the archer 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.750
 tower the damage I think right 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.700
 manageable from tesla can be attacked 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.740
 be from the magician tower and then 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.150
 of course fend off the air and if 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.590
 now dangerous in the Klamm castle 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.300
 Troops can do that a lot 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.480
 Doing harm but you see it already 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.940
 Also every one dragon is from the tom brand 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.830
 Tom and Tesla focuses and holds 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.260
 he was quite nice and the 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.020
 other two fight it too 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.090
 I diligently work the way ahead in time 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.920
 that it was 100 percent short of is there 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.260
 In the corners each still building 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.210
 is hope but that the 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:58.030
 At least one more of the two kites 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.030
 get gold mines or 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.820
 get more gold 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.530
 You must not be surprised I have 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.090
 unfortunately something to fight with at the moment 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.100
 my headset that has the little one 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.720
 shaky contact I have to have one 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.400
 send and have it repaired 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.480
 and then I look at the transition 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.660
 get sentences 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.770
 Now 96 have the three buildings in the truck 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.400
 more or less the neck 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.440
 Broken 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.390
 All in all, of the resources 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.550
 Of course, very very effective attacks 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.050
 100 percent not quite done but it 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.729
 also goes with such strong troops 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.449
 Although the fortress is not so great 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.009
 out 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.900
 I say it is not so extra 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.559
 easily equal to 100 percent 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.180
 to get 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:35.039
 maybe I want the one or the other 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.449
 another device can place differently 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.710
 because I could gladly comments 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.210
 Write what I could have done better 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.159
 Of course I can not be there either 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.759
 infallible 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.259
 of course you can now too 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.089
 under this video again yours 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.069
 Suggestions for the epic enemy number 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:49.289
 Two write what we do 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.089
 Compilation you have there as well 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.979
 best rate with thumbs high so that 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:55.080
 I see there favorite fast 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.069
 if you liked the video 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.569
 of course, as always 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.309
 crazy about a thumbs up and 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:01.710
 could also look forward to 

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:03.360
 facebook follow industries coc where i am 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.240
 really look as good as they can each 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.729
 to answer private message and me 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.099
 I am already curious what ideas 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:13.279
 So in the next video you have me 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.779
 there with new ideas challenger 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:17.400
 magic spells or even troops too 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:18.749
 if that goes into the money right up to 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.860
 The resources will be a lot of fun
