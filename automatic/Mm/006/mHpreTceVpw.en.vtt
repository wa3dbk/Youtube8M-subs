getting a nice bend in the tube a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.820 
getting a nice bend in the tube a
silicone<00:00:20.720> basically<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> silicone<00:00:22.230> tube<00:00:22.529> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
silicone basically a silicone tube a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.330 
silicone basically a silicone tube a
solid<00:00:23.250> one<00:00:23.539> this<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.720> great<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.439> it's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
solid one this is great because it's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.900 
solid one this is great because it's
going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.580> give<00:00:26.760> us<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.210> perfect<00:00:28.369> fill<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
going to give us a perfect fill for the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.170 
going to give us a perfect fill for the
tube<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> end<00:00:31.590> here

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
tube as you can see on the end here

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.740 
tube as you can see on the end here
there's<00:00:33.180> no<00:00:33.450> gap<00:00:34.309> whatsoever<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.480> tube

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
there's no gap whatsoever on this tube

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.619 
there's no gap whatsoever on this tube
so<00:00:37.079> when<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.380> go<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.559> bend<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.420> there's<00:00:39.420> not

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so when we go to bend it there's not

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.670 
so when we go to bend it there's not
going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.930> any<00:00:40.050> flat<00:00:40.410> spots<00:00:41.840> any<00:00:42.840> kinks<00:00:43.530> in

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
going to be any flat spots any kinks in

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
going to be any flat spots any kinks in
the<00:00:43.800> tube<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.579> pretty<00:00:44.789> much<00:00:44.879> come

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the tube it's going to pretty much come

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.580 
the tube it's going to pretty much come
out<00:00:45.360> perfect<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:47.480> have<00:00:48.480> some<00:00:48.719> sandpaper<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
out perfect so I have some sandpaper and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.939 
out perfect so I have some sandpaper and
some<00:00:50.190> olive<00:00:50.460> oil<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.300> same<00:00:51.570> paper

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
some olive oil the same paper

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.910 
some olive oil the same paper
essentially<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:55.620> silicone<00:00:56.180> now

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
essentially is for the silicone now

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.290 
essentially is for the silicone now
unfortunately<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.250> don't<00:00:59.370> manufacture<00:00:59.670> these

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
oil that we can put on the end of this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.880 
oil that we can put on the end of this
silicone<00:01:48.049> as<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:49.860> just

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
silicone as you can see here I'm just

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.219 
silicone as you can see here I'm just
dipping<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.670> wetting<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.420> silicone<00:01:51.899> here

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
dipping and wetting the silicone here

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.179

right<00:01:56.369> through<00:01:57.079> olive<00:01:58.079> oil<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.380> great<00:01:58.530> because

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
right through olive oil is great because

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.149 
right through olive oil is great because
it<00:01:59.070> cleans<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.490> easy<00:01:59.729> it<00:02:00.030> doesn't<00:02:00.360> burn<00:02:01.159> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it cleans up easy it doesn't burn and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.560 
other stuff away move over the heat gun
excuse<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.979> noise<00:02:10.010> of<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:10.520> heat<00:02:10.640> gun<00:02:10.790> but<00:02:11.120> we

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
excuse the noise of the heat gun but we

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.660 
excuse the noise of the heat gun but we
kind<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.840> need<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.020> heat<00:02:12.230> up<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.410> acrylic<00:02:15.670> so

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
kind of need to heat up the acrylic so

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.480 
kind of need to heat up the acrylic so
the<00:02:16.880> real<00:02:17.060> key<00:02:17.390> with<00:02:17.720> bending<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:18.770> tube<00:02:19.100> is

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
the real key with bending this tube is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.190 
the real key with bending this tube is
to<00:02:19.670> actually<00:02:20.060> get<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:21.710> acrylic<00:02:22.340> itself

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
to actually get the acrylic itself

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.910 
to actually get the acrylic itself
pretty<00:02:24.200> much<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.680> almost<00:02:25.340> molten<00:02:25.760> state<00:02:26.920> as

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
pretty much to almost molten state as

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.850 
pretty much to almost molten state as
you<00:02:28.520> can<00:02:28.670> see<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.810> acrylic<00:02:30.230> itself<00:02:30.590> right<00:02:30.800> now

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
you can see the acrylic itself right now

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.570 
you can see the acrylic itself right now
when<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.310> go<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.520> bend<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.780> pretty<00:02:33.140> much

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
when I go to bend it it's pretty much

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.730 
when I go to bend it it's pretty much
rigid<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.720> know<00:02:35.840> I'm<00:02:35.960> not<00:02:36.020> able<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.440> bend

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
rigid so you know I'm not able to bend

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.250 
rigid so you know I'm not able to bend
it<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:38.150> know<00:02:38.270> even<00:02:38.780> with<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.930> little<00:02:39.140> bit<00:02:39.230> of

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
it you know even with a little bit of

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.410 
it you know even with a little bit of
heat<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:39.740> what<00:02:40.400> we're<00:02:40.520> going<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.880> is<00:02:41.090> we're

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
heat so what we're going to do is we're

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.660 
heat so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:41.810> kind<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.170> hold<00:02:42.980> this<00:02:43.220> over<00:02:43.580> the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
going to just kind of hold this over the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.110 
going to just kind of hold this over the
heat<00:02:43.850> gun<00:02:44.530> rotate<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.710> I<00:02:45.860> can<00:02:46.040> use<00:02:46.220> my<00:02:46.610> silicone

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
heat gun rotate it I can use my silicone

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.410 
heat gun rotate it I can use my silicone
here<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.510> rotate<00:02:47.660> it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
here to rotate it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.110 
here to rotate it
and<00:02:49.540> kind<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.260> like<00:02:50.550> maybe<00:02:51.550> cooking<00:02:51.940> some

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
and kind of like maybe cooking some

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.380 
and kind of like maybe cooking some
s'mores<00:02:53.130> over<00:02:54.130> nice<00:02:54.310> little<00:02:54.610> campfire<00:02:55.060> for

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
s'mores over nice little campfire for

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.229 
s'mores over nice little campfire for
those<00:02:55.690> people<00:02:56.349> don't<00:02:56.530> like<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.800> do<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.239> as

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
those people don't like to do that as

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.210 
those people don't like to do that as
you'll<00:02:58.510> notice<00:02:58.840> I'm<00:02:59.290> moving<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.830> back<00:03:00.010> and

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
you'll notice I'm moving it back and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.650 
you'll notice I'm moving it back and
forth<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.700> don't<00:03:00.819> want<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.030> hold<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.360> in<00:03:01.450> one

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
forth I don't want to hold it in one

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.760 
forth I don't want to hold it in one
spot<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:03.610> where<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.630> creek<00:03:04.989> acrylic<00:03:05.650> will

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
spot to where the creek acrylic will

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.410 
spot to where the creek acrylic will
actually<00:03:06.100> start<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.430> bubble<00:03:06.790> up<00:03:06.880> because<00:03:07.239> it's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
actually start to bubble up because it's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.180 
actually start to bubble up because it's
getting<00:03:07.600> too<00:03:07.870> hot

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
getting too hot

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.850 
getting too hot
I'll<00:03:10.120> have<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.420> one<00:03:10.630> end<00:03:10.870> for<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.500> little<00:03:11.590> while

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
I'll have it one end for a little while

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.640 
I'll have it one end for a little while
and<00:03:12.220> then<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.520> can<00:03:12.700> travel<00:03:12.970> down<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:14.230> acrylic

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
and then I can travel down the acrylic

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.800 
and then I can travel down the acrylic
tube<00:03:14.830> itself

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.380 

very<00:03:19.380> simple<00:03:19.860> very<00:03:20.430> straightforward<00:03:20.760> you

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
very simple very straightforward you

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.190 
very simple very straightforward you
know<00:03:22.050> this<00:03:22.380> will<00:03:22.530> probably<00:03:22.710> take<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:24.170> say<00:03:25.170> a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
know this will probably take I say a

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.950 
know this will probably take I say a
minute<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.740> two<00:03:25.920> minutes<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:27.360> really<00:03:27.630> get<00:03:27.810> this

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
minute to two minutes to really get this

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.590 
minute to two minutes to really get this
acrylic<00:03:28.290> nice<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.890> soft<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.460> pliable<00:03:29.850> and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
acrylic nice and soft and pliable and

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.490 
acrylic nice and soft and pliable and
give<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.680> nice<00:03:31.830> Bend<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:33.170> as<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.440> see

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
give a nice Bend on it as you can see

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.970 
give a nice Bend on it as you can see
where<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.890> put<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.760> heat<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:37.410> can<00:03:37.560> see<00:03:37.770> that<00:03:37.950> I

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
where I put the heat you can see that I

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.440 
where I put the heat you can see that I
can<00:03:38.190> start<00:03:38.430> getting<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.790> little<00:03:38.910> bit<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.300> bend

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
can start getting a little bit of a bend

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.860 
can start getting a little bit of a bend
there<00:03:39.920> but<00:03:40.920> nowhere<00:03:41.220> near<00:03:41.280> as<00:03:41.550> soft<00:03:42.030> as<00:03:42.240> I<00:03:42.270> need

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
there but nowhere near as soft as I need

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.870 
there but nowhere near as soft as I need
the<00:03:43.020> acrylic<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:43.920> be<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.280> get<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> good<00:03:44.610> nice

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
the acrylic to be to get a good nice

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.390 
the acrylic to be to get a good nice
Bend<00:03:45.320> so<00:03:46.320> I'm<00:03:46.500> going<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.740> continue<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.160> heat

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
Bend so I'm going to continue to heat

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400 
Bend so I'm going to continue to heat
this<00:03:47.580> I'm<00:03:47.940> not<00:03:48.180> necessarily<00:03:48.390> heating<00:03:49.080> up<00:03:49.200> this

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
this I'm not necessarily heating up this

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.830 
this I'm not necessarily heating up this
end<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.580> acrylic<00:03:50.790> because<00:03:51.300> I'm<00:03:51.540> not<00:03:51.660> going

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
end of the acrylic because I'm not going

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.420 
end of the acrylic because I'm not going
to<00:03:51.900> put<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.080> bend<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.890> want<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.400> be

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
to put a bend in this I want this to be

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.760 
to put a bend in this I want this to be
nice<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.910> straight<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.750> can<00:03:55.020> have<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> you

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
nice and straight so I can have a you

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.280 
nice and straight so I can have a you
know<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.890> nice<00:03:56.130> u-shape<00:03:56.760> at<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.090> end<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.630> then

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
know a nice u-shape at the end and then

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.490 
know a nice u-shape at the end and then
I<00:03:58.380> can<00:03:58.560> trim<00:03:58.830> my<00:03:59.780> acrylic<00:04:00.780> down<00:04:00.930> after<00:04:01.380> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
I can trim my acrylic down after the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.130 
I can trim my acrylic down after the
fact<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:02.300> you'll<00:04:03.300> kind<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.570> see<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.959> it's

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
fact so you'll kind of see that it's

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.410 
fact so you'll kind of see that it's
getting<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.500> little<00:04:04.709> softer<00:04:05.130> there<00:04:05.310> for<00:04:05.580> us

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
getting a little softer there for us

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.190 
getting a little softer there for us
still<00:04:08.110> not<00:04:08.260> as<00:04:08.410> soft<00:04:08.620> as<00:04:08.800> I'd<00:04:08.950> like<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.340> me

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
still not as soft as I'd like it to me

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.990 
still not as soft as I'd like it to me
again<00:04:11.200> we<00:04:11.410> want<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.710> get<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.520> acrylic<00:04:12.970> to

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
again we want to get the the acrylic to

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.420 
again we want to get the the acrylic to
a<00:04:13.150> molten<00:04:13.630> state<00:04:13.810> we<00:04:14.710> don't<00:04:14.830> really<00:04:15.190> want<00:04:15.370> to

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
a molten state we don't really want to

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.170 
a molten state we don't really want to
you<00:04:16.180> know<00:04:16.380> completely<00:04:17.380> melt<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.890> acrylic<00:04:18.340> to

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
you know completely melt the acrylic to

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.000 
you know completely melt the acrylic to
where<00:04:19.299> it's<00:04:19.690> liquefied<00:04:20.230> but<00:04:20.530> we<00:04:20.680> want<00:04:20.860> to<00:04:20.920> get

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
where it's liquefied but we want to get

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.640 
where it's liquefied but we want to get
it<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.250> nice<00:04:21.459> soft<00:04:21.850> molten<00:04:22.450> State

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
it to a nice soft molten State

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.590 
it to a nice soft molten State
and<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.220> can<00:04:25.340> see<00:04:25.520> how<00:04:25.639> easy<00:04:25.880> that's<00:04:26.150> bending

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
and you can see how easy that's bending

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.020 
and you can see how easy that's bending
now<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:28.160> I'll<00:04:28.250> give<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.790> know<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:28.940> few

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
now so I'll give it a you know a few

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.689 
now so I'll give it a you know a few
more<00:04:29.300> seconds<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:30.560> where<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.710> can<00:04:30.919> really<00:04:31.190> feel

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
more seconds to where I can really feel

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.150 
more seconds to where I can really feel
that<00:04:31.970> acrylic<00:04:32.590> starting<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.680> be<00:04:33.740> nice<00:04:33.949> and

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
that acrylic starting to be nice and

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.640 
that acrylic starting to be nice and
loose<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.760> as<00:04:35.540> we<00:04:35.720> get<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:36.050> acrylic<00:04:36.320> nice

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
loose and as we get that acrylic nice

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.250 
loose and as we get that acrylic nice
and<00:04:36.889> loose<00:04:37.660> that's<00:04:38.660> going<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:38.990> give<00:04:39.139> us<00:04:39.229> a

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
and loose that's going to give us a

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.810 
and loose that's going to give us a
perfect<00:04:39.470> opportunity<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:40.310> wrap<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.729> around

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
perfect opportunity to wrap it around

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.600 
perfect opportunity to wrap it around
something<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.979> you<00:04:42.979> know<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.130> have<00:04:43.460> this

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
something and you know I have this

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.960 
something and you know I have this
copper<00:04:44.389> slug<00:04:44.780> right<00:04:45.050> here<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:46.610> I'm<00:04:46.729> going<00:04:46.880> to

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
copper slug right here that I'm going to

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.879 
copper slug right here that I'm going to
wrap<00:04:47.090> this<00:04:47.419> first<00:04:47.720> one<00:04:47.960> around<00:04:48.229> to<00:04:48.620> show<00:04:48.800> you

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
wrap this first one around to show you

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.040 
wrap this first one around to show you
you<00:04:49.729> know<00:04:49.850> how<00:04:50.030> simple<00:04:50.449> it<00:04:50.510> is<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.660> get<00:04:50.870> that

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
you know how simple it is to get that

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.100 
you know how simple it is to get that
nice<00:04:51.260> turn<00:04:51.590> so<00:04:52.490> as<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.699> can<00:04:52.790> see<00:04:53.060> this<00:04:53.389> is<00:04:53.780> now

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
nice turn so as you can see this is now

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.969 
nice turn so as you can see this is now
a<00:04:54.880> flexible<00:04:55.880> piece<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:56.720> acrylic<00:04:56.979> no

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
a flexible piece of acrylic no

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.700 
a flexible piece of acrylic no
flattening<00:04:58.520> no<00:04:58.729> bubbling<00:04:59.210> and<00:04:59.780> essentially<00:05:00.680> I

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
flattening no bubbling and essentially I

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.360 
flattening no bubbling and essentially I
can<00:05:00.800> take<00:05:01.130> my<00:05:01.310> slug<00:05:01.639> just<00:05:01.880> like<00:05:02.180> this<00:05:03.220> see<00:05:04.220> if<00:05:04.310> I

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
can take my slug just like this see if I

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.420 
can take my slug just like this see if I
can<00:05:04.520> do<00:05:04.639> this<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:06.080> can<00:05:06.289> bend<00:05:07.250> it

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
can do this and I can bend it

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.450 
can do this and I can bend it
essentially<00:05:08.260> right<00:05:09.260> around<00:05:09.500> my<00:05:09.710> slug<00:05:10.100> just

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
essentially right around my slug just

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.709 
essentially right around my slug just
like<00:05:11.180> that

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
like that

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:18.000 
like that
put<00:05:13.289> it<00:05:13.409> right<00:05:13.589> up<00:05:14.099> there

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.790 

and<00:05:18.750> I'm<00:05:19.750> done<00:05:19.960> with<00:05:20.110> that<00:05:22.020> put<00:05:23.020> this<00:05:23.170> here<00:05:23.650> and

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
and I'm done with that put this here and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.900 
and I'm done with that put this here and
you'll<00:05:24.580> see<00:05:24.760> that<00:05:24.910> there's<00:05:25.150> no<00:05:25.270> flattening

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
you'll see that there's no flattening

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.330 
you'll see that there's no flattening
there's<00:05:27.910> nothing<00:05:28.300> you<00:05:28.810> know<00:05:29.340> flattening

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
there's nothing you know flattening

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.550 
there's nothing you know flattening
going<00:05:30.610> on<00:05:30.730> there<00:05:31.000> after<00:05:31.270> I<00:05:31.600> have<00:05:31.810> my<00:05:31.990> shape<00:05:32.290> I

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
going on there after I have my shape I

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.750 
going on there after I have my shape I
can<00:05:32.860> hold<00:05:33.250> this

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
can hold this

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.800 
can hold this
I<00:05:34.830> can<00:05:35.830> flex<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.220> little<00:05:36.430> bit<00:05:36.550> more<00:05:36.790> I<00:05:37.120> can<00:05:37.690> get

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
I can flex a little bit more I can get

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.010 
I can flex a little bit more I can get
it<00:05:37.900> right<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.170> the<00:05:38.260> shape<00:05:38.470> I<00:05:38.620> want<00:05:39.150> and<00:05:40.150> we<00:05:40.780> cool

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
it right to the shape I want and we cool

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.600 
it right to the shape I want and we cool
them<00:05:41.110> down<00:05:41.200> with<00:05:41.530> fans<00:05:41.800> some<00:05:42.130> people<00:05:42.370> say<00:05:42.550> to

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
them down with fans some people say to

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.610 
them down with fans some people say to
stick<00:05:42.970> stick<00:05:43.390> them<00:05:43.510> in<00:05:43.570> a<00:05:43.630> bucket<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:44.020> water<00:05:44.080> I

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
stick stick them in a bucket of water I

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.640 
stick stick them in a bucket of water I
think<00:05:45.400> it<00:05:45.670> shocks<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.090> acrylic<00:05:46.540> too<00:05:46.690> quick

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
think it shocks the acrylic too quick

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.390 
think it shocks the acrylic too quick
I<00:05:47.680> think<00:05:48.280> air<00:05:48.460> cooling<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:50.800> know<00:05:50.920> the<00:05:51.160> part

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
I think air cooling you know the part

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.720 
I think air cooling you know the part
down<00:05:51.670> is<00:05:51.970> going<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:52.840> be<00:05:52.960> best<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:56.430> like<00:05:57.430> I<00:05:57.520> said

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
down is going to be best and like I said

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.600 
down is going to be best and like I said
I<00:05:57.760> would<00:05:57.940> bring<00:05:58.030> a<00:05:58.180> fan<00:05:58.390> in<00:05:58.600> here<00:05:58.900> but<00:05:59.740> I<00:06:00.130> really

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
I would bring a fan in here but I really

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.950 
I would bring a fan in here but I really
don't<00:06:00.730> want<00:06:00.850> to<00:06:00.910> have<00:06:01.030> all<00:06:01.180> that<00:06:01.330> noise<00:06:01.540> to

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
don't want to have all that noise to

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.680 
don't want to have all that noise to
really<00:06:02.410> cool<00:06:02.620> this<00:06:02.740> part<00:06:02.980> down<00:06:03.390> so<00:06:04.390> as<00:06:04.480> you<00:06:04.570> can

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
really cool this part down so as you can

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.680 
really cool this part down so as you can
see<00:06:04.830> this<00:06:05.830> size<00:06:06.070> real<00:06:06.370> rigid<00:06:06.580> still<00:06:07.030> this

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
see this size real rigid still this

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.110 
see this size real rigid still this
sides<00:06:08.020> becoming<00:06:08.500> rigid<00:06:08.800> and<00:06:09.160> that's<00:06:09.700> almost<00:06:09.970> a

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
sides becoming rigid and that's almost a

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.410 
sides becoming rigid and that's almost a
perfect<00:06:11.010> you<00:06:12.010> know<00:06:12.100> angle<00:06:12.550> if<00:06:13.090> I<00:06:13.150> want<00:06:13.330> to

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.420 
perfect you know angle if I want to

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.420 
perfect you know angle if I want to
adjust<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.900> just<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.200> tiny<00:06:14.440> bit<00:06:14.710> I<00:06:14.770> can<00:06:14.920> and

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
adjust the just a tiny bit I can and

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.700 
adjust the just a tiny bit I can and
hold<00:06:15.970> it<00:06:16.150> so<00:06:16.420> I<00:06:16.450> can<00:06:16.660> get<00:06:16.810> my<00:06:16.960> perfect<00:06:17.350> angle

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
hold it so I can get my perfect angle

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.740 
hold it so I can get my perfect angle
again<00:06:18.520> this<00:06:18.730> isn't<00:06:19.000> going<00:06:19.090> to<00:06:19.150> be<00:06:19.210> perfect

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
again this isn't going to be perfect

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.090 
again this isn't going to be perfect
this<00:06:19.900> is<00:06:20.110> just<00:06:20.320> kind<00:06:20.530> of<00:06:20.560> for<00:06:20.770> an<00:06:20.860> illustration

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
this is just kind of for an illustration

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.430 
this is just kind of for an illustration
to<00:06:21.460> show<00:06:21.640> you<00:06:21.700> guys<00:06:21.880> how<00:06:22.140> you<00:06:23.140> know<00:06:23.260> we're

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440

to show you guys how you know we're
getting<00:06:23.620> these<00:06:23.740> cool<00:06:23.950> little<00:06:23.980> bends<00:06:24.430> on<00:06:24.550> here

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
getting these cool little bends on here

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.630 
getting these cool little bends on here
so<00:06:25.780> once<00:06:26.260> it<00:06:26.380> gets<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.620> a<00:06:26.740> point<00:06:26.770> of<00:06:27.190> cooling

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
so once it gets to a point of cooling

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.970 
so once it gets to a point of cooling
you<00:06:28.330> know<00:06:28.480> you<00:06:28.990> could<00:06:29.140> also<00:06:29.290> tack<00:06:29.680> this<00:06:29.920> down

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
you know you could also tack this down

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.940 
you know you could also tack this down
here<00:06:30.610> if<00:06:30.700> you<00:06:30.760> wanted<00:06:31.090> to<00:06:31.300> to<00:06:32.200> hold<00:06:32.410> that<00:06:32.560> sharp

here if you wanted to to hold that sharp

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:39.000 
here if you wanted to to hold that sharp
radius<00:06:34.080> until<00:06:35.550> it<00:06:36.550> completely<00:06:36.880> cools<00:06:37.530> but<00:06:38.530> for

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
radius until it completely cools but for

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.560 
radius until it completely cools but for
you<00:06:39.220> know<00:06:39.340> the<00:06:39.460> purpose<00:06:39.760> of<00:06:39.880> this<00:06:39.940> video<00:06:40.300> we're

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
is it's not going to stick the heat from

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.100 
is it's not going to stick the heat from
it<00:06:54.160> you<00:06:54.850> know<00:06:54.970> it's<00:06:55.150> not<00:06:55.270> going<00:06:55.480> to<00:06:55.600> dismember
