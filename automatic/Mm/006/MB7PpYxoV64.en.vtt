 It was difficult to cooperate with the medical staff in the treatment process in a state of sudden discomfort in an accident. 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.160
 It was because you saw your pants. 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.850

 She refused to help out of free and showed harsh behavior 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.740
 However, nurses recognize the patient's emotional state 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:52.900
 We did our best to provide rainfall that suits the characteristics of the patient. 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:55.540
 In order to provide accurate nursing to the characteristics of Westerners , 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.920
 We searched and collected information 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:04.450
 Use picture charts and educational materials to overcome obstacles to communication.

 I ridiculed the knowledge of the book in practice . 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:25.950
 By solving the patient's physical and emotional problems one by one 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.950
 Nursing was truly a science, and once again Jesus was able to realize Jesus
