00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
okay here's where we drained the water

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.950

goes<00:00:07.259> out<00:00:07.500> there<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:08.610> think<00:00:10.910> what<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.000> almost

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
goes out there you think what is almost

drained<00:00:12.679> turn<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.740> machine<00:00:14.040> on<00:00:14.190> put<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.269> a

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
drained turn the machine on put it on a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.580 
drained turn the machine on put it on a
wash<00:00:17.029> and<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.300> goes<00:00:18.449> into<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.990> spin

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
wash and there it goes into a spin

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.220 
wash and there it goes into a spin
when<00:00:21.100> all<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.400> very<00:00:21.700> slow<00:00:22.000> spins<00:00:22.390> itself

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:41.020 

that's<00:00:28.230> how<00:00:28.380> long<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:29.029> sliding<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.930 

and<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.960> fill<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> rest<00:00:46.730> number<00:00:47.730> now

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
and then we fill for the rest number now

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.770 
and then we fill for the rest number now

I<00:00:48.810> have<00:00:49.740> no<00:00:49.920> watch<00:00:50.160> my<00:00:50.490> little<00:00:50.790> cup<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
I have no watch my little cup so in the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.280 
I have no watch my little cup so in the
R<00:00:55.770> inside<00:00:56.070> my<00:00:56.340> ps2<00:00:56.700> resistor<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.200> a

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
R inside my ps2 resistor which is just a

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.670 
R inside my ps2 resistor which is just a
little<00:00:58.500> bit<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:59.570> hair<00:01:00.570> conditioner<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
little bit of hair conditioner in a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.670 
little bit of hair conditioner in a
little<00:01:01.860> cap<00:01:02.570> just<00:01:03.570> tip<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.050> loops<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.500> in

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
little cap just tip that loops right in

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.780 
little cap just tip that loops right in
there<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:06.080> gets<00:01:07.080> added<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.400> again

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
there and it gets added and like again

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.390 
there and it gets added and like again
the<00:01:12.119> water<00:01:12.300> goes<00:01:12.600> everywhere<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the water goes everywhere but in the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.790 
the water goes everywhere but in the
drawer<00:01:20.119> now<00:01:21.119> you'll<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.420> super<00:01:21.900> high<00:01:22.050> logic

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
drawer now you'll get super high logic

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.790 
drawer now you'll get super high logic
water<00:01:23.010> level<00:01:23.310> where<00:01:27.080> we<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.260> let<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.530> turn

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
water level where we just let it turn

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.210 
water level where we just let it turn
just<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.880> mix<00:01:30.300> it<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.690> little<00:01:30.930> bit

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.230 

to<00:01:36.220> again

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.140 

sure<00:01:40.970> stop<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> down<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.570> onto<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.900> reverse

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
sure stop it down go onto the reverse

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.340 
sure stop it down go onto the reverse
tumbles<00:01:45.150> I'm<00:01:45.270> looking<00:01:45.510> for<00:01:45.690> my<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:45.960> crank

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
tumbles I'm looking for my little crank

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.510 
tumbles I'm looking for my little crank
notice<00:01:48.500> sorry<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:49.890> very<00:01:50.130> amateur

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
video be a fuckup on the ball there it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:17.800 
video be a fuckup on the ball there it
is<00:01:55.460> move<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.759> some<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.060> those<00:01:57.180> tunnels

great fun and now for the spin dryer

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.350 
great fun and now for the spin dryer
which<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> special<00:02:21.900> one<00:02:22.050> so
