the<00:00:03.090> number<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.629> new<00:00:03.899> stores<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.890> coffee

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
the number of new stores in a coffee

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.509 
the number of new stores in a coffee
shop<00:00:05.339> chain<00:00:05.580> that<00:00:06.000> opened<00:00:06.450> during<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:07.170> years

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
shop chain that opened during the years

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.820 
shop chain that opened during the years
1986<00:00:08.519> through<00:00:09.200> 1994<00:00:11.750> using<00:00:12.750> x<00:00:12.990> equals<00:00:13.469> 1<00:00:13.650> to

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
1986 through 1994 using x equals 1 to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.530 
1986 through 1994 using x equals 1 to
represent<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.400> year<00:00:14.610> nineteen<00:00:14.820> eighty-six

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
represent the year nineteen eighty-six

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.810 
represent the year nineteen eighty-six
and<00:00:15.929> why<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> represent<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> number<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.670> new

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
and why to represent the number of new

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.700 
and why to represent the number of new
stores<00:00:18.180> write<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> exponential<00:00:19.170> regression

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
stores write the exponential regression

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.700 
stores write the exponential regression
equation<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.850> data<00:00:21.119> around<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.199> values

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
equation for this data around all values

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.990 
equation for this data around all values
to<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.920> nearest<00:00:23.250> thousandth<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.880> what<00:00:26.880> we're

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
to the nearest thousandth so what we're

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.779 
to the nearest thousandth so what we're
going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.390> first<00:00:27.439> is<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:29.039> say<00:00:29.220> use<00:00:29.490> X

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
going to do first is they say use X

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.600 
going to do first is they say use X
equal<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.359> represent<00:00:30.800> 1986<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> just

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
equal one to represent 1986 so I just

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.069 
equal one to represent 1986 so I just
like<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.940> labeled<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.899> going

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
like the labeled is this this is going

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.660 
like the labeled is this this is going
to<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.230> 1<00:00:34.530> 2<00:00:35.010> 3<00:00:35.309> 4<00:00:36.559> 5<00:00:37.559> 6<00:00:38.000> 7<00:00:39.000> 8<00:00:39.420> 9<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.980> those<00:00:41.460> are

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and those are

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.610 
to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and those are
the<00:00:41.760> values<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.180> x<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.629> I'll<00:00:42.870> actually<00:00:43.170> plug

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the values of x that I'll actually plug

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.590 
the values of x that I'll actually plug
in<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.070> these<00:00:44.190> years<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.760> don't<00:00:44.789> use<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
in for these years so don't use the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.430 
in for these years so don't use the
actual<00:00:45.780> years<00:00:46.680> use<00:00:47.570> those<00:00:48.570> values<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
actual years use those values that I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.250 
actual years use those values that I
just<00:00:49.739> put<00:00:49.950> down<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.640> ex<00:00:53.809> now<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
just put down for your ex now in the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.689 
just put down for your ex now in the
second<00:00:55.620> column<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.489> be

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
second column this would kind of like be

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
second column this would kind of like be
our<00:00:56.820> Y<00:00:57.030> column<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.570> we're<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.440> use

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
our Y column and we're just going to use

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
our Y column and we're just going to use
those<00:00:58.739> manage<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.309> gave<00:00:59.489> us<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> want

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
those manage that they gave us so I want

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
those manage that they gave us so I want
to<00:01:00.870> erase<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.680> right<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> my

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
to erase this right here and go to my

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.780 
to erase this right here and go to my
calculator<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:05.270> if<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.390> hit<00:01:06.630> stat<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:08.640> would

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
calculator and if I hit stat and I would

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.370 
calculator and if I hit stat and I would
hit<00:01:08.939> enter<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.570> edit<00:01:09.900> my<00:01:10.080> list<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:12.119> you'll<00:01:13.110> see

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
hit enter to edit my list and you'll see

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.350 
hit enter to edit my list and you'll see
because<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.250> wanted<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> save<00:01:14.850> time<00:01:15.119> I've

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
because I wanted to save time I've

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.469 
because I wanted to save time I've
already<00:01:15.600> plugged<00:01:15.930> these<00:01:16.170> values<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.479> 1986

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
already plugged these values in for 1986

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.620 
already plugged these values in for 1986
I<00:01:18.810> used<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.150> value

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I used one and you can see the value

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.039 
I used one and you can see the value
that<00:01:21.659> corresponds<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.700> 1427<00:01:24.049> 4880

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that corresponds with it is 1427 4880

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
that corresponds with it is 1427 4880
and<00:01:25.500> i<00:01:25.560> did<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> values<00:01:26.490> i<00:01:26.580> plug<00:01:26.790> mullen

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and i did all the values i plug mullen

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.920 
and i did all the values i plug mullen
down<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.290> column<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.280> well<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.659> one

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
down this column as well as the one

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.800 
down this column as well as the one
through<00:01:31.259> nine<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.979> column<00:01:32.540> now<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> get

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
through nine in this column now to get

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.429 
through nine in this column now to get
the<00:01:33.990> exponential<00:01:34.829> regression<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:36.290> would<00:01:37.290> hit

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the exponential regression I would hit

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.410 
the exponential regression I would hit
stat<00:01:38.360> go<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> calc<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.610> arrow<00:01:41.820> down<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
stat go to calc and you can arrow down a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.010 
stat go to calc and you can arrow down a
little<00:01:42.780> bit<00:01:43.049> until<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.619> find<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.270> exponential

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
little bit until we find the exponential

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.350 
little bit until we find the exponential
regression<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.399> tenth<00:01:47.700> choice<00:01:48.060> or

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
regression and it's the tenth choice or

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510 
regression and it's the tenth choice or
the<00:01:48.479> zero<00:01:48.750> choice<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.399> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the zero choice so I'm going to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
the zero choice so I'm going to
highlight<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.090> hit<00:01:51.329> enter<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.799> I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
highlight that hit enter and then I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.789 
highlight that hit enter and then I
always<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.399> make<00:01:53.640> sure<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.200> type<00:01:55.560> in

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
always like to make sure that I type in

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.709 
always like to make sure that I type in
the<00:01:55.950> right<00:01:56.130> columns<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.880> used<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.360> my<00:01:57.390> list

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the right columns that I used in my list

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.740 
the right columns that I used in my list
so<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.350> al<00:01:58.530> 1<00:01:58.770> comma<00:02:00.770> L<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.210> hit<00:02:03.210> enter<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
so it's al 1 comma L to hit enter and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.350 
so it's al 1 comma L to hit enter and
then<00:02:04.549> I'm<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.759> use<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.119> information

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
then I'm going to use this information

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.250 
then I'm going to use this information
to<00:02:07.110> write<00:02:07.890> down<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.369> equation<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.940> i<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.690> y

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
to write down my equation so i have y

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.550 
to write down my equation so i have y
equals

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
equals

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.650

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
would be a times B to the X and my a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.860 
would be a times B to the X and my a
value<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.650> they<00:02:22.040> said<00:02:22.340> round<00:02:22.670> all<00:02:23.030> values<00:02:23.660> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
value and they said round all values to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.500 
value and they said round all values to
the<00:02:23.900> nearest<00:02:24.370> leave<00:02:25.370> us<00:02:25.520> at<00:02:25.700> thousand<00:02:26.210> I<00:02:26.270> can't

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
the nearest leave us at thousand I can't

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.050 
the nearest leave us at thousand I can't
move<00:02:26.630> my<00:02:26.690> calculator<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.340> round<00:02:28.580> these<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
move my calculator so to round these to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.260 
move my calculator so to round these to
the<00:02:29.180> nearest<00:02:29.420> thousand<00:02:30.100> this<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.340> value<00:02:32.060> would

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
the nearest thousand this a value would

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.430 
the nearest thousand this a value would
be<00:02:34.780> 10<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:37.220> five<00:02:37.750> or<00:02:38.750> actually<00:02:39.080> this

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
be 10 and this five or actually this

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.100 
be 10 and this five or actually this
nine<00:02:39.770> would<00:02:39.980> round<00:02:40.160> up<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:40.520> 5<00:02:40.730> 206<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:42.020> this

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
nine would round up that 5 206 so this

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:51.250 
nine would round up that 5 206 so this
would<00:02:42.200> be<00:02:42.850> 10.5<00:02:44.260> 96<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:46.610> then<00:02:47.120> my<00:02:47.840> B<00:02:48.140> value<00:02:50.260> is

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
would be 10.5 96 and then my B value is

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.420 
would be 10.5 96 and then my B value is
1.5<00:02:52.190> 86<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:54.050> too<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.680> not<00:02:55.190> going<00:02:55.370> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
1.5 86 and that too is not going to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.620 
1.5 86 and that too is not going to
change<00:02:55.490> that<00:02:55.820> six<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:56.360> it's<00:02:56.480> going<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.630> be<00:02:57.040> 1.5

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
change that six so it's going to be 1.5

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.540 
change that six so it's going to be 1.5
86<00:02:59.630> and<00:03:00.190> put<00:03:01.190> your<00:03:01.460> acts<00:03:01.640> up<00:03:01.880> there<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:03.550> then

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
86 and put your acts up there and then

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:12.460 
86 and put your acts up there and then
they<00:03:04.850> said<00:03:07.570> let's<00:03:08.570> see<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:10.990> guess<00:03:11.990> that's<00:03:12.320> all

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
they said let's see I guess that's all

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.050 
they said let's see I guess that's all
they<00:03:12.590> want<00:03:12.800> us<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.070> do<00:03:13.190> was<00:03:13.370> find<00:03:13.610> an<00:03:13.760> equation

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
they want us to do was find an equation

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.940 
they want us to do was find an equation
so<00:03:14.690> there's<00:03:14.900> your<00:03:14.990> equation<00:03:15.560> that's<00:03:15.680> your

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
so there's your equation that's your

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.070 
so there's your equation that's your
answer
