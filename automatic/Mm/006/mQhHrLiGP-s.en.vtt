00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
yellow is not wide enough so it's not

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.359

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.920 
bright enough so I would like to add a
little<00:00:32.399> bit<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.890> white<00:00:34.890> color<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:36.210> with

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
little bit of this white color go with

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.130 
little bit of this white color go with
yellow<00:00:37.530> color<00:00:37.890> anyway<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.390> yellow<00:00:39.840> color

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
yellow color anyway the yellow color

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.200 
yellow color anyway the yellow color
itself<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.160> already<00:00:42.120> opac<00:00:43.110> non-transparent

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
itself is already opac non-transparent

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.479 
itself is already opac non-transparent
even<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.870> light<00:00:46.260> color<00:00:46.739> white

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
even this kind of light color white

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.319 
even this kind of light color white
color<00:00:48.230> yellow<00:00:49.230> color<00:00:49.680> light<00:00:50.039> green<00:00:50.460> color<00:00:50.730> all

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
color yellow color light green color all

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.310 
color yellow color light green color all
of<00:00:51.840> them<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.199> non<00:00:53.100> transparent<00:00:53.730> opaque<00:00:54.719> color

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
of them are non transparent opaque color

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.180 
of them are non transparent opaque color
so<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:57.230> difference<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.590> Chinese

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190

minerals<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.510> mineral<00:01:13.110> grind<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
minerals it's the mineral grind the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
minerals it's the mineral grind the
mineral<00:01:14.430> different<00:01:14.880> color<00:01:15.180> stone<00:01:15.689> grinding

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
mineral different color stone grinding

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.789 
mineral different color stone grinding
the<00:01:16.860> color<00:01:17.130> stone<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.630> put<00:01:18.960> soaked<00:01:19.560> into

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the color stone and the put soaked into

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.940 
the color stone and the put soaked into
water<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> solution<00:01:21.950> so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
water and then there is a solution so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.590 
water and then there is a solution so
the<00:01:23.130> first<00:01:24.259> filter<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> color<00:01:26.220> is

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
the first filter of the color is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
the first filter of the color is
something<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.750> first<00:01:28.229> blue<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.520> first

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
something like first blue you have first

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.840 
something like first blue you have first
green<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.780> most<00:01:31.500> condensed<00:01:32.250> color<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
green is the most condensed color and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
green is the most condensed color and
then<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.259> use<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.340> second<00:01:35.820> future<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.020> called

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
then the use the second future is called

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.700 
then the use the second future is called
a<00:01:37.740> second<00:01:38.220> blue<00:01:38.700> second<00:01:39.450> green<00:01:39.810> something

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
a second blue second green something

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.780 
a second blue second green something
like<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.130> answered<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:43.649> color<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.040> from
