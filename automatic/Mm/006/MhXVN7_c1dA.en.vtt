board<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.520> boat<00:00:28.670> take<00:00:29.539> place<00:00:29.750> pretty<00:00:29.990> much

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
board the boat take place pretty much

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.740 
board the boat take place pretty much
right<00:00:30.410> here<00:00:30.910> my<00:00:31.910> boat's<00:00:32.119> quite<00:00:32.329> special<00:00:32.689> in

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
right here my boat's quite special in

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.090 
right here my boat's quite special in
the<00:00:32.840> fact<00:00:33.020> that<00:00:33.050> it's<00:00:33.230> got<00:00:33.260> two<00:00:33.649> tillers

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
the fact that it's got two tillers

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.580 
the fact that it's got two tillers
obviously<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.090> tillers<00:00:35.390> are<00:00:35.989> there<00:00:36.199> to<00:00:36.350> steer

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
obviously the tillers are there to steer

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.069 
obviously the tillers are there to steer
the<00:00:36.710> boat<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.100> they're<00:00:37.789> both<00:00:37.909> connected<00:00:38.179> to

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
the boat and they're both connected to

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.680 
the boat and they're both connected to
each<00:00:39.440> other<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.969> reason<00:00:41.210> we<00:00:41.300> have<00:00:41.449> to

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
each other and the reason we have to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.719 
each other and the reason we have to
it's<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.079> that<00:00:42.230> when<00:00:42.409> I<00:00:42.530> when<00:00:43.370> I'm<00:00:43.460> steering

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:43.729 
it's so that when I when I'm steering

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.389 
it's so that when I when I'm steering
the<00:00:43.879> boat<00:00:43.909> at<00:00:44.179> sea<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:44.739> sit<00:00:45.739> on<00:00:45.859> the<00:00:45.949> high<00:00:46.100> side

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
the boat at sea I sit on the high side

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.489 
the boat at sea I sit on the high side
and<00:00:46.729> the<00:00:47.030> tiller<00:00:47.269> is<00:00:47.539> brightly<00:00:47.929> in<00:00:48.140> my<00:00:48.260> hand

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499 
and the tiller is brightly in my hand

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.169 
and the tiller is brightly in my hand
where<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:48.739> needs<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:49.069> be<00:00:49.159> and<00:00:49.699> I<00:00:49.789> have<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:49.969> very

have is a little cuttie area here and
when<00:01:01.699> we<00:01:01.789> built<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.089> boat<00:01:02.299> we<00:01:02.479> we<00:01:02.749> had<00:01:02.929> this

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
when we built the boat we we had this

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.620 
when we built the boat we we had this
fitted<00:01:03.820> specifically<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:04.970> that<00:01:05.000> i<00:01:05.120> can<00:01:05.239> sit

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
fitted specifically so that i can sit

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.890 
fitted specifically so that i can sit
underneath<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.940> take<00:01:08.240> shelter<00:01:08.270> from<00:01:08.720> the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
underneath and take shelter from the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.510 
underneath and take shelter from the
elements<00:01:08.990> when<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.560> need<00:01:09.829> to<00:01:09.979> be<00:01:10.100> on<00:01:10.219> deck

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
elements when I need to be on deck

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.520 
elements when I need to be on deck
there's<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.479> lot<00:01:11.689> of<00:01:11.719> times<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.200> this<00:01:12.320> race

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
there's a lot of times in this race

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.800 
there's a lot of times in this race
where<00:01:12.799> it's<00:01:13.399> so<00:01:13.670> rough<00:01:13.969> that<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.270> need<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.600> be<00:01:14.689> on

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
where it's so rough that I need to be on

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.679 
where it's so rough that I need to be on
deck<00:01:15.049> to<00:01:15.289> take<00:01:15.829> charge<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.340> boat<00:01:16.549> but<00:01:17.119> at

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
deck to take charge of the boat but at

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.120 
deck to take charge of the boat but at
the<00:01:17.869> same<00:01:18.079> time<00:01:18.229> I<00:01:18.289> need<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> bit<00:01:18.799> of<00:01:18.829> shelter

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
the same time I need a bit of shelter

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.880 
the same time I need a bit of shelter
just<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:19.759> keep<00:01:20.719> out<00:01:20.930> of<00:01:21.079> the<00:01:21.170> elements<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:21.710> this

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
just to keep out of the elements so this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.740 
just to keep out of the elements so this
is<00:01:22.039> why<00:01:22.189> we<00:01:22.340> built<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.359> as<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.600> can<00:01:23.719> see

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
is why we built this and as you can see

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.889 
is why we built this and as you can see
it's<00:01:24.020> perfect<00:01:24.500> for<00:01:24.560> my<00:01:24.799> size<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:26.299> spend<00:01:26.600> up

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
it's perfect for my size and I spend up

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.899 
it's perfect for my size and I spend up
to<00:01:26.960> sort<00:01:27.409> of<00:01:27.469> half<00:01:27.680> an<00:01:27.799> hour<00:01:27.920> at<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.130> time<00:01:28.159> or

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
to sort of half an hour at a time or

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.300 
to sort of half an hour at a time or
even<00:01:29.000> an<00:01:29.210> hour<00:01:29.359> just<00:01:29.840> lying<00:01:30.079> here<00:01:30.310> and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
even an hour just lying here and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.090 
even an hour just lying here and
sleeping<00:01:31.850> actually<00:01:32.409> rather<00:01:33.409> than<00:01:33.680> going<00:01:33.859> down

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
sleeping actually rather than going down

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.459 
sleeping actually rather than going down
below<00:01:34.399> so<00:01:34.670> if<00:01:34.700> anything<00:01:35.000> happens<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.659> can<00:01:36.350> get

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469

as well or anybody in D when I'm out at

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.240 
as well or anybody in D when I'm out at
sea<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:27.380> helps<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.740> convey<00:02:28.040> what's

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
sea and that helps to convey what's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.729 
sea and that helps to convey what's
going<00:02:28.520> on<00:02:28.640> here<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.209> boat<00:02:29.360> as<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.380> happens

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
going on here on the boat as it happens

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.070 
going on here on the boat as it happens
and<00:02:30.980> bring<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.489> into<00:02:31.700> your<00:02:31.940> home's<00:02:32.239> when<00:02:32.959> we

and bring it into your home's when we

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.260 
and bring it into your home's when we
were<00:02:33.140> rating<00:02:33.260> okay<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:34.310> one<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.819> essential

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
were rating okay so one of the essential

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.600 
were rating okay so one of the essential
parts<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:36.020> long-distance<00:02:36.709> ocean<00:02:37.220> racing

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
parts of long-distance ocean racing

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.530 
parts of long-distance ocean racing
especially<00:02:38.060> when<00:02:38.390> your<00:02:38.510> solo<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.220> eating<00:02:40.220> and

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
especially when your solo is eating and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.910 
especially when your solo is eating and
on<00:02:41.540> these<00:02:41.959> race<00:02:42.230> boats<00:02:42.440> we<00:02:42.590> have<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.739> lot<00:02:42.890> of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
on these race boats we have a lot of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.160 
on these race boats we have a lot of
freeze-dried<00:02:43.250> food<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.120> one<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.810> systems

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
freeze-dried food and one of the systems

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.020 
freeze-dried food and one of the systems
that<00:02:45.260> I've<00:02:45.680> got<00:02:45.860> on<00:02:45.950> board<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.340> quite<00:02:46.640> simple

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
that I've got on board is quite simple

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.880 
that I've got on board is quite simple
but<00:02:47.090> very<00:02:47.239> effective<00:02:47.450> I've<00:02:48.140> got<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.470> kettle

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
but very effective I've got a kettle

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.340 
but very effective I've got a kettle
welded<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.820> what<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.570> really<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.110> little

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
welded to what is really just a little

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.009 
welded to what is really just a little
Primus<00:02:51.709> stove<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.420> helps<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.810> boil

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
Primus stove and that helps to boil

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.590 
Primus stove and that helps to boil
water<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.650> add<00:02:55.280> into<00:02:55.670> my<00:02:55.790> freeze-dried<00:02:56.330> food

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
water to add into my freeze-dried food

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.740 
water to add into my freeze-dried food
and<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.709> can<00:02:57.950> have<00:02:58.100> good<00:02:58.730> quality<00:02:59.120> meals

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
and so I can have good quality meals

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.140 
and so I can have good quality meals
when<00:03:00.500> we're<00:03:00.620> on<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.800> go<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.580> everything<00:03:01.910> on

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
when we're on the go but everything on

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.550 
when we're on the go but everything on
board<00:03:02.239> has<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.600> be<00:03:02.690> simplistic<00:03:03.050> and

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
board has to be simplistic and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.710 
board has to be simplistic and
functional<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.700> we<00:03:04.880> don't<00:03:05.060> have<00:03:05.239> really<00:03:05.480> pots

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
functional so we don't have really pots

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.630 
functional so we don't have really pots
and<00:03:05.900> pans<00:03:06.110> or<00:03:06.319> anything<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:07.069> have<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.280> kettle

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
and pans or anything just have a kettle

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.110 
and pans or anything just have a kettle
that<00:03:07.790> boils<00:03:08.060> water<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:10.519> here<00:03:10.700> we<00:03:10.790> are<00:03:10.940> in<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
that boils water so here we are in the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.090 
that boils water so here we are in the
front<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.810> fujifilm<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.590> bow<00:03:12.769> of<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.010> boat

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
front of fujifilm in the bow of the boat

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.300 
front of fujifilm in the bow of the boat
and<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:14.450> section<00:03:14.870> here<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.140> really<00:03:15.709> all

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
and this section here is really all

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.060 
and this section here is really all
about<00:03:16.370> sale<00:03:16.970> stowage<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.380> racetrack<00:03:18.560> we

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
about sale stowage on the racetrack we

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.979 
about sale stowage on the racetrack we
have<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.430> change<00:03:19.880> sales<00:03:20.209> regularly<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
have to change sales regularly to

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.740 
have to change sales regularly to
increase<00:03:21.350> our<00:03:21.620> performance<00:03:22.329> all<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.570> time

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
increase our performance all the time

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.090 
increase our performance all the time
we're<00:03:23.989> thinking<00:03:24.290> about<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.620> speed<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.040> the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
we're thinking about the speed of the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.220 
we're thinking about the speed of the
boat<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.820> we<00:03:26.060> have<00:03:26.209> different<00:03:26.570> sales<00:03:26.840> to

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
boat and we have different sales to

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.080 
boat and we have different sales to
cater<00:03:27.470> for<00:03:27.769> different<00:03:28.130> scenarios<00:03:28.640> on<00:03:28.850> board

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
cater for different scenarios on board

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.370 
cater for different scenarios on board
different<00:03:29.540> weather<00:03:29.690> conditions<00:03:29.780> and

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
different weather conditions and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.710 
different weather conditions and
suchlike<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:31.549> is<00:03:31.700> where<00:03:31.850> we<00:03:31.970> store<00:03:32.239> them<00:03:32.450> and

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
suchlike this is where we store them and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.600 
suchlike this is where we store them and
I've<00:03:33.140> got<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.440> get<00:03:33.530> them<00:03:33.709> through<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:34.370> little

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
I've got to get them through that little

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.259 
I've got to get them through that little

pilots the reason there's a watertight

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.529 
pilots the reason there's a watertight
hatch<00:04:32.680> here<00:04:32.949> is<00:04:33.100> in<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.639> worst<00:04:33.850> case<00:04:34.090> scenario

started to sink for any reason this

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.010

gives us a clear access through through
the<00:04:44.139> boat<00:04:44.320> towards<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.039> back<00:04:45.220> area<00:04:45.669> which<00:04:46.389> is

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
the boat towards the back area which is

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.300 
the boat towards the back area which is
kind<00:04:46.810> of<00:04:46.930> like<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.110> little<00:04:47.260> survival<00:04:47.740> capsule

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
kind of like a little survival capsule

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.370

should<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.000> worst<00:04:49.210> happen<00:04:49.660> so<00:04:49.870> safety<00:04:50.349> is

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
should the worst happen so safety is
