it's pretty much the same as the other
one<00:00:04.890> except<00:00:05.279> for<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.490> fact<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.730> all<00:00:05.910> the

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060

down<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> little<00:00:09.420> bit<00:00:09.630> but<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.080> still<00:00:10.469> really

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
down a little bit but it's still really

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.089 
down a little bit but it's still really
fast<00:00:11.340> for<00:00:11.700> what<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.380> so<00:00:13.380> anyway<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.920> have

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099

three<00:00:40.140> cards<00:00:40.520> it's<00:00:41.520> really<00:00:41.760> hard<00:00:42.000> actually

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
three cards it's really hard actually

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.880 
three cards it's really hard actually
drawing<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.780> them<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.140> decided<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.620> another

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
drawing to them so I decided in another

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.590 
drawing to them so I decided in another
one<00:00:44.100> that's<00:00:44.340> pretty<00:00:44.610> good<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.000> his<00:00:45.090> effect<00:00:45.480> is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
one that's pretty good and his effect is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.330 
one that's pretty good and his effect is
okay<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.379> still<00:00:46.710> haven't<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.219> thought

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
okay but I still haven't really thought

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.920 
okay but I still haven't really thought
