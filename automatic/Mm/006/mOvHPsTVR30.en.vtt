00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.960
 Hi guys, I'm good, I'm going to make a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.730
 review on a cream that it is not 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.540
 draws much attention as the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.060
 consumer in relation to the full 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.680
 I when I buy some product always 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.260
 I see a product so finalizing is the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.900
 cream combing a little book I see 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.320
 always the texture of it because the wires 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.360
 end of my hair he always gave himself 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.860
 better with that product that is more 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.530
 concentrated but then I always saw this 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.170
 product at it in stores that cosmetic 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.600
 but the smell did not catch my eye 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.510
 price is good but because it is a product well 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.329
 cheap is not an easy product to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.820
 finding it was already in doubt and 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.800
 I decided to buy is the master on 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.530
 many curly girls who have already 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.170
 I've seen some videos here in the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.920
 youtube 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.189
 speaking of him I actually saw the rose 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.470
 talking but her hair type is the 4c 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.360
 that the kind of the case of my daughter and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.430
 It is also very good doing twist it. 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.310
 here in his composition he has been talking 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:33.000
 about the processes they r for three 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.079
 types of process, not only how to comb the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.810
 hair 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.780
 he says that on a daily basis he is used in 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.100
 day-to-day funny yarn strings 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:48.210
 facilitates styling and can rinse or 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.670
 not the hair after the shampoo talks at 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.329
 bath is a bath treatment 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.799
 I live in the bath that have the same function as 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.020
 hydrate and has the function of acting for ten 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.659
 minutes to 20 minutes with the hot towel 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.880
 and speaks also in the bath of sea or swimming pool 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.580
 which protects from the sun and chlorine 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.590
 I'm not the first time I have 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.550
 used I soon bought two 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.790
 which I use a lot of combing cream there 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.680
 Unfortunately, Ireland has managed to reduce 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:31.900
 a texture very well the line o eu 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:36.520
 put dating already trickled right is not me 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.830
 I used it in my hair without I washed it. 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.810
 hydration in the non- rabbit bath made a 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.260
 hydration with my hydration that I 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:51.930
 I'll do three minutes, then I'll go. 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:54.790
 show you and I ended up with him only 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.300
 which is the following you have to leave the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.000
 hair not too dry nor too wet 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.750
 it is an acid but Prass and when you have to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.730
 wet the why you put it in the hair 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.910
 without the kind of your hair was mine 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.270
 Look when you put it in his hair. 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.060
 creating a foam will know what is 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.300
 doing the will it creates a foam and 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.780
 he does not reduce the volume he gets it already 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.420
 leaves its volume and not set logo 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.920
 immediately curls when he goes 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:35.050
 surrounding are some places like this. 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:39.010
 hair like here in the middle in the hair is 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.820
 another type is 3 and it's 3d my he stays 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.480
 more dry and I have to go over 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.000
 after drying to be able to stay 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.050
 with others in the rest of the 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.870
 wires 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.740
 so I recommend you use with the 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.370
 dry hair without my got super 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.440
 defined people I did a hydration 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.709
 very fast was three minutes even in the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.390
 Minutes A maximum of three moisturizing and 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.180
 used and maceiÃ³ 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.209
 I did not need to use it with my eye. 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.450
 it's pure that I used and he left my 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.250
 hair a volume without me needing it 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.160
 it's going 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.710
 I used a hair here, I did not even move 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.310
 just as I do with others to 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.840
 to be able to give a volume he leaves my hair 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.460
 bulky 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.390
 For those who do not like volume, I do not 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.900
 I recommend 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.480
 he leaves my hair bulky and 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.180
 define who has the type of hair and to 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.810
 who's 46 is what my hair is 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.850
 daughter in the air, what I used does not 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.990
 Today it's just that I did not do it ishii 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.940
 Pan 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.630
 but whoever has it can be has to be 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:57.150
 politician is very shabby he does not define 14 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:59.610
 yes but it looks bright 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.940
 no it looks like moisturizing hair 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.400
 and that smell of it that is not 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.990
 a smell very much attached to the 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:14.300
 I smell like it does not have that smell 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:17.490
 is that you do not have to use a 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.140
 mercedes a perfume that sometimes I do not 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.270
 I finish my hair, I do not need it 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.780
 perfume that my hair already says everything already me 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.250
 leaves super smelling it you you o 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.060
 smell is very light 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.810
 It's one more hint of cream. 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.150
 I recommend it and if you have any 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.300
 doubt about the cream who has type 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.080
 my hair or even anyone who wants to make a 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:48.030
 review about it about the type of hair 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:50.660
 Make me listen, I recommend that kiss to you.
