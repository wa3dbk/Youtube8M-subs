hi<00:00:00.390> I'm<00:00:00.450> Eddie<00:00:00.750> Leal<00:00:01.079> and<00:00:01.290> we're<00:00:01.410> going<00:00:01.530> to

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
hi I'm Eddie Leal and we're going to

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.470 
hi I'm Eddie Leal and we're going to
continue<00:00:01.800> on<00:00:02.310> with<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.760> fermentation

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
continue on with the fermentation

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.740 
continue on with the fermentation
process<00:00:04.100> once<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.370> add<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.700> yeast<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.480> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
process once we add the yeast to the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.560 
process once we add the yeast to the
ward<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.410> fermentation<00:00:08.099> tank<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:09.269> yeast

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
ward in the fermentation tank the yeast

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.419 
ward in the fermentation tank the yeast
begins<00:00:10.110> feeding<00:00:10.559> off<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:10.980> sugars

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
begins feeding off of the sugars

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.169 
begins feeding off of the sugars
creating<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> alcohol<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.809> co2<00:00:12.990> content

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
creating the alcohol and co2 content

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.550 
creating the alcohol and co2 content
basically<00:00:15.179> what<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.049> primary

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
basically what this is it's the primary

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.710 
basically what this is it's the primary
fermentation<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.940> basically<00:00:18.210> takes

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
fermentation this basically takes

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.550 
fermentation this basically takes
between<00:00:19.100> four<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.130> seven<00:00:20.789> days<00:00:21.350> depending<00:00:22.350> on

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
between four to seven days depending on

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.099 
between four to seven days depending on
the<00:00:22.859> beer<00:00:23.340> style<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.939> you're<00:00:24.119> brewing<00:00:24.390> what

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the beer style that you're brewing what

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.460 
the beer style that you're brewing what
we<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.689> pump<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.869> wort<00:00:28.140> into

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
we do here is that we pump the wort into

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.070 
we do here is that we pump the wort into
our<00:00:28.890> fermentation<00:00:29.279> tank<00:00:30.029> basically<00:00:30.929> we're

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
our fermentation tank basically we're

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840 
our fermentation tank basically we're
pumping<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> wort<00:00:31.740> from<00:00:31.920> our<00:00:32.189> brew<00:00:32.430> kettle

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
pumping the wort from our brew kettle

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.299 
pumping the wort from our brew kettle
and<00:00:33.000> tour<00:00:33.300> fermenter<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.770> while<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.160> do

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
and tour fermenter and then while we do

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.900 
and tour fermenter and then while we do
that<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.790> cool<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.329> wort<00:00:36.570> down<00:00:37.190> now<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.640> ward

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that we cool the wort down now the ward

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
that we cool the wort down now the ward
is<00:00:39.120> approximately<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:39.870> 200<00:00:40.379> degrees<00:00:40.410> when

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
is approximately about 200 degrees when

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.440 
is approximately about 200 degrees when
we're<00:00:41.040> bringing<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> from<00:00:41.700> our<00:00:41.850> brew<00:00:42.059> kettle

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
we're bringing it from our brew kettle

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
we're bringing it from our brew kettle
so<00:00:43.050> what<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:44.040> bring<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> down<00:00:44.670> we

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
so what we do is we bring it down we

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.729 
so what we do is we bring it down we
pull<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.480> down<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:46.170> our<00:00:46.410> fermentation

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
pull it down to our fermentation

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.709 
pull it down to our fermentation
temperature<00:00:48.530> we<00:00:49.530> mainly<00:00:50.070> make<00:00:50.460> ales<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.449> so

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
temperature we mainly make ales here so

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.369 
temperature we mainly make ales here so
I<00:00:51.750> ferment<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.440> 68<00:00:53.309> degrees<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> basically

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
I ferment at 68 degrees so basically

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.319 
I ferment at 68 degrees so basically
when<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.800> cool<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.250> wart<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:57.059> pull<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
when we cool that wart down we pull it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.439 
when we cool that wart down we pull it
down<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.690> 68<00:00:58.109> degrees<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.120> we<00:01:00.120> fill<00:01:00.420> our

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
down to 68 degrees and we fill our

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.260 
down to 68 degrees and we fill our
fermentation<00:01:00.899> tank<00:01:02.210> at<00:01:03.210> 68<00:01:04.110> degrees<00:01:05.270> during

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
fermentation tank at 68 degrees during

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.230 
fermentation tank at 68 degrees during
that<00:01:06.510> time<00:01:06.750> period<00:01:07.070> we<00:01:08.070> keep<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.729> 68

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that time period we keep it at 68

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.850 
that time period we keep it at 68
degrees<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> temperature

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
degrees here this is a temperature

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
degrees here this is a temperature
control<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.540> keep<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
control and this will keep it at that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.210 
control and this will keep it at that
from<00:01:13.770> fermentation<00:01:14.640> temperature<00:01:16.220> after

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
from fermentation temperature after

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.030 
from fermentation temperature after
those<00:01:17.400> four<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.790> seven<00:01:18.210> days<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:19.740> primary

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
those four to seven days the primary

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.250 
those four to seven days the primary
fermentation<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.570> beer<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.439> sit<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
fermentation the beer will sit in the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.910 
fermentation the beer will sit in the
tank<00:01:23.530> from<00:01:24.310> one<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.970> two<00:01:25.210> weeks<00:01:25.770> depending<00:01:26.770> on

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
tank from one to two weeks depending on

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.910 
tank from one to two weeks depending on
the<00:01:27.070> beer<00:01:27.480> even<00:01:28.480> longer<00:01:28.720> longer<00:01:29.290> if<00:01:29.620> it's<00:01:29.800> a

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
the beer even longer longer if it's a

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.760 
the beer even longer longer if it's a
logger<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:31.210> stronger<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.750> is<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.590> more

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
logger and the stronger it is the more

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.760 
logger and the stronger it is the more
alcohol<00:01:33.310> is<00:01:33.520> present<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:34.470> they'll<00:01:35.470> take

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
alcohol is present so they'll take

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.370 
alcohol is present so they'll take
longer<00:01:36.010> for<00:01:36.160> it<00:01:36.370> to<00:01:36.870> sit<00:01:37.870> in<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.140> tank

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
longer for it to sit in the tank

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.640 
longer for it to sit in the tank
basically<00:01:38.920> wow<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:40.420> time<00:01:40.870> period<00:01:41.200> what's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
basically wow that time period what's

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.830 
basically wow that time period what's
happening<00:01:42.160> is<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.370> beers<00:01:42.640> aging<00:01:43.270> inside<00:01:43.630> the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
happening is the beers aging inside the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.980 
happening is the beers aging inside the
tent<00:01:44.110> where<00:01:45.070> all<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.760> flavors<00:01:46.330> are<00:01:46.360> starting

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
tent where all the flavors are starting

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.590 
tent where all the flavors are starting
to<00:01:47.020> balance<00:01:47.470> out<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.190> takes<00:01:48.370> about<00:01:48.600> another

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
to balance out so it takes about another

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.440 
to balance out so it takes about another
one<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.590> two<00:01:50.800> weeks<00:01:50.830> after<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.210> primary

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
one to two weeks after the primary

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.860 
one to two weeks after the primary
fermentation<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.880> beer<00:01:55.120> to<00:01:55.270> balance<00:01:55.660> out

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
fermentation for the beer to balance out

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.580 
fermentation for the beer to balance out
and<00:01:56.260> age<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.540> was<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.720> logger<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.470> would

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
and age and if it was a logger it would

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.490 
and age and if it was a logger it would
even<00:01:59.860> be<00:01:59.890> longer
