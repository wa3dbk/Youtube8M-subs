00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
I I've seen at least one auto art

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.960 
I I've seen at least one auto art
version<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.169> this<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:35.519> really<00:03:35.730> wasn't

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
version of this and there really wasn't

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.550 
version of this and there really wasn't
that<00:03:36.090> much<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.449> a<00:03:36.510> difference<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.930> cause<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
that much of a difference to cause the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.920 
that much of a difference to cause the
huge<00:03:38.269> price<00:03:39.269> gap<00:03:39.629> in<00:03:39.870> between<00:03:39.959> them<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.760> I

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
huge price gap in between them so I

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.869 
huge price gap in between them so I

actually<00:03:46.440> do<00:03:46.829> like<00:03:47.010> mastis<00:03:47.579> for<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.940> price

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
actually do like mastis for the price

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.199 
actually do like mastis for the price
and<00:03:48.419> what<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.750> get<00:03:49.049> but<00:03:49.949> um<00:03:50.159> this<00:03:50.760> car<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.060> think

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
and what you get but um this car I think

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.020 
and what you get but um this car I think
it<00:03:51.629> compared<00:03:52.379> to<00:03:52.440> any<00:03:52.620> other<00:03:52.790> Dodge<00:03:53.790> Viper

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
it compared to any other Dodge Viper

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.030 
it compared to any other Dodge Viper
model<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.629> know<00:03:54.690> Hot<00:03:55.049> Wheels<00:03:55.260> had<00:03:55.470> one<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.680> they
