something that's even 300 times more

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.480 
something that's even 300 times more
potent<00:00:18.570> than<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.289> actual<00:00:19.650> fruiting<00:00:20.160> body<00:00:20.369> of

potent than the actual fruiting body of
reishi<00:00:20.820> mushroom<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.840> that's<00:00:21.960> exactly<00:00:22.320> what

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
reishi mushroom so that's exactly what

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.750 
reishi mushroom so that's exactly what
we're<00:00:22.800> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:22.980> talk<00:00:23.130> about<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.580> video

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
we're going to talk about in this video

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.359 
we're going to talk about in this video
something<00:00:24.689> which<00:00:25.199> I'm<00:00:25.380> very<00:00:25.590> excited<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.250> be

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
something which I'm very excited to be

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.650 
something which I'm very excited to be
able<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.609> share<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.119> now<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.420> something

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
able to share with you now and something

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540 
able to share with you now and something
I've<00:00:27.750> been<00:00:27.779> working<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.439> hard<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:29.369> bring

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
I've been working really hard to bring

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490 
I've been working really hard to bring
forward<00:00:29.910> over<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> last<00:00:30.929> couple<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.349> months

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
forward over the last couple of months

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.560 
forward over the last couple of months
so<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.550> see<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> reishi

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
so as you can see here I have a reishi

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.420 
so as you can see here I have a reishi
mushroom<00:00:34.200> fruiting<00:00:34.590> body<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:35.040> actually

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
mushroom fruiting body which actually

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.360 
mushroom fruiting body which actually
just<00:00:35.460> found<00:00:35.969> earlier<00:00:36.930> today<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.219> see

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
just found earlier today and you can see

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.729 
just found earlier today and you can see
what's<00:00:38.610> left<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.300> brown<00:00:39.629> dust<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.410> here

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
what's left of this brown dust on here

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.610 
what's left of this brown dust on here
and<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.540> called<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and this this is what is called the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.590 
and this this is what is called the
spore<00:00:44.010> operation<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.239> after

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
spore operation you can see after

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.410 
spore operation you can see after
rubbing<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.800> finger<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.340> turns<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.820> dark

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
rubbing on my finger it turns this dark

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.959 
rubbing on my finger it turns this dark
round<00:00:48.750> black<00:00:49.200> color<00:00:49.590> basically<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.910> is

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
round black color basically what this is

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.959 
round black color basically what this is
is<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> reproductive<00:00:52.079> essence<00:00:52.680> or<00:00:53.309> sperm

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
is the reproductive essence or sperm

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720 
is the reproductive essence or sperm
operation<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> what<00:00:56.010> happens<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> reishi

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
operation so what happens is the reishi

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.790 
operation so what happens is the reishi
grows<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> log<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.500> releases

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
grows on the log and then it releases

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
grows on the log and then it releases
this<00:00:59.129> brown<00:00:59.399> dust<00:00:59.699> into<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.149> air<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this brown dust into the air then that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.950 
this brown dust into the air then that
brown<00:01:01.410> dust<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:02.300> goes<00:01:03.300> throughout<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> air

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
brown dust then goes throughout the air

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
brown dust then goes throughout the air
and<00:01:04.140> lands<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.470> other<00:01:04.650> trees<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.189> inoculates

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and lands on other trees then inoculates

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.330 
and lands on other trees then inoculates
or<00:01:06.210> infects<00:01:06.720> those<00:01:06.990> trees<00:01:07.320> thus<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.159> ratio

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
or infects those trees thus the ratio

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.050 
or infects those trees thus the ratio
they<00:01:08.670> will<00:01:08.850> produce<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.810> procreate<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
they will produce in procreate so as I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.240 
they will produce in procreate so as I
just<00:01:12.240> said<00:01:12.450> these<00:01:12.960> spores<00:01:13.380> contain<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
just said these spores contain the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.840 
just said these spores contain the
literal<00:01:14.820> essence<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> gene<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.290> reishi<00:01:16.850> so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
literal essence or the gene of reishi so

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.090 
literal essence or the gene of reishi so
basically<00:01:18.360> what's<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.350> 300<00:01:19.619> times

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
basically what's what can be 300 times

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.130 
basically what's what can be 300 times
more<00:01:20.280> potent<00:01:20.909> than<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.240> actual<00:01:21.750> fruiting

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
more potent than this actual fruiting

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.800 
more potent than this actual fruiting
body<00:01:22.369> none<00:01:23.369> other<00:01:23.549> than<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.150> actual<00:01:24.450> reishi

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
body none other than the actual reishi

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.499 
body none other than the actual reishi
or<00:01:25.439> oil<00:01:25.740> which<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.640> say<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.420> in

obviously<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.649> don't<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.040> oxidize<00:02:05.520> or

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
obviously we don't want to oxidize or

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.600 
obviously we don't want to oxidize or
turn<00:02:05.969> those

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
turn those

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.900 
turn those
oils<00:02:06.940> into<00:02:07.300> trans<00:02:07.810> fatty<00:02:08.110> acids<00:02:08.619> thus<00:02:09.220> we<00:02:09.880> use

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
oils into trans fatty acids thus we use

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.140 
oils into trans fatty acids thus we use
a<00:02:10.360> supercritical<00:02:11.340> extraction<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.850> give<00:02:13.060> you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
a supercritical extraction so give you

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.570 
a supercritical extraction so give you
an<00:02:13.270> idea<00:02:13.390> how<00:02:14.050> concentrated<00:02:14.590> these<00:02:15.040> for<00:02:15.340> oil

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
an idea how concentrated these for oil

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.930 
an idea how concentrated these for oil
is<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.600> takes<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:17.140> thousand<00:02:17.920> kilograms<00:02:18.460> of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
is it takes a thousand kilograms of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.020 
is it takes a thousand kilograms of
these<00:02:19.180> reishi<00:02:19.540> mushrooms<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.740> produce<00:02:21.030> one

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
these reishi mushrooms to produce one

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.170 
these reishi mushrooms to produce one
kilogram<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.410> spores<00:02:23.710> then<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.820> takes<00:02:25.000> a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
kilogram of the spores then it takes a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.630 
kilogram of the spores then it takes a
thousand<00:02:25.870> kilograms<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.920> spores<00:02:27.340> to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
thousand kilograms of the spores to

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.250 
thousand kilograms of the spores to
produce<00:02:28.210> just<00:02:28.690> one<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.350> three<00:02:30.930> kilograms<00:02:31.930> of

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
produce just one to three kilograms of

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.860 
produce just one to three kilograms of
the<00:02:32.410> reishi<00:02:32.620> spore<00:02:33.130> oil<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.330> means<00:02:34.540> that

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
the reishi spore oil so that means that

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.800 
the reishi spore oil so that means that
the<00:02:35.590> ratios<00:02:36.130> for<00:02:36.400> oil<00:02:36.640> can<00:02:36.940> be<00:02:37.090> anywhere<00:02:37.750> from
