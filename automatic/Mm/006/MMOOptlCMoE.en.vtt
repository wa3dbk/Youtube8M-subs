00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.340
 Three years on, I fucked three years sump 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.199
 some right gives me advice in 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.449
 Excellent I now advise for the future 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.160
 guys who are undecided on what 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.199
 they would like to tell open spaces 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.620
 sampo 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:04.320
 spend your time and money on donat you 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.250
 advised of course 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 energy 500 is a motorcycle he is but i am now 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.409
 just explain in brief I'm first he 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.439
 very maneuverable that is you will be able to 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.990
 any narrow street to call on it and where 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.700
 please turn further if you are now 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.430
 ask what he and he slowly 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.340
 speed infern tsybulya then I'm going so 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.200
 it would seem given a little loses 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.060
 but worth starting 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 click the arrow period is all 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.350
 famous bagooyuz if you don't know it 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.140
 congratulations you're new but nothing there 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.320
 no fear click the arrow forward and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.020
 he accelerates that's magic he rides he rides 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.909
 very fast and no longer loses by 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.829
 speed not Infernus will not Wise 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.430
 play that little bit 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.560
 that's the most important advantage of this 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.020
 motorcycle what else 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.939
 reporting forgotten the main thing is that his 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.040
 it's very hard to beat him very 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.780
 high up or that is you need so much 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.050
 once bump on it for it to catch fire 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.730
 just hard to imagine that there 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.950
 much more tenacious than usual 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.120
 car and it is cheaper infernusy 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.830
 bullets are much cooler than their practical and 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.680
 finally the most important plus I don't know 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.010
 will I have now or not but if 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.540
 you have straight arms and you would have one 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.870
 you will have some skill time 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.930
 practice then energy 500 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.450
 will give you such beauty for your 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.690
 mother i didn't want to crash into that tree 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.350
 even so shorter than the patch will continue if u 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.750
 you have straight arms and a share of dexterity and 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.030
 you will train if not such a handle 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.160
 how can I give you this bike 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.560
 wonderful opportunity to travel 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.470
 high building plan now i'm certainly not 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.550
 It turned out 1 time because I am well 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.530
 just two weeks, the sampo is all a joke 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.050
 really here you can on this bike 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.910
 jump anywhere here besides i 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.190
 used to jump on this building here 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.340
 right on the bomzhatnik me even sometimes varna 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.650
 for 4 gave on another account but true 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.440
 yes what is it did not work before 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.780
 what kind of garbage, guys? 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.330
 that is no longer working but what am I leading 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.160
 what it will allow you to really jump 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.620
 anywhere else strip intourist here 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.239
 know there are green, I basically right now, show 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.360
 try to jump one last time 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.720
 edition but i 'm straight answer what it is 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.730
 maybe I did that 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.890
 how the hell ain't got what the hell 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.900
 why did you get this whole thing before 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.910
 in a motorcycle this is a motorcycle is a bad one 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.270
 I do not handle this whole thing motorcycle 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.489
 motorcycle frets last try 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.920
 last attempt to fly it 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.260
 bomzhatskie building damn is not 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.849
 it turns out let's go las venturas 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.090
 before 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.989
 It was live that I flew right next to 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.510
 de la la us 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.900
 I went to las venturas there a couple more 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.150
 Places will show you will be well on 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.300
 and I very much doubt that you can so 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.099
 on will i told the motorcycle 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.739
 energy and all motorcycles in general but 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.780
 of course more nrg degree is huge and 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.290
 advantage over all others 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.790
 vehicles it is just 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.620
 the king of the mobile of him can be called that 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.530
 I know Batmobile because on it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.419
 maybe almost everything and really me 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.639
 already crooked hands I don't have much 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.320
 it turns out but something like this in theory over 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.020
 jump on all these buildings i have 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.310
 you in places where there are cats 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.490
 here you are 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.360
 opportunity to fly almost on 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.550
 any building 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.340
 I do not know I did not prepare for this 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.090
 video clip I Krivorukov yes but I apologize 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.139
 may lead on youtube just the name 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.790
 stance nrg that is stand and there are 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.889
 people who are seriously engaged in this 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.139
 it they have there on the videos even don 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.789
 Raul seems to be shooting and they will be there 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.520
 like the most popular but also sa 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.470
 popular videos staunton energy so 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.700
 see here and there it is directly shown how 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.800
 you can fly it as much as possible 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.080
 took advantage of this 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.490
 undiscovered potential motorcycle you there 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.669
 really people fly all the buildings 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.410
 las-venturas just fly fly into 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.980
 1 fly another now imagine 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.000
 that cops are after you 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.930
 and they go fast let's say you had 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.770
 fig . 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.810
 or do you run a tire on your infern 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.550
 led you need to quickly get away from the chase and you 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.410
 just fly away to the building just 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.350
 imagine the reaction of these guys they ride 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.100
 and the wave probably he cheater should write 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.000
 time 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.980
 Well, he would write the same is not like nobody 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.770
 did not make any from war Ming 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.690
 you do not go to chat and so on 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.880
 complete impunity and at the same time 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.510
 huge advantage over all here 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.170
 Now that's well almost but you get the idea how 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.780
 it's done shorter energy 500 your bro 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:57.140
 this is a really cool bike we can fly 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.780
 anywhere simple and principle here is my 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.210
 advice I hope which of you will see this 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.380
 video will not create these stupid 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.570
 debility topics 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.630
 what transport best tunic something 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:12.220
 so everything is clear that this is energy oh oh 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.300
 oh oh well ok you didn't see anything 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.300
 really nrg 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.310
 I need him with both my hands 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.590
 bought it in california on advance 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.510
 me not energy but all because i 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.910
 the fool is actually energy better 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.240
 transport well, something like this mini guide 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.700
 It turned out because because that 's thanks 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.550
 for watching told everything he knew 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.900
 principle 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.900
 let's good luck so far
