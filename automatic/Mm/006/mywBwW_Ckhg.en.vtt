00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
maze I think to be honest it is the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.830 
maze I think to be honest it is the
easiest<00:02:03.130> maze<00:02:03.549> there<00:02:04.359> is<00:02:04.859> it<00:02:05.859> is<00:02:06.840> really

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
easiest maze there is it is really

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.410 
easiest maze there is it is really
really<00:02:08.229> easy<00:02:08.440> made<00:02:09.039> it's<00:02:09.369> not<00:02:09.819> hard<00:02:10.119> at<00:02:10.239> all

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
really easy made it's not hard at all

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.520 
really easy made it's not hard at all
it's<00:02:11.319> completely<00:02:11.799> easy<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:14.170> do<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.410> other

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
it's completely easy to do the other

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.320 
it's completely easy to do the other
ones<00:02:14.739> are<00:02:14.860> more<00:02:14.950> harder<00:02:15.310> than<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.549> is<00:02:15.760> but

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
ones are more harder than this is but

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.380 
ones are more harder than this is but
