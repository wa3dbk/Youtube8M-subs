these<00:00:41.219> shoes<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.149> first<00:00:42.480> thing<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
these shoes and the first thing is the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.569 
these shoes and the first thing is the
heel<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.950> biggest<00:00:44.129> thing<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.460> my

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
heel this is the biggest thing in my

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.720 
heel this is the biggest thing in my
opinion<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.050> three<00:00:46.469> millimeter<00:00:46.680> drop<00:00:47.160> but

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
opinion it's a three millimeter drop but

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.010 
opinion it's a three millimeter drop but
that's<00:00:47.879> not<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> story<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.660> it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
that's not the story here it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.139 
that's not the story here it's
incredibly<00:00:49.770> stable<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.610> almost<00:00:50.879> like

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
incredibly stable it's almost like

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
incredibly stable it's almost like
lifting<00:00:51.780> shoes<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.920> press<00:00:53.190> down

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
lifting shoes so when you press down

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.369 
lifting shoes so when you press down
you're<00:00:54.030> not<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.510> anywhere<00:00:54.780> when<00:00:55.140> you're<00:00:55.289> in

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
you're not going anywhere when you're in

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.319 
you're not going anywhere when you're in
a<00:00:55.469> squat<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.070> awesome<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.640> unlike<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> lot

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
a squat it's awesome it's unlike a lot

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 
a squat it's awesome it's unlike a lot
of<00:00:57.360> CrossFit<00:00:57.930> shoes<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.379> there<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
of CrossFit shoes out there so the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.310 
of CrossFit shoes out there so the
biggest<00:00:59.399> thing<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.149> heel<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.870> opinion

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
biggest thing is the heel in my opinion

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.240 
biggest thing is the heel in my opinion
second<00:01:02.160> biggest<00:01:02.309> thing<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.899> tread<00:01:04.439> it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
second biggest thing is the tread it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
second biggest thing is the tread it's
vastly<00:01:05.700> superior<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.200> you're<00:01:07.350> gonna<00:01:07.439> see

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
vastly superior to what you're gonna see

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100 
vastly superior to what you're gonna see
on<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.070> Nano<00:01:08.369> shoes<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.360> got<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.689> jagged

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
on the Nano shoes it's got this jagged

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.859 
on the Nano shoes it's got this jagged
edge<00:01:10.439> design<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.520> when<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> jump<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> box<00:01:12.540> or

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
edge design so when you jump on a box or

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.140 
edge design so when you jump on a box or
you<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> split<00:01:13.619> jerk<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.549> sprints

you do a split jerk or you do sprints

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.850 
you do a split jerk or you do sprints
you're<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.720> gonna<00:01:15.930> dig<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.710> gonna

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you're really gonna dig in it's gonna

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890 
you're really gonna dig in it's gonna
grip<00:01:17.189> down<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.729> awesome<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.689> much

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
grip down it's awesome it's so much

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.179 
grip down it's awesome it's so much
better<00:01:19.140> than<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.500> you'll<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> lot<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
better than what you'll see on a lot of

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.370 
better than what you'll see on a lot of
CrossFit<00:01:20.670> shoes<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.810> next<00:01:22.080> thing<00:01:22.259> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
CrossFit shoes and the next thing is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
CrossFit shoes and the next thing is
that<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.280> incredibly<00:01:23.970> breathable<00:01:24.360> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
that these are incredibly breathable you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
that these are incredibly breathable you
can<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.200> see<00:01:25.500> through<00:01:25.770> these<00:01:26.130> shoes

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
can actually see through these shoes

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.789 
can actually see through these shoes
which<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.880> pretty<00:01:27.450> awesome<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.990> they're

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
which is pretty awesome and they're

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.620 
which is pretty awesome and they're
flexible<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.759> you'll<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.150> able<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> move<00:01:30.479> your

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
flexible so you'll be able to move your

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.289 
flexible so you'll be able to move your
toes<00:01:30.869> around<00:01:31.170> however<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.680> want<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:33.030> also

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
toes around however you want and I also

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.640 
toes around however you want and I also
think<00:01:33.509> they're<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.960> very<00:01:34.229> durable

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
think they're going to be very durable

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.469 
think they're going to be very durable
and<00:01:35.040> they're<00:01:35.159> lightweight<00:01:35.369> too<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.030> speaking

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and they're lightweight too but speaking

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.780 
and they're lightweight too but speaking
of<00:01:36.600> durability<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.130> actually<00:01:38.520> wrapped

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
of durability they are actually wrapped

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.660 
of durability they are actually wrapped
end<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.299> end<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.780> Kevlar<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.189> stuff<00:01:41.430> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
end to end in Kevlar so this stuff is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.880 
end to end in Kevlar so this stuff is
awesome<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.930> hopefully<00:01:43.320> gonna<00:01:43.439> help<00:01:43.710> them

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
awesome it's hopefully gonna help them

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.819 
awesome it's hopefully gonna help them
last<00:01:44.159> longer<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.020> fight<00:01:46.020> back<00:01:46.290> against<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
last longer and fight back against the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.139 
last longer and fight back against the
rope<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:47.280> you're<00:01:47.399> climbing<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.759> rope<00:01:47.909> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
rope when you're climbing a rope that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.030 
rope when you're climbing a rope that
sort<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.540> thing<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.350> think<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.649> Kevlar

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
sort of thing but I think the Kevlar

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760 
sort of thing but I think the Kevlar
makes<00:01:50.549> them<00:01:50.729> look<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.149> nice<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:52.619> think

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
makes them look really nice and I think

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.139 
makes them look really nice and I think
it's<00:01:52.890> gonna<00:01:53.009> add<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.280> their<00:01:53.430> durability<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it's gonna add to their durability and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.690 
it's gonna add to their durability and
the<00:01:54.630> fourth<00:01:54.899> biggest<00:01:55.229> thing<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.549> they<00:01:56.549> look

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the fourth biggest thing is they look

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.800 
the fourth biggest thing is they look

them around you're not gonna be

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.969 
them around you're not gonna be
embarrassed<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.409> think<00:02:01.740> they're<00:02:01.860> awesome

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
embarrassed I think they're awesome

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.840 
embarrassed I think they're awesome
looking<00:02:02.430> shoes<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> negative<00:02:04.590> side

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
looking shoes now on the negative side

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.039 
looking shoes now on the negative side
there<00:02:05.850> are<00:02:05.880> two<00:02:06.030> things<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.840> want<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
there are two things that I want to

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.809 
there are two things that I want to
highlight<00:02:07.200> number<00:02:07.649> one<00:02:07.860> these<00:02:08.429> are<00:02:08.580> very

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
highlight number one these are very

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.279 
highlight number one these are very
minimalist<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.629> mentioned<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.140> there's

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
minimalist like I mentioned so there's

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.930 
minimalist like I mentioned so there's
not<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.530> lot<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.890> padding<00:02:11.069> when<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
not a lot of padding when you go for a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940 
not a lot of padding when you go for a
run<00:02:12.209> when<00:02:12.959> you're<00:02:13.110> out<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:13.260> running

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
run when you're out there running

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.430 
run when you're out there running
it<00:02:14.819> kind<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.239> hurts<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.050> little<00:02:16.319> bit

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
it kind of hurts just a little bit

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.690 
it kind of hurts just a little bit
especially<00:02:16.709> if<00:02:17.010> you're<00:02:17.129> running<00:02:17.310> longer

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
especially if you're running longer

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.910 
especially if you're running longer
distances<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.569> these<00:02:19.050> are<00:02:19.230> probably<00:02:19.530> gonna<00:02:19.800> be

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
distances so these are probably gonna be

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.160 
distances so these are probably gonna be
shoes<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.580> wear<00:02:20.730> primarily<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> gym

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
shoes that you wear primarily in the gym

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.290 
shoes that you wear primarily in the gym
not<00:02:22.890> for<00:02:23.220> workouts<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.700> involve<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.150> lot<00:02:24.269> of

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
not for workouts that involve a lot of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.110 
not for workouts that involve a lot of
running<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.800> second<00:02:26.220> thing<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.550> they

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
running and the second thing is they

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.509 
running and the second thing is they
cost<00:02:27.360> two<00:02:27.720> hundred<00:02:27.750> dollars<00:02:28.530> yes<00:02:28.950> two<00:02:29.280> hundred

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
cost two hundred dollars yes two hundred

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.520 
cost two hundred dollars yes two hundred
dollars<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.090> they're<00:02:30.269> very<00:02:30.810> very<00:02:31.140> expensive

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
dollars so they're very very expensive

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.130 
dollars so they're very very expensive
so<00:02:32.430> much<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.330> don't<00:02:33.510> know<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.930> can

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
so much so that I don't know that I can

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.930 
so much so that I don't know that I can
honestly<00:02:34.349> recommend<00:02:35.040> them<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.400> lot<00:02:35.790> of

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
honestly recommend them to a lot of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.820 
honestly recommend them to a lot of

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
your feet I was comparing them earlier

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.180 
your feet I was comparing them earlier
today<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:58.200> they're<00:02:58.349> almost<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.739> same<00:02:58.769> shoe

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
today so they're almost the same shoe

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.280 
today so they're almost the same shoe
but<00:02:59.819> these<00:02:59.970> are<00:03:00.269> gonna<00:03:00.480> last<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.989> longer

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
but these are gonna last you longer

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.830 
but these are gonna last you longer
they're<00:03:01.980> wrapped<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.549> end<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.239> Kevlar

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
they're wrapped and end in that Kevlar

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.839 
they're wrapped and end in that Kevlar
cage<00:03:04.079> as<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.410> mentioned<00:03:04.829> they<00:03:05.220> still<00:03:05.489> have<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
cage as I mentioned they still have the

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.000 
cage as I mentioned they still have the
rope<00:03:06.090> Pro<00:03:06.450> technology<00:03:07.170> here<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.590> they<00:03:07.709> also<00:03:07.950> is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
rope Pro technology here so they also is

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.350 
rope Pro technology here so they also is
not<00:03:08.190> going<00:03:08.459> anywhere<00:03:08.700> when<00:03:09.030> you're<00:03:09.150> climbing

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
not going anywhere when you're climbing

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.600 
not going anywhere when you're climbing
ropes<00:03:09.840> it's<00:03:10.349> also<00:03:10.500> gonna<00:03:10.709> dig<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.400> rope

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
ropes it's also gonna dig into the rope

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.309 
ropes it's also gonna dig into the rope
I<00:03:11.819> think<00:03:12.120> there's<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.329> great<00:03:12.569> shoes<00:03:12.930> but<00:03:13.200> I'm

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
I think there's a great shoes but I'm

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.110 
I think there's a great shoes but I'm
not<00:03:13.410> sure<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> lot<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.010> people<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.519> justify
