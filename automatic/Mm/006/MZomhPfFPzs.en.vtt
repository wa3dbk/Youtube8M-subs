00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.550
I'm at 64 degrees north, in Reykjavik. This
city is the world's northernmost capital of

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.939
a sovereign state.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.590
This is one of only two places in the world
where you can actually see the Earth's tectonic

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.710
plates meet up. There's two here, over on
my left is the North American plate and over

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.000
on the right is the Eurasian. It's pretty
mind-blowing.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.700
There are two Taco Bells in Iceland.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.260
This country is home to almost 200 volcanoes,
and almost 11 per cent of the land is covered

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.530
by a glacier or cooled lava bed.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.320
I'm in a geothermal lagoon and 200 types of
bacteria in here are new species.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.409
Iceland is home to Europe's biggest glacier,
you can see it behind me. At the bottom of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.829
it is this huge lagoon, it's 18 square kilometres
and has these icebergs, bits of the glacier,

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.289
floating around in it. It's mind-blowing.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.399
Nearly 85 per cent of Iceland's electricity
come from renewable sources, like geothermal

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:49.149
or hydropower. 80 per cent of the homes here
are powered by geothermal. I love renewable

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.149
energy.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.340
It's a really geologically young country so
the landscapes here have been mind-blowing.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.080
We describe things as mind-blowing all the
time, but what does actually mean?
