there was a black lady that helped her

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.259 
there was a black lady that helped her
and<00:03:11.410> did<00:03:11.739> three<00:03:11.860> teachers<00:03:12.370> they<00:03:12.580> would<00:03:12.760> divide

I<00:03:16.470> guess<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.680> kept<00:03:17.950> us<00:03:18.160> from<00:03:18.310> going<00:03:18.400> hungry<00:03:18.820> a

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
I guess that kept us from going hungry a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.380 
I guess that kept us from going hungry a
lot<00:03:19.239> of<00:03:19.390> times<00:03:19.600> because<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:21.820> hadn't<00:03:22.180> been<00:03:22.239> for

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
lot of times because it hadn't been for

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.590 
lot of times because it hadn't been for
that<00:03:24.090> sometimes<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.390> know<00:03:25.540> what<00:03:25.989> we<00:03:26.170> do<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:28.420> I

that sometimes you know what we do and I

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.390 
that sometimes you know what we do and I
can<00:03:28.840> truthfully<00:03:29.079> say<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.829> have<00:03:30.130> never

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
can truthfully say that I have never
