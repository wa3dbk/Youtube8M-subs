00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.750 
two three four five you could do six you
can<00:02:23.050> do<00:02:23.140> four<00:02:23.349> five<00:02:24.099> seems<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.459> be<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> pretty

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
can do four five seems to be a pretty

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.570 
can do four five seems to be a pretty
good<00:02:24.940> number<00:02:25.120> draw<00:02:25.989> this<00:02:26.709> through<00:02:29.489> till<00:02:30.489> it

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
good number draw this through till it

good number draw this through till it
gets<00:02:30.730> tight<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.230> little<00:02:32.230> bit<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:34.530> management<00:02:35.530> of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
gets tight a little bit of management of

the leader material as you go along is
going<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.140> keep<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.709> from<00:02:38.860> kinking<00:02:39.299> draw<00:02:40.299> that

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
going to keep it from kinking draw that

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.199 
going to keep it from kinking draw that
up<00:02:40.660> like<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:41.610> tighten<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.700> up<00:02:42.760> really<00:02:43.030> well

close okay now you're ready for the next

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.600 
close okay now you're ready for the next
one<00:02:52.200> spring<00:02:53.200> chinook<00:02:53.349> we<00:02:53.709> use<00:02:53.890> green<00:02:54.310> label

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
one spring chinook we use green label

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.059 
one spring chinook we use green label
hearing<00:02:54.970> typically<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:56.319> way<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> like<00:02:57.040> to

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
hearing typically the way I like to

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.199 
hearing typically the way I like to
measure<00:02:57.370> green<00:02:57.700> label<00:02:58.000> herring<00:02:58.329> the<00:03:00.209> gap

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
measure green label herring the gap

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.880 
measure green label herring the gap
between<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.810> hooks<00:03:02.110> for<00:03:02.200> green<00:03:02.500> label<00:03:02.739> hair

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
between the hooks for green label hair

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.780 
between the hooks for green label hair
and<00:03:03.010> rather<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.450> by<00:03:04.450> using<00:03:05.049> my<00:03:06.040> fingers<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.579> have

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
and rather is by using my fingers I have

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.630 
and rather is by using my fingers I have
medium-sized<00:03:07.569> hands<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.200> don't<00:03:08.260> have<00:03:08.560> very<00:03:09.430> big

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
medium-sized hands I don't have very big

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.729 
medium-sized hands I don't have very big
hands<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.780> have<00:03:10.900> medium-sized<00:03:11.410> hands

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
hands so if you have medium-sized hands

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.110 
hands so if you have medium-sized hands
this<00:03:12.400> would<00:03:12.609> probably<00:03:12.790> be<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.299> good

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
this would probably be a good

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.199 
this would probably be a good
approximate<00:03:16.120> measurement<00:03:16.540> for<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:18.209> between

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
approximate measurement for you between

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
like to have about one and a half finger

all<00:04:14.739> of<00:04:14.979> the<00:04:15.100> line<00:04:15.280> over<00:04:15.790> here<00:04:16.060> in<00:04:16.449> your<00:04:16.600> right

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
all of the line over here in your right

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.259 
all of the line over here in your right
hand<00:04:17.100> get<00:04:18.100> it<00:04:18.190> out<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.489> way<00:04:18.609> push<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.090> over

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
hand get it out of the way push it over

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.039 
hand get it out of the way push it over
there

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
there

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.990 
there
all<00:04:20.139> that's<00:04:20.410> in<00:04:20.530> my<00:04:20.560> left<00:04:20.799> hand<00:04:21.009> is<00:04:21.220> just<00:04:21.459> those

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
all that's in my left hand is just those

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.570 
all that's in my left hand is just those
two<00:04:22.180> hooks<00:04:22.389> and<00:04:22.569> draw<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:23.680> up<00:04:23.740> pull<00:04:24.430> it

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
two hooks and draw this up pull it

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.920 
two hooks and draw this up pull it
through<00:04:24.759> there<00:04:25.500> okay<00:04:26.940> I'm<00:04:27.940> kink<00:04:28.419> this<00:04:28.629> as<00:04:28.810> you

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
through there okay I'm kink this as you

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.960 
through there okay I'm kink this as you
go<00:04:29.050> along<00:04:29.460> it's<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.520> little<00:04:30.729> time<00:04:30.940> consuming

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
go along it's a little time consuming

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.540 
go along it's a little time consuming
these<00:04:31.780> take<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.080> lot<00:04:32.319> longer<00:04:32.500> but<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.400> know

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
these take a lot longer but you know

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.909 
these take a lot longer but you know
what's<00:04:33.759> nice<00:04:33.970> when<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:35.050> get<00:04:35.199> one<00:04:35.440> hook<00:04:35.650> in<00:04:35.800> the

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
what's nice when you get one hook in the

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.159 
what's nice when you get one hook in the
fish<00:04:36.099> you<00:04:36.550> typically<00:04:37.030> get<00:04:37.330> at<00:04:37.539> least<00:04:37.750> one

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
fish you typically get at least one

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.839 
fish you typically get at least one
other<00:04:38.500> hook<00:04:38.830> in<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.069> fish<00:04:39.280> when<00:04:39.490> you're<00:04:39.610> using

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
other hook in the fish when you're using

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.020 
other hook in the fish when you're using
three<00:04:40.120> hooks<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:41.199> using<00:04:41.560> two<00:04:41.710> hooks<00:04:41.949> you<00:04:42.520> most

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
three hooks and using two hooks you most

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.399 
three hooks and using two hooks you most
the<00:04:43.120> time<00:04:43.300> just<00:04:43.509> get<00:04:43.659> one<00:04:43.840> hook<00:04:44.020> in<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.229> fish

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
the time just get one hook in the fish

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.670 
the time just get one hook in the fish
two<00:04:44.979> hooks<00:04:45.250> in<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.490> fish<00:04:45.699> is<00:04:45.909> better<00:04:46.539> than<00:04:47.379> one

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
two hooks in the fish is better than one

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.499 
two hooks in the fish is better than one
oak<00:04:47.860> in<00:04:48.039> the<00:04:48.129> fish<00:04:48.310> you're<00:04:48.909> not<00:04:49.090> going<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.389> be
