00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.010
 I hope all is well a few weeks ago is 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.800
 came out another shoddy of jelsi for 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.439
 huge automotive strongholds 5 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.840
 the downloadable content is like this 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.149
 interesting that among all the 100 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.019
 friends I only list for two 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.510
 they downloaded it in ga ga ga ga ga however 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.690
 the title of the downloadable content has 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.129
 no, I'm not a hipster but a 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.709
 shit barrel 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.409
 let's analyze its contents later 

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:50.780
 each of you will get your own fucking 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.869
 conclusions obviously once 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.639
 downloaded I sling immediately to see 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:58.339
 damnation which are the new weapons that 

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:01.039
 have released that I know a lance 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.889
 chickens a crossbow a ninja sword 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.320

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:08.450

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.619
 etc. etc. 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.289
 I'm dying of curiosity not 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.119
 I hold back the orgasm 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.140
 in fact these are the last two slots 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.390
 available 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.509
 then I think that others will not be released 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.109
 we hope new weapons is something 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.869
 cool and above all something original 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.350
 but what the fuck happens you take me for the 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.469
 ass 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.359
 what can you tell me about that 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.670
 shit pack was in one 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:40.820
 ancient dagger and a gun years 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.789

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.159

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.329
 I make a dagger 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.850
 when I already have the knife that bullshit 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.340
 but it was not better to put a sword with 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.950
 which to fight and make tournaments in 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.679
 samurai style and instead of the nth 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.729
 gun was better not to put something 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.439
 of original 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.289
 a bit like those of saints row 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.560
 not or better to insert the twentieth 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.710
 useless but fucking gun heads 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.750
 let's get lost by 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.720
 and let's go see the many new ones 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.540
 clothes that added who knows what 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.850
 there may be a chicken dress a 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.670
 the uniform of the gods dressed in satan 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.730

 I can't wait to try it and buy them 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.240
 all 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.790
 imagine that cool would be to form a 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.520
 clan and dress all of policemen 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.540
 too good hey but what the fuck is he 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.700

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.910
 what are these fennel dresses ni 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.430
 meaningless shirt thrown back one 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.100
 over the other but who buys them 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.100
 you are taking me for your ass you are 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.110
 really taking her ass and these 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.660
 you call them new clothes 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.270
 I'm the usual shit and there are 3 thousand of them 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.150
 all so that nobody gives a shit 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.940
 where are the police uniforms le 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.780
 the costumes, etc., separated from prisoners 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.660
 etc 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.150
 you have wasted a lot of time for 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.680
 create this stinky garbage when 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.160
 you could really do something 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.380
 original but wait because while 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.900
 I was looking at the clothes I found 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.880
 also an incredible treat 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.730
 ladies and gentlemen, I found the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.410
 incredible giuseppe simone t-shirt 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.130
 but its really true 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.270
 I have no words is something shabby 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.970
 the rockstar games 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.320
 technically it's a hundred years ahead but a 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.020
 fantasy level 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.780
 you still have a lot to learn from saint 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.820
 row really but really a lot 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.490
 as I said before instead of adding 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.400
 useless shit was enough to make a couple of 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.590
 uniforms of policemen and criminals 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.440
 to create a kind of gang war 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.020
 in style all points bullettin look 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.920
 not even my mummified grandfather went into 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.470
 outfit so faak this deal is had 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.900
 failed two out of three goals now let's see 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.920
 if he can smell even in the new ones 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.020
 car 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.200
 look at these are just some of the 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.900
 new cars added all cars they make 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.440
 part of the grungy sheet series 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.250
 80's take me away to ga ga ga ga ga ga 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.710
 we have the smart of the pods 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.440
 of the old sedans worthy of Giuseppe 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.410
 simone self deformed and the body as the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.660
 world hunger and similar bullshit 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.900
 I broke my balls, it seems 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.670
 be in mine crafen cock but a little 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.500
 fantasy 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.930
 you could add a lot of vehicles 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.330
 original but keep throwing shit 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.580
 on shit according to you 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.490
 after releasing the tegas even 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.970
 throat turn but who the fuck you buy one 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.660
 stuff like that, but give it a try 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.360
 waken up 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.970
 otherwise I will be forced to fotter di 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.000
 bad weather you even let out 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.400
 the beautiful is the highly anticipated creator of 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.380
 contents with which we all dreamed of 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.870
 hacking is the only thing 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.180
 they asked aifa you didn't put it ie 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.100
 the possibility of creating missions 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.620
 cooperatives against characters 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.140
 computer controlled 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.320
 in a nutshell, to do missions 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.200
 you can do it all capture deathmatch 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.830
 the sister race by bike parachuting 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.110
 but not individual missions and how sad 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.229
 what else to say if I am not a 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.810
 hipster but a bag of shit well 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.240
 I think it's all for today 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.370
 hope that in the future they will release 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.000
 something original and above all 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.630
 useful I greet you bye all margoni a 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.630
