00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
 how many times when I arrive and I say that 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.750
 I'm an image consultant, the first thing 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.600
 they ask me is what haircut I 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.100
 remains or that the red cut remains and 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.150
 I 'm telling myself that I do not of course 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.609
 that makeup the type of cut the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.759
 clothes gives a very important message to 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.310
 other people but you have to start is 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.619
 very funny to know that the image of the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.960
 image is not really the image that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.220
 it should be from the image and what game 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.690
 complicated of words already so 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.480
 complicated sometimes to explain what is 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.730
 the image because what do you create your image 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.300
 your image does not really belong to you 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.920
 is the conclusion that other people 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.410
 they take as a consequence of what you 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.000
 you are screaming through the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 different stimuli, both verbal and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 non-verbal and those stimuli when 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.690
 come to memory and combine with 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.630
 other experiences that have the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.230
 receiver in this case is how it starts to 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.360
 draw conclusions 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.460
 that's why sometimes when we arrive 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.229
 with someone and we choose our name and 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.180
 has an antecedent of that name that 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.560
 person nothing else with the simple fact of 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.020
 listen to that name there's going to be a 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.479
 rejection effectively the image is not 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.850
 just the cut as we can see the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.900
 image is much more complex the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.750
 way as we speak 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.360
 strut to let's think talk about thousand 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.820
 forms the example the car in which 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.270
 comes is the cleaning of your car you 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.430
 name your school for example also 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.130
 is telling us something cleaning your 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.020
 house how is your house decorated on 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.000
 how do you talk to your children how the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.220
 your boss is how you take with your 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.050
 coworkers how you answer 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.030
 an email the avatar that 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.700
 selections for your social networks the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.920
 what kind of public content so 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.259
 regular on your social networks the like him 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.270
 talks about zero to a goalkeeper that 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.509
 for me of course he is screaming 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.100
 much more than a simple wardrobe or 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.920
 a simple makeup haircut 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.110
 what happens with the clear image that is 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.690
 very easy to change it from the outside but 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.360
 who believes is the radical image of how you 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.739
 you speak what we should really 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.970
 start to change is the image that 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.069
 we have of ourselves 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.640
 because if we believe we are going to 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.300
 modify nothing else how we think 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.670
 We will automatically start sending 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.830
 another type of stimulus to the whole world 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.110
 a true makeover begins 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.000
 inside because that's the reason 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.280
 sustenance of what later begins to 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.400
 leave as a consequence that is the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.650
 result is not the goal and many 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.569
 Sometimes we think that the big goals 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.610
 is it really worth the 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.730
 have a good image should not be 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.739
 your phone has an image of a good 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.480
 image should be the consequence of 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.459
 everything you are doing your job 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.980
 internal in improving your relationships 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.930
 personal in the of course get to 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.049
 climb the position above studying 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.940
 graduates doing many things more than 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.310
 can then take you to have in 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.750
 consequence a good perception of the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.840
 external eyes 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.150
 I insist the day we learn then to 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.580
 that the image starts with a change of 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.470
 personal perception is what is going to 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.400
 help then understand that everything 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.540
 other is a simple and plain result 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.880
 I hope the next time you turn to 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.920
 see the mirror start not just for 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.320
 see what's outside if you do not start with 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.140
 start to really empower what 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.330
 times really worth worth and sign 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.160
 that everyone who is listening to this 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.610
 what I give you k'asa sure that you 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.370
 you have many excellent and beautiful things 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.320
 beautiful exploitable great talents that 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.489
 you can avoid them the world invite you 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.709
 so that you start to see them with 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.150
 good eyes because that really is what 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.110
 that can lead you to have a great 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.730
 image 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.040
 remember that it is week with week 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.810
 we have content because it is not first 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.540
 the goal is to generate the best version 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.610
 of yourself or of yourself we have 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.230
 body language content we have 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.240
 contents of the communication protocol 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.920
 facial that I hope that nothing else 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.570
 we are going but you also share them 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.980
 I invite you to subscribe here below and 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.980
 Well, see you next week
