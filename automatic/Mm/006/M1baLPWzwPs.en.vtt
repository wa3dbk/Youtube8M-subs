sometimes has a bit of a bad rap like
its<00:03:16.090> associated<00:03:16.480> with<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:16.840> like<00:03:16.930> boring

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
vegetables and stuff like that but the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.160 
vegetables and stuff like that but the
great<00:03:19.270> thing<00:03:19.420> about<00:03:19.450> steaming<00:03:19.840> is<00:03:20.080> they

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
great thing about steaming is they

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.630 
great thing about steaming is they

the steams really powerful and that

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.390 
the steams really powerful and that
