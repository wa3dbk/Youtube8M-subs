edge of it where the idler pulley goes I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.150 
edge of it where the idler pulley goes I
didn't<00:00:28.019> put<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.349> right<00:00:28.470> there<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.830> smoke

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
to drill two extra holes and mount it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:53.990 
to drill two extra holes and mount it
with<00:00:42.000> long<00:00:42.300> bolts<00:00:51.050> came<00:00:52.050> over<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> length<00:00:53.000> but

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
with long bolts came over the length but

with long bolts came over the length but
I<00:00:54.030> went<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.420> Walmart<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.989> got<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.800> bike<00:00:56.760> thing

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
I went to Walmart and got a a bike thing

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.910 
I went to Walmart and got a a bike thing
using<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> original<00:01:01.020> one<00:01:01.140> with

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
using that with the original one with

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.299 
using that with the original one with
some<00:01:02.070> welding<00:01:02.430> wire<00:01:02.579> holding<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:04.309> all

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
some welding wire holding it for now all

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.770 
some welding wire holding it for now all
dipstick<00:01:06.170> headers<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.439> oh<00:01:09.590> yeah<00:01:11.360> nineteen<00:01:12.390> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
dipstick headers on oh yeah nineteen I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.429 
dipstick headers on oh yeah nineteen I
guess<00:01:12.990> 98<00:01:13.650> Camaro<00:01:14.189> no<00:01:14.640> fiber<00:01:15.240> long<00:01:16.170> tube

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
guess 98 Camaro no fiber long tube

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.190 
guess 98 Camaro no fiber long tube
headers<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.100> had<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.090> cut<00:01:18.390> some<00:01:18.420> stuff<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> make

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
headers I had to cut some stuff to make

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.810 
headers I had to cut some stuff to make
them<00:01:19.320> work<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.700> side<00:01:22.040> on<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.520> side<00:01:23.790> I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
them work on that side on this side I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
them work on that side on this side I
had<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> cut<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> primary<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.500> well<00:01:25.619> during

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
had to cut a primary one and well during

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.010 
had to cut a primary one and well during
the<00:01:25.920> primary<00:01:26.400> -<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:28.229> worth

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
the primary - but is worth

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.249 
the primary - but is worth
as<00:01:29.109> it<00:01:29.590> works<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:31.240> going<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.479> use<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.750> factory

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
as it works I'm going to use the factory

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.969 
as it works I'm going to use the factory
temperature<00:01:33.219> gauge<00:01:33.429> I'm<00:01:34.679> cutting<00:01:35.679> it<00:01:35.770> right

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
temperature gauge I'm cutting it right

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.560 
temperature gauge I'm cutting it right
now

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.310 

we'll<00:01:41.500> get<00:01:42.190> away<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.490> spectral<00:01:43.420> filter<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:44.020> got

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
we'll get away a spectral filter I got

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.670 
we'll get away a spectral filter I got
from<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.590> junkyard<00:01:44.890> why<00:01:45.460> not<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:49.410> lock<00:01:50.410> of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
from the junkyard why not the lock of

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.920 
from the junkyard why not the lock of
the<00:01:50.710> against<00:01:51.580> EGR<00:01:52.090> whatever<00:01:52.480> it<00:01:52.660> is<00:01:54.780> well<00:01:55.780> the

the against EGR whatever it is well the
fans<00:01:56.170> work<00:01:56.530> alternator<00:01:57.130> works<00:01:58.050> it's<00:01:59.050> the

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
fans work alternator works it's the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.230 
fans work alternator works it's the
transmission<00:01:59.620> flow<00:02:00.130> right<00:02:00.370> here<00:02:00.520> I'm<00:02:00.610> messing

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
transmission flow right here I'm messing

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.410 
transmission flow right here I'm messing
with<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.480> I<00:02:01.660> got<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> by<00:02:02.430> another<00:02:03.430> three

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420

with it I got it by another three
gallons<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:05.020> transmission<00:02:05.710> from<00:02:05.860> them<00:02:06.340> and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
gallons of transmission from them and

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:14.070 
gallons of transmission from them and
replace<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.450> tail-shaft<00:02:07.870> housing<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:13.570> sounds

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
replace the tail-shaft housing it sounds

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.280 
replace the tail-shaft housing it sounds
different<00:02:14.260> than<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.770> does<00:02:14.920> before<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:16.330> I'm

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
different than it does before and I'm

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.460

leaking<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:18.250> good<00:02:19.060> bit<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.390> exhaust<00:02:19.900> because<00:02:20.290> I

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
leaking a good bit of exhaust because I

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.760 
leaking a good bit of exhaust because I
just<00:02:20.680> got<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:21.820> there<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.560> see

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
just got it on there just to see

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:44.199 
just got it on there just to see
oh<00:02:27.180> yeah<00:02:28.180> pulled<00:02:28.450> out<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.570> couple<00:02:28.840> fuses<00:02:29.350> so

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.059

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
I've got a little bit of exhaust leak I

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.750 
I've got a little bit of exhaust leak I
got<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.310> get<00:02:46.459> some<00:02:46.610> different<00:02:46.760> gaskets<00:02:48.760> some

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
got to get some different gaskets some

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.069 
got to get some different gaskets some
of<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:49.970> little<00:02:50.120> miscellaneous<00:02:50.510> stuff<00:02:50.810> and

of the little miscellaneous stuff and
tightening<00:02:51.409> up<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.840> works

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.830 

oh<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.850> converted<00:03:01.600> the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:23.440 

set<00:03:08.530> off<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.950> whole<00:03:09.280> top<00:03:09.670> area

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.800 

engine<00:03:23.840> heads<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:26.540> open<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.620> up<00:03:28.120> got<00:03:29.120> will<00:03:29.569> use

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
engine heads to open it up got will use

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.720 
engine heads to open it up got will use
more<00:03:30.050> marine<00:03:30.349> will<00:03:30.560> put<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:31.069> there<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.520> not

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
more marine will put it in there and not

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.260 
more marine will put it in there and not
have<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.920> piece<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:33.950> there<00:03:34.280> from<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.640> top<00:03:34.849> of<00:03:35.090> it

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
have a piece in there from the top of it

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.460
