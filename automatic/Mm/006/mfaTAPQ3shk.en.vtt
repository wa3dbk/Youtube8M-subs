wearables I think that's going to be a

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.729 
wearables I think that's going to be a
very<00:00:47.010> important<00:00:47.430> market<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.879> forward<00:00:48.739> so

there<00:04:13.710> do<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.190> think<00:04:14.460> the<00:04:14.820> SmartWatch<00:04:15.330> is<00:04:15.540> a

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
there do you think the SmartWatch is a

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.810 
there do you think the SmartWatch is a
viable<00:04:16.470> product<00:04:17.160> do<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.310> think<00:04:17.520> it's<00:04:17.640> just

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
viable product do you think it's just

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.130 
viable product do you think it's just
too<00:04:18.030> soon<00:04:18.060> or<00:04:18.540> would<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.720> think<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.020> should

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
too soon or would you think we should

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.170 
too soon or would you think we should
all<00:04:19.230> jump<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:19.950> get<00:04:20.580> hold<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:20.820> these<00:04:20.940> things

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
all jump in and get hold of these things

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.300 
all jump in and get hold of these things
they<00:04:21.600> do<00:04:21.660> have<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.959> lot<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.170> bugs<00:04:22.500> they<00:04:22.740> do<00:04:23.130> have

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
they do have a lot of bugs they do have

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.560 
they do have a lot of bugs they do have
a<00:04:23.340> weak<00:04:23.670> battery<00:04:24.170> they<00:04:25.170> do<00:04:25.230> have<00:04:26.570> some

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
a weak battery they do have some

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.720 
a weak battery they do have some
problems<00:04:27.960> with<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.680> camera<00:04:28.980> you<00:04:29.430> need<00:04:29.700> a

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
problems with with a camera you need a

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.040 
problems with with a camera you need a
camera<00:04:30.030> here<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:30.950> we<00:04:31.950> have<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.370> tiny<00:04:32.670> display<00:04:33.050> I

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
camera here and we have a tiny display I

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.340 
camera here and we have a tiny display I
think<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.250> smart<00:04:36.090> watches<00:04:36.390> will<00:04:36.870> be<00:04:37.050> very

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
think the smart watches will be very

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.800 
think the smart watches will be very
interesting<00:04:37.950> in<00:04:38.100> about<00:04:38.340> one<00:04:39.030> or<00:04:39.210> two<00:04:39.240> years

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
interesting in about one or two years

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.070 
interesting in about one or two years
when<00:04:40.530> we<00:04:40.710> have<00:04:40.890> more<00:04:41.490> functions<00:04:42.420> in<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:42.720> better

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
when we have more functions in a better

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.120 
when we have more functions in a better
functions<00:04:43.590> when<00:04:44.130> we<00:04:44.310> when<00:04:44.820> they<00:04:45.000> look<00:04:45.240> nicer

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
functions when we when they look nicer

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.510 
functions when we when they look nicer
not<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:47.340> bulky<00:04:48.080> so<00:04:49.080> we<00:04:49.200> were<00:04:49.320> we<00:04:50.070> were<00:04:50.340> waiting

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
not so bulky so we were we were waiting

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.700 
not so bulky so we were we were waiting
yeah<00:04:50.910> but<00:04:51.330> but<00:04:51.600> it's<00:04:51.750> definitely<00:04:52.020> not<00:04:52.500> too

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
yeah but but it's definitely not too

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.980 
yeah but but it's definitely not too
soon
