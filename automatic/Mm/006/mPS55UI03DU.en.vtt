00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.490 
we just pulled the holding tank out of
our<00:01:33.810> West<00:01:34.020> sail<00:01:34.170> three<00:01:34.440> two<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:36.500> crappy

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
our West sail three two it was a crappy

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.210 
our West sail three two it was a crappy
experience<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:39.380> but<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.500> got<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.800> up<00:01:40.920> somehow

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
experience and but we got it up somehow

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.080 
experience and but we got it up somehow
we<00:01:41.790> managed<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> lift<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> out<00:01:43.440> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> v-berth

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
we managed to lift it out of the v-berth

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.749 
we managed to lift it out of the v-berth
and<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.680> next<00:01:46.950> step<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.670> out

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and now the next step is to get it out

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.590 
and now the next step is to get it out
of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.910> companionway

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
of the companionway

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.249 
of the companionway
see<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> fits<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.720> we're

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
see if it fits out of there but we're

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.960 
see if it fits out of there but we're
removing<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> holding<00:01:53.100> tank<00:01:53.340> because<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
removing the holding tank because of the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.930 
removing the holding tank because of the
odors<00:01:54.649> we're<00:01:55.649> gonna<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> composting<00:01:56.670> head

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
odors we're gonna get a composting head

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.510 
odors we're gonna get a composting head
probably<00:01:57.390> an<00:01:57.570> airhead<00:01:58.100> one<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.220> these<00:01:59.310> days

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
probably an airhead one of these days

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.570 
probably an airhead one of these days
some<00:02:00.210> people<00:02:00.240> suggested<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:02.160> hoses

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
some people suggested that the hoses

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.850 
some people suggested that the hoses
might<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.910> been<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.259> incorrect<00:02:04.259> type<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
might have been the incorrect type and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.380 
might have been the incorrect type and
that<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> smell<00:02:05.369> was<00:02:05.490> permeating<00:02:06.119> from<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that the smell was permeating from the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.109 
that the smell was permeating from the
hoses<00:02:06.750> or<00:02:07.050> if<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.100> were<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.190> old<00:02:08.580> hoses

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
hoses or if there were just old hoses

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.200 
hoses or if there were just old hoses
but<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:10.020> got<00:02:10.350> rid<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.560> everything<00:02:11.280> cleaned

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
but we got rid of everything cleaned

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.960 
but we got rid of everything cleaned
everything<00:02:12.510> out<00:02:12.840> really<00:02:13.200> well<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:14.850> was

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
everything out really well and that was

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.850 
everything out really well and that was
an<00:02:15.060> interesting<00:02:15.270> experience<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:16.470> holding

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
an interesting experience the holding

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.000 
an interesting experience the holding
tank<00:02:17.450> barely<00:02:18.450> fit<00:02:18.900> through<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> doorway<00:02:19.590> of

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
tank barely fit through the doorway of

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.640 
tank barely fit through the doorway of
the<00:02:20.370> v-berth<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.260> getting<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.380> out<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the v-berth and getting it out of the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.070 
the v-berth and getting it out of the
companionway<00:02:23.190> was<00:02:23.520> interesting<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:24.569> well

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.740 

when<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:27.800> first<00:02:28.040> looked<00:02:28.610> at<00:02:28.730> other<00:02:28.940> options<00:02:29.240> we

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750
