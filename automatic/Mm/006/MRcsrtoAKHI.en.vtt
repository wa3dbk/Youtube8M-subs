now<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.470> edging<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.190> rough<00:03:23.850> for<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.060> moment

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
now the edging is rough for the moment

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.640 
now the edging is rough for the moment
but<00:03:24.390> I've<00:03:24.450> got<00:03:24.600> some<00:03:24.780> edging<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.080> strip<00:03:25.380> on<00:03:25.560> the

but I've got some edging a strip on the
way<00:03:25.800> which<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.540> because<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.750> single<00:03:28.020> lip<00:03:28.290> on

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
way which is because of a single lip on

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.500 
way which is because of a single lip on
it<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.830> think<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.130> just<00:03:29.310> glue<00:03:29.490> it<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.790> I've

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
it and I think you just glue it on I've

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.830 
it and I think you just glue it on I've
still<00:03:30.780> yet<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.050> do<00:03:31.170> trim<00:03:31.560> around<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.840> window

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
still yet to do trim around the window

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.400 
still yet to do trim around the window
there<00:03:34.140> I've<00:03:34.860> got<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.840> yeah<00:03:36.840> where<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.290> here

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
there I've got the yeah where is it here

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.680 
there I've got the yeah where is it here
we<00:03:37.470> go<00:03:37.620> got<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.980> overhead<00:03:41.400> for<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
we go got the the overhead for the the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.290 
we go got the the overhead for the the
up<00:03:42.810> lighting<00:03:43.320> in<00:03:43.680> but<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.880> was<00:03:45.030> really

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
up lighting in but it was really

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.280 
up lighting in but it was really
difficult<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.780> screw<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.920> thing<00:03:47.160> up<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.640> the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
difficult to screw the thing up to the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.350 
difficult to screw the thing up to the
ceiling<00:03:49.580> because<00:03:50.580> obviously<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.060> can't

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
ceiling because obviously you can't

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.170 
ceiling because obviously you can't
pierce<00:03:52.100> you<00:03:53.100> can't<00:03:53.310> screw<00:03:53.550> things<00:03:53.760> onto<00:03:53.940> this

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
pierce you can't screw things onto this

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.570 
pierce you can't screw things onto this
you<00:03:54.300> can't<00:03:54.510> pierce<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.110> once<00:03:55.320> it's<00:03:55.530> up<00:03:55.710> so<00:03:56.460> what

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
you can't pierce it once it's up so what

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.300 
you can't pierce it once it's up so what
I<00:03:56.610> did<00:03:56.730> was<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.120> put<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.330> little<00:03:57.740> thin<00:03:58.740> bridges<00:03:59.160> of

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
I did was I put a little thin bridges of

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.730 
I did was I put a little thin bridges of
wood<00:03:59.510> into<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.630> structure<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.440> could<00:04:01.650> go

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
wood into the structure so I could go

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.170 
wood into the structure so I could go
straight<00:04:02.070> up<00:04:02.310> through<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.700> holes<00:04:03.060> for<00:04:04.020> the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
straight up through the holes for the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.640 
straight up through the holes for the
for<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.270> lighting<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:06.900> that's<00:04:07.080> how<00:04:07.260> it's<00:04:07.440> held

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
for the lighting so that's how it's held

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.740 
for the lighting so that's how it's held
up<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.040> heart<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.430> ceiling<00:04:08.940> but<00:04:09.450> all<00:04:09.600> the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750

ceiling done as well
everything<00:04:12.630> was<00:04:12.750> screwed<00:04:13.050> up<00:04:13.170> with<00:04:13.320> these

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
everything was screwed up with these

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.660 
everything was screwed up with these
little<00:04:15.170> little<00:04:16.170> screws<00:04:16.560> like<00:04:16.920> so<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.430> these
