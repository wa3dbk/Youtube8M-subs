other bits and bobs here and there and

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.899 
other bits and bobs here and there and
so<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.560> imagine<00:01:35.799> if<00:01:36.159> they're<00:01:36.490> going<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.670> do<00:01:36.760> more

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
so I imagine if they're going to do more

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
just a corker of a track and I think it

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.080 
just a corker of a track and I think it

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
completely sure about that maybe it was

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.499 
completely sure about that maybe it was

also<00:02:07.900> excellent<00:02:08.259> but<00:02:08.799> most<00:02:09.099> of<00:02:09.250> all<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.580> has<00:02:09.759> to

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
also excellent but most of all it has to

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.850 
also excellent but most of all it has to
be<00:02:10.090> banshee<00:02:10.929> boardwalk<00:02:11.470> because<00:02:11.680> i<00:02:11.709> think

that has had a remake but seriously that

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.210 
that has had a remake but seriously that
deserves<00:02:14.349> another<00:02:14.560> one<00:02:14.739> it's

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
deserves another one it's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
oh good and actually used to really

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.740

why I think there's something to do with
the<00:02:21.040> booze<00:02:21.280> because<00:02:21.790> they<00:02:21.880> didn't<00:02:22.060> look<00:02:22.150> like

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
it like me but unfortunately with too

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.460 
it like me but unfortunately with too
few<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:12.100> just<00:03:12.610> unlikely<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:13.840> very<00:03:14.080> unlikely

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
few it's just unlikely so very unlikely

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.350 
few it's just unlikely so very unlikely
however<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.400> doesn't<00:03:15.610> necessarily<00:03:15.820> spell

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
however that doesn't necessarily spell

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.270 
however that doesn't necessarily spell
doom<00:03:16.570> for<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.810> future<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.650> think<00:03:17.950> it's

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
doom for the future but I think it's

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.650 
doom for the future but I think it's
gonna<00:03:18.490> be<00:03:18.640> quite<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.910> long<00:03:19.120> time<00:03:19.150> before<00:03:19.420> we<00:03:19.630> see

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
pricey than some other companies but you

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.949 
pricey than some other companies but you
do<00:03:42.820> get<00:03:42.970> all<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.300> stuff<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.720> looks

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
do get all of this stuff and it looks

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.199 
do get all of this stuff and it looks
really<00:03:44.049> cool<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.560> begin<00:03:44.650> with<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.220> then<00:03:45.250> after

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
really cool to begin with and then after

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.640 
really cool to begin with and then after
a<00:03:46.239> while<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.570> just<00:03:46.600> sort<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:46.930> lose<00:03:47.200> interest

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
a while you just sort of lose interest

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.400 
a while you just sort of lose interest
very<00:03:48.130> very<00:03:48.549> rapidly<00:03:48.820> and<00:03:49.209> then<00:03:49.600> it's<00:03:50.260> just

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
very very rapidly and then it's just

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.020 
very very rapidly and then it's just
sort<00:03:50.739> of<00:03:50.769> taking<00:03:51.130> up<00:03:51.220> space<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.549> I'd<00:03:51.850> much

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
sort of taking up space so I'd much

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.460 
sort of taking up space so I'd much
rather<00:03:52.060> just<00:03:52.330> have<00:03:52.570> a<00:03:52.600> game<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:53.080> be<00:03:53.200> honest

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
rather just have a game to be honest

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.199 
rather just have a game to be honest

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
asked me do I think that the we use

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.330 
asked me do I think that the we use
Apple<00:04:01.870> should<00:04:02.110> be<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.350> thing<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:02.860> is<00:04:03.130> it

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
Apple should be a thing and is it

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.550 
Apple should be a thing and is it
potentially<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:04.000> virtual<00:04:04.690> reality<00:04:05.110> contender

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
potentially a virtual reality contender
