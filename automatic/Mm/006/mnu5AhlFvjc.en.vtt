on<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.510> river<00:02:02.800> staring<00:02:03.800> up<00:02:03.920> at<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.070> Cathedral

visiting<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.170> Cathedral<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:10.100> have<00:02:10.369> always

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
visiting the Cathedral I have always

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.910 
visiting the Cathedral I have always
thought<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.209> cathedral<00:02:11.780> as<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.140> dynamo

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
thought of the cathedral as a dynamo

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.310 
thought of the cathedral as a dynamo
it's<00:02:13.700> like<00:02:13.910> some<00:02:14.090> great<00:02:14.209> generator<00:02:14.870> up<00:02:15.140> there

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
it's like some great generator up there

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.110 
it's like some great generator up there
I<00:02:15.350> always<00:02:15.680> think<00:02:16.040> there's<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.280> buzz<00:02:16.550> about<00:02:16.760> it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
I always think there's a buzz about it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.330 
I always think there's a buzz about it
and<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.780> buzz<00:02:18.020> concerns<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.650> University<00:02:19.130> -

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
and the buzz concerns the University -

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.140 
and the buzz concerns the University -
and<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.760> think<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.270> out<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:20.959> all<00:02:21.230> of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
and to think that out of all of

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.670 
and to think that out of all of
potential<00:02:23.150> candidates<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.230> can<00:02:24.440> imagine

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
potential candidates and I can imagine

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.120 
potential candidates and I can imagine
whom<00:02:25.670> they<00:02:25.880> might<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.209> been<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:27.290> I've<00:02:27.470> come

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
whom they might have been that I've come

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.530 
whom they might have been that I've come
through<00:02:28.400> all<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.730> process<00:02:29.060> without

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
through all of that process without
