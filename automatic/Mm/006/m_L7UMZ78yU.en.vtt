00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.970
 the work is so good in this video of 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.160
 25 great online I will show you a 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.130
 secret a good instruct more than a 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.200
 exterior is a reference to the game of 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.540
 mario a mario everyone knows mario or 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.789
 they do not know mario and luigi then what 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.070
 good wave is a reference to mario and 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.259
 luigi good these are not represented 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.060
 with some hallucinogenic mushrooms but good 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.679
 before going into details and all that 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.679
 let's open our map 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.359
 true and good department since we 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.430
 we left we open our map and right now 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:37.370
 It usually gives you the exact location in the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.620
 map is down here are locate is more 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.969
 or less by the city center said 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.129
 franklin house is the cas 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.079
 franklin is something weird because then I 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.510
 I had never seen them but well there it is 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.380
 in the house and this limitation is that 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.050
 well let's go there 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.610
 and well, here we are in the house of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 franklin so then we got off 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.060
 our car to crash my car not you 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.470
 and I know that this is not going to stay 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.360
 so not to leave your car yes good in what 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.310
 that escaped me from the police we go with 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.080
 franklin because here in the and it does not come out 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.520
 we have to go with him because I do not know he's 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.570
 the one that mushrooms consume then 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.570
 I guess we have to go with him 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.700
 and good here we are with our 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.990
 franklin see here is the reference 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.960
 there are fungi as you know mario 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.620
 luigi and mario rojo luis verde a mario 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.850
 consume these mushrooms to grow for 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.430
 stay well hallucinated which is very 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.500
 big and can against everything there something very 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.720
 interesting this reference is that as 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.460
 you know mario is mario luigi this 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.800
 obviously everyone knows mario and luigi 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.270
 but as you know mario is the short 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.250
 mario is more downcast luigi is like this 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.650
 as longer and exactly is what 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.750
 we are seeing here not the red that is the 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.580
 mario color is like the fungus more 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 small and the green that is the color of 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.550
 luigi is longer because it's not like most 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.410
 long there yes it's practically that good 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.510
 a curious fact they knew that fungi 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.640
 who consume mario the red mushrooms the 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.240
 that make you grow those that make you 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.370
 big and huge equal to those these 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.080
 mushrooms and these exist in reality and 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.360
 It is a kind of fungus that is called 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.520
 amanita muscaria that good is one of the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.200
 more species this common fungi 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.510
 hallucinogens here you can see an image 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.640
 on the screen to see what the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.170
 little hand muskaria is exactly equal to 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.120
 mario eating fungus that is , 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.030
 that if they were based practically on the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 drugs and they came out stronger they knew 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.150
 that the flower that you eat after 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.510
 Eat the mushroom to throw balls of 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.430
 fire is the plant that those flowers this 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.830
 is the poppy that is the flower with which 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.930
 they do the cocaine as they see here too 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.580
 they have an image on the screen as they see 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.459
 it is exactly the same as the green stem and 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.010
 this orange flower is more or less like this 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.920
 good mario mario this is here in 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.360
 traveled not or everything that goes there 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.430
 he does not know fights against turtles and 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.950
 you crush mushrooms and it came to auster and 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.780
 you save the princess and you're just a 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.970
 plumber who for some reason can 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.250
 jump so high and you are invincible 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.720
 if when you eat those stars those 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.670
 stars is something that is not so 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.620
 drug addict but I believe that if it is not 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.560
 as you turn on colors not sales in 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.840
 the spectrum and well that's obviously there 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.150
 there are many things but although the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.950
 game make clear reference to drugs 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.440
 to strong drugs such as fungi 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.540
 hallucinogens and cocaine and everything 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.739
 whatever else there may be in there or 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.959
 some things 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.940
 out there more hidden than there should be but 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.280
 well that does not take away 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.350
 the sea ​​I am one of the best games 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.290
 of history and if then practically 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.580
 would this be the reference is very cool 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.820
 the mushrooms truth here that is in 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.130
 different sizes the colors and if all 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.990
 that's not the mushrooms that mario should eat 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.370
 as you also know those mushrooms is all 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.780
 the red ones are the ones that make you grow 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.490
 I said it and the greens, well, 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.260
 are the lives they did not put anymore 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.880
 references not the mushrooms of lives 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.640
 but at the same time they are mario and 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.790
 luigi and they are the colors and all that stuff 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.890
 that because if nothing else 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.230
 to escape the police I had to 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.770
 do a few strategies of 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.090
 parkour to climb to the roof I do not 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.740
 ask how I did it because I think 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.019
 that it was like fear not fear 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.630
 did go up there and now perhaps such 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.890
 After a few days but do not fall for nothing 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.810
 scare everyone and I hope you have them 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.080
 liked is for this video and even the 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.080
 next
