home I'm doing a little watering here

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.920 
home I'm doing a little watering here
with<00:00:14.849> my<00:00:15.059> watering<00:00:15.750> wand<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.940> a<00:00:17.940> few<00:00:18.690> things

with my watering wand and a few things

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.660 
with my watering wand and a few things
you<00:00:19.050> need<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.289> know<00:00:19.529> about<00:00:19.770> watering<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
you need to know about watering the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.300 
you need to know about watering the
first<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.210> don't<00:00:21.510> use<00:00:21.900> too<00:00:22.289> much<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:23.130> don't

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
first is don't use too much you don't

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
first is don't use too much you don't
want<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.519> use<00:00:23.670> more<00:00:24.060> water<00:00:24.090> than<00:00:25.050> your<00:00:25.260> plants

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
want to use more water than your plants

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.200 
want to use more water than your plants
actually<00:00:26.369> need<00:00:26.580> them<00:00:26.699> there<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> number<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
actually need them there are a number of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.589 
actually need them there are a number of
reasons<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.760> first<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> foremost<00:00:30.449> is

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
reasons for that first and foremost is

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.810 
reasons for that first and foremost is
water<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.050> becoming<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.679> precious<00:00:32.130> resource<00:00:32.610> we

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
water is becoming a precious resource we

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.200 
water is becoming a precious resource we
don't<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> waste<00:00:33.870> any<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.210> anything

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
don't want to waste any of it anything

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.660 
don't want to waste any of it anything
that<00:00:36.930> may<00:00:37.140> be<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> ground<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.190> liable<00:00:38.520> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
that may be on the ground is liable to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.459 
that may be on the ground is liable to
wash<00:00:38.879> into<00:00:39.180> your<00:00:39.390> local<00:00:39.750> watershed<00:00:40.290> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
wash into your local watershed and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.979 
wash into your local watershed and
become<00:00:40.829> pollution<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.390> want<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> give<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
become pollution so we want to give the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.250 
become pollution so we want to give the
plants<00:00:43.379> only<00:00:44.070> as<00:00:44.280> much<00:00:44.550> water<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.899> need

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
plants only as much water as they need

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470 
plants only as much water as they need
and<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> number<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.640> ways<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.329> do

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and there are a number of ways to do

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.080 
and there are a number of ways to do
that<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.350> probably<00:00:49.710> an<00:00:49.890> ideal<00:00:50.340> watering

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that so it's probably an ideal watering

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.510 
that so it's probably an ideal watering
system<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> vegetable<00:00:52.800> garden<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.219> called

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
system for a vegetable garden is called

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.110 
system for a vegetable garden is called
drip<00:00:53.969> irrigation<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> watering

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
drip irrigation and that's a a watering

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.470 
drip irrigation and that's a a watering
system<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.750> sort<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.789> planted<00:00:59.789> into<00:01:00.329> your

drip drip drip of water and that sinks

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.390 
drip drip drip of water and that sinks
down<00:01:07.710> deep<00:01:08.189> into<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> soil<00:01:09.290> which<00:01:10.290> forces<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
down deep into the soil which forces the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.530 
down deep into the soil which forces the
plants<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.210> grow<00:01:12.930> deep<00:01:13.650> roots<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.939> want<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
plants to grow deep roots we want the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.280 
plants to grow deep roots we want the
plants<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> grow<00:01:16.140> deep<00:01:16.680> roots<00:01:17.330> down<00:01:18.330> into<00:01:19.170> the

plants to grow deep roots down into the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.580 
plants to grow deep roots down into the
soil<00:01:19.590> rather<00:01:20.460> than<00:01:20.820> spreading<00:01:21.360> thin<00:01:22.259> roots

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
soil rather than spreading thin roots

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.850 
soil rather than spreading thin roots
over<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> surface<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.290> one<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> issues

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
over the surface and one of the issues

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.580 
over the surface and one of the issues
that<00:01:25.890> most<00:01:26.549> gardeners<00:01:27.420> beginning<00:01:28.170> gardeners

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that most gardeners beginning gardeners

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.090 
that most gardeners beginning gardeners
have<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.540> water<00:01:31.049> too<00:01:31.470> often<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
have is that they water too often and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.749 
have is that they water too often and
too<00:01:32.159> lightly<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> does<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
too lightly and what that does is it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.179 
too lightly and what that does is it
signals<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.659> plant<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> water<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
signals to the plant that the water to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
signals to the plant that the water to
be<00:01:38.340> had<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.479> surface<00:01:39.930> so

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
be had is really at the surface so

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.210 
be had is really at the surface so
rather<00:01:40.829> than<00:01:41.210> developing<00:01:42.210> big<00:01:42.540> deep<00:01:43.380> healthy

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
rather than developing big deep healthy

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.899 
rather than developing big deep healthy
root<00:01:44.460> systems<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.630> develop<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.500> fluff<00:01:47.280> flimsy

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
root systems they develop a fluff flimsy

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.840 
root systems they develop a fluff flimsy
system<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.930> roots<00:01:49.140> right<00:01:49.470> at<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.829> surface<00:01:50.070> we

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
system of roots right at the surface we

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.969 
system of roots right at the surface we
want<00:01:51.060> them<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> go<00:01:51.479> down<00:01:51.689> deep<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
want them to go down deep so we want the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.060 
want them to go down deep so we want the
water<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.939> saturate<00:01:54.780> deep<00:01:55.229> into<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> ground

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
water to saturate deep into the ground

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.179 
water to saturate deep into the ground
so<00:01:57.000> drip<00:01:57.390> irrigation<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.140> very<00:01:58.320> good<00:01:58.469> way<00:01:59.130> to

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
so drip irrigation is a very good way to

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.880 
so drip irrigation is a very good way to
get<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> water<00:02:00.060> saturated<00:02:00.930> deep<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
get the water saturated deep into the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.069 
get the water saturated deep into the
soil<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.399> force<00:02:02.670> those<00:02:02.880> roots<00:02:03.180> deep<00:02:03.450> another

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
soil and force those roots deep another

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.300 
soil and force those roots deep another
way<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.710> using<00:02:05.460> soaker<00:02:06.390> hose<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.799> hoses

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
way is using soaker hose and this hoses

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.479 
way is using soaker hose and this hoses
type<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.090> hose<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.539> made<00:02:09.929> out<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> usually<00:02:11.340> out

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
type of hose is made out of usually out

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.790 
type of hose is made out of usually out
of<00:02:11.520> recycled<00:02:12.390> tires

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
of recycled tires

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.340 
of recycled tires
and<00:02:13.920> what<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.670> does<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.210> when<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.420> turn<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.170> on

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and what it does is when you turn it on

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.990 
and what it does is when you turn it on
it<00:02:16.950> kind<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.460> oozes<00:02:18.330> out<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.590> hose<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.550> this

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it kind of oozes out of the hose so this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.960 
it kind of oozes out of the hose so this
wouldn't<00:02:21.240> be<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.510> much<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.690> permanent<00:02:22.970> fixture

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
wouldn't be so much a permanent fixture

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.800 
wouldn't be so much a permanent fixture
in<00:02:24.000> your<00:02:24.240> garden

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
in your garden

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.840 
in your garden
usually<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.530> looped<00:02:25.860> through<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.340> planting

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
usually it's looped through the planting

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.080 
usually it's looped through the planting
areas<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.540> sort<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.620> semi<00:02:29.070> buried<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.850> there

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
areas and sort of semi buried in there

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.810 
areas and sort of semi buried in there
so<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.990> when<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.770> turn<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.670> can

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
so that when you turn it on and you can

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.610 
so that when you turn it on and you can
do<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.720> can<00:02:33.840> put<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> timer

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
do that with a you can put it on a timer

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.060 
do that with a you can put it on a timer
as<00:02:34.890> well<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.730> gives<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.360> slow<00:02:37.140> using

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
as well it gives you a very slow using

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.720 
as well it gives you a very slow using
of<00:02:38.580> water<00:02:38.880> again<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.960> goes<00:02:40.440> deep<00:02:41.160> into<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
of water again that goes deep into the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.030 
of water again that goes deep into the
soil<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.390> feed<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.840> roots<00:02:43.050> down<00:02:43.260> there<00:02:43.650> our

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
soil and feed the roots down there our

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.850 
soil and feed the roots down there our
garden<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.760> still<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.030> kind<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.200> temporary<00:02:46.710> we

these beds that I built aren't going to
be<00:02:52.170> here<00:02:52.410> forever<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.010> we<00:02:53.160> haven't<00:02:53.370> put<00:02:53.700> in<00:02:53.850> a

I use the watering wand mainly to water

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.690 
I use the watering wand mainly to water
in<00:03:01.860> new<00:03:02.130> plants<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.570> water<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:04.700> individual

spots and what you want to do is not
water<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.390> plant<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:10.020> much<00:03:10.230> as<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:11.100> water<00:03:11.730> the

soil well getting the plants wet in a
bright<00:03:17.190> Sun<00:03:17.580> actually<00:03:17.940> can<00:03:18.900> damage<00:03:19.560> them<00:03:19.970> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
bright Sun actually can damage them the

bright Sun actually can damage them the
light<00:03:21.950> being<00:03:23.570> magnified<00:03:24.570> through<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.320> drops

on<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.520> leaves<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:27.150> hurt<00:03:27.360> them<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.440> we<00:03:28.620> don't

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
on the leaves can hurt them so we don't

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.199 
on the leaves can hurt them so we don't
like<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.070> do<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.370> too<00:03:29.550> much<00:03:29.580> in<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.000> bright

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
like to do this too much in the bright

like to do this too much in the bright
Sun<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:31.790> when<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.120> water<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.690> want<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.110> do

if you can in that way it gives the the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.900 
if you can in that way it gives the the
water<00:03:42.690> time<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.350> evaporate<00:03:43.800> during<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.700> day

one<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.110> biggest<00:03:46.920> dangers<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.550> plants<00:03:47.970> is

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
one of the biggest dangers to plants is

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.180 
one of the biggest dangers to plants is
fungi<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.980> course<00:03:50.190> they<00:03:50.340> like<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.880> moist

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
fungi and of course they like that moist

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.810 
fungi and of course they like that moist
environment<00:03:53.270> and<00:03:54.500> will<00:03:55.500> attack<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.250> plants

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
environment and will attack the plants

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.729 
environment and will attack the plants
if<00:03:57.630> they're<00:03:58.020> left<00:03:58.290> moist<00:03:59.280> overnight<00:04:00.739> finally

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
if they're left moist overnight finally

if they're left moist overnight finally
what<00:04:02.370> we<00:04:02.550> do<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:03.570> get<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.750> really<00:04:04.320> deep<00:04:04.530> soaking

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
what we do to get a really deep soaking

what we do to get a really deep soaking
of<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:06.420> garden<00:04:06.780> beds<00:04:07.020> is<00:04:07.290> put<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.190> hose<00:04:08.760> on<00:04:09.030> a

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
of the garden beds is put the hose on a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.990 
of the garden beds is put the hose on a
sprinkler<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.959> do<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.620> it's<00:04:11.220> not<00:04:11.459> optimum

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
sprinkler and do that it's not optimum

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.030 
sprinkler and do that it's not optimum
by<00:04:12.180> any<00:04:12.420> means<00:04:12.750> we'd<00:04:13.170> rather<00:04:13.350> have<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.680> drip

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
by any means we'd rather have the drip

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.880 
by any means we'd rather have the drip
irrigation<00:04:14.330> but<00:04:15.330> sometimes<00:04:16.140> we<00:04:16.320> really<00:04:16.560> need

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
irrigation but sometimes we really need

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.830 
irrigation but sometimes we really need
to<00:04:17.040> do<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:17.340> because<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.880> gets<00:04:18.030> very<00:04:18.090> hot<00:04:18.600> and

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
to do that because it gets very hot and

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.400 
to do that because it gets very hot and
dry<00:04:19.049> here<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.700> Washington<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.940> summer
