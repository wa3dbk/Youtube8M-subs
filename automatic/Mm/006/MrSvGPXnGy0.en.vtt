00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.519
 hello all guys you are agent charlie 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.099
 or welcome to my channel 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:10.370
 youtube as you can see in this first 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.019
 video I'm going to dedicate it to the new beta of 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.449
 world of warcraft mists of pandaria 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.570
 and to begin with he knows what is 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.970
 creating a panda ling monk to walk 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.770
 in that in the new race that may be 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.470
 so much order alliance and we will only go 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.720
 within the game and monk that the new 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.410
 class so without further ado let's 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.450
 start by creating our character 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.330
 as you can see how to create the 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.559
 characters has varied a bit now in 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.300
 instead of having down the typical arrow to 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.650
 change the ranges we have a 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.340
 preview to the right of the 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.470
 screen 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.230
 so we can legislate from the skin of 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.060
 face combed and to the right will go 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.920
 Changing 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.990
 man the truth is that it helps a little 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.960
 to make units what to wear more 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.600
 Quick 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.340
 for example we can create a panda 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.340
 It is not the typical black and white panda 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.610
 a face yes 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.610
 serious t 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.810
 hair colors right now there's not much 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.750
 and beautiful facials 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.320
 We have different types of beards 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.780
 the same is well 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.490
 now let's keep the name 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.080
 charly 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.440
 and for inside 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.260
 we're level 1 and we're going to start with 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.550
 the slight or of this kind on the island 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.610
 wandering 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.550
 I will try to explain how it is 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.460
 and well here we have the beginning as 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.010
 you can see a beta 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.520
 and we will make a lot of people 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.510
 to start good panda things like 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.900
 you can see above on the left or 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:05.100
 uses energy like the rogues and these 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.920
 four circuits that are here are one 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.050
 new 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.470
 a new statistic so to speak 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.550
 that we will fill with skills and 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.620
 that then we will have other skills 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.120
 to consume them 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.500
 as we can see in the racial 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.870
 we have the fierce tiger style 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.200
 well I said at the beginning the pandas 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.780
 may be so that hitler and dps by 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.980
 example the art style and I 'd prefer it would be 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.340
 of dps and having it active makes our 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.830
 damage is increased by 20% 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.810
 we have a racial one called palm 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.640
 sedative that comes is an incapacitated 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.860
 It has two minutes of use as 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.600
 you can read and basically incapacitate 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.740
 for four seconds 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.700
 another grace of the boom yes yes my English 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.640
 pathetic does not fail me is something like 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.150
 dock or bounce that basically makes 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.840
 the damage of the falls is reduced half 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.750
 double passive ration handle 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.450
 epikurean I do not know what it means but the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.480
 translation basically is that the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.440
 benefits of meals will double 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.710
 OK 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.020
 this passive struggle 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.750
 who comes to tell us that depending on 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.130
 the one of the weapon that we have equipped 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.350
 our fighting style will be one 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.960
 way of the style as well as the 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.090
 damage that we do and what it will cost us 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.959
 the abilities 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.370
 guzmÃ¡n is something like a I believe 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.260
 basically our cooking skill 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.900
 the souls we can use grow 15% 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.080
 we can use canes and weapons up 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.450
 of two hands and one hand we can use 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.130
 axes more adapted fist weapons 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.520
 our armor is leather 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.610
 and we can also use cloth obviously 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.160
 we have another race that without the pee 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.050
 as well as peace for interior 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.490
 which basically says that the experience 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.030
 what we get 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.530
 when we are in places of rest 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.620
 get twice as fast as normal 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:23.639
 and next page right now we have 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.639
 to give passives to tiger blows 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.750
 I think it basically tells us that 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.919
 We have a 10 percent chance of winning it from 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.139
 gain stability with our car 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.900
 attack and when we win it in our 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.879
 attack speed increased by 50% and 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.190
 It also makes our following 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.529
 four car until they cause an attack 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.810
 extra 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:45.490
 and finally the path of the monk 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.500
 that depending on the weapons that 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.630
 let's give us some advantages or other 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.090
 if we carry weapons with one hand our 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.720
 our car attack our damage 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.940
 attack will be increased by 40% and if 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.210
 We carry two-handed weapons speed 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.470
 of attack will be increased by 40% and 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.530
 like talking a lot and I'm not doing 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.389
 nothing we go before to good first mission 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.250
 and a lot to learn and tried the 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.410
 missions but I do not want to stop either 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.800
 a lot because if you do not forget they're going to be 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.760
 very long and boring is an egg 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.210
 basically talk to the teacher yes that 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.000
 we have it here in front 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.680
 if you want to read it whole and some steps 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.220
 very fast to use it and you read it with 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.220
 tranquility 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.920
 we deliver and the first mission we 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.430
 says we get a couple of sales of 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.720
 combat as you can see from the 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.630
 expansion in which we are 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.460
 in the cataclysm used since 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.410
 the objects shine when we go to 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.090
 pick it up so here is easy you 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.889
 is in progress 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:51.249
 we come that the right opens 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:54.009
 and we take the 22 bandages to equip the 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:57.569
 we open inventories of the right and 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.569
 equipped we deliver 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.680
 and second mission completed next 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.360
 mission destroy 5 objectives of 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.159
 training 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.159
 objective training as you can 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:11.379
 see has unmarked us and would teach us the 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:14.319
 map but as it happens right now it is not 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.030
 put in the Spanish version so 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.439
 we get to mark the area where you are 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.139
 in missions but we can not see anything 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:22.870
 I'm really sorry because the truth is that 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.360
 pretty nice but good 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.250
 Well let's kill our goals 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.280
 workouts in the first life that 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.490
 we have it's called stability 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.520
 It costs 40 energy and makes 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.530
 hit the target we make it 226 of 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.720
 damage and we generate if what you documented at 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.420
 principle if we use it as you can see 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.840
 up here the elche circle is going 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.840
 increasing 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:53.250
 there are two points three points four points 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.900
 while outside combat and think not 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.800
 reduces or I think that if we get to 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.800
 four remain four 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.710
 as a good vein in which we are 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.140
 chase I escape to fall 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.500
 they commented that it was very unstable 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:12.770
 right now take two for three falls 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.639
 fail any 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.639
 of everything
