00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.169
 Oh 5 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:18.430
 Hello, this is the lecture . 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.990
 Through lectures, complete with volume control and finished the encounter is one grain of Choi, Sung - Soo 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.489
 is 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:29.590
 If you do not know how and how to adjust the volume yet 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:31.000
 Please refer to the volume control method of the YouTube 쏭 Master series channel. 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.940
 wish 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.890
 Alto Saxophone Mac's suit 3 / does not enter a minor key 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.499
 I will play. 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:50.499
 Volume adjustment method In practice, it is basically recommended to practice by breaking off by each node 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:53.760
 However, in the easy-to- repeat section, you can practice by repeating 4 words. 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.760
 Hageteupnida of the river 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.940
 Let's start with the first part of the song. 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:06.290
 When you start the first time, 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:10.610
 It gradually decreases from the second node to the t crescendo 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:16.159
 The third node n Let's keep it small as it is. 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:20.170
 The fourth node will be gradually reduced to the council d crescendo 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.170
 I will continue to index my node. 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.940
 soo ah 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.380
 Lifetime 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:52.870
 This section has various symbols of the first word 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:55.030
 Initially starting small, the crescendo gradually grew, 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.050
 It got a little bigger. 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:04.930
 My second cancer is chemically small. 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:09.759
 After that, the smaller the second node, the smaller it becomes. 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.260
 This part points to give yanked gradually larger volume as guided 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.140
 Points 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:20.820
 The third measure is the fourth word you see smaller volumes as small 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.820
 I 'll try my next to measure. 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.560
 U 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.130
 In this section, the first note is the same as the first note, but the volume control 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.760
 There is a difference. 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.530
 The first segment starts small and gradually grows into Class India. 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.580
 Getting smaller 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.810
 The next taste will be gradually smaller in the city 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:09.140
 The third measure is also similar in the two bars and adjust the volume of the front 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.980
 It's getting bigger and bigger . 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.690
 The next one will be gradually smaller . 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.690
 I will continue to recognize my node. 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.800
 With total eyes 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.550
 Sound 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.709
 These two are equal to the volume and volume controls of the second section 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.069
 Because of 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:58.090
 You can adjust the volume as described. 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:04:01.680
 As mentioned earlier point is to check out the small stand larger volumes 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.680
 I will try mg followed by two words 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.970
 Oo 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.970
 Oo 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:23.740
 These two words gradually grow up to the crescendo 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:28.060
 When the bass falls down, 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.960
 In two octaves means if yireotdago to fall over the banks means breath 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.910
 If you think you drop it, it will be easier 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.910
 I'll continue with the two ng. 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.040
 Two Room 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.040
 a home 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:58.570
 This segment begins small in Lala. 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.250
 It gradually grows from city to class, then becomes smaller and smaller. 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:10.290
 You can do it. 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:10.290
 Let's coming already then keep the two in this way when blown affair 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.230
 towel to a 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:33.620
 This one started small in the trial, 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.880
 Ignore it a little bigger than mexoforte. 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:41.560
 You can also be a d class in beauty and do it slowly. 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.560
 Let's do two words followed by mg. 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.540
 qoo 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.540
 U 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.210
 This Marie starts slightly a little later on the next week Forte 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.360
 It has to be small. 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:15.640
 Once you get out on the road, you should gradually grow to Forte until next time. 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:18.720
 You can blow it all the way to Forte, and it will gradually decrease from the last wave. 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.720
 Let's ng it. 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.860
 Tung operations 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:43.769
 This segment begins with Forte. 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:45.419
 To start from the beginning greatly to Forte gradually over a significant blow the final straight 

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:48.439
 It will be smaller. 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.439
 Let's do the mg. 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.710
 Review 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
 Oo
