00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.730
 like the main thing that she was pretty 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.010
 thick so that it does not flow out later 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.800
 and starting with what I cook 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.590

 We lived together in Moscow so 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.759
 while yeast tune itself in russia 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 Here, in principle, there is time you can paint 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.930
 even twice something was more than you 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.700
 feels this flour i sieved added 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.720

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:50.540
 and mix well the dough a little bit 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.540
 shuffled by this time I lived 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:59.090
 yeast prominent as they rose and all 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:02.960
 poured here to the general test it right now 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.780
 you all spoon him neatly here I 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.069
 added a yeast talker and now 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.870
 I will take small portions of milk 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.800
 a little mind all carefully mix 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.970
 Well , I'm all well mixed dough 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.380
 it turns out pretty 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.330
 still show to she is very sticky to hands 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.070
 but at the same time it does not spread it 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.489
 pretty keeping shape then if so 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.290
 I put it so it remains now I 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.860
 something towel al plate I 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.019
 I'll cover 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.530
 and leave for 15 minutes a little dough 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.880
 rested gluten swollen dough will 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.280
 Stir the dough easier then it is a little 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.310
 I stood now I will be small 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.320
 enter vegetable oil in portions and 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.940
 knead well when it is butter 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.070
 I’m going to add the following 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.850
 a portion of all the butter I put in the dough 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.810
 it turns out that 's pretty much the same 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.930
 soft can be very well said not liquid 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.329
 but he is so tough now 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.239
 put it on the table and knead the veto 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.299
 well, 10-15 minutes at least ten minutes 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.290
 need to knead so that the dough is filled 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:24.109
 Oxygenated and pies were then more 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:27.200
 air dough and well you prevented it 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.420
 I have become more so she is 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.730
 changed in texture after i 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.590
 I could and did n’t bother but she still remained 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.870
 that's so sticky that's when I knead 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.329
 kneading without flour just on the table she 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.239
 I was very stuck to the table and fall 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.769
 ripped off all the time 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.190
 did not knead you do not be afraid that she 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.109
 be so sticky I put the dough in 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.300
 bowl where it will approach me to you 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:54.800
 there must be a rather large volumetric 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.630
 now I will cover with a slightly wet towel and 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.620
 leave to climb forty minutes 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.850
 five o'clock but depending on the house you warm 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:10.020
 I got the dough for the first time I 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.590
 put it down and put it somewhere else 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.870
 for an hour so that it came a second time 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.750
 I have a good dough now I 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.109
 lay it on the work surface 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.750
 a little with flour 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:28.650
 Well, now I will divide the dough into 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:33.060
 portion portions such pieces which 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.090
 there will be me pies well here I am dough 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.010
 divided into such portions 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:42.990
 Now we will cover the top with a towel and 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:45.600
 leave for 3-4 minutes 4 minutes have passed 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.380
 and now every bit I will 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.150
 roll out 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:54.600
 not very thin such billet for me 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.180
 it turned out thin now I'll 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.550
 overlay the stuffing today here do 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.760
 apple jam she's just to herself 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:07.010
 thick and does not leak 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:10.010
 Now wring so why Liu 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.010
 firewood 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.720
 and seam down I'll be laid out on 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.090
 parchment the first batch of pies on 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.670
 baking tray and spread them out pretty much 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.610
 loosely far apart as 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.340
 now I will leave them 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.380
 insist somewhere for half an hour 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.930
 a towel so that they are not weatherburned 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.180
 and give them rest they should 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.510
 I increase a little Volodya horns from me 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.300
 a little bit came up and now in 10 minutes 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.210
 before putting in the oven i 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:48.050
 smear them with bits of egg and eggs in the recipe 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.820
 did not indicate so it is your business to lubricate 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.700
 or not i just like them when 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:58.150
 pies getting more blush and therefore 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.150
 before baking i'm smearing the egg 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.630
 Well , 10 minutes have passed now put 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:09.800
 pies in a preheated oven to 180 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:13.090
 degrees watch until they become 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.490
 such blush it will take it minutes 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.870
