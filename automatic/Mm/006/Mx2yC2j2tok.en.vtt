00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
screen and just a lot of dim places

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.450 
screen and just a lot of dim places
where<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> bulb<00:00:33.930> wasn't<00:00:34.350> getting<00:00:34.620> too<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.190> if

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
where the bulb wasn't getting too so if

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.209 
where the bulb wasn't getting too so if
you<00:00:35.910> remember<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.780> last<00:00:37.110> video<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.770> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you remember from that last video that I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.970 
you remember from that last video that I
put<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.719> bulbs<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.260> was<00:00:40.379> using<00:00:40.559> were

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
put up the bulbs that I was using were

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.660 
put up the bulbs that I was using were
these<00:00:41.309> old<00:00:42.120> game<00:00:42.660> gear<00:00:42.960> bulbs<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> can

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
these old game gear bulbs and as you can

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.750 
these old game gear bulbs and as you can
see<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:45.649> they're<00:00:46.649> definitely<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:47.129> rounded

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
see here they're definitely not rounded

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.510 
see here they're definitely not rounded
on<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.360> outside<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> same<00:00:49.739> shape<00:00:50.340> as

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
on the outside here the same shape as

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
on the outside here the same shape as
this<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> managed<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> do<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.289> I

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
this one but what I managed to do as I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
this one but what I managed to do as I
took<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.370> these<00:00:53.460> old<00:00:53.640> game<00:00:53.910> gear<00:00:54.149> tubes

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
took two of these old game gear tubes

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.930 
took two of these old game gear tubes
and<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.140> tied<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.649> two<00:00:55.680> ends<00:00:56.039> together<00:00:56.280> here

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and I tied the two ends together here

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420 
and I tied the two ends together here
using<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> piece<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> wire<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> wired

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
using a piece of wire and then I wired

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.330 
using a piece of wire and then I wired
in<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.850> two<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.600> kind<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.989> replicate<00:01:01.649> this

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
in these two to kind of replicate this

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.670 
in these two to kind of replicate this
tube<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.719> it's<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> perfect<00:01:04.110> replication

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
tube here it's not a perfect replication

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.370 
tube here it's not a perfect replication
because<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> assume<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.450> mean<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.720> didn't<00:01:07.260> have

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
because I assume I mean I didn't have

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.719 
because I assume I mean I didn't have
this<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.860> brand<00:01:08.130> new<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.460> assume

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this one it was brand new but I assume

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.039 
this one it was brand new but I assume
this<00:01:08.880> thing<00:01:09.060> put<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.360> quite<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.900> light

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this thing put out quite a bit of light

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.980 
this thing put out quite a bit of light
and<00:01:10.260> around<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.280> back<00:01:11.520> part<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.720> was

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and around this back part here this was

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.780 
and around this back part here this was
a<00:01:13.020> pretty<00:01:13.560> essential<00:01:13.950> part<00:01:14.369> but

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
a pretty essential part but

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.399 
a pretty essential part but
unfortunately<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> couldn't<00:01:15.780> get<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.170> with

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
unfortunately I couldn't get that with

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.679 
unfortunately I couldn't get that with
these<00:01:16.950> tubes<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.360> could<00:01:18.600> have

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
these tubes here I know I could have

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.270 
these tubes here I know I could have
gone<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> route<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> buying<00:01:19.590> some<00:01:19.860> LEDs<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
gone the route of buying some LEDs and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920 
gone the route of buying some LEDs and
installing<00:01:20.880> those<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.509> maybe<00:01:21.689> gone<00:01:21.900> a

different route may be trying to get one

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.210 
different route may be trying to get one

thought<00:01:36.720> I'd<00:01:36.840> try<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.079> see<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.470> could<00:01:37.530> get

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
thought I'd try and see if I could get

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.010 
thought I'd try and see if I could get
it<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.070> least<00:01:38.220> turn<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.630> figured

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it to at least turn on but I figured

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.719 
it to at least turn on but I figured
I'll<00:01:40.110> show<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> system<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.579> is

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
I'll show you the system here this is

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.039 
I'll show you the system here this is
with<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.030> all<00:01:42.119> put<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:42.390> together<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.960> can

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
with it all put back together as you can

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.319 
with it all put back together as you can
see<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.500> seen<00:01:43.680> better<00:01:43.710> days<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:45.060> front<00:01:45.299> part

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.810 
see it's seen better days the front part
of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> screen<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.470> pretty<00:01:47.040> scratched

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
up pretty dull in some places but for

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.030 
up pretty dull in some places but for
the<00:01:51.869> most<00:01:52.020> part<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.560> know<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.829> back

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
right here I took those off just for

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.359 
right here I took those off just for
testing<00:02:00.180> purposes<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.159> this<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
testing purposes and this is the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.190 
testing purposes and this is the
cartridge<00:02:02.729> slot<00:02:02.969> here<00:02:03.360> what's<00:02:03.659> nice<00:02:03.840> about<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
cartridge slot here what's nice about it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.150 
cartridge slot here what's nice about it
is<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.979> does<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.490> AV<00:02:06.270> outs<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.129> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
is it does have AV outs so if you have a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.550 
is it does have AV outs so if you have a
plug<00:02:08.550> which<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.149> might<00:02:09.420> wind<00:02:09.660> up<00:02:09.810> making<00:02:10.259> up

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560

so as you can see here here's the screen

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.710 
so as you can see here here's the screen
now<00:03:26.680> there's<00:03:27.010> still<00:03:27.250> some<00:03:27.459> dark<00:03:27.699> spots<00:03:28.030> on<00:03:28.329> the

now there's still some dark spots on the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.319 
now there's still some dark spots on the
right<00:03:28.959> side<00:03:29.319> and<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.709> little<00:03:30.669> a<00:03:30.819> couple<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.180> dark

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
right side and a little a couple of dark

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.020 
right side and a little a couple of dark
spots<00:03:31.449> on<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.840> left<00:03:32.049> side<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.530> does<00:03:32.769> have

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
spots on the left side but it does have

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.400 
spots on the left side but it does have
enough<00:03:34.030> color<00:03:34.359> to<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.019> where<00:03:35.169> i<00:03:35.199> can

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
enough color to it to where i can

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.250 
enough color to it to where i can
actually<00:03:35.440> play<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.019> lights

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
actually play it this is with the lights

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.289 
actually play it this is with the lights
on<00:03:38.560> here<00:03:38.919> so<00:03:39.129> at<00:03:39.250> least<00:03:39.370> i<00:03:39.549> can<00:03:39.609> get<00:03:39.849> a<00:03:39.879> somewhat

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
on here so at least i can get a somewhat

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.869 
on here so at least i can get a somewhat
you<00:03:41.109> know<00:03:41.139> reasonable<00:03:41.919> picture<00:03:42.459> with<00:03:42.669> it

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
you know reasonable picture with it

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.819 
you know reasonable picture with it
before<00:03:43.329> like<00:03:43.690> i<00:03:43.840> said<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.139> whole<00:03:44.349> thing<00:03:44.650> was

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
before like i said the whole thing was

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.129 
before like i said the whole thing was
just<00:03:44.980> completely<00:03:45.370> dark<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.780> could<00:03:46.989> not

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
just completely dark and you could not

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.129 
just completely dark and you could not
see<00:03:47.410> anything<00:03:47.819> this<00:03:48.819> dark<00:03:49.180> spot<00:03:49.449> on<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.840> sides

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
see anything this dark spot on the sides

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.839 
see anything this dark spot on the sides
here<00:03:50.470> this<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:50.829> basically<00:03:51.160> caused<00:03:51.459> from<00:03:51.669> not

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
here this is basically caused from not

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.569 
here this is basically caused from not
having<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.209> rounded<00:03:52.690> tube<00:03:52.959> but<00:03:53.370> let's<00:03:54.370> kill

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
having that rounded tube but let's kill

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.970 
having that rounded tube but let's kill
the<00:03:54.699> lights<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:58.440> kind<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.530> see<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.829> little

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
the lights and kind of see it a little

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.490 
the lights and kind of see it a little
bit<00:04:00.129> better<00:04:00.340> here<00:04:00.669> this<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.690> what<00:04:02.199> it<00:04:02.319> looks

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
bit better here this is what it looks

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.189 
bit better here this is what it looks
like<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:02.709> it's<00:04:03.040> definitely<00:04:03.489> playable<00:04:04.239> like<00:04:05.079> I

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
like so it's definitely playable like I

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.680 
like so it's definitely playable like I
said<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.620> with<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.220> angle<00:04:06.669> it<00:04:06.909> changes<00:04:07.629> a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
said it with the angle it changes a

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.110 
said it with the angle it changes a
little<00:04:07.930> bit<00:04:08.079> so<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.799> can<00:04:09.069> see<00:04:09.220> you<00:04:09.790> know<00:04:09.909> a

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
little bit so you can see you know a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.879 
little bit so you can see you know a
little<00:04:10.449> bit<00:04:10.599> less<00:04:10.870> if<00:04:11.079> you<00:04:11.169> turn<00:04:11.349> it<00:04:11.470> down<00:04:11.500> like

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
little bit less if you turn it down like

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.349 
little bit less if you turn it down like
this<00:04:12.129> you<00:04:12.489> can<00:04:12.609> see<00:04:12.729> a<00:04:12.760> little<00:04:12.940> bit<00:04:13.030> more<00:04:13.239> if

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
this you can see a little bit more if

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.960 
this you can see a little bit more if
you<00:04:13.479> turn<00:04:13.659> it<00:04:13.780> up<00:04:13.900> like<00:04:14.349> this<00:04:14.879> depends<00:04:15.879> on<00:04:15.909> the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
you turn it up like this depends on the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.710 
you turn it up like this depends on the
angle<00:04:16.150> but<00:04:16.419> it<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:17.349> playable<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.720> it's

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
angle but it is playable so it's

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.779 
angle but it is playable so it's
something<00:04:19.930> I'm<00:04:20.139> pretty<00:04:20.349> happy<00:04:20.560> about<00:04:20.789> just

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
something I'm pretty happy about just

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.310 
something I'm pretty happy about just
kind<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.360> little<00:04:22.539> bit<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.900> an<00:04:23.050> experiment

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
kind of a little bit of an experiment

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.390 
kind of a little bit of an experiment
here<00:04:23.710> with<00:04:23.860> some<00:04:23.979> of<00:04:24.070> these<00:04:24.130> fluorescent

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
here with some of these fluorescent

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.290 
here with some of these fluorescent
bulbs<00:04:24.909> but

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
bulbs but

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.180 
bulbs but
it<00:04:25.360> finally<00:04:25.990> got<00:04:26.199> it<00:04:26.319> to<00:04:26.440> where<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.800> will<00:04:26.949> turn

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
it finally got it to where it will turn

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.490 
it finally got it to where it will turn
on<00:04:27.400> if<00:04:28.090> i<00:04:28.180> press<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.539> start<00:04:28.840> button<00:04:28.870> which<00:04:29.349> is

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
on if i press the start button which is

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:37.200 
on if i press the start button which is
over<00:04:29.830> here<00:04:35.190> can<00:04:36.190> kind<00:04:36.430> of<00:04:36.460> hear<00:04:36.580> this<00:04:36.789> speaker

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
over here can kind of hear this speaker

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.540 
over here can kind of hear this speaker
is<00:04:37.300> actually<00:04:37.659> really<00:04:38.020> loud<00:04:38.319> and<00:04:38.680> it's<00:04:39.340> not<00:04:39.520> a

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
capacitor issue with the other tube the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.499 
capacitor issue with the other tube the
other<00:04:41.860> tube<00:04:42.099> is<00:04:42.250> just<00:04:42.490> really<00:04:42.909> bad<00:04:43.120> it's<00:04:43.389> just

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
other tube is just really bad it's just

other tube is just really bad it's just
shot<00:04:43.960> oh<00:04:44.259> that's<00:04:45.190> changing<00:04:45.639> the<00:04:45.759> light

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
shot oh that's changing the light

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.230 
shot oh that's changing the light
brightness<00:04:47.280> trying<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.340> do<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> soon<00:04:48.819> the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
brightness trying to do the soon the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:57.330 
brightness trying to do the soon the
dark<00:04:49.449> here<00:04:49.690> but<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:55.030> does<00:04:55.210> get<00:04:55.389> quite<00:04:55.569> loud<00:04:56.340> but

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
dark here but it does get quite loud but

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.820 
dark here but it does get quite loud but
nonetheless<00:04:58.120> at<00:04:58.780> least<00:04:59.020> it<00:04:59.169> came<00:04:59.349> out<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.530> it

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
nonetheless at least it came out and it

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.830 
nonetheless at least it came out and it
does<00:04:59.979> work<00:05:00.250> you<00:05:00.669> know<00:05:00.789> everything<00:05:01.599> still

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
does work you know everything still

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.149 
does work you know everything still
works<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:02.259> can<00:05:02.409> over<00:05:02.919> on<00:05:03.069> do<00:05:05.370> no<00:05:06.370> job<00:05:07.680> but<00:05:08.680> it

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
works you can over on do no job but it

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:10.830 
works you can over on do no job but it
does<00:05:09.370> depend<00:05:09.550> on<00:05:09.789> the<00:05:09.909> game<00:05:10.090> some<00:05:10.419> games<00:05:10.629> look

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
does depend on the game some games look

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.520 
does depend on the game some games look
much<00:05:11.050> much<00:05:11.289> better<00:05:12.389> with<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.629> with<00:05:14.409> the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
much much better with the with the

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.070 
much much better with the with the
backlight<00:05:14.889> in<00:05:15.039> there<00:05:15.219> as<00:05:16.120> an<00:05:16.360> example<00:05:16.719> let's

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
backlight in there as an example let's

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.959 
backlight in there as an example let's
turn<00:05:17.379> this<00:05:17.500> back<00:05:17.710> on<00:05:17.740> here<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:18.340> hope<00:05:18.550> that<00:05:18.759> the

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
turn this back on here and hope that the

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.200 
turn this back on here and hope that the
other<00:05:19.120> one<00:05:19.300> goes<00:05:19.539> in<00:05:19.830> quite<00:05:20.830> easily<00:05:21.039> pop<00:05:22.000> this
