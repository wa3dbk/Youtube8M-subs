several years ago to three years ago

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.140 
several years ago to three years ago
when<00:00:21.860> we<00:00:21.890> started<00:00:22.010> to<00:00:22.369> make<00:00:22.460> these<00:00:22.640> signature

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
when we started to make these signature

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.260 
when we started to make these signature
guitars<00:00:24.190> that<00:00:25.190> was<00:00:25.340> the<00:00:25.460> first<00:00:25.670> relationship

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
guitars that was the first relationship

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.380 
guitars that was the first relationship
with<00:00:26.450> fender<00:00:26.780> and<00:00:27.550> since<00:00:28.550> then<00:00:28.760> we've<00:00:28.970> you

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
with fender and since then we've you

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.670 
with fender and since then we've you
know<00:00:29.450> we<00:00:29.600> had<00:00:29.690> talked<00:00:29.930> about<00:00:30.020> doing<00:00:30.410> an<00:00:30.530> app

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
know we had talked about doing an app

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.190 
know we had talked about doing an app
and<00:00:31.010> and<00:00:31.390> they've<00:00:32.390> been<00:00:32.570> making<00:00:32.719> me<00:00:32.960> several

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
and and they've been making me several

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.549 
and and they've been making me several
prototypes<00:00:34.329> and<00:00:35.329> this<00:00:35.600> let<00:00:35.840> this<00:00:36.079> last<00:00:36.320> one

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
prototypes and this let this last one

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.049 
prototypes and this let this last one
that<00:00:36.590> they<00:00:36.800> did<00:00:36.829> is<00:00:37.160> I<00:00:37.370> think<00:00:37.430> it's<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.789> fourth

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
that they did is I think it's the fourth

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.900 
that they did is I think it's the fourth
or<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:38.300> fifth<00:00:38.420> prototype<00:00:39.230> is<00:00:39.550> great<00:00:40.550> it's<00:00:40.820> the

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
or the fifth prototype is great it's the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.790 
or the fifth prototype is great it's the
one<00:00:41.150> I<00:00:41.420> mean<00:00:41.750> I<00:00:41.840> kind<00:00:42.140> of<00:00:42.230> knew<00:00:42.350> what<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:42.560> wanted

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
one I mean I kind of knew what I wanted

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.430 
one I mean I kind of knew what I wanted
you<00:00:43.220> know<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.329> whole<00:00:44.450> idea<00:00:44.750> by<00:00:44.989> they're

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
you know the whole idea by they're

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.540 
you know the whole idea by they're
called<00:00:45.650> inspired<00:00:46.130> by<00:00:46.370> amps<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.060> it's<00:00:47.900> um<00:00:48.550> it

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
called inspired by amps and it's um it

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.340 
called inspired by amps and it's um it
simply<00:00:49.970> means<00:00:50.150> that<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:50.480> take<00:00:50.690> an<00:00:50.840> existing

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
simply means that you take an existing

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.290 
simply means that you take an existing
product<00:00:51.649> that<00:00:51.920> they<00:00:52.040> have<00:00:52.220> an<00:00:52.430> existing<00:00:52.880> amp

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
product that they have an existing amp

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.630 
product that they have an existing amp
and<00:00:53.540> you<00:00:53.570> make<00:00:54.230> upgrades<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:54.950> changes<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.430> I

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
and you make upgrades and changes that I

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.130 
and you make upgrades and changes that I
normally<00:00:56.060> would<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:56.480> know<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:56.600> would<00:00:56.810> not

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
normally would you know I would not

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.470 
normally would you know I would not
change<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.890> speakers<00:00:58.309> mainly<00:00:58.730> this<00:00:59.149> amp<00:00:59.390> is

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
change the speakers mainly this amp is

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.600 
change the speakers mainly this amp is
actually<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.899> simplified<00:01:00.530> version<00:01:00.770> of<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.160> the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
actually a simplified version of the the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.880 
actually a simplified version of the the
current<00:01:02.600> hot<00:01:02.870> rod<00:01:03.079> deville<00:01:03.380> it's<00:01:03.559> actually<00:01:03.829> a

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
current hot rod deville it's actually a

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.590 
current hot rod deville it's actually a
single<00:01:04.159> channel<00:01:04.610> amp<00:01:04.909> but<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.299> has<00:01:05.420> two

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
single channel amp but it has two

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.840 
single channel amp but it has two
volumes<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.200> can<00:01:06.409> switch<00:01:06.619> between

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
volumes that you can switch between

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.730 
volumes that you can switch between
volume<00:01:07.850> 1<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.149> volume<00:01:08.329> 2<00:01:08.899> and<00:01:09.380> there's<00:01:09.619> no

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
volume 1 and volume 2 and there's no

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.270 
volume 1 and volume 2 and there's no
master<00:01:09.979> volume<00:01:10.490> on<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:11.440> so<00:01:12.440> it's<00:01:12.620> just<00:01:12.979> kind<00:01:13.220> of

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
master volume on it so it's just kind of

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.180 
master volume on it so it's just kind of
like<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.600> great<00:01:14.600> platform<00:01:15.260> for<00:01:15.350> pedals<00:01:15.890> and

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
like a great platform for pedals and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.240 
like a great platform for pedals and
just<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.180> real<00:01:17.390> solid<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:18.799> 12<00:01:19.070> amp

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.429 

I've<00:01:23.250> never<00:01:23.759> been<00:01:23.969> a<00:01:24.030> fan<00:01:24.329> of<00:01:24.360> master<00:01:24.990> volumes

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
I've never been a fan of master volumes

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.130 
I've never been a fan of master volumes
they<00:01:25.920> always<00:01:26.520> sound<00:01:26.759> kind<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.420> artificial<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
they always sound kind of artificial to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.300 
they always sound kind of artificial to
me<00:01:28.289> and<00:01:28.500> also<00:01:29.340> channel<00:01:29.969> switching<00:01:30.390> amps<00:01:31.310> they

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
me and also channel switching amps they

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.630 
me and also channel switching amps they
never<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:32.820> work<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.210> me<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:34.490> like<00:01:35.490> in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
never really work for me because like in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
never really work for me because like in
a<00:01:35.969> hotrod<00:01:36.179> ability<00:01:36.780> original<00:01:37.229> when<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.500> share

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
a hotrod ability original when you share

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.029 
a hotrod ability original when you share
an<00:01:38.130> EQ<00:01:38.520> section<00:01:39.439> for<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.500> clean<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
an EQ section for the clean and the

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.090 
an EQ section for the clean and the
overdrive<00:01:41.340> there's<00:01:42.270> never<00:01:42.450> one<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.170> EQ

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
overdrive there's never one like EQ

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
overdrive there's never one like EQ
setting<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> could<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.409> work<00:01:46.409> for

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
setting that you could get that work for

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.859 
setting that you could get that work for
both<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.069> clean<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
both the clean and the and that the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.230 
both the clean and the and that the
dirty<00:01:49.110> side<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.710> always<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.219> bit<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
dirty side it was always a bit of a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.510 
dirty side it was always a bit of a
compromise<00:01:51.569> so<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.770> way<00:01:52.950> by<00:01:53.159> having<00:01:53.459> just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
compromise so this way by having just

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.330 
compromise so this way by having just
two<00:01:53.789> volumes<00:01:54.330> that<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.599> can<00:01:54.750> switch<00:01:54.990> between

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
two volumes that you can switch between

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.190 
two volumes that you can switch between
you<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.729> natural<00:01:57.209> much<00:01:57.630> more<00:01:57.840> natural

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
you get a much natural much more natural

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.130 
you get a much natural much more natural
transition<00:01:58.470> from<00:01:59.099> clean<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.880> overdrive<00:02:00.390> it's

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
transition from clean to overdrive it's

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.490 
transition from clean to overdrive it's
just<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.069> smoother<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.610> sounds<00:02:02.849> like<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.149> amp

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.560 

when<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> first<00:02:10.979> started<00:02:11.340> using<00:02:11.520> these<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.120> was

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
when I first started using these I was

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.250 
when I first started using these I was
renting<00:02:12.990> them<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:14.430> tour<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.330> I'd<00:02:16.050> never

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
renting them on tour and I'd never

of the upgrades that Stan Cody did who's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.920 
of the upgrades that Stan Cody did who's
designing<00:02:33.570> this<00:02:33.840> new<00:02:34.020> one<00:02:34.230> he<00:02:35.450> he<00:02:36.450> modified

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
designing this new one he he modified

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.470 
designing this new one he he modified
the<00:02:37.110> power<00:02:37.290> section<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.940> give<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.270> little

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
the power section to give it a little

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.690 
the power section to give it a little
bit<00:02:39.630> more<00:02:39.780> Headroom<00:02:40.230> even<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.100> original

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
bit more Headroom even in the original

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.180 
bit more Headroom even in the original
which<00:02:42.450> makes<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.930> kind<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.290> even<00:02:43.590> more<00:02:43.920> solid

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
which makes it kind of even more solid

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.160 
which makes it kind of even more solid
with<00:02:44.520> pedals<00:02:44.850> than<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.630> original<00:02:45.720> night

one<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.040> upgrade<00:02:49.010> we<00:02:50.010> went<00:02:50.190> back<00:02:50.370> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
one of the upgrade we went back and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.830 
one of the upgrade we went back and
forth<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.970> Stan<00:02:51.210> had<00:02:51.450> some<00:02:51.600> great<00:02:51.780> ideas

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
forth and Stan had some great ideas

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.260 
forth and Stan had some great ideas
about<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.590> boost<00:02:52.800> it's<00:02:53.340> kind<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.670> voiced<00:02:53.940> for

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
about the boost it's kind of voiced for

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.110 
about the boost it's kind of voiced for
the<00:02:54.360> trouble<00:02:54.720> pickup<00:02:55.080> which<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:59.580> makes<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.910> very

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the trouble pickup which it makes a very

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:12.020 
the trouble pickup which it makes a very
round<00:03:00.420> sound<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.960> itself<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:11.310> that's<00:03:11.670> kind<00:03:11.940> of

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
round sound in itself so that's kind of

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.840 
round sound in itself so that's kind of
voiced<00:03:12.450> for<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> strat<00:03:13.650> or<00:03:13.920> tele<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
voiced for it for a strat or tele the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.490 
voiced for it for a strat or tele the
back<00:03:15.030> pickup<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.810> was<00:03:15.930> kind<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.200> Stan's

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
back pickup and that was kind of Stan's

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.229 
back pickup and that was kind of Stan's
doing<00:03:16.920> because<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.190> normally<00:03:17.489> would<00:03:17.910> just<00:03:17.940> use

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
doing because I normally would just use

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.060 
doing because I normally would just use
the<00:03:18.390> two<00:03:18.570> volumes<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.290> know<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.709> speakers
