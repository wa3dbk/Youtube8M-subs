00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
things like that uh he can't only catch

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.920 
things like that uh he can't only catch
the<00:01:14.850> pass<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.299> need<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.720> also

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the pass if you need so you can also

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
the pass if you need so you can also
block<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.799> guys<00:01:16.950> seen<00:01:17.220> when<00:01:17.430> he<00:01:17.520> did<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
block if you guys seen when he did to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.450 
block if you guys seen when he did to
Terence<00:01:18.210> Newman<00:01:18.570> he<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.950> bully<00:01:20.280> on

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
Terence Newman he is just a bully on

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.580 
Terence Newman he is just a bully on
blocking<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.180> feel<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.960> should<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.290> higher

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
blocking I feel that it should be higher

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740 
blocking I feel that it should be higher
because<00:01:22.890> he<00:01:23.130> does<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.340> 65<00:01:23.939> impact<00:01:24.330> barking

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
because he does have 65 impact barking

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
because he does have 65 impact barking
which<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:25.650> should<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.920> higher<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.580> EA

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
which I think should be higher but EA

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.410 
which I think should be higher but EA
has<00:01:27.479> given<00:01:27.840> him<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> generous<00:01:28.530> 65<00:01:28.979> come<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:29.970> give

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
has given him a generous 65 come on give

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.310 
has given him a generous 65 come on give
him<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.689> better<00:01:31.049> blocking<00:01:31.950> attribute<00:01:33.320> also

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
him a better blocking attribute also

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.580 
him a better blocking attribute also
he's<00:01:34.950> great<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:36.119> route<00:01:36.990> running<00:01:37.200> even<00:01:37.470> though

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
he's great at route running even though

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.440 
he's great at route running even though
that<00:01:37.829> 85<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.400> think<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.790> perfect<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.299> him

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that 85 I think it's perfect for him

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.230 
that 85 I think it's perfect for him
because<00:01:39.689> he<00:01:40.049> only<00:01:40.829> was<00:01:41.340> known<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.909> fade

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
because he only was known for fade

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.179 
because he only was known for fade
routes<00:01:42.570> streaks<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.590> things<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
routes streaks and things like that and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.679 
routes streaks and things like that and
that<00:01:44.340> doesn't<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:44.820> take<00:01:45.060> much<00:01:45.090> about

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that doesn't really take much about

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.719 
that doesn't really take much about
running<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.110> 85<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.649> think<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.009> perfect<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.610> him

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
running so 85 I think is perfect for him

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.170 
running so 85 I think is perfect for him
so<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.420> mindful<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.320> running<00:01:50.180> crosses

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
so be mindful of that if running crosses

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.210 
so be mindful of that if running crosses
or<00:01:51.360> things<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.720> which<00:01:52.470> enables<00:01:53.130> your

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
or things like that which enables your

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.980 
or things like that which enables your
receiver<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.820> use<00:01:54.030> your<00:01:54.479> route<00:01:54.780> running

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
receiver to use your route running

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.719 
receiver to use your route running
