00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
picked myself up a brand new power

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.220 
picked myself up a brand new power
supply<00:00:12.780> my<00:00:13.559> thermaltake<00:00:14.070> tr2<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.630> wasn't

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
supply my thermaltake tr2 just wasn't

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.420 
supply my thermaltake tr2 just wasn't
cutting<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.500> anymore<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.920> was<00:00:17.100> getting<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.340> lot

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
cutting it anymore I was getting a lot

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.660 
cutting it anymore I was getting a lot
of<00:00:17.490> voltage<00:00:17.910> drop<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.260> wanted<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> step<00:00:20.490> this

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
of voltage drop so I wanted to step this

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.890 
of voltage drop so I wanted to step this
up<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.359> went<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> 80<00:00:22.680> plus<00:00:23.010> gold<00:00:23.039> series

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
up and I went with a 80 plus gold series

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
up and I went with a 80 plus gold series
corsair<00:00:24.900> ax750<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.029> an

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
corsair ax750 so we're going to do an

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.400 
corsair ax750 so we're going to do an
unboxing<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.810> I've<00:00:27.990> never<00:00:28.109> done<00:00:28.260> an

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
unboxing of this I've never done an

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.990 
unboxing of this I've never done an
unboxing<00:00:28.680> video<00:00:29.070> before<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.820> don't<00:00:29.910> really

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
unboxing video before so I don't really

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.970 
unboxing video before so I don't really
know<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.720> expect<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:31.920> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you have to pay shipping on that so I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.880 
you have to pay shipping on that so I
got<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> hell<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.260> deal<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.860> just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
got a hell of a deal on this I just

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.529 
got a hell of a deal on this I just
couldn't<00:00:56.250> pass<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.820> considering

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
couldn't pass it up considering

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.819 
couldn't pass it up considering
everything<00:00:57.629> else<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> same<00:00:58.440> price<00:00:58.710> range

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
everything else in the same price range

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.810 
everything else in the same price range
was<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> bronze<00:00:59.910> rated<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.460> every<00:01:02.460> single

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
was a bronze rated so every single

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.070 
was a bronze rated so every single
connector<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.359> kind<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> hard<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
connector it's kind of hard to see I

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
connector it's kind of hard to see I
know<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.619> right<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.210> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
know if you can see that right here you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.880 
know if you can see that right here you
can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> front<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.680> sure

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
can see it on the front here for sure

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.000 
can see it on the front here for sure
every<00:01:08.790> connector<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.299> modular<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.920> not

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
every connector is modular so you're not

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.770 
every connector is modular so you're not
stuck<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.640> bundle<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.210> wires<00:01:12.360> coming

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
stuck with this bundle of wires coming

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200 
stuck with this bundle of wires coming
out<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.619> big<00:01:13.799> clump<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> wires<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
out you know it's big clump of wires and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
out you know it's big clump of wires and
then<00:01:15.330> some<00:01:15.659> modular<00:01:16.130> everything<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.220> modular

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
then some modular everything is modular

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.200 
then some modular everything is modular
on<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> 750<00:01:19.439> watt<00:01:19.650> unit<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.210> bumped

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
on this this is a 750 watt unit I bumped

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.399 
on this this is a 750 watt unit I bumped
it<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.330> from<00:01:21.509> 650<00:01:22.110> i'm<00:01:22.259> using<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> 650<00:01:23.280> now<00:01:23.430> but

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
it up from 650 i'm using a 650 now but

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.050 
it up from 650 i'm using a 650 now but
you<00:01:25.409> know<00:01:25.500> 750<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.250> more<00:01:26.430> than<00:01:26.520> enough<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.970> i

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you know 750 is more than enough if i

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.690 
you know 750 is more than enough if i
decide<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.540> sli<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.200> 680<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.369> future

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
decide to sli my 680 in the future

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
decide to sli my 680 in the future
because<00:01:29.909> they're<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.390> efficient<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.560> i<00:01:31.740> am<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
because they're so efficient but i am a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.800 
because they're so efficient but i am a
fan<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> single<00:01:32.909> graphics<00:01:33.329> cards<00:01:33.630> just

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
fan of single graphics cards just

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
fan of single graphics cards just
because<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.259> simplicity<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.130> i'll

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because of the simplicity so i'll

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.700 
because of the simplicity so i'll
probably<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.759> stick<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.360> 750<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> most

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
probably just stick with 750 at the most

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.010 
probably just stick with 750 at the most
here<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> gold<00:01:38.970> rated<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.570> i<00:01:39.600> am<00:01:39.780> going<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
here it is a gold rated so i am going to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.100 
here it is a gold rated so i am going to
get<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> full<00:01:40.439> 750<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.250> i<00:01:41.340> need<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.930> but<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.049> i

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
get a full 750 if i need it but what i

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.510 
get a full 750 if i need it but what i
like<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.500> power<00:01:43.740> supply<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.310> is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
like about this power supply here is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.149 
like about this power supply here is
that<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> does<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> PM<00:01:46.130> pwm<00:01:47.130> fan

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that you know it does have a PM pwm fan

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.149 
that you know it does have a PM pwm fan
in<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.930> fan<00:01:49.259> speed<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.040> see

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
in it so the fan speed as you can see

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.330 
in it so the fan speed as you can see
right<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.640> does<00:01:50.939> ramp<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:52.049> load<00:01:52.680> but

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
right here does ramp up with load but

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.510 
right here does ramp up with load but
you've<00:01:53.490> got<00:01:53.729> two<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.380> eight<00:01:55.530> pins<00:01:55.799> you've

but yeah that's pretty much it here just
showing<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.360> efficiency<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:17.160> is

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
showing the efficiency here and this is

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.160 
showing the efficiency here and this is
the<00:02:17.490> fan<00:02:17.730> chart<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.270> then<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.870> showing<00:02:19.140> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the fan chart and then just showing you

the fan chart and then just showing you
here<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.740> know<00:02:19.860> here's<00:02:20.070> your<00:02:20.190> outputs<00:02:20.580> here

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
here you know here's your outputs here

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.690 
here you know here's your outputs here
you<00:02:20.970> DC<00:02:21.300> output<00:02:21.330> max<00:02:22.140> load<00:02:22.440> okay<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.310> let's<00:02:23.490> go

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
you DC output max load okay so let's go

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.220 
you DC output max load okay so let's go
ahead<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.910> cut<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.210> thing<00:02:24.390> open<00:02:24.690> here<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.170> we

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
ahead and cut this thing open here so we

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.370 
ahead and cut this thing open here so we
can<00:02:25.320> do<00:02:25.470> without<00:02:25.620> cutting<00:02:25.890> myself<00:02:27.200> my<00:02:28.200> wife

screws right here if you use to connect

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.340 
screws right here if you use to connect
it<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.970> your<00:03:48.000> case<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:51.000> here<00:03:51.990> I'm<00:03:52.110> imagining

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
it to your case and here I'm imagining

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.900 
it to your case and here I'm imagining
this<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.800> going<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> be<00:03:53.070> all<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.310> our<00:03:53.430> cables

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
this is going to be all of our cables

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.200 
this is going to be all of our cables
set<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.600> nice<00:03:54.810> bag<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:59.580> sleeping<00:04:00.000> on<00:04:00.090> these

set this nice bag the sleeping on these

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.680 
set this nice bag the sleeping on these
are<00:04:00.390> nice<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:03.000> this<00:04:03.390> here<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.930> our<00:04:05.570> it's<00:04:06.570> like

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
are nice so this here is our it's like

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.840 
are nice so this here is our it's like
this<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:06.870> our<00:04:07.170> PCI<00:04:08.070> Express<00:04:08.610> 8-pin<00:04:10.850> another

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
this is our PCI Express 8-pin another

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.400 
this is our PCI Express 8-pin another
PCI<00:04:12.270> Express<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:15.150> yeah<00:04:15.570> these<00:04:16.020> are<00:04:16.140> all<00:04:16.290> our

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
PCI Express so yeah these are all our

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.190 
PCI Express so yeah these are all our
cables<00:04:16.859> here<00:04:17.270> interestingly<00:04:18.270> enough<00:04:18.930> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
cables here interestingly enough the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.379 
cables here interestingly enough the
SATA<00:04:19.590> cables<00:04:20.100> are<00:04:20.220> not<00:04:20.400> sleeved

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
SATA cables are not sleeved

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.999 
SATA cables are not sleeved
however<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.139> appears<00:04:23.409> that<00:04:23.530> everything<00:04:23.650> else

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.009 
however it appears that everything else

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:29.100 
however it appears that everything else
might<00:04:24.430> be<00:04:25.979> yeah<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.330> molex<00:04:28.539> and<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.870> SATA

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
might be yeah so the molex and the SATA

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.040 
might be yeah so the molex and the SATA
cables<00:04:29.499> are<00:04:29.590> not<00:04:29.710> sleeved<00:04:30.129> the<00:04:30.629> PCI<00:04:31.629> Express

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
cables are not sleeved the PCI Express

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.879 
cables are not sleeved the PCI Express
ones<00:04:32.379> are<00:04:32.680> so<00:04:33.099> go<00:04:33.490> figure<00:04:33.639> on<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.330> one<00:04:37.889> nice
