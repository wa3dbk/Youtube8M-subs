00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:05.099
 hello to all we are pleased to present the servan interview 

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:06.010
 escoffier 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.859
 what a disappointment boat 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.489
 with the youth animation service 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.489
 this is the first time cameron diaz 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.759
 group 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.210
 he thumb 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.880
 soccer 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.830
 so good player at the end of the year what hated Saint-Malo 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.950
 29 years 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.470
 to lg will leave on saint-malo 2015 years 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.680
 in addition on the road of the rum the postal bank on October 31, 2010 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.560
 and saint-malo 2015 is a catamaran percent and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.120
 in e twenty-two meters fifty long formosa 50 wide and at 28 m 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.760
 meters high 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.360
 what do you do with your life besides the rum race as all the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.770
 world niger is the country in a house 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.630
 I have the mini put it put 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.110
 then when I'm not doing the rank cause when I'm not shopping at the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.360
 veil I also do other things in the middle of the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.000
 the victim imams 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.230
 Yesterday I advised yesterday by the sailing company 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.780
 and if not German signed customers yes sailing boats 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.810
 is it complicated to manage the boat alone 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.110
 acer and physics the boat and high schools in saint-malo 2015 and enough 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.240
 great price which is still 22 meters fifty long per year or 50 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.350
 wide 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.750
 and suddenly it's true that it's pretty physical but that's why I 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.650
 does as much by anticipation 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.390
 what are the good means of communication with the land then the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.199
 means of communication when I'm running it's going through% 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.579
 by satellite by the media me 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:17.799
 so in fact 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.799
 e I have a phone called a referral 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.489
 the international inquired about a satellite 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.749
 and it was after that comes back to do 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.749
 how long is the race 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.689
 so for me I think the court hopefully should last two weeks 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.689
 a little near up to 3500 billion 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.879
 what are the boats leaving the physical 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.930
 so the boats that will go faster are the boats that are in 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.549
 my category in ultimate 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.700
 but who are boats much newer record saint-malo 2015 he has 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.879
 still 27 years old I now have to face the Netherlands as soon as 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.019
 my youngest 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.809
 and give it is less than the fastest ones are definitely boats 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:57.779
 as 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:01.519
 major stops on leases groupama am senators 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.009
 why the boats went back home 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.389
 so why are the boats turning itar-tass and yet 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.759
 tyson to overtake their turnaround troops this year anyway 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.769
 a lot of water when he is a britney fan 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.649
 and always done so that it has minimal stability 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:22.249
 and if unfortunately there is too much wind were at the same time for example a 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:22.969
 wave was coming 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.029
 but first of all it's a side of the boat 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.789
 and if the righting torque has been exceeded the boat capsizes 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.179
 you have to arrive in guadeloupe what do we do 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.030
 so general and bayal the forise the arrival so 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.369
 I kiss everyone I call my partners 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.579
 and then when such centers 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.029
 as for jaime gama a country everyone the game did not let go I take a 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.249
 little hello 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.179

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.709

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.849
 dehydrated called duo phil ivey on which we put water very 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:56.729
 hot 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:58.519
 to restore 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.519
 Tonight it's little food bags 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.399
 as for the first round donkey do you have any food 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.579
 then me and I will try to take food I think for 20 days 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.119
 like that if I ever have a problem 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.389
 but even in these cases I will have a little more 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.499
 how long do you work 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.870
 so I try to sleep a minimum 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.530
 tomorrow at five o'clock in 24 hours but by cons I feel much more of 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.400
 time 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 I made a Sunni dignitary 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.090
 what will you train in this moscow 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.010
 what was driving me in this cause to effect but already had the chance 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.199
 of the feria four years 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.949
 and this year I really wanted to redo it and then the soul to m 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.660
 it under the worsened impulse of saint-malo and the agglomeration of 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.710
 Saint Malo 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.850
 this is one of the many Malvinian companies in particular have 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.809
 federated around the club projects 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:54.139
 and it's thanks to all these companies that I was able to leave 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.840
 at what age did you start 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.980
 for them I had the chance to make a first cruise I had three or 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.710
 four months later I went to sailing school 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.789
 and my skin and then when I started competing at it's because I 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.990
 started at 16 or 17 years old 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.780
 and the first transatlantic at 22 and it's been my job since 2005 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.639

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.650
 we can not 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.650
