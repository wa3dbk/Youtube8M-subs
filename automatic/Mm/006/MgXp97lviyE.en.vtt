00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.549
 good friends of the channel I am animal 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.910
 for people who still do not know me and 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.139
 we are today in the section of 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.030
 curiosities today that such 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.429
 Once you did not know we are in the chapter 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.679
 11 we are going to talk about two champions 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.550
 only in this section but I explain 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:22.730
 why in some the champions are mommy and 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.499
 bard mom we have in basic details 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.659
 because it does not have much depth 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.729
 unlike Bardo is worth a bardo if 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.939
 we have to analyze the champion well and 

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:34.429
 we can even draw certain theories 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.769
 we will start with my mom mainly 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.969
 it's going to be called rom light el but 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.890
 final was removed and his name was put 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.660
 current on behalf of nam and has 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.210
 different meanings in Japanese but 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.429
 it is commonly decided as the wave the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.469
 namic concept are the inspiration of 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.360
 a mermaid a typical myth creature 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.700
 mythical forgiveness 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.260
 related to the sea the ability to 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.210
 namic are a reference to movement 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.490
 of water and relation to the tides 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.620
 natural if you take away the voice of 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.960
 speed will tell a class doing 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.059
 exactly the little mermaid 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.190
 nemocon launch but I think if the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.810
 energy the Viking ghost tells you to 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.640
 namic that the moonstone is in another 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.200
 side who is the Viking ghost for 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.910
 the people who do not know him are the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.790
 ghost that is in aran 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.920
 that means that enami has lost the 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.050
 target search but not yet 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.600
 she has recorded a lot in eldoret 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.780
 share a corner theme with warwick 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.700
 which is that of a dinner-rally finally 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.250
 of nami we are going to deny the famous myth 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.050
 of end supposedly both are 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.190
 in love things that is not true 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.540
 let's see 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.920
 one thing that you have a lot in a lot of people 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.200
 so keep in mind that if this is because 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.970
 either mono or if they are already both sea and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.390
 they have to be paid that's a lie 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.790
 the only thing that is between them friends and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.220
 a lot of confidence because what you're going 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.120
 to understand in the ore the tribe of enami and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.900
 da say they are close to each other 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.070
 now let's go with bardo let's see this 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.760
 enigmatic champion 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.600
 there is a lot of variation of who can be 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.850
 which can 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.220
 et cetera etcetera anyway 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.430
 Talk about who is the god of music 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.769
 the god of music and peace 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.049
 before we continue with him we are going to detail 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.150
 what is a bard not the name of brown 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.400
 a bard let's see a bard for the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.319
 people who do not know what it is is a poet 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.290
 or a musician who is dedicated to storytelling 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.510
 of the songs usually travel alone or 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.769
 arc are rented by patrons who 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.200
 they tell you their feat of the 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.909
 heroic and who walks his adventure often 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.099
 they usually wear leather and have 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.189
 always a common musical instrument 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.609
 commonly in the medieval realm it was a 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.099
 lute in this case with our champion 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.739
 let's say it has a more oriental tone 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.769
 your original intro if you look bard 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.590
 is the one that bard uses within the game with 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.829
 all its sound effect a lot of people 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.829
 confuse 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.870
 the role of bard believe that it is a super 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.659
 aggressive of a line and it really is a 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.189
 super aggressive roaming is to say leads 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.659
 moving through every line of work to 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.209
 center of the crib and of a 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.739
 down mother or may vary from below 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.110
 formula but good that is not usually in 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.140
 the line 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.120
 we are going to issues of neighborhood a neighborhood is a 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.190
 be heavenly that has been created from a 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.260
 way that has created the same forgiveness a 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.970
 corporeal form to be able to act in the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.830
 physical world let's say that your body that 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.440
 we see inside the game is not its way 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.480
 original but only one housing does not 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.250
 I imagine that a person has two feet 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.040
 ok they seem to take zetas but good 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.100
 we follow if you look at the animation 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.870
 of death of bard when they kill you 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.120
 in the game so you can see it 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.040
 begins to shrink and starts as wrinkles 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.270
 to wrinkle is worth the body and also if 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.490
 you notice a kind comes out of 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.150
 spirit above the body that wants 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.159
 say what a housing is 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.409
 however brownish by what they give to 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.510
 understand is not omnipotent despite 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.519
 be an immortal being as a spirit by 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.409
 example he can be banished by 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.590
 powerful machines and could even 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.370
 incarcerate a force of equal power or 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.420
 superior to him could kill him 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.540
 so normally lords in 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.850
 Bard history can also be one of 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.010
 the five beings 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.850
 semi immortals of history as per 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.890
 example approx 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.110
 bard influence room is one way 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.060
 very different as for example atrox the 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.380
 directly influence the story with 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.510
 fo conflicts 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.790
 and I rarely apologize that they are not 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.160
 words, bloodshed 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.540
 in the whore who would not kiss and bard what 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.490
 does in a celestial way passively 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.950
 balancing the world during its 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.410
 most exasperating moments means 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.050
 that what they are going to understand is one of the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.940
 five beings guarding is worried 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.770
 by the actions of mortals alone 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.780
 acts for the greatest dangers that 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.780
 they can threaten to value their mission is 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.790
 protect and balance the world 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.860
 if you have fixed the ball that sits 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.690
 bard when I return to base is a key 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.639
 harmonica that makes all the sounds 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.060
 of the world hit in a magical friction 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.919
 inside of him the followers of 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.660
 bard are called mips are attracted by the 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.630
 energy of the same although they are and 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.430
 although they are separate entities have 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.470
 traveled with bard so long that in 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.570
 some part they have done a bit of it 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.660
 also the relationship is mutually 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.490
 beneficial 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.330
 it is said that the instrument music of 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.169
 bard can wake up or xing 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.689
 true or not they were not clarified bard is the 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.470
 second champion that you use instruments 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.219
 musicals 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.590
 the first is bard area does not speak 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.650
 communicate by musical notes if we set 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.969
 bard when you use it tell jokes 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.889
 you walk as if he hits you he has kissed 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:45.139
 against the wall does not speak are heard 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.620
 musical notes 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.120
 good 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.680
 as you have fixed we have spoken it 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.210
 of the two champions especially more 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.010
 we have not based on bard that is a 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.419
 mysterious champion and I even want 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.100
 look for more information from him to do 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.300
 a special chapter like for example 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.790
 because on the subject also of jeans and 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.190
 the rest 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.690
 You can also look at the chapters 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.990
 previous and asked for a champion 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.010
 in detail instead of asking for three 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.440
 you have to throw it between two 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.510
 subscribers and one more thing before 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.920
 leave do not vote here the champion who 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.480
 want to see for the next game 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.610
 that is already voted in the previous video 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.740
 and well, here you can vote the 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.140
 next myth that you have green from 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.880
 curiosity champion and nothing more like 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.180
 always thank you very much for seeing me and a 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.180
 greeting
