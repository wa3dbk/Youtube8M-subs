again he celebrates like a bit of a dick
but<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.780> guess<00:01:31.079> most<00:01:31.530> people<00:01:31.650> would<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.250> if

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
but I guess most people would do that if

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.300 
but I guess most people would do that if
they<00:01:32.579> scored<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.000> 90th<00:01:33.420> minute<00:01:33.710> winner<00:01:34.710> so

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
they scored a 90th minute winner so

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.410 
they scored a 90th minute winner so
that's<00:01:36.270> looking<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:37.100> fitness<00:01:38.270> around<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that's looking at fitness around the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.730 
that's looking at fitness around the
keeper<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.790> ends<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.210> 32<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.259> em<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
keeper and that ends it at 32 to em and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.770
