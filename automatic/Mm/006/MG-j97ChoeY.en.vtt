00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.040 

different<00:02:20.380> length<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.800> sizzle<00:02:22.050> different

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
different length of sizzle different

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.250 
different length of sizzle different
coins<00:02:23.319> sound<00:02:23.920> different<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> here's<00:02:26.170> a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
coins sound different so here's a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:38.819 
coins sound different so here's a
quarter

so you can hear that what I found with

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.660 
so you can hear that what I found with
the<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.260> quarter<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.830> penny<00:02:58.070> they're

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670

the the quarter and the penny they're
kind<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:58.970> heavy<00:02:59.240> so<00:02:59.620> it'll<00:03:00.620> it'll<00:03:01.190> dry<00:03:01.580> out

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
kind of heavy so it'll it'll dry out

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.100 
kind of heavy so it'll it'll dry out
your<00:03:01.940> cymbal<00:03:02.270> a<00:03:02.330> little<00:03:02.510> bit<00:03:02.630> it'll<00:03:02.900> it'll

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
your cymbal a little bit it'll it'll

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.520 
your cymbal a little bit it'll it'll
really<00:03:03.350> take<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.650> decay<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:03.980> cut<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.520> off<00:03:05.530> so

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
really take the decay and cut it off so

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.690 
really take the decay and cut it off so
I<00:03:06.560> was<00:03:06.680> experimenting<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.280> little<00:03:07.370> bit<00:03:07.490> and<00:03:07.670> I

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
I was experimenting a little bit and I

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.790 
I was experimenting a little bit and I
found<00:03:07.910> these<00:03:08.030> little<00:03:08.270> tiny<00:03:08.630> washers<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.620> think

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
found these little tiny washers I think

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.150 
found these little tiny washers I think
they're<00:03:09.950> number<00:03:10.280> eight<00:03:10.550> or<00:03:10.820> number<00:03:11.060> six<00:03:12.160> you

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
they're number eight or number six you

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.360 
they're number eight or number six you
know<00:03:13.280> machine<00:03:13.780> washers<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.920> now<00:03:16.130> they're<00:03:16.340> a

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
know machine washers and now they're a

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.850 
know machine washers and now they're a
real<00:03:16.580> light<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.600> they<00:03:17.840> they<00:03:18.200> don't<00:03:18.290> choke<00:03:18.650> the

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
real light so they they don't choke the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.980 
real light so they they don't choke the
symbol<00:03:19.220> out<00:03:19.370> as<00:03:19.640> much<00:03:25.240> and<00:03:26.240> so<00:03:26.480> it'll<00:03:26.660> it'll

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
symbol out as much and so it'll it'll

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.110 
symbol out as much and so it'll it'll
sizzle<00:03:27.500> for<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.709> lot<00:03:27.890> longer<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.730> cool<00:03:28.910> thing

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
sizzle for a lot longer the cool thing

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.880 
sizzle for a lot longer the cool thing
with<00:03:29.270> this<00:03:29.480> idea<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.080> can<00:03:30.200> also<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.560> know

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
with this idea is you can also you know

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.760 
with this idea is you can also you know
you<00:03:31.370> can<00:03:31.490> put<00:03:31.610> scissors<00:03:32.030> on<00:03:32.440> your<00:03:33.440> smaller

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
you can put scissors on your smaller

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.660 
you can put scissors on your smaller
cymbals<00:03:35.890> we're<00:03:36.890> just<00:03:37.040> kind<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.340> different

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
cymbals we're just kind of a different

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.530 
cymbals we're just kind of a different
down

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.590 

and<00:03:46.540> uh<00:03:46.950> there<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.070> go<00:03:48.250> pretty<00:03:48.850> simple<00:03:49.060> just

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
and uh there you go pretty simple just

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.570 
and uh there you go pretty simple just
stick<00:03:50.230> some<00:03:50.470> stuff<00:03:50.740> to<00:03:50.920> your<00:03:51.040> cymbals<00:03:51.430> and

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
stick some stuff to your cymbals and

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.370 
stick some stuff to your cymbals and
tape<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.060> on<00:03:52.210> there<00:03:52.390> I've<00:03:52.900> been<00:03:52.990> playing<00:03:53.230> with

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
tape it on there I've been playing with

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.480 
tape it on there I've been playing with
it<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.620> here<00:03:53.800> for<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:53.980> while

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
it on here for a while

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.930 
it on here for a while
and<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:56.050> tape<00:03:56.230> seems<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.710> stick<00:03:56.980> so<00:03:57.580> you'll<00:03:57.850> at

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
and the tape seems to stick so you'll at

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.760 
and the tape seems to stick so you'll at
least<00:03:58.000> get<00:03:58.300> a<00:03:58.360> whole<00:03:58.870> tune<00:03:59.170> out<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.680> before

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
least get a whole tune out of it before

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.380 
least get a whole tune out of it before
you<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:00.370> might<00:04:00.520> have<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.730> replace<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.209> tape

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
you you might have to replace the tape

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.300 
you you might have to replace the tape
you<00:04:01.750> may<00:04:01.930> even<00:04:02.020> be<00:04:02.140> able<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.680> get<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:02.860> whole<00:04:03.040> gig

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
you may even be able to get a whole gig

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.630 
you may even be able to get a whole gig
out<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.270> this<00:04:04.420> this<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:04.810> trick<00:04:05.350> so<00:04:05.620> give<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.580> a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
out of this this this trick so give it a

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.949 
out of this this this trick so give it a
shot<00:04:06.850> let<00:04:07.030> me<00:04:07.090> know<00:04:07.209> how<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:07.420> works<00:04:07.600> for<00:04:07.840> you

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
shot let me know how it works for you

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.700 
shot let me know how it works for you
and<00:04:08.170> I'll<00:04:08.650> see<00:04:08.890> you<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.310> next<00:04:09.580> one
