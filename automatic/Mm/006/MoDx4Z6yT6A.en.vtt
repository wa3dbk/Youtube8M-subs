00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 so he did not win the emmy 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.120
 I do not know how it is possible that the planet 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.290
 continue turning and there are people alive 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.290
 I do not explain it 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.640
 hello that such welcome once again to 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.199
 this channel that is called a reader 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.759
 night and this time I'm going to 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.410
 talk about a book called the 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.410
 psychoanalyst by john katzenbach 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.820
 katzenberg yes what is this book about 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.350
 this book tells us about ricky a 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.739
 psychoanalyst who just turned 53 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.930
 years and he sincerely hoped to spend 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.090
 the day of his birthday as a day 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.580
 normal in consultation receiving their 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.260
 patients listening to their problems and 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.870
 then go eat something when 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.760
 your business day will end but everything is going to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.670
 change because when your last one goes 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.769
 patient receives a letter that letter is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.410
 Mr. r can not pronounce the 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.210
 name of this character so he 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.899
 let's say sir r as they say 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.420
 our protagonist and tells him he has 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:12.680
 two options has 15 days for 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.470
 find out who sent you that letter 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.780
 or you have to kill yourself and what happens if you do not 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 He commits suicide because the man will take 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.390
 retaliation against a family member of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.149
 ricky our protagonist psychoanalyst 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 and here the whole story starts a 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.500
 history and there are no more characters 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.409
 involved as virgin which is a 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.380
 super beautiful woman and a 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.210
 lawyer who might not be a lawyer or who 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.460
 if I could be a lawyer called 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.280
 merlin or at least those are the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.590
 names that they say to ricky and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.560
 these two characters are like that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.719
 allies or henchmen of Mr. r and his 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.420
 work is to make ricky's life 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.939
 impossible and you can give him certain clues 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.829
 so that he finds a way to 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.990
 discover the identity of the person who 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.969
 he sent you this letter 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.259
 now let you see why this book I 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.579
 it seemed surprisingly wow me what 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.440
 had recommended a long time ago 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.660
 but I did not want to read it because I did not 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.970
 I wanted to buy it that easy until I 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.400
 a friend lent it to me and I said ok it's 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.129
 I'm going to give you a chance what 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.140
 I started reading and I do not regret not 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.239
 have read it before because I think if 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.370
 I would have read it before, I would not have 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.340
 enjoyed as much as I enjoyed it now 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.620
 because I really liked every paragraph 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.170
 of this story I think this has been 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.599
 one of the books where most has been 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.150
 noticed the development and change of 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.150
 main character as is ricky 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.970
 because in these 523 pages there is a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.180
 I miss a shitload of things like you have 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.930
 an idea a shitload of things that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.769
 they are part of a plan perfectly 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.079
 crafted to make ricky do everything 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.730
 what he does in the book now in almost 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.700
 the whole book but I think 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.160
 awesome as the author first that 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.489
 nothing develop these characters and the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.959
 pair develops this plan so 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.900
 superbly structured where 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.910
 every gear is important and every 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.040
 action that the characters perform is 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.099
 vital to the consequence that goes to 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.810
 having that made me just 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.069
 spectacular and then we move on to another 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.980
 which I really liked that is the 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.230
 psychological aspect of the characters 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.810
 put your study psychology so that 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.250
 interesting and as I said before the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.819
 main character that is the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.000
 psychoanalyst is noted or net it shows 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.980
 an impressive change in his way of 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.410
 analyze things because he is a 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.150
 analyst he is a psychoanalyst and to the 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.489
 principle knows how his life is 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.830
 perfectly structured that your 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.390
 thoughts try to follow an order 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.700
 according to the sequence of events 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.579
 but in the end we see that that changes 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.069
 completely and has logic and has 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.379
 same sense with the antagonists or 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.160
 secondary characters or each one 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.980
 has a history of his past that the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.840
 does what they are at the moment in the 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.329
 that is in the book and that gives you a 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.489
 logic to everything they do because there 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.340
 books where they talk about murderers 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.840
 that they do not finish matching the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.060
 stories that are telling us but 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.570
 here they square as 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.450
 a box they keep like a picture like this 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.210
 perfect I thought I liked it a lot 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.410
 if anything, there was something that I did not like 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.880
 much of the book was already at the end where 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.480
 I felt like the author wanted to take 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.880
 more pasta pasta pasta to make 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.720
 it was like that increasing the excitement and 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.730
 suspense of that from that final moment to 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.260
 that someone wanted to take us and I know 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.650
 I felt like ok this is 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.479
 boring and I had to pass as well as 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.010
 three pages where they just threw him 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.930
 there I repeat to see what happened but 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.760
 I saw that nothing interesting happened 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.190
 I only discovered places and said ok 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.720
 this already bored me this and I went 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.400
 directly where the action began 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.889
 If so, I can say that it was 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.260
 only that I did not like the book so much 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.139
 but from then on out from the beginning 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.150
 until the end the end I liked it very much and 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.040
 I especially liked that we do not know what 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.510
 it happens with a certain character itself 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.490
 and I liked that, I gave him five of 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.270
 five stars in cutris because it's a 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.610
 five-star book 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.040
 could some people could you 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.330
 seem predictable and even to me 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.460
 certain aspects were made to me 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.050
 predictable but still does not take away what 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.120
 great how the author is going 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.820
 developing and as I explain it to you 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.710
 that's why I put it 5 out of 5 stars there 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.260
 some other opinions on the blog 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.090
 in case you do not want to check and you know if 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.100
 you already read it I would like to know your 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.290
 comments in the bottom part and if not 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.150
 I recommend them a lot and I hope that 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.470
 have a very good week and read 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.600
 very very good book 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.250
 I honestly do not know what to say here at 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.250
 so I'm just going to make noises
