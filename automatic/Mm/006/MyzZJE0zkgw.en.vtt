00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
question that Josh asked his could be

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.640 
question that Josh asked his could be
valuable<00:04:35.509> and<00:04:36.509> be<00:04:36.660> prepared<00:04:37.110> for<00:04:37.199> maybe<00:04:37.620> a

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
valuable and be prepared for maybe a

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.680

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
little singing but accept that and say

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
okay how can we move forward from this

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.779 
okay how can we move forward from this
whether<00:04:42.780> that's<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:44.280> Josh<00:04:44.490> is<00:04:44.639> still

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
whether that's and Josh is still

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.219 
whether that's and Josh is still
breaking<00:04:44.910> about<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.449> figuring<00:04:45.900> that<00:04:45.990> out<00:04:46.050> too

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
breaking about to figuring that out too

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.939 
breaking about to figuring that out too
like<00:04:46.440> we<00:04:46.740> reshape<00:04:47.520> our<00:04:47.639> ministry<00:04:48.240> do<00:04:49.080> we<00:04:49.259> do

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
like we reshape our ministry do we do

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.589 
like we reshape our ministry do we do
something<00:04:50.250> different<00:04:50.520> in<00:04:50.580> Sunday<00:04:50.819> mornings<00:04:51.270> I

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
something different in Sunday mornings I

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:52.909 
something different in Sunday mornings I
would<00:04:51.780> guess<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.169> would<00:04:52.259> have<00:04:52.349> to<00:04:52.409> be<00:04:52.500> deeper

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
would guess it would have to be deeper

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.070 
would guess it would have to be deeper
