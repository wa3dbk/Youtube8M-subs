favorite gun may be my opinion the
scar-h<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.310> probably<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.880> third<00:02:30.150> or

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
scar-h is probably like a third or

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.970 
scar-h is probably like a third or
fourth<00:02:30.510> best<00:02:30.840> assault<00:02:31.380> rifle<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.950> game

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980
