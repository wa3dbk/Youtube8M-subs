00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
prepare and again that's a process I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.259 
prepare and again that's a process I
mean<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.580> you<00:00:38.670> don't<00:00:38.820> submit<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
process you can't get better until it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.439 
process you can't get better until it
becomes<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> habit<00:00:41.519> you<00:00:41.730> can't<00:00:41.940> get<00:00:42.059> better<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
becomes a habit you can't get better in

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.870 
becomes a habit you can't get better in
it<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.680> process<00:00:43.920> each<00:00:44.280> week<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.670> game

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
it so it's a process each week the game

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.600 
it so it's a process each week the game
plan<00:00:45.090> prepare<00:00:45.649> do<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> mental<00:00:47.190> work<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
plan prepare do all the mental work and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.860 
plan prepare do all the mental work and
then<00:00:47.700> let<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.880> rip<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.540> got<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.780> get

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
call him struggle the other day and we

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.639 
call him struggle the other day and we
can't<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.020> game<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.190 
can't have that in a game of that
magnitude<00:00:58.890> period<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> does<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.930> come<00:01:01.079> down

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
magnitude period so does this come down

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.950 
magnitude period so does this come down
to<00:01:01.350> how<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.890> pack<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> lot<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.430> cookie<00:01:02.699> hope

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
to how we can pack a lot of cookie hope

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.660 
to how we can pack a lot of cookie hope
I<00:01:03.960> figured<00:01:04.289> out<00:01:04.410> by<00:01:04.530> game<00:01:04.710> time<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.160> so<00:01:05.399> until

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I figured out by game time and so until

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.279 
I figured out by game time and so until
at<00:01:05.789> left<00:01:05.940> tackle<00:01:06.149> I<00:01:06.509> guess<00:01:06.690> that's<00:01:06.899> an<00:01:07.050> open

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
at left tackle I guess that's an open

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.020 
at left tackle I guess that's an open
competition<00:01:07.440> it's<00:01:08.039> got<00:01:08.190> it<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.640> got<00:01:08.759> when<00:01:08.970> I

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
competition it's got it it's got when I

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.520 
competition it's got it it's got when I
get<00:01:09.210> enough<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.690> left<00:01:09.840> hand<00:01:10.020> it's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
get enough out of the left hand it's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.749 
get enough out of the left hand it's
just<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.800> simple<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.310> we're<00:01:11.460> not<00:01:11.550> getting

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
just the simple that we're not getting

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.340 
just the simple that we're not getting
enough<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> left<00:01:12.660> tackle<00:01:12.810> we've<00:01:13.140> tried

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
enough at a left tackle we've tried

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.020 
enough at a left tackle we've tried

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
the way it looks it's going to be fixed

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.240 
the way it looks it's going to be fixed

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
you last time based on would have you

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.240 
you last time based on would have you
seen<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> different<00:02:31.040> athletes

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
seen it is that a different athletes

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.950 
seen it is that a different athletes
would<00:02:31.640> have<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.850> seen<00:02:32.060> different<00:02:32.480> he's<00:02:32.840> got

he's<00:02:33.200> got<00:02:33.260> different<00:02:33.530> athletes<00:02:33.710> there's<00:02:34.040> no

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
he's got different athletes there's no

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.740 
he's got different athletes there's no
questions<00:02:34.550> guy<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:35.000> think<00:02:35.240> he<00:02:35.330> would<00:02:35.450> say<00:02:35.600> he's

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
questions guy I think he would say he's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.030 
questions guy I think he would say he's
got<00:02:35.900> better<00:02:36.080> athletes<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.710> think<00:02:36.950> the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
got better athletes that I think the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.030 
got better athletes that I think the
line<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.270> bigger<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:38.480> more<00:02:38.570> physical<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
line is bigger and more physical the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.370 
line is bigger and more physical the
full-back<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.300> runner<00:02:41.660> really<00:02:42.230> can

after world so again I think I think

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:10.700 
after world so again I think I think
they're<00:05:09.690> doing<00:05:09.900> good<00:05:10.020> i<00:05:10.080> mean<00:05:10.259> the<00:05:10.379> key<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.680> a

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
they're doing good i mean the key that a

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.459 
they're doing good i mean the key that a
good<00:05:10.830> look<00:05:11.009> today<00:05:11.629> hopefully<00:05:12.629> they're<00:05:13.199> not<00:05:13.319> as

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
good look today hopefully they're not as

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.080 
good look today hopefully they're not as
high<00:05:13.620> as<00:05:13.770> they<00:05:13.889> were<00:05:14.009> after<00:05:14.159> ohio<00:05:14.520> state<00:05:14.819> we're

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
high as they were after ohio state we're

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.850 
high as they were after ohio state we're
trying<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.330> keep<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.569> lead<00:05:15.719> system<00:05:16.139> it<00:05:16.650> looked

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
trying to keep the lead system it looked

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.080 
trying to keep the lead system it looked
like<00:05:16.949> they<00:05:17.069> had<00:05:17.159> a<00:05:17.219> good<00:05:17.250> approach<00:05:17.580> today<00:05:17.789> Tim

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
like they had a good approach today Tim

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.990 
like they had a good approach today Tim
so<00:05:18.300> I<00:05:18.330> mean<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.830> strong<00:05:20.069> group<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.550> obviously

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
so I mean the strong group and obviously

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.330 
so I mean the strong group and obviously
I<00:05:21.330> think<00:05:21.750> there's<00:05:21.900> a<00:05:21.930> while<00:05:22.110> air<00:05:22.409> that<00:05:22.620> took<00:05:23.310> a

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
I think there's a while air that took a

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.580 
I think there's a while air that took a
long<00:05:23.490> time<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:23.759> create<00:05:24.169> be<00:05:25.169> able<00:05:25.319> to<00:05:25.379> stay<00:05:25.560> with

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
long time to create be able to stay with

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.740 
long time to create be able to stay with
real<00:05:26.340> quick<00:05:26.550> going<00:05:26.729> back<00:05:26.909> 20<00:05:27.090> line<00:05:27.389> police

to<00:05:32.580> go<00:05:32.669> ranking<00:05:33.389> them<00:05:33.449> but<00:05:33.599> I<00:05:33.629> think<00:05:33.960> gun<00:05:34.110> is

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
to go ranking them but I think gun is

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.260 
to go ranking them but I think gun is
just<00:05:35.219> performed<00:05:35.699> the<00:05:36.120> most<00:05:36.240> assistant

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
linder was the first three games i think

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.060 
linder was the first three games i think

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.040 
gun as I've taken his game up to the
next<00:05:43.310> notch<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.730> so<00:05:44.420> now<00:05:44.540> it's<00:05:44.690> up<00:05:44.780> it's<00:05:44.900> time
