00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Today, exactly today , the xps one 27 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.130
 Foreigners 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.019
 the idea is to find out where i can 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 double the RAM 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.240
 triples tenfold and above 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.510
 All the more important the express of 27 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.949
 had hdw plate mitgekriegt in each 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.310
 case a 2 terabyte hard disk and 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.579
 actually you want the next 12 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.309
 change months to ssd 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:46.160
 we now have two screws so 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:46.160
 listened to and theoretically exclude and 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.260
 that's all relatively straightforward for me 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.020
 at first glance at the second 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.010
 look ask me where are the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.840
 individual things i would say that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.059
 I'm after the hard drive 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.519
 you have to go to us on the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.340
 manager I will soon put the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.299
 us-data ostrich then and the menu then 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.100
 You can check it yourself again 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 Everybody wanted to change but saw 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.920
 and straightforward here are the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.229
 Ventilation systems in there 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.210
 under it hide completely 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.210
 sure there where it says hdd 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.799
 and where it says what is behind 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 lamstedt taken if it takes the drum 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.100
 you have always been a few times 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.140
 shown house where you can be there 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.890
 bit of release then you can get the ram 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.720
 latch out very clear 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.920
 that's great that 's obvious 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:03.170
 So that's for people who made me 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:06.110
 if you look again one before 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.030
 cool ribs with it turn off the dsl 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.619
 here above is therefore the preceding 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.530
 I've shown it lately 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.330
 here for why 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.730
 Details are also available from 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.160
 on the outside convey the feeling there is the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.230
 Come through the air if I am now 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.330
 looks exactly here, however , it looks 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.590
 as if no air whirled out 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.840
 but that is only here 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.010
 it may be that it is a bit 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.409
 so little is there before 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.620
 gambling is already pretty good 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.269
 lead and then has difficulties 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.230
 has to transport the air away 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.069
 carry away 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.150
 I just look if all of you is on it 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.150
 and how things are already running 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.900
 Do you want to be a little careful ? 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.900
 and straight 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.070
 so and I realize the hdd is not 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:24.670
 down work processor 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:27.250
 I believe this with the camera underneath 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.350
 or as I mean the question is how 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.000
 I can get there but that's just how 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.170
 in fact the question is or can be 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.380
 You do not really see what I mean 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.390
 all slots the classically 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.500
 By the way, this battery lubricates exactly this battery 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.360
 behind 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.750
 since the earth must always tell me first 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.030
 where the animal is the battery 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.500
 It always happens after 23 years 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.040
 It can happen that it causes stress 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.310
 since they hear so I exchange them 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.370
 wanted round so looking for the 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.480
 hard drive I'm a bit 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.620
 finally the thing how far 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.780
 to take apart 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.780
 but not classic 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.090
 it is really only as already 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.230
 said it is actually the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.600
 classic looks for the classic 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.900
 hard disks in format 80 powerless 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.900
 countries 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.590
 Yes / Yes 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.470
 the blu-ray drive is clearly logical 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.110
 Here it is also still time on it, the 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.900
 is one actually in this case 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.110
 dvd burner is although i have the system 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.949
 said that's a blu-ray drive 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.930
 So here could be the blu-ray drive 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.310
 exchange is not uninteresting 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.389
 because of course in the same 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.659
 I can also interface one 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.759
 Reinstall the hard disk and a 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:53.669
 The blu ray no longer needs it here 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:57.000
 simply expand there is so fawn 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:00.270
 for not not children but television 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.610
 so systems where you get this shape and 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.009
 then just the ss can pack the pure 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.509
 to lure one of the advantages of a ssd 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.659
 can leave for the operating system and 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:13.199
 for the important application and for 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.210
 other the two terabytes hdd themselves 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.190
 with a lot of security now 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:23.789
 mother finds the location plan as short 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:28.409
 set on it and the map says yet 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:31.199
 very unique hdd is here 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:35.580
 So here is the fan and 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.860
 so very unlikely that and then 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:55.159
 I would say 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:55.159
 it is always there 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.699
 so from birth 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:13.790
 and then can be found here including a 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.470
 2 terabyte hard disk clearly logical because 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.180
 of course that's right again 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.560
 in the ordinary in a real heat 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.790
 no longer using the notebook systems 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.060
 hard disks that are so small 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.850
 but that's a lot stronger 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.340
 hdds are built-in 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.710
 There is also a short exchange 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.270
 look worthy of the ordinary 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.400
 connections that you saw me so 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.640
 really nice on the head 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:43.220
 get the position but you are usb 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:45.200
 3.0 without network cable hdmi hdm out is 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.150
 pretty cool at the quali winner through 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.850
 grind and in case of doubt video 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.490
 recorder a man comes pretty cool 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:55.280
 if you are somehow very brilliant films 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.810
 wants to see and finn closed and 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.180
 determined on this sexy 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.130
 would like to bring heavy part away 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.660
 definitely not someone in 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:08.300
 would have presentation room I had the 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.710
 suspected is the variant here 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.710
 decided to build by 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.330
 admittedly york has a hard time 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.440
 seen how fast you get this one 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.970
 can degrade 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.020
 It's fast legistical because 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.020
 I know that then
