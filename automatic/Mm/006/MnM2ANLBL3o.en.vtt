00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
grafting with pecan trees last year like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.609 
grafting with pecan trees last year like
we<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.740> young<00:01:26.009> pecan<00:01:26.939> tree<00:01:27.619> you're

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
we did on this young pecan tree you're

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.710 
we did on this young pecan tree you're
going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> need<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:29.310> back<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.759> any<00:01:30.270> time<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
going to need to go back in any time in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
going to need to go back in any time in
the<00:01:30.810> spring<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.320> early<00:01:31.350> summer<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.369> and

the spring or early summer like now and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.940 
the spring or early summer like now and
do<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> little<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.960> pruning<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.650> start

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
do a little bit of pruning to start

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.899 
do a little bit of pruning to start
getting<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.670> growth<00:01:35.909> growing<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.630> through

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
getting the growth growing up through

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.960 
getting the growth growing up through
your<00:01:38.909> Scion<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.600> start<00:01:40.500> getting<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.979> good<00:01:41.700> tree

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
your Scion and start getting a good tree

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.340 
your Scion and start getting a good tree
structure<00:01:42.439> beginning<00:01:44.000> now<00:01:45.000> these<00:01:45.350> lower

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
structure beginning now these lower

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
structure beginning now these lower
branches<00:01:47.180> we<00:01:48.180> left<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.950> sort<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.750> braking

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.770 
branches we left as sort of a braking
system<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:53.280> don't<00:01:53.579> want<00:01:53.850> excessive<00:01:54.509> growth

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
system you don't want excessive growth

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.080 
system you don't want excessive growth
of<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.439> sign<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> first<00:01:56.399> year<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:56.909> these

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
of that sign in the first year so these

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.170 
of that sign in the first year so these
branches<00:01:57.659> were<00:01:58.380> left<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.070> absorb<00:01:59.520> some<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
energy from that root stock so the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.569 
energy from that root stock so the

our graft is well healed
it's<00:02:17.770> quite<00:02:18.010> strong<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:18.760> ready<00:02:19.030> to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.400 
so we need to go in and start removing
some<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:27.880> these<00:02:28.030> lower<00:02:28.300> branches<00:02:28.540> we're<00:02:29.290> not
