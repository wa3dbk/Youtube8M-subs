middle areas what is with that sliding
that<00:01:27.390> was<00:01:27.600> friggin<00:01:28.229> interesting<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that was friggin interesting so I got to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.219 
that was friggin interesting so I got to
be<00:01:35.430> careful<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.909> Israel's<00:01:36.360> skill<00:01:36.689> shots<00:01:36.960> here

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that most of them can go through most of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.450 
that most of them can go through most of
them<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.649> through<00:01:43.920> minions<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:46.369> going<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
them can go through minions so going to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.499

none<00:03:20.239> of<00:03:20.360> that<00:03:21.850> as<00:03:22.850> far<00:03:23.060> as<00:03:23.209> i<00:03:23.300> know<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.690> homing

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
none of that as far as i know the homing

missile targets the nearest enemy unit

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.080 
missile targets the nearest enemy unit
which<00:03:26.600> means<00:03:27.130> if<00:03:28.130> i<00:03:28.310> put<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.520> champion<00:03:28.970> in

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
which means if i put a champion in

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.790 
which means if i put a champion in
between<00:03:29.360> me<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.750> him<00:03:29.870> where<00:03:30.080> he<00:03:30.140> teleports<00:03:30.680> it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
between me and him where he teleports it

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.729 
between me and him where he teleports it
should<00:03:30.980> be<00:03:31.239> relatively<00:03:32.239> ok<00:03:32.720> i<00:03:35.739> should

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
should be relatively ok i should

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:37.840 
should be relatively ok i should
probably<00:03:36.890> be<00:03:37.070> trying<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.280> push<00:03:37.489> him<00:03:37.640> back<00:03:37.790> a

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
probably be trying to push him back a

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.430 
probably be trying to push him back a
little<00:03:38.090> more<00:03:38.330> but<00:03:38.480> he's<00:03:38.600> at<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.840> tower<00:03:39.080> so<00:03:39.410> i

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
little more but he's at the tower so i

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.560 
little more but he's at the tower so i
can't<00:03:39.739> really<00:03:39.880> get<00:03:40.880> in<00:03:41.000> there<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:42.910> do<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.090> can't

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
can't really get in there to do it can't

for<00:03:46.820> tower<00:03:46.970> damage<00:03:47.330> here<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.780> can<00:03:47.930> see

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
for tower damage here because I can see

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.920 
for tower damage here because I can see
that<00:03:48.230> he's<00:03:48.320> trying<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.709> go<00:03:48.830> for<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.930> defensive

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
that he's trying to go for a defensive

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.810 
that he's trying to go for a defensive

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
little bit safe here because i figured

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.600 
little bit safe here because i figured
something<00:07:16.360> stupid<00:07:16.720> like<00:07:16.810> that<00:07:16.870> would<00:07:17.140> happen

now i'm going to be going back hopefully
his<00:07:19.990> ultimate<00:07:20.410> shouldn't<00:07:20.710> be<00:07:20.800> back<00:07:21.040> up<00:07:22.560> and

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030 
his ultimate shouldn't be back up and

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.450 
his ultimate shouldn't be back up and
thinking<00:07:25.030> about<00:07:25.270> grabbing<00:07:25.510> the<00:07:26.080> phage<00:07:26.380> so<00:07:27.340> i'm

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:27.460 
thinking about grabbing the phage so i'm

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.700 
thinking about grabbing the phage so i'm
going<00:07:27.610> to<00:07:27.730> do<00:07:27.880> that<00:07:28.120> get<00:07:29.050> myself<00:07:29.200> a<00:07:29.470> little<00:07:29.530> bit

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710 
going to do that get myself a little bit

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.200 
going to do that get myself a little bit
of<00:07:29.830> extra<00:07:29.920> hit<00:07:30.220> points<00:07:30.490> potential<00:07:30.910> to<00:07:31.000> slow

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
of extra hit points potential to slow

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.940 
of extra hit points potential to slow
him<00:07:31.330> down<00:07:31.360> a<00:07:31.540> little<00:07:31.660> bit<00:07:31.960> he's<00:07:32.800> probably

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950 
him down a little bit he's probably

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.220 
him down a little bit he's probably
gonna<00:07:33.160> have<00:07:33.280> a<00:07:33.340> chance<00:07:33.490> to<00:07:33.670> push<00:07:33.820> the<00:07:33.940> tower

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 
gonna have a chance to push the tower

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.210 
gonna have a chance to push the tower
but<00:07:35.230> it<00:07:35.350> shouldn't<00:07:35.590> be<00:07:35.620> that<00:07:35.680> big<00:07:35.920> of<00:07:35.980> a<00:07:36.100> deal

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:36.220 
but it shouldn't be that big of a deal

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.900 
but it shouldn't be that big of a deal
he<00:07:36.370> shouldn't<00:07:36.610> feel<00:07:36.700> to<00:07:36.790> do<00:07:36.910> that<00:07:37.060> much<00:07:37.180> damage

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:38.910 
he shouldn't feel to do that much damage

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:48.450 
he shouldn't feel to do that much damage
maybe<00:07:39.910> a<00:07:40.360> quarter<00:07:41.050> of<00:07:41.410> the<00:07:41.680> towers<00:07:42.010> life<00:07:47.460> even

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.460 
maybe a quarter of the towers life even

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.650 
maybe a quarter of the towers life even
though<00:07:48.580> i'm<00:07:48.700> going<00:07:48.910> pretty<00:07:49.090> slow<00:07:49.270> yet<00:07:49.540> not

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:49.660
