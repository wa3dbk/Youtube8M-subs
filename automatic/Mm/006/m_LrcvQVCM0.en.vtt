that means that right now the demo at

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.320 
that means that right now the demo at
its<00:00:13.410> most<00:00:13.530> basic<00:00:13.769> level<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.400> playable<00:00:15.030> from

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
its most basic level is playable from

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.380 
its most basic level is playable from
start<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.809> finish<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.880> why<00:00:17.880> are<00:00:17.940> there<00:00:18.180> still

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
start to finish so why are there still

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.109 
start to finish so why are there still
12<00:00:18.660> days<00:00:18.900> until<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.289> get<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> demo

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
12 days until we get to see the demo

12 days until we get to see the demo
good<00:00:21.119> question<00:00:21.660> audience<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.439> short<00:00:22.680> answer

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
good question audience the short answer

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.099 
good question audience the short answer
is<00:00:23.039> we've<00:00:23.460> got<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> lot<00:00:23.939> more<00:00:23.970> stuff<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.779> but

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
is we've got a lot more stuff to do but

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.859 
is we've got a lot more stuff to do but
the<00:00:25.260> long<00:00:25.470> answer<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.340> follows<00:00:26.789> now<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the long answer is as follows now that

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.810 
the long answer is as follows now that
ethereal<00:00:28.199> gates<00:00:28.590> has<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:29.039> maps<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> events

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
ethereal gates has all maps and events

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.609 
ethereal gates has all maps and events
done<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.390> finally<00:00:30.720> move<00:00:31.019> from<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> alpha

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
done we finally move from the alpha

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.830 
done we finally move from the alpha
phase<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.279> call<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> beta<00:00:32.850> phase<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
phase to what we call the beta phase the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.780 
phase to what we call the beta phase the
beta<00:00:34.079> phase<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.219> complete<00:00:35.489> product

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
beta phase is not the complete product

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.630 
beta phase is not the complete product
but<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.540> close<00:00:36.840> enough<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.460> we

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
but it's close enough to one so that we

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
but it's close enough to one so that we
can<00:00:38.850> begin<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.510> called<00:00:39.719> beta<00:00:39.960> testing

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
can begin what is called beta testing

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.680 
can begin what is called beta testing
and<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.730> second<00:00:42.329> episode<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and that is what this second episode of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.389 
and that is what this second episode of
behind<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.260> scenes<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.649> Pokemon<00:00:44.010> ethereal

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
beta testing is where a bunch of things

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.580 
beta testing is where a bunch of things
will<00:00:55.520> happen<00:00:55.640> first<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:56.750> foremost<00:00:56.990> we're

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
all potential game breaking bugs we're

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.930 
all potential game breaking bugs we're
also<00:01:03.380> going<00:01:03.650> to<00:01:03.710> be<00:01:03.830> walking<00:01:04.070> into<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:04.760> about

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
also going to be walking into just about

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.150 
also going to be walking into just about

every wall in the game to make sure the

buildings stand as they should another
part<00:01:10.160> of<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.310> phase<00:01:10.550> will<00:01:10.700> be<00:01:10.820> giving<00:01:11.150> the

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
part of this phase will be giving the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.710 
part of this phase will be giving the
beta<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.960> other<00:01:12.320> people<00:01:13.420> who<00:01:14.420> have<00:01:14.540> never

played<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.229> game<00:01:15.260> before<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.040> we<00:01:16.130> can

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
played the game before so that we can

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.930 
played the game before so that we can
get<00:01:16.400> feedback<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:17.270> pacing<00:01:18.170> strategy<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.370> play

time from some pairs of fresh eyes

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.340 
time from some pairs of fresh eyes
before<00:01:23.119> people<00:01:23.690> start<00:01:23.930> flooding<00:01:24.170> the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
before people start flooding the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.830 
before people start flooding the
comments<00:01:24.800> I<00:01:24.890> do<00:01:24.950> need<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.310> say<00:01:25.580> this<00:01:25.790> we<00:01:26.600> will

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
comments I do need to say this we will

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.490 
comments I do need to say this we will
be<00:01:26.960> doing<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.619> closed<00:01:28.460> beta<00:01:29.080> this<00:01:30.080> means<00:01:30.350> that

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
be doing a closed beta this means that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.620 
be doing a closed beta this means that
the<00:01:30.650> beta<00:01:30.979> is<00:01:31.220> going<00:01:31.550> out<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.850> close<00:01:32.119> friends

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
the beta is going out to close friends

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.320 
the beta is going out to close friends
people<00:01:33.380> we<00:01:33.500> know<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:33.710> trust<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.610> those<00:01:35.180> who

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
people we know and trust and those who

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.020 
people we know and trust and those who
already<00:01:35.509> know<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> bunch<00:01:36.050> about<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.440> game<00:01:37.030> the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
already know a bunch about the game the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.670 
already know a bunch about the game the
reason<00:01:38.420> we're<00:01:38.570> doing<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:38.900> is<00:01:39.050> because<00:01:39.320> we're

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
reason we're doing this is because we're

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.200 
reason we're doing this is because we're
still<00:01:39.770> all<00:01:39.979> about<00:01:40.460> preserving<00:01:40.729> the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
still all about preserving the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.450 
still all about preserving the
experience<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.080> while<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.619> beta<00:01:42.830> is<00:01:43.040> close

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
experience and while the beta is close

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.150 
experience and while the beta is close
to<00:01:43.670> being<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.000> final<00:01:44.180> product<00:01:44.540> it<00:01:44.920> still<00:01:45.920> will

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
to being the final product it still will

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.770 
to being the final product it still will
have<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.399> lot<00:01:46.729> in<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.210> we're<00:01:47.330> not<00:01:47.509> quite

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
have a lot in it that we're not quite

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.260 
have a lot in it that we're not quite
done<00:01:47.810> with<00:01:48.020> yet<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:49.160> recently<00:01:49.460> switched<00:01:49.850> over

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
done with yet we recently switched over
