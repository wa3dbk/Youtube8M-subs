00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
belt and the belt is kind of surprising

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.100

because<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.459> artwork<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.660> back<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:51.020> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
because the artwork on the back of the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.190 
because the artwork on the back of the
box<00:02:51.320> doesn't<00:02:51.920> show<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:52.850> she<00:02:53.330> has<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.510> belt<00:02:53.840> and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
it clasps around in the back so the belt

it clasps around in the back so the belt
is<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.530> bit<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.920> bonus<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:59.120> is<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.330> little<00:02:59.600> hard

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
is a bit of a bonus it is a little hard

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.229
