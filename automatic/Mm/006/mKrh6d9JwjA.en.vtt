about<00:00:02.159> how<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.429> change<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.939> home<00:00:03.149> furnace

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
about how to change a home furnace

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.010 
about how to change a home furnace
filter<00:00:04.310> now<00:00:05.310> although<00:00:05.490> some<00:00:06.299> furnace<00:00:06.629> filters

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
filter now although some furnace filters

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.180 
filter now although some furnace filters
are<00:00:07.379> located<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.189> units<00:00:08.760> most<00:00:09.480> houses<00:00:10.190> have

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
are located in units most houses have

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.939 
are located in units most houses have
the<00:00:11.880> air<00:00:12.450> filters<00:00:13.700> installed<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.179> wall

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
the air filters installed in a wall

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.439 
the air filters installed in a wall
receptacle<00:00:16.949> such<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.210> right<00:00:18.390> here

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
receptacle such as this one right here

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.450 
receptacle such as this one right here
so<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.529> access<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.760> simply<00:00:21.180> flip<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:22.460> these

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
so to access it we simply flip out these

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.170 
so to access it we simply flip out these
two<00:00:23.640> levers<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> top<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.609> that<00:00:26.609> gives<00:00:26.849> us

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
two levers on the top and that gives us

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.070 
two levers on the top and that gives us
access<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.890> filter<00:00:29.420> so<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.900> your

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
access to the filter so this is your

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.420 
access to the filter so this is your
return<00:00:31.260> air<00:00:32.960> entrance<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.320> your<00:00:34.380> house<00:00:34.680> as

return air entrance for your house as

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.389 
return air entrance for your house as
you<00:00:35.670> look<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:35.940> these<00:00:36.090> filters<00:00:37.219> whenever<00:00:38.219> you

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you look at these filters whenever you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.440 
you look at these filters whenever you
get<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> buildup<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:40.680> lot<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.579> dark<00:00:41.760> material

you want to change these out and when

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
you want to change these out and when
you<00:00:50.489> look<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.149> size<00:00:51.449> these<00:00:51.870> come<00:00:52.170> in

a situation where he opened up and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.440 
a situation where he opened up and
there's<00:01:03.930> no<00:01:04.110> filter<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.970> markings

there's no filter there or the markings
aren't<00:01:06.840> available<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
aren't available then what you can do is

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.700 
aren't available then what you can do is
you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.720> measure<00:01:11.420> from<00:01:12.420> inside<00:01:12.930> this

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you can measure from inside this

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.960 
you can measure from inside this
recessed<00:01:14.280> area<00:01:14.670> measure<00:01:15.360> side<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.960> side<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
recessed area measure side to side and

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.999 
recessed area measure side to side and
then<00:01:17.970> top<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> bottom<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:21.240> should<00:01:21.600> be

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
then top to bottom and it should be

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.310 
then top to bottom and it should be
right<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> dimensions<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.330> filter

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
right out the dimensions of your filter

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
right out the dimensions of your filter
14<00:01:25.830> by<00:01:26.009> 25<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> once<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.729> our<00:01:29.759> new<00:01:30.030> filter

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
14 by 25 so once we have our new filter

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.210 
14 by 25 so once we have our new filter
it's<00:01:30.900> important<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> look<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> side<00:01:32.189> of

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
it's important to look on the side of

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.010 
it's important to look on the side of
your<00:01:32.400> filter<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> you'll<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.509> there<00:01:33.990> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
your filter and you'll see that there is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.440 
your filter and you'll see that there is
a<00:01:34.110> black<00:01:34.439> arrow<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:35.579> indicates<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a black arrow this indicates the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.480 
a black arrow this indicates the
direction<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.990> air<00:01:37.170> flow<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:38.009> course<00:01:38.250> air

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
direction of air flow and of course air

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.910 
direction of air flow and of course air
is<00:01:38.729> drawing<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.170> always<00:01:40.409> want<00:01:40.770> this

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
is drawing in so we always want this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.010 
is drawing in so we always want this
arrow<00:01:41.540> pointed<00:01:42.540> towards<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> wall<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.810> we

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
arrow pointed towards the wall so all we

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.980 
arrow pointed towards the wall so all we
need<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:48.439> slide<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.710> filter<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
need to do is slide the filter in and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.789 
need to do is slide the filter in and
sometimes<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.170> takes<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.740> of

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
sometimes it takes a little bit of

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.280 
sometimes it takes a little bit of
pressure<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.280> put<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:54.079> close<00:01:55.079> your

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
pressure to put that in close your

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.950 
pressure to put that in close your
return<00:01:55.590> air<00:01:55.799> grille<00:01:59.420> and<00:02:00.590> you're<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:01.740> set<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
return air grille and you're all set and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.760 
return air grille and you're all set and
periodically<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.200> usually<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> good<00:02:04.710> idea

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
periodically it's usually a good idea

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.300 
periodically it's usually a good idea
with<00:02:05.670> your<00:02:05.880> vacuum<00:02:06.469> to<00:02:07.469> vacuum<00:02:07.860> these<00:02:08.039> louvers

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
with your vacuum to vacuum these louvers

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.919 
with your vacuum to vacuum these louvers
and<00:02:08.520> try<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.239> some<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.750> dust

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and try to get some of the dust

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.620 
and try to get some of the dust
accumulation<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:12.440> periodically

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
accumulation and periodically

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.940 
accumulation and periodically
probably<00:02:13.840> once<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.200> year<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.680> want<00:02:14.890> to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
probably once a year you want to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.470 
probably once a year you want to
actually<00:02:15.190> remove<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.640> grill<00:02:15.910> take<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.330> out

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
actually remove this grill take it out

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.230 
actually remove this grill take it out
and<00:02:16.510> hose<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.590> down<00:02:17.620> keep<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.220> clean<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:19.120> will

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
and hose it down keep it clean that will

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.980 
and hose it down keep it clean that will
help<00:02:19.980> keep<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.160> filter<00:02:22.090> working<00:02:22.540> efficiently

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
help keep the filter working efficiently
