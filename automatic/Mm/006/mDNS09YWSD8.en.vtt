00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.670
 a new city we are no longer in town 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.410
 We are no longer in Querétaro now we are 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.410
 in the beautiful tepeyac 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:24.970
 nothing more and nothing more and nothing less than a 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.009
 little cloudy but that is not going to 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.140
 prevent us from showing you everything 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.119
 we have prepared these days and in 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.809
 these more Christian weeks and we have 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.329
 much better we take off so much water and 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.870
 we go there 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.870
 You can record everything 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.520
 arrived at the point of sale of poster in 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.350
 park plaza and how to be 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.239
 fulfilled we arrived here in plaza del 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 park and they received us very well basic 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.860
 mariachis for one achieved achieved but 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.590
 good these services we will be 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 talking about the link s600 but of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.489
 what do you think is enough if we analyze 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.199
 the screen of this phone that all 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.200
 they make the screen this chapter like this 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:14.790
 is accompany me to the one where you accompany me 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:17.160
 we do not go so here we have the unics 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.960
 killing is 600 and we are going to talk to you 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.830
 about some very cool features 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.740
 of this team 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.660
 for example the screen is hd ips and then 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 good as many already know hd means 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.860
 high definition or high definition not here 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.350
 in Spanish and it's the evolution in 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 video quality is to say a TV or a 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.190
 HD camera is a device that reproduces or 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.259
 register the images in a quality 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.910
 higher than the formats that are 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.229
 they knew so far and good with the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.270
 overcrowding of digital cameras 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.830
 it was a fact that they will begin to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.159
 evolve towards higher formats 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.649
 quality 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.719
 good phd as you want and more or less 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:55.479
 but ips well explained to ips a screen 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.250
 ips intuic switching for its acronyms 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.810
 English s classic that has a 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.369
 internal arrangement of the crystals 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.469
 liquids that prevents leaks and losses 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.420
 of light phenomenon that degrades the quality 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.759
 of image and definition of their colors 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.259
 especially the dark ones it is possible to emphasize 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.060
 that the colors arranged in said 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.830
 liquid crystal are illuminated by 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.840
 behind with a second layer of spotlights 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.230
 LEDs so all ips screen 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.970
 modern is a lcd liquid crystal top 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.560
 and with a led layer on the back 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.540
 good can and in the last case 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.760
 that's why it's going to serve me both 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.530
 they look there is where the hd does the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.970
 difference since high definition has 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.590
 a higher quality than the formats 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.769
 standards 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:38.200
 On the screen HD Ips is ideal to see 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:40.650
 videos on your YouTube channel games in 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.650
 High Definition 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.540
 movie applications like netflix and 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.049
 your personal videos 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.049
 ah 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.870
 that means that with his 8 camera 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.970
 megapixels you can enjoy your 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.530
 photographs in hd and with a better 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.810
 resolution because it has double 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.190
 flash is the little foxes and good people 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.500
 are loose on the screen of 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.880
 choose I s 600 as 20 cristian me 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.280
 like where the truth is I did not think 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.170
 that you get cancer at my term of hd 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.610
 but we were looking for colors and they are alive and 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.080
 people can check it in a center 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.110
 of attention of it can not ask for a 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.970
 try to show them the s600 and they can 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.590
 check that if we are talking to 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.570
 the whole truth of the world so that we do not 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.710
 say 22 but good in the next 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.930
 impressions we will continue talking 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.830
 about this model so this in this and 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.830
 we are already going 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:44.990
 and we are going to eat something typical of querétaro 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.990
 I do not know what is typical good friends 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.080
 and 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.080
 Y 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.630
