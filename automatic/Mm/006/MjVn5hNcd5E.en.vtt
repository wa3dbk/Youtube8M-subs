00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.860 

now<00:00:05.550> I<00:00:05.580> want<00:00:05.760> to<00:00:05.820> talk<00:00:06.000> about<00:00:06.180> what<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.630> call

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
now I want to talk about what I call

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.900 
now I want to talk about what I call
rhythmic<00:00:07.380> phrasing<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.610> previous

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
rhythmic phrasing and the previous

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.460 
rhythmic phrasing and the previous
segment<00:00:09.330> about<00:00:09.510> triplets<00:00:10.020> it's<00:00:10.170> really

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:10.470 
segment about triplets it's really

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.890 
segment about triplets it's really
strongly<00:00:11.280> related<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.910> because<00:00:12.270> it's

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
strongly related to that because it's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.140 
strongly related to that because it's
about<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.350> rhythms<00:00:13.730> so<00:00:14.730> when<00:00:14.879> I<00:00:14.910> talk<00:00:15.120> about

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
about the rhythms so when I talk about

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.870 
about the rhythms so when I talk about
rhythmic<00:00:15.750> phrasing<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.530> mean<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.490> rhythm

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
rhythmic phrasing I mean the rhythm

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.390 
rhythmic phrasing I mean the rhythm
that's<00:00:18.390> used<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> lick<00:00:19.470> or<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.950> the<00:00:20.010> idea

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
that's used for the lick or for the idea

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.320 
that's used for the lick or for the idea
and<00:00:21.680> this<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.010> really<00:00:23.460> important<00:00:24.060> thing<00:00:24.120> to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and this is a really important thing to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.500 
and this is a really important thing to
practice<00:00:25.020> I<00:00:25.140> find<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.030> way<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.270> you<00:00:27.390> can

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
practice I find the one way that you can

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.290 
practice I find the one way that you can
do<00:00:27.600> this<00:00:27.780> is<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.960> listen<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:29.030> solos<00:00:30.030> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
do this is to listen to solos and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.830 
do this is to listen to solos and
records<00:00:30.870> and<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.350> try<00:00:32.129> and<00:00:32.160> memorize

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
records and really try and memorize

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.139 
records and really try and memorize
maybe<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> part<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.320> solo<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.890> lick<00:00:35.610> yes

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
maybe a part of a solo a lick yes

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.660 
maybe a part of a solo a lick yes
memorize<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.140> rhythm<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.129> sing

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
memorize the rhythm for it and you sing

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.329 
memorize the rhythm for it and you sing
along<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.269> hum<00:00:39.539> along<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:40.620> I'm<00:00:40.859> personally

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
along and hum along now I'm personally

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.369 
along and hum along now I'm personally
probably<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> worst<00:00:42.239> singers<00:00:42.989> north

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
probably one of the worst singers north

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.630 
probably one of the worst singers north
of<00:00:43.620> Antarctica<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.230> doesn't<00:00:46.620> matter<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
of Antarctica but it doesn't matter the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.579 
of Antarctica but it doesn't matter the
important<00:00:48.179> thing<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.929> rhythm<00:00:49.109> so

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
important thing is just the rhythm so

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.910 
important thing is just the rhythm so
what<00:00:50.069> I<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.749> listen<00:00:51.749> to<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.019> track<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
what I would do is listen to a track and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.619 
what I would do is listen to a track and
go<00:00:53.100> bump<00:00:53.609> bump<00:00:53.760> bottom<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.379> uh<00:00:55.699> that<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
go bump bump bottom but but uh that you

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.819 
go bump bump bottom but but uh that you
know<00:00:57.719> Connor<00:00:57.960> called<00:00:58.319> me<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:58.620> they're<00:00:58.800> doing

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
know Connor called me what they're doing

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.629 
know Connor called me what they're doing
and<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.710> memorize<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.159> then<00:01:02.309> when<00:01:02.519> I'm

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:02.639 
and and memorize that so then when I'm

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:04.399 
and and memorize that so then when I'm
playing<00:01:02.909> myself<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.749> actually<00:01:03.899> execute

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
playing myself I can actually execute

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.460 
playing myself I can actually execute
those<00:01:04.800> rhythms<00:01:05.040> using<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.700> scale<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.870> one<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
those rhythms using a scale or a one of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.319 
those rhythms using a scale or a one of
these<00:01:07.560> concepts<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.579> talked<00:01:08.790> about<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
these concepts that I talked about and

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.100 
these concepts that I talked about and
it's<00:01:09.630> gonna<00:01:09.719> sound<00:01:09.960> great<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.960> I'm<00:01:12.960> gonna

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it's gonna sound great so I'm gonna

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
it's gonna sound great so I'm gonna
illustrate<00:01:13.469> how<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.399> how<00:01:14.759> I<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.390> when

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
illustrate how you how I do this when

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.030 
illustrate how you how I do this when
I'm<00:01:15.750> practicing<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.590> taking<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.920> few

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
I'm practicing actually I'm taking a few

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.670 
I'm practicing actually I'm taking a few
notes<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.180> case<00:01:18.450> I'm<00:01:18.630> gonna<00:01:18.719> use<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
notes in this case I'm gonna use the a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.270 
notes in this case I'm gonna use the a
minor<00:01:20.159> blue<00:01:20.460> scale<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.500> I'm<00:01:22.500> gonna<00:01:22.740> reuse<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
minor blue scale and I'm gonna reuse the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.830 
minor blue scale and I'm gonna reuse the
same<00:01:23.430> notes<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:23.789> I'm<00:01:23.909> gonna<00:01:24.000> change<00:01:24.420> where<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
same notes but I'm gonna change where I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.870 
same notes but I'm gonna change where I
start<00:01:25.520> where<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> end<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.079> note<00:01:28.950> duration

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
start where I end the the note duration

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.340 
start where I end the the note duration
of<00:01:29.969> each<00:01:30.060> note<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.539> gonna<00:01:30.719> change<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
of each note is gonna change so the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.319 
of each note is gonna change so the
whole<00:01:31.500> phrase<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:32.039> sound<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.640> little<00:01:33.119> bit

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
whole phrase gonna sound a little bit

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
whole phrase gonna sound a little bit
different<00:01:33.630> each<00:01:33.780> time<00:01:34.219> but<00:01:35.219> I'm<00:01:35.340> still<00:01:35.549> using

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
different each time but I'm still using

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
different each time but I'm still using
the<00:01:35.850> same<00:01:35.880> notes<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:37.320> an<00:01:37.439> example<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the same notes so that's an example of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.240 
the same notes so that's an example of
of<00:01:38.520> taking<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.719> few<00:01:39.960> notes<00:01:40.380> reusing<00:01:41.130> them

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
of taking just a few notes reusing them

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.859 
of taking just a few notes reusing them
over<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.700> over<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> vary<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.719> rhythm

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
over and over but you vary the rhythm

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.899 
over and over but you vary the rhythm
and<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.740> gonna<00:01:43.859> totally<00:01:44.039> change<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> sound

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and it's gonna totally change the sound

00:01:44.909 --> 00:02:30.610 
and it's gonna totally change the sound
of<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> whole<00:01:45.240> thing

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.820 

so<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.650> tried<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.100> stick<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:32.760> plan<00:02:33.830> those

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
so I tried to stick to this plan those

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.670 
so I tried to stick to this plan those
notes<00:02:35.130> from<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.400> pentatonic<00:02:35.700> scale<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.120> I

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
notes from the pentatonic scale and I

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.940 
notes from the pentatonic scale and I
changed<00:02:37.680> where<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.840> started<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.930> note<00:02:40.140> perhaps<00:02:40.830> a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
changed where I started a note perhaps a

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.740 
changed where I started a note perhaps a
little<00:02:41.040> bit<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.490> how<00:02:41.940> long<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.270> stayed<00:02:42.570> on

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
little bit and I how long I stayed on

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.199 
little bit and I how long I stayed on
some<00:02:43.020> notes<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.560> how<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.800> ended<00:02:44.220> them<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.610> by

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
some notes and how I ended them and by

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.210 
some notes and how I ended them and by
doing<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.660> hear<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.110> sounds<00:02:46.620> different<00:02:47.070> it

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
doing so you hear it sounds different it

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.860 
doing so you hear it sounds different it
doesn't<00:02:47.760> sound<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.390> same<00:02:48.630> lake

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
doesn't sound like it's the same lake

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.070 
doesn't sound like it's the same lake
anymore<00:02:49.790> not<00:02:50.790> all<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.300> these<00:02:51.390> were<00:02:51.750> Great

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
anymore not all of these were Great

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.190 
anymore not all of these were Great
Lakes<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:53.060> agree<00:02:54.060> completely<00:02:54.330> but<00:02:54.720> that's<00:02:55.050> not

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
Lakes I agree completely but that's not

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.949 
Lakes I agree completely but that's not
the<00:02:55.320> point<00:02:55.500> that's<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.920> point<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.720> you

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the point that's the point is that you

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.530 
the point that's the point is that you
can<00:02:58.200> change<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.850> sound<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.830> just<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.980> few<00:03:02.130> notes

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
can change the sound of just a few notes

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.630 
can change the sound of just a few notes
as<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:04.290> lick<00:03:04.680> by<00:03:05.100> varying<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.760> rhythm<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
as a lick by varying the rhythm and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.090 
as a lick by varying the rhythm and
focusing<00:03:08.640> on<00:03:08.850> little<00:03:09.380> rhythmic<00:03:10.380> hooks<00:03:10.769> that's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
focusing on little rhythmic hooks that's

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.270 
focusing on little rhythmic hooks that's
gonna<00:03:11.430> make<00:03:12.300> them<00:03:12.480> stand<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:14.130> think

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
gonna make them stand out and I think

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.310 
gonna make them stand out and I think
when<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.030> add<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.510> triplets<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.050> hope<00:03:16.200> you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
when I add the triplets I hope you

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.009 
when I add the triplets I hope you
notice<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.690> that's<00:03:18.690> an<00:03:18.870> example

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
notice that that that that's an example

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.500 
notice that that that that's an example
of<00:03:19.500> rhythmic<00:03:19.739> phrasing<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.760> works<00:03:21.090> well

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
of rhythmic phrasing that works well

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.949 
of rhythmic phrasing that works well
because<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:23.459> just<00:03:23.850> makes<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.360> more

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
because it it just makes it more

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.330 
because it it just makes it more
attractive<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.830> year<00:03:25.980> because<00:03:26.190> it's

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
attractive to the year because it's

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.430 
attractive to the year because it's
repeated<00:03:27.000> it's<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.570> repetition<00:03:27.959> thing<00:03:28.290> in

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
repeated it's a repetition thing in

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.520 
repeated it's a repetition thing in
there<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:30.800> rhythmic<00:03:31.800> phrasing<00:03:32.280> as<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:33.530> concept

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
there so rhythmic phrasing as a concept

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.759 
there so rhythmic phrasing as a concept
is<00:03:34.800> about<00:03:35.209> finding<00:03:36.209> little<00:03:37.049> rhythms<00:03:37.650> that

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
is about finding little rhythms that

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.460 
is about finding little rhythms that
makes<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.549> ear<00:03:38.730> go<00:03:39.000> yeah<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:39.690> cool<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.230> like

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
makes the ear go yeah that's cool I like

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.130 
makes the ear go yeah that's cool I like
that<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:42.090> lot<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.390> times<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.750> notes<00:03:42.959> are

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
that and a lot of times the notes are

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.900 
that and a lot of times the notes are
secondary<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:45.799> what<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.830> recommend<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.430> do<00:03:47.670> to

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
secondary and what I recommend you do to

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.240 
secondary and what I recommend you do to
get<00:03:48.060> better<00:03:48.269> at<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.019> listen<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:50.190> your

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
get better at this is to listen in your

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.750 
get better at this is to listen in your
car<00:03:50.459> when<00:03:50.880> you're<00:03:51.000> driving<00:03:51.090> or<00:03:51.570> when<00:03:52.560> you're

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
car when you're driving or when you're

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.400 
car when you're driving or when you're
doing<00:03:53.760> something<00:03:53.970> where<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.360> have<00:03:54.959> time<00:03:55.200> to

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
doing something where you have time to

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.100 
doing something where you have time to
just<00:03:55.440> listen<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.160> tune<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.930> because<00:03:57.930> great

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
just listen to a tune and because great

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.740

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
if you can loop it and just listen for

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.180 
if you can loop it and just listen for
that<00:04:00.989> part<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.380> really<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.070> maybe

something and before you know what you
have<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.889> really<00:04:33.160> cool<00:04:33.280> lick<00:04:33.520> so<00:04:34.450> rhythmic

phrasing<00:04:35.380> is<00:04:35.470> an<00:04:35.590> important<00:04:36.100> part<00:04:36.340> of

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
phrasing is an important part of

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.420 
phrasing is an important part of
improvising<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.380> even<00:04:39.220> though<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.370> just

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
improvising and even though I just

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.129 
improvising and even though I just
scratched<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:39.970> surface<00:04:40.180> on<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:40.750> topic<00:04:41.050> of

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
scratched the surface on the topic of

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.430 
scratched the surface on the topic of
phrasing<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:42.250> do<00:04:42.669> think<00:04:43.060> this<00:04:43.270> little<00:04:43.990> thing<00:04:44.350> I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
phrasing I do think this little thing I

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.010 
phrasing I do think this little thing I
talked<00:04:44.740> about<00:04:44.979> yes<00:04:45.250> for<00:04:45.550> rhythm<00:04:46.020> itself
