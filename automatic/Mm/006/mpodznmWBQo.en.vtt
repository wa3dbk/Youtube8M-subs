 of 1 liter or so small molds 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.549
 for example the green mold of 125 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.820
 megawatts each is next for the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.430

 whipped and 200 g strawberries 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.420
 so let's start preparing our 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.759
 chocolate flora so first of all 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.759
 put your butter in a saucepan 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:38.909
 and melt it flank during this 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.299
 time treat your chocolate like this 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.299
 site 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:50.549
 so when your butter will be fine 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:58.049
 melted add your dark chocolate including 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:02:04.649
 julia the whole thing once the whole thing will be 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:07.100
 well melted add in your sugar and 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.100
 mix 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.540
 during that time put your milk 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.409
 in a small saucepan and carry so 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.409
 your milk to a boil 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:32.360
 then add your flour already 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:41.569
 sieved and mix using your 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:49.209
 corner so incorporate your milk 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:49.209
 boiling gently while stirring 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:11.069
 and therefore boils the preparation to 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.069
 flank for 4 to 5 minutes 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.379
 it is important to turn without stopping 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:28.269
 because otherwise it might be risk of 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.810
 get burned so prepare your mold in 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.239
 the wetting 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:39.250
 with a little water like these have 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.250
 started pouring your preparation 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.799
 so do a little devil your 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.280
 preparation and then once well 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:00.340
 teddy the whole cover up your mold with 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.819
 transparent film and keep it 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.010
 your fleet of chocolate in the fridge during 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.060
 at least four months I advise you 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.980
 to do it in the evening for the next day 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:21.100
 so once spent a night in the fridge 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:23.260
 remove so the film is transparent so 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.520
 you have difficulty returning 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.190
 your flame immersed so your flank to 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.220
 upside down like these in water 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.220
 boiling 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:46.800
 then take your plate put there 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.800
 over and flip them over 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.430
 and so now lift your mold 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 here 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.599
 so put your cream into a 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:15.099
 sleeve pocket and started decorating 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.099
 your flank simply 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.680
 and complete your flame with 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.680
 the strawberries 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.710
 so here is the result of the fund at the 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.100
 chocolate with its whipped cream and 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.270
