00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello very good future diamonds 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.150
 welcome to this new video blog what 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.740
 first apologize a little for my 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.869
 I'm pretty tired right now 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.659
 I've slept very little tonight is more the 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:14.129
 video that I'm going to take a nap already 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:16.049
 take back a little the energies that this 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.750
 night at 10 we play against accelerate 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.310
 our first game of the third sprint 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.420
 of division of honor so you have to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.790
 be cool and you have to play well 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.890
 we have been training with the 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.780
 new super fast dragon and mainly 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 this video is for that to explain the 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.189
 change of missing by hacking the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.550
 reasons a little and well let's go to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.050
 start to see the first thing to say that this 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.429
 change has not been a desired change nor 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.559
 much less we would have loved 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.819
 keep playing with jaclyn but what 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.350
 happens is that garden came out in a 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:45.359
 offer good job out makes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.519
 time and it was a job that was going to 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.309
 occupy eight hours a day if I do not 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.260
 I'm wrong five days a week and that's 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.909
 true that we could not reconcile 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.920
 with the team we could reconcile 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.659
 with the rest of the availability that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.240
 we have the rest to keep trying 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.530
 improve and good then no 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.290
 we have not been able to continue with him the truth 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.330
 what a pity because personally 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.670
 I think as a player 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.470
 contributed a lot to the team not only 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.180
 in game but also out of the game a 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.640
 Very nice person that is great with 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.500
 everyone and the whole thing in 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.060
 the team the truth that not always the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.190
 good vibes in the team was so 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.810
 It hurts a lot to lose one 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.070
 person who contributed so much good vibes to 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.050
 already departed team not only good roll 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.730
 but actually it plays well or be 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.710
 the improvement that crime had had in the 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.690
 last two months it was amazing all 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.670
 the division players of honor me 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.260
 have commented is more this weekend 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 is so social are born in the event of 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.000
 madrid of the girl and has not spoken everything 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 this with them and everyone said it 's a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.910
 pity because -ha really cream now 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.360
 himself is improving to a level 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.310
 incredible but that is the truth 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 there's not much more to do really 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.900
 I found out when the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.460
 decision I remember that is doing 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.590
 this book is making tucumÃ¡n and duke 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.120
 and suddenly this and some of you are 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.680
 watching streaming you could see it 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.180
 and I remember I was playing and I 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.980
 they said yesterday even you have to stay 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.440
 two minutes to download one thing 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.610
 it's worth the end of the game that ends 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.350
 the game and they told me hey what's 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.690
 past this with hungry in the letter is 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.030
 total and jair and I'm out let's go to 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.600
 have to put in another support so 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.790
 so well that's what it is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.170
 decided and well then that's what there is 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.480
 really also have to say that 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.100
 I am happy also on the part of fast 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.990
 down I think it's because it's going to contribute 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.330
 very much the team is a great player 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.010
 as you will already know it in case 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.650
 you know it fast 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.510
 support of the giants team before 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.370
 that enter riveros to change or not 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.989
 they did before together just before 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.720
 qualify for the qualifiers of 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.630
 the lcd was changed to riddle by fast 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.459
 dragon 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.080
 fast dragon for riddle and well then 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.610
 I really think it's a very good 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.170
 support one of the best in Spain and 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.000
 that will go general with the team but 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.320
 personally the truth that hurts me 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.150
 fact of having to lose j tears 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.940
 in because the truth that was improving 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.170
 very very well I really know the hacking of 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.880
 the last matches of the players 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.989
 bought in the first matches of 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.610
 the playoffs is that there's no point 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.140
 comparison really is a great 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.060
 pity the truth but good really 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.400
 I could not say no to work was 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.080
 something important to him the money in his 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.120
 house they needed it really was something 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.410
 pretty important so there's that there 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.400
 have priority in this life and that is what 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.409
 that there is really a pity 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.400
 I hope it suits us well 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.680
 great with the team that we follow 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.670
 improving we were striving now of 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.620
 now on we will continue 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.060
 training and we have been playing the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.500
 Saturdays run that tim and we have also 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.569
 played are written against a team 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.340
 pretty good and the two corners we have 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.170
 won and from the start we did lost the 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.609
 last because it has been a bit chaotic 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.599
 apart from them that was very breaded 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.579
 and slept very little tonight in 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.840
 rest really close to 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.970
 train because it was asked please 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.609

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.530

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.970

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.680
 gaming and 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.469
 nothing much more to say but it is 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.959
 for watching the video and that the people who 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.639
 It's also the one we have to do 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.380
 this change for jaclyn I'm sorry I 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.329
 I also assure you that I had 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.889
 liked things would not have been like that 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.389
 but good now we have to adapt to the 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.610
 changes we have to the fast dragon at least 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.830
 the substitution of karim has been with a 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.110
 great support so I 'm sure that the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.600
 things for the better from now on 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.600
