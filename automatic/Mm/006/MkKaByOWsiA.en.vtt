and I am going to bring you guys a famas

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.690 
and I am going to bring you guys a famas
patch<00:00:04.020> video<00:00:04.350> because<00:00:04.710> it<00:00:04.890> was<00:00:05.040> just<00:00:05.069> updated

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
patch video because it was just updated

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.280 
patch video because it was just updated
today<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.330> there<00:00:06.509> seems<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.779> be<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> lot<00:00:07.230> of

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
today and there seems to be a lot of

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.049 
today and there seems to be a lot of
misconceptions<00:00:08.160> about<00:00:08.250> what<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.730> famas

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
misconceptions about what the famas

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.940 
misconceptions about what the famas
patch<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.570> actually<00:00:09.990> doing<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> weapon<00:00:10.800> I

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
patch is actually doing to the weapon I

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
patch is actually doing to the weapon I
will<00:00:11.400> let<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.610> guys<00:00:11.730> take<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> look<00:00:12.809> at<00:00:12.929> some<00:00:13.049> of

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
will let you guys take a look at some of

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.930 
will let you guys take a look at some of
the<00:00:13.230> things<00:00:13.410> I've<00:00:13.559> noticed<00:00:13.769> as<00:00:14.190> well<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:14.730> talk

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the things I've noticed as well as talk

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.400 
the things I've noticed as well as talk
about<00:00:14.969> if<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.330> think<00:00:15.509> it's<00:00:15.599> actually<00:00:15.900> going<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
about if I think it's actually going to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.040 
about if I think it's actually going to
affect<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.970> game<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.359> any<00:00:18.480> way<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.690> right

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
affect the game in any way so right

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.599 
affect the game in any way so right
there<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.320> see<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.980> normal<00:00:20.250> red

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
there you see this is just a normal red

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.880 
there you see this is just a normal red
dot<00:00:20.789> famas<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.510> that's<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.230> me<00:00:22.350> firing<00:00:22.680> at

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
dot famas and that's just me firing at

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.320 
dot famas and that's just me firing at
normal<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.609> notice<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.150> two<00:00:24.300> are

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
normal and you notice the first two are

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.640 
normal and you notice the first two are
nice<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.840> pattern<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.320> then<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> third

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
nice and pattern but then on the third

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.140 
nice and pattern but then on the third
one<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.160> some<00:00:26.310> reason<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.640> starts<00:00:27.029> to

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
one for some reason it just starts to

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.929 
one for some reason it just starts to
climb<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.560> recoil<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.010> really<00:00:29.369> random<00:00:29.609> now

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
climb so the recoil is really random now

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.640 
climb so the recoil is really random now
the<00:00:30.599> three<00:00:30.869> things<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.170> they<00:00:31.320> ended<00:00:31.529> up

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the three things that they ended up

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.680 
the three things that they ended up
patching<00:00:32.070> were<00:00:32.250> they<00:00:32.640> added<00:00:32.910> more<00:00:33.030> recoil<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
patching were they added more recoil and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.740 
patching were they added more recoil and
they<00:00:34.350> added<00:00:34.710> less<00:00:35.130> sitter<00:00:35.760> slower<00:00:36.300> centering

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
they added less sitter slower centering

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
they added less sitter slower centering
speed<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.260> what's<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.040> means<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.520> is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
speed so what's what that means is is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.630 
speed so what's what that means is is
the<00:00:39.329> centering<00:00:40.260> speed<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.010> weapon<00:00:41.399> will

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the centering speed on the weapon will

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.520 
the centering speed on the weapon will
like<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.360> shoot<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.719> it'll<00:00:42.960> take<00:00:43.290> longer

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
like as you shoot it it'll take longer

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.010 
like as you shoot it it'll take longer
to<00:00:43.770> come<00:00:43.920> back<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.309> Center<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.570> recoil

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to come back to Center like the recoil

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.529 
to come back to Center like the recoil
will<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:46.530> come<00:00:46.770> down<00:00:46.920> slower<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> don't<00:00:48.480> make

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
will will come down slower so don't make

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.119 
will will come down slower so don't make
long-range<00:00:49.140> targets<00:00:49.530> harder<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.039> they

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
long-range targets harder and then they

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
long-range targets harder and then they
reduce<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.820> aim<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.570> made<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.719> aim

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
reduce the aim that they made the aim

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
reduce the aim that they made the aim
down<00:00:52.079> sights<00:00:52.440> lower<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:53.039> an<00:00:53.160> LMG<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.820> then

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
down sights lower like an LMG and then

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.170 
down sights lower like an LMG and then
they<00:00:54.420> made<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> hipfire<00:00:54.899> extremely<00:00:55.800> bad<00:00:56.250> they

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
they made the hipfire extremely bad they

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.610 
they made the hipfire extremely bad they
made<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.539> lmg<00:00:57.930> hipfire<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> see

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
made it like lmg hipfire so you see

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.220 
made it like lmg hipfire so you see
right<00:00:58.770> there<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.010> an<00:00:59.100> LMG<00:00:59.640> hipfire<00:01:00.539> spray<00:01:00.960> from

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
right there is an LMG hipfire spray from

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
right there is an LMG hipfire spray from
the<00:01:01.289> famas<00:01:01.710> whoa<00:01:01.890> steady<00:01:02.129> aim<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.760> going

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the famas whoa steady aim so it's going

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.820 
the famas whoa steady aim so it's going
to<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:03.989> more<00:01:04.140> difficult<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to be a little bit more difficult to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590 
to be a little bit more difficult to
just<00:01:05.010> run<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> people<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.880> spray<00:01:06.420> them

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
just run up to people and spray them

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.120 
just run up to people and spray them
down<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.080> think<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.650> we'll<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
down but I think that what we'll see is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.560 
down but I think that what we'll see is
we'll<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.729> people<00:01:08.970> using<00:01:09.270> steady

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
we'll see a lot of people using steady

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.080 
we'll see a lot of people using steady
aim<00:01:09.780> instead<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.799> slide<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> hand<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.939> see

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
aim instead of slide a hand you see

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.460 
aim instead of slide a hand you see
right<00:01:12.210> there<00:01:12.360> how<00:01:12.479> slow<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> aim<00:01:13.290> down

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
right there how slow it is the aim down

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
right there how slow it is the aim down
sights<00:01:13.770> now<00:01:13.860> granted<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.270> steady<00:01:15.540> aim

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
sights now granted this is a steady aim

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.020 
sights now granted this is a steady aim
class<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.290> sleight<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> hand<00:01:17.520> does<00:01:17.729> pose<00:01:18.000> some

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
class now sleight of hand does pose some

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.780 
class now sleight of hand does pose some
advantages<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.400> used<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
advantages now more so to that used to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.840 
advantages now more so to that used to
because<00:01:21.740> because<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.979> lower<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.670> lower

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
because because of that lower that lower

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
because because of that lower that lower
a<00:01:23.939> non-science<00:01:24.509> did<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> see<00:01:24.840> right<00:01:24.960> there

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
a non-science did you see right there

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.740 
a non-science did you see right there
that's<00:01:25.290> steady<00:01:25.590> aim<00:01:25.740> hipfire<00:01:26.479> it's<00:01:27.479> pretty

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that's steady aim hipfire it's pretty

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.300 
that's steady aim hipfire it's pretty
poor<00:01:27.990> compared<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> what<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.619> used<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.130> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
poor compared to what it used to be I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
poor compared to what it used to be I
would<00:01:30.030> still<00:01:30.240> say<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.570> pretty<00:01:30.780> beastly<00:01:31.200> just

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
would still say it's pretty beastly just

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.960 
would still say it's pretty beastly just
because<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:31.890> such<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.100> rich<00:01:32.220> such<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> high

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
because it has such a rich such a high

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.120 
because it has such a rich such a high
rate<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.180> fire<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.259> don't<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.710> know<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
rate of fire so I don't really know if

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.679 
rate of fire so I don't really know if
this<00:01:35.250> will<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.549> change<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> game<00:01:36.180> or<00:01:36.509> make

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
this will really change the game or make

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.539 
this will really change the game or make
the<00:01:36.810> famas<00:01:37.110> any<00:01:37.380> worse<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.890> mean<00:01:38.040> it'll<00:01:38.250> make<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the famas any worse I mean it'll make it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
the famas any worse I mean it'll make it
harder<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:39.000> kill<00:01:39.240> people<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.869> know<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.229> cheap

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
harder to kill people you know get cheap

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.560 
harder to kill people you know get cheap
kills<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.890> close<00:01:41.070> range<00:01:41.220> probably<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.420> for

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
kills in close range probably but for

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.819 
kills in close range probably but for
the<00:01:42.659> most<00:01:42.840> part<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.170> think<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.500> still<00:01:43.680> going

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the most part I think it's still going

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.410 
the most part I think it's still going
to<00:01:43.890> stay<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> very<00:01:44.460> competitive<00:01:44.790> weapon

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
to stay a very competitive weapon

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.300 
to stay a very competitive weapon
because<00:01:45.840> good<00:01:46.470> players<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.070> able<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
because good players will be able to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.149 
because good players will be able to
manage<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> recoil<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.450> they'll<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.689> able<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
manage the recoil and they'll be able to

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.870 
manage the recoil and they'll be able to
to<00:01:50.159> adjust<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.509> bad<00:01:52.290> hip<00:01:52.500> fire<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.759> I'll

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
to adjust for the bad hip fire so I'll

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.219 
to adjust for the bad hip fire so I'll
be<00:01:54.000> curious<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.299> see<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:54.659> weapons<00:01:55.079> they

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
be curious to see which weapons they

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.539 
be curious to see which weapons they
decide<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> use<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.040> here's<00:01:56.159> some<00:01:56.340> long-range

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
decide to use and here's some long-range

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.990 
decide to use and here's some long-range
footage<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> lot<00:01:59.520> harder<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
footage you can see is a lot harder to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.880 
footage you can see is a lot harder to
stay<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.299> target<00:02:00.509> especially<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.619> full

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
stay on target especially if you go full

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.469 
stay on target especially if you go full
auto<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.430> kind<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.670> climbs<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> then

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
auto it just kind of climbs and then

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
auto it just kind of climbs and then
that's<00:02:04.350> some<00:02:04.560> pop<00:02:04.770> shots<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.219> see<00:02:05.369> how<00:02:05.430> slow

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that's some pop shots you see how slow

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.240 
that's some pop shots you see how slow
it<00:02:05.850> takes<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.509> center<00:02:06.810> back<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.920> famas

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it takes to the center back so the famas

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.400 
it takes to the center back so the famas
has<00:02:08.429> definitely<00:02:08.819> been<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.110> crippled<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.170> little

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
has definitely been a crippled a little

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.780 
has definitely been a crippled a little
bit<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.739> still<00:02:11.009> think<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.340> probably<00:02:11.550> one

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
bit but I still think it's probably one

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.350 
bit but I still think it's probably one
of<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> best<00:02:12.209> assault<00:02:12.510> rifles<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> game

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
of the best assault rifles in the game

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.360 
of the best assault rifles in the game
I'm<00:02:14.260> assuming<00:02:14.680> we're<00:02:14.770> going<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> see<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.130> lot<00:02:15.190> of

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
I'm assuming we're going to see a lot of

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.420 
I'm assuming we're going to see a lot of
famas<00:02:15.760> still<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.690> MLG<00:02:17.230> probably<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:17.980> few

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
famas still and like MLG probably a few

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.760 
famas still and like MLG probably a few
au<00:02:18.610> jeez<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.270> don't<00:02:19.600> really<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.080> recoil

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
au jeez I don't really like the recoil

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.050 
au jeez I don't really like the recoil
in<00:02:20.830> aug<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.430> i<00:02:21.460> don't<00:02:21.640> know<00:02:21.700> if<00:02:21.760> we'll<00:02:21.910> actually

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
in aug so i don't know if we'll actually

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.090 
in aug so i don't know if we'll actually
see<00:02:22.270> anybody<00:02:22.720> using<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.470> then<00:02:23.950> we'll

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
see anybody using that and then we'll

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.940 
see anybody using that and then we'll
probably<00:02:24.280> see<00:02:24.820> some<00:02:25.030> ak-47<00:02:25.960> if<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.260> if<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.740> was<00:02:26.920> a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
probably see some ak-47 if I if I was a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.500 
probably see some ak-47 if I if I was a
betting<00:02:27.130> man<00:02:27.310> because<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:27.970> has<00:02:28.120> some<00:02:28.330> pretty

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
betting man because that has some pretty

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.810 
betting man because that has some pretty
predictable<00:02:28.900> recoil<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.040> once<00:02:30.190> again<00:02:30.280> once

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
predictable recoil so once again once

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.190 
predictable recoil so once again once
again<00:02:30.910> let's<00:02:31.180> take<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.390> look<00:02:31.540> at<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.720> hip<00:02:31.990> fire

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
again let's take a look at the hip fire

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.830 
again let's take a look at the hip fire
from<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.620> sleight<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:32.950> hand<00:02:33.300> famas<00:02:34.300> now<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.780> you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
from a sleight of hand famas now and you

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.690 
from a sleight of hand famas now and you
can<00:02:34.930> see<00:02:35.080> it's<00:02:35.230> pretty<00:02:35.560> horrible<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.550> it's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
can see it's pretty horrible so it's

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.210 
can see it's pretty horrible so it's
been<00:02:36.850> crippled
