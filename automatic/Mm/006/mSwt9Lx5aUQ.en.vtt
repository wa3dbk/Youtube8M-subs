and<00:01:25.650> i<00:01:26.310> don't<00:01:26.610> think<00:01:26.640> i<00:01:26.790> should<00:01:26.910> happen<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and i don't think i should happen I

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.670 
and i don't think i should happen I
think<00:01:27.750> that's<00:01:27.900> kind<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.470> they've

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
think that's kind of like so they've

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.100 
think that's kind of like so they've
been<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> FIFA<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.300> I<00:01:30.450> don't

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
been up on a FIFA because I don't

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.940 
been up on a FIFA because I don't
think<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:31.380> should<00:01:31.410> have<00:01:31.560> added<00:01:31.830> in

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950

but and what going to do here is

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.200 
but and what going to do here is
actually<00:03:10.800> create<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> resting<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:11.970> called<00:03:12.150> a

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
actually create a resting is called a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.360 
actually create a resting is called a
backup<00:03:12.630> squad<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.410> i<00:03:13.440> found<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:13.980> helps<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
backup squad the i found this helps a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.100 
backup squad the i found this helps a
lot<00:03:14.580> it's<00:03:15.060> kind<00:03:15.210> of<00:03:15.240> like<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.450> rotation<00:03:15.960> but

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
lot it's kind of like a rotation but

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.630 
lot it's kind of like a rotation but
I've<00:03:16.230> decided<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.740> put<00:03:16.890> all<00:03:16.980> my<00:03:17.040> main<00:03:17.310> main

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640

I've decided to put all my main main
star<00:03:17.940> team<00:03:18.180> onto<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.960> bench<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.290> means

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
star team onto the bench that means

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.740 
star team onto the bench that means
their<00:03:19.650> fitness<00:03:19.860> will<00:03:20.160> go<00:03:20.280> up<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.580> means<00:03:21.480> i<00:03:21.600> can

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
their fitness will go up and means i can

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.600 
their fitness will go up and means i can
jump<00:03:21.930> into<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.170> single<00:03:22.590> like<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:22.770> single<00:03:23.280> offline

obviously I'm at ease my starting pretty
much<00:03:31.800> as<00:03:32.250> it's<00:03:32.760> going<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.060> difficult

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
much as it's going to be difficult

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.730 
much as it's going to be difficult
anywhere<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.960> computer<00:03:34.380> really<00:03:34.530> read

anywhere that the computer really read
bad<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:36.240> haven't<00:03:36.390> got<00:03:36.540> enough<00:03:36.600> coins

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
bad and that I haven't got enough coins

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.830 
bad and that I haven't got enough coins
yet<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.590> buy<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.800> second<00:03:38.700> team<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.150> could<00:03:39.690> just

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
yet to buy a second team I could just

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.510 
yet to buy a second team I could just
when<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.380> get<00:03:40.530> enough<00:03:40.710> coins<00:03:40.920> i<00:03:41.010> build<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.490> a

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
when I get enough coins i build a a

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.520 
when I get enough coins i build a a
second<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.330> Goulding<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:42.930> red<00:03:43.140> sheep<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
second like Goulding this red sheep and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.440 
second like Goulding this red sheep and
conclude<00:03:44.520> keep<00:03:44.730> rotating<00:03:44.880> between<00:03:45.150> there<00:03:45.420> and

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
conclude keep rotating between there and

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.420 
conclude keep rotating between there and
get<00:03:45.630> myself<00:03:45.750> promoted<00:03:46.290> up<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.470> divisions<00:03:46.890> but

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
get myself promoted up the divisions but

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.760 
get myself promoted up the divisions but
we<00:03:47.610> do<00:03:48.120> list<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.510> few<00:03:48.660> least<00:03:48.840> 150<00:03:49.440> coins<00:03:49.590> again

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
we do list a few least 150 coins again

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.160 
we do list a few least 150 coins again
and<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.730> do<00:03:50.790> realize<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.480> just<00:03:51.750> need<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.930> store

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
a single player or flying game kind of

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.110 
a single player or flying game kind of

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
hopefully this will save us a little bit

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.010 
hopefully this will save us a little bit
a<00:04:02.100> few<00:04:02.310> coins<00:04:02.490> on<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.820> fitness<00:04:03.000> cards<00:04:03.420> which

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
a few coins on the fitness cards which

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.060 
a few coins on the fitness cards which
in<00:04:04.170> my<00:04:04.320> opinion<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.710> one<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.010> most

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
in my opinion is one of the most

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.620 
in my opinion is one of the most
important<00:04:05.520> things<00:04:05.700> keeping<00:04:06.060> them<00:04:06.180> coins<00:04:06.390> up

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
important things keeping them coins up

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.100 
important things keeping them coins up
and<00:04:06.810> but<00:04:07.620> we<00:04:07.710> do<00:04:07.830> head<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.720> think<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.840> might<00:04:09.930> kill

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
and but we do head I think it might kill

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.930 
and but we do head I think it might kill
each<00:04:10.170> other<00:04:10.320> these<00:04:10.650> 52<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.310> max<00:04:11.490> i<00:04:11.610> can<00:04:11.640> get

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
each other these 52 is the max i can get
