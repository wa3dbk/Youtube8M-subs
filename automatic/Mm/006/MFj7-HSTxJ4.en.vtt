00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:16.199
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.840
 the topic is more accurate today but it is mine 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.769
 ten minutes later 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 as I shot a video on the farm well and build 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.269
 already 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.370
 hybrid well let's give something like 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.870
 usually we build a bunch of that 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:48.680
 I do this not to get confused 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:48.680
 it's here tex 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:01:01.109
 from here so I like this little village 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:04.170
 chose that it is not very easy 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.159
 rebuild with this fence get confused 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:16.130
 who doesn't even always save for is 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.259
 minions balls dragons but the same pigs 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.590
 take and fly over and jump over 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:32.040
 fence for something to finish at all 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:40.970

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.970

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:50.549
 so here it is oh here the second layer is not already 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.549

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:24.840
 huok should all happen here, and here and 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:38.590
 here then we do it this way and you 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:44.430
 I was one of the fence where he was to me 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.430

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:57.660

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:29.550
