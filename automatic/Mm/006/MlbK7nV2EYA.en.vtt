 rondônia 5 west sénnia it called to me 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 attention that every time he entered the goal 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 made by carrots atacama that 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 That's it, I got the 5 that I 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.699
 I decided to run 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:33.210
 He is a type is a rpg. 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.610
 I just did not particularly enjoy it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.980
 a lot and he 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.809
 The cool thing about this game is that it 's fine. 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.879
 designed very well done the game for 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.649

 download this game here personal 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.840
 I already have a character created already 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.500
 You need to be on the internet to connect. 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.710
 on the internet to play because he 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.710
 do the little doll validations here 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.110
 I do not really like the game itself 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.470
 I spoke rpg, but I'm not much of a fan. 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.840
 I like it but given the turn of 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.140
 stay talking - from ska where you 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.260
 Talk to Jesus, but there 's action. 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.060
 mixed with the rpm here but but only r 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.060
 turkey in the house of the team and direct 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.600
 Let's go to the commands of the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.799
 regional commands to which it is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.930
 the peta 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.909
 however you talk to the person 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.439
 Do you have a map here with people? 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.530
 also have a break here and a drava I 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:16.500
 I find here are the living standards and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.120
 I think the fight of the little doll is 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 very well done the game very well 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:29.610
 designed even more for a tablet 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:31.650
 is still very good there and the history or 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.140
 Talk to what you want to buy 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.530

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.530

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.810
 This is the first is the first Dada game. 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.590
 of the series I see that I see that already 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.299
 is fifth in the fifth game 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.909
 this is kind of like that 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:02.170
 another that in the end also fantasy that is 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:05.530
 at thirteen at 15 if there in the same style and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.569
 If you want to talk, it's good until now that 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:15.099
 start talking when you 're 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:22.629
 talking to the guinea is a 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:24.609
 experience going directly because it is 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:33.730

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.969
 came in the corner here 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.180
 You have to come here and talk to 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.900
 ellen 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.329
 and then I think it's funny the sword that 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.599
 is greater than he personally is well at 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:07.629

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:10.200

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:20.500
