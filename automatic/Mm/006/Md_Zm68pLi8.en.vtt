a counter that sucks

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.830 
a counter that sucks
so<00:03:48.080> my<00:03:49.010> rash<00:03:49.400> decision<00:03:50.030> there<00:03:50.180> stops<00:03:50.540> the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
so my rash decision there stops the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.479 
so my rash decision there stops the
Quagsire<00:03:51.560> sweep<00:03:51.980> which<00:03:52.160> would<00:03:52.310> have<00:03:52.400> been

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
Quagsire sweep which would have been

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.190 
Quagsire sweep which would have been
awesome<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:53.030> sweep<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.360> team<00:03:53.540> with<00:03:53.690> Quagsire

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
awesome to sweep the team with Quagsire

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.410 
awesome to sweep the team with Quagsire
but<00:03:54.440> it's<00:03:54.830> okay<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.250> mean<00:03:55.400> this<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.880> making<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.330> a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
but it's okay I mean this is making it a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.660 
but it's okay I mean this is making it a
really<00:03:56.720> good<00:03:56.840> match<00:03:57.110> now<00:03:57.860> I'm<00:03:58.040> really<00:03:58.400> afraid

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
really good match now I'm really afraid

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.479 
really good match now I'm really afraid
of<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.209> close<00:03:59.510> score<00:03:59.810> basically<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:00.920> at<00:04:01.310> this

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
of this close score basically so at this

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.370 
of this close score basically so at this
point<00:04:01.820> I<00:04:02.030> put<00:04:02.269> up<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:02.450> sticky<00:04:02.810> web<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.110> make<00:04:03.260> the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
point I put up a sticky web to make the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.800 
point I put up a sticky web to make the
Garchomp<00:04:03.830> slower<00:04:04.160> he<00:04:04.730> just<00:04:04.940> Thunder<00:04:05.300> waves<00:04:05.510> me

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
Garchomp slower he just Thunder waves me

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.780 
Garchomp slower he just Thunder waves me
now<00:04:06.170> instead<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.860> toxic<00:04:07.400> so<00:04:07.550> I'm<00:04:07.670> like

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
now instead of the toxic so I'm like

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.030 
now instead of the toxic so I'm like
okay<00:04:08.120> cool<00:04:08.450> oh<00:04:08.660> no<00:04:09.019> might<00:04:09.350> not<00:04:09.500> even<00:04:09.590> have<00:04:09.860> it

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
okay cool oh no might not even have it

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.190 
okay cool oh no might not even have it
so<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.459> just<00:04:10.670> keeps<00:04:11.060> pouring<00:04:11.420> realizing<00:04:12.080> the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
so I just keeps pouring realizing the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.780 
so I just keeps pouring realizing the
eventually<00:04:12.739> this<00:04:12.860> toxic<00:04:13.310> damage<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.640> gonna

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
eventually this toxic damage is gonna

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.250 
eventually this toxic damage is gonna
rack<00:04:14.030> up<00:04:14.269> and<00:04:14.480> unless<00:04:14.630> he<00:04:14.780> carries<00:04:15.140> the

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
rack up and unless he carries the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.890 
rack up and unless he carries the
aromatherapy<00:04:15.880> but<00:04:16.880> at<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:17.299> point<00:04:17.600> it's

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
aromatherapy but at this point it's

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.300 
aromatherapy but at this point it's
looking<00:04:18.019> like<00:04:18.320> he<00:04:18.470> would<00:04:18.590> have<00:04:18.680> used<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.100> right

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
looking like he would have used it right

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.330 
looking like he would have used it right
about<00:04:19.580> now<00:04:19.880> so<00:04:20.180> we<00:04:20.510> saw<00:04:20.720> foils<00:04:21.109> instead<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:22.220> he

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
about now so we saw foils instead so he

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.890 
about now so we saw foils instead so he
can't<00:04:22.550> really<00:04:22.760> have<00:04:22.940> it<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.270> I'm<00:04:23.510> just<00:04:23.810> gonna

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
can't really have it so I'm just gonna

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.170 
can't really have it so I'm just gonna
keeps<00:04:24.229> pouring<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:25.400> would<00:04:25.550> be<00:04:25.669> great<00:04:26.000> if<00:04:26.150> he

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
keeps pouring it would be great if he

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.460 
keeps pouring it would be great if he
brought<00:04:26.450> this<00:04:26.780> quarter<00:04:27.200> and

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
brought this quarter and

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.660 
brought this quarter and
get<00:04:27.650> put<00:04:27.830> asleep<00:04:28.100> because<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.430> don't<00:04:28.580> really

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
get put asleep because I don't really

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.370 
get put asleep because I don't really
have<00:04:28.790> much<00:04:29.210> for<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:29.540> coolest<00:04:29.780> score<00:04:30.050> so

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
have much for the coolest score so

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.320 
have much for the coolest score so
that's<00:04:31.010> what<00:04:31.280> ends<00:04:31.490> up<00:04:31.580> happening<00:04:31.640> this<00:04:32.150> is

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
that's what ends up happening this is

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.450 
that's what ends up happening this is
just<00:04:32.510> absolutely<00:04:33.110> perfect<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:33.860> his<00:04:34.010> gliscor

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
just absolutely perfect so his gliscor

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.940 
just absolutely perfect so his gliscor
goes<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:34.790> sleep<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.470> I'm<00:04:36.470> just<00:04:36.620> gonna<00:04:36.740> switch

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
goes to sleep and I'm just gonna switch

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.320 
goes to sleep and I'm just gonna switch
the<00:04:37.040> hell<00:04:37.190> out<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.370> there<00:04:37.580> now<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.820> my<00:04:38.090> rosary

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
the hell out of there now to my rosary

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.930 
the hell out of there now to my rosary
because<00:04:38.870> Rosa<00:04:39.140> rate<00:04:39.350> is<00:04:39.550> legitimately<00:04:40.550> the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
because Rosa rate is legitimately the

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.790 
because Rosa rate is legitimately the
only<00:04:41.180> thing<00:04:41.360> they<00:04:41.480> could<00:04:41.630> take<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:41.930> on<00:04:42.170> and<00:04:42.470> I

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
only thing they could take this on and I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.470 
only thing they could take this on and I
