00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.189 
this is just a gray hoodie it's like a
cropped<00:04:07.259> one<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.159> quite<00:04:08.969> like<00:04:09.479> it<00:04:09.719> and<00:04:09.750> I'll

actually wear it with high-waisted jeans

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.640 
actually wear it with high-waisted jeans
it's<00:04:11.759> not<00:04:11.879> much<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.180> say<00:04:12.359> about<00:04:12.479> this<00:04:12.719> but<00:04:13.500> it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
it's not much to say about this but it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.949 
it's not much to say about this but it
is<00:04:13.769> extremely<00:04:14.189> like<00:04:14.759> warm<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.209> think<00:04:15.449> because

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
is extremely like warm I think because

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.170 
is extremely like warm I think because
the<00:04:16.079> arms<00:04:16.380> are<00:04:16.590> not<00:04:16.769> like<00:04:17.039> as<00:04:17.190> big<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:17.759> me<00:04:17.969> but

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
the arms are not like as big on me but

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.089 
the arms are not like as big on me but
they're<00:04:18.780> like<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> group<00:04:19.409> to<00:04:19.560> me<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.829> give<00:04:19.919> me<00:04:20.070> a

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
they're like a group to me and give me a

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.959 
they're like a group to me and give me a
lot<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.400> watts

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:20.969 
lot of watts

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.150 
lot of watts
so<00:04:21.120> this<00:04:21.389> is<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.570> size<00:04:22.400> small

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
so this is a size small

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.430 
so this is a size small
it<00:04:24.340> is<00:04:24.430> also<00:04:24.610> made<00:04:24.850> by<00:04:24.910> boo-hoo<00:04:25.450> themselves

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
it is also made by boo-hoo themselves

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.370 
it is also made by boo-hoo themselves
