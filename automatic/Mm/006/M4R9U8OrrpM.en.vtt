00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 in the water park of qingdao in 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:10.410
 china a dolphin named xiao qiang is 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.019
 able to paint I say dolphin but many 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.599
 after seeing these photos I will consider 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.330
 jce this like a beluga whale in the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.850
 background is the nickname that is put to this 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.340
 dolphin type in fact you do not have 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.119
 very clear that if it is a dolphin 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.340
 or a hybrid between whale and dolphin 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.590
 let's say that they do not agree 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.770
 biologists I'll call it dolphin 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.420
 because I find it more familiar and I do not 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.540
 you think I'm wrong because 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.850
 This was already investigated and no say 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.340
 that there are different ways of calling it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.649
 you can call it a beluga whale that is its 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.649
 nickname or you can call it as like 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 dolphin there is no problem good 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.719
 I wanted to make an appraisal of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.270
 the intelligence of these living beings in 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.730
 other videos I commented that it is possible that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.309
 the dolphin is even smarter 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.470
 that the human being actually bends us in 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.060
 how many neurons and the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.280
 proportion between 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.800
 and his body is much larger than in the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.320
 human being has a huge brain 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.420
 that are limited because they can not 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.970
 use your hands and be in the middle 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.000
 terrestrial does not mean that they are not 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.710
 smart and here we have a real case 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.460
 of a dolphin or beluga whale like 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.910
 you want to call him what he paints is capable of 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.940
 paint and you can see a picture of this 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.070
 Dolphin 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.620
 a picture that I do not know what he has intended 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.990
 represent but of course not 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.780
 it looks like it's painted randomly it seems 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.170
 that is shaping something that has 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.350
 seen inside the water not sincerely 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.900
 impressive that these living beings are 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.240
 able to paint complex shapes with 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.140
 the mouth you imagine if they could do it 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.970
 appropriately and have a hand 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.690
 they would be able to paint at the same level 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.420
 that the human being I think that if his 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.970
 intelligence would allow them to do this 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.960
 kind of things and others much more 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.090
 complex 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.880
 if they had hands like us 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.570
 they would really show the smart 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.570
 What are they
