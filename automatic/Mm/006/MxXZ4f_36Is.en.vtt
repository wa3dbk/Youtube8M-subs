 cnb I'm 21 years old and I'm here 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 menik nor another game I played 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.330
 gold was a great school craft that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.640
 called the morning the child is a dementia 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.130
 when you have a lot of creativity and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.809
 Maschio munich will fall over time 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:46.950
 The child stayed behind with his mana is in the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:50.550
 early morning xd later malÃ³ between the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:59.870
 favorites are sure to be zed the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.870
 I did not cut the cut to keita in a tail 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:12.920
 It's just the boy I have I do not like 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.810
 to play against areas is Aryan denies funk 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.260
 boring I think if I could walk away 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:26.540
 on the butt in the sand area 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:29.540
 I do not like it when someone is insulting. 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.810
 cursing the shows is in the promotion of 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.780
 Ok, and I do not go back to him, face to face. 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.880
 I try to be sarcastic or give an indirect 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.050
 that people usually touch and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.050
 they try to be funny 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.289
 usually it 's just dumb 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.119
 I think I'm good because I can 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.670
 see what I have to do in each 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.460
 game I know if I have to play more 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.180
 aggressive in the most defensive game and play 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.549
 more 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:11.220
 the team or if a little more selfish 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:11.220
 in- question farm-in site sells except 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.150
 ned school I think sport does not 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.730
 nothing slims think I went to win 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.550
 I think in five pounds but it's okay 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.250
 you have to police yourself, you have to 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.110
 have your time on the computer and the time 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.020
 sometimes the activity was nobody but 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.860
 That eating foolery I did not think in faith 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.860
 So I lost weight. It was not even me. 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.810
 sure we had a motivation 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.510
 that's how it is when I started doing 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.540
 stream was calling me chubby 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.450
 That's the end of faith, it's not just from Miami anymore. 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:57.320
 that no one spoke mother was this was where 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.320
 I started running on the street and lost weight 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.300
 She was good because I also tattooed the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.470
 Her name is from here she does not stay with 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.590
 jealous 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.310
 but my mother always supported me a lot 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.730
 that I do then I find that boring is 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.730
 up close 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.830
 also in the beginning when I started 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.850
 when he left the first ramps in Switzerland 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.740
 1 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.950
 I think I stayed about 20 hours 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.960
 followed playing to her dick but already 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.470
 has a lot of time but I think with 20 more 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.470
 hours 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.120
 I think this is the first step is if 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.920
 Do you want to be the best? What do you have to do? 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.470
 consider it better because if not you do not 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.840
 Will you be able to get there ? 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.090
 yes it is obvious but adapted to each shot and 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.739
 has its specific qualities that 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.530
 fits better for your teams 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.209
 but the first step if you 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.799
 wants to be a champion if you want to be the 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:08.849
 better you consider the best in 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:10.349
 My opinion, the memory is so 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.629
 competitive to win the championship 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:17.970
 brazil game show international 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.919
 I was happier there than when 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.699
 I was Brazilian champion in 2002 because 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.190
 scenario was further developed 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.949
 we really had trained a lot 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.870
 for that if prepared very and 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.800
 I managed to finish that championship in 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.919
 first was happiness and can not 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.900
 Do not even remember the real ones. 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.900
 Then she told me about the experience I've had
