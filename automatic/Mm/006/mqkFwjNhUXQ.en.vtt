00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
actually allows us to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.320 
actually allows us to
save<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:28.350> game<00:04:28.800> as<00:04:29.040> an<00:04:29.250> appointment<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.030> we

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
save the game as an appointment so we

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.780 
save the game as an appointment so we
can<00:04:30.480> stay<00:04:30.720> up<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.990> date<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.610> remind<00:04:32.610> ourselves

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
then we have an injury report so that's

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.740 
then we have an injury report so that's
nice<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:37.470> have<00:04:37.850> let's<00:04:38.850> actually<00:04:39.090> go<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.510> a

I<00:05:46.230> haven't<00:05:46.620> found<00:05:46.920> a<00:05:47.130> way<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:47.900> save<00:05:48.900> a<00:05:49.350> team's

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
I haven't found a way to save a team's

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.960 
I haven't found a way to save a team's
games<00:05:51.240> all<00:05:51.570> at<00:05:51.750> once<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.260> I<00:05:52.470> would<00:05:53.190> love<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.760> see

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
games all at once so I would love to see

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.790 
games all at once so I would love to see
it<00:05:54.090> where<00:05:54.360> you<00:05:54.480> can<00:05:54.510> add<00:05:55.020> maybe<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.560> whole

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
it where you can add maybe the whole

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.920 
it where you can add maybe the whole
seasons<00:05:56.370> games<00:05:56.670> but<00:05:57.300> it<00:05:57.420> seems<00:05:57.570> like<00:05:57.720> you<00:05:57.840> have

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
seasons games but it seems like you have

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.750 
seasons games but it seems like you have
to<00:05:58.020> do<00:05:58.140> one<00:05:58.380> by<00:05:58.560> one<00:05:58.830> unless<00:05:59.220> there's<00:05:59.460> a<00:05:59.580> way

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
to do one by one unless there's a way

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.150 
to do one by one unless there's a way
that<00:06:00.030> I<00:06:00.060> haven't<00:06:00.300> discovered<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:01.130> so<00:06:02.130> just

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
that I haven't discovered it so just

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.940 
that I haven't discovered it so just
like<00:06:02.520> college<00:06:02.940> football<00:06:03.300> we<00:06:03.480> can<00:06:03.770> check<00:06:04.770> out

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
like college football we can check out

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.850 
like college football we can check out
injuries<00:06:05.340> and<00:06:05.580> save<00:06:06.330> to<00:06:06.480> calendar<00:06:06.630> and<00:06:07.110> there

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
injuries and save to calendar and there

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.040 
injuries and save to calendar and there
will<00:06:07.950> probably<00:06:08.130> be<00:06:08.310> a<00:06:08.400> preview<00:06:09.050> eventually

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
will probably be a preview eventually

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.930 
will probably be a preview eventually
and<00:06:10.230> before<00:06:10.590> I<00:06:10.620> forget<00:06:10.680> let's<00:06:11.190> actually<00:06:11.430> press

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
and before I forget let's actually press

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.510 
and before I forget let's actually press
menu<00:06:12.510> so<00:06:12.780> depending<00:06:13.560> on<00:06:13.650> which<00:06:13.830> sport<00:06:14.310> you're

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
menu so depending on which sport you're

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.040 
menu so depending on which sport you're
in<00:06:14.670> it'll<00:06:14.880> actually<00:06:15.090> cater<00:06:15.540> to<00:06:16.350> that<00:06:16.850> content
