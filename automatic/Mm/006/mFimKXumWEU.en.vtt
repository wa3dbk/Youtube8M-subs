00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.150
 tomato and I already said some recipe that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.710
 I do not really like tomato sauce. 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 industrialized is not what I do not like is 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.480
 A delight but will have to do 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.480

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.390
 day and day and that it was delicious people go 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.489
