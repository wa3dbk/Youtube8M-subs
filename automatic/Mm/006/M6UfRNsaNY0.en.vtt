00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.389
 hey people this time so no now 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.820
 minecraft finally just his times something 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.690
 very special 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.259
 and I have decided mine 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.250
 own another hangar game your own 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:24.279
 create hangar game 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:28.570
 it should go at 2 o'clock fields 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.570
 I find the 79th 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.670
 so so I think these horny new 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.989
 commands so cool 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.430
 which is now synonymous in singleplayer there 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.050
 yes in any case it should be at 2 o'clock 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.500
 peoples against whom have lived here 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.809
 and one very very very rich was one 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.399
 It was free and it works 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.969
 first of all a success therefore on the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.309
 lived in the ground and in huts and stone 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.250
 castles and anything else and has 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.269
 there is such a holy kind here as well 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.820
 always built very cool thus special 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.900
 I'll say effects when you look at it 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.630
 which levers and switches come 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.659
 then be pressed 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.729
 it's pretty high 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.890
 win then you get to schwertern 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.280
 and armor and diamonds and none 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.590
 I have a clue yes, I always do that shortly 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.000
 to freestyle and should now be very short 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.100
 announcement video is what I do 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.869
 the mix is definitely more I have 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.420
 first only this one full clock 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.860
 made and now a tower of that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.079
 success does not know I circuit 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.460
 I'm there I'll do it in the end 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.549
 a bit jagged up is a tour 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.630
 with all sorts of things in it and so on 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:46.539
 Of course, it also needs to hollow out like that 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.209
 lined with stones 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:54.759
 so that you know that the cave is planned 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:57.049
 was and that there are boxes inside yes 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.939
 I just did not think so much 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.500
 The result is wilderness 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.479
 a little bit shit a story 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.250
 For example, it depends that the 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.979
 fought against each other 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.840
 and at the end both were eradicated by 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.880
 Something in any case , they are gone 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.440
 face at the end are only theirs 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.810
 own then fallen buildings left over 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.370
 So I have one more 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.230
 I've been given a lot of trouble with that 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:24.049
 warehouse with a fireplace with 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.859
 a stollen of everywhere leads them 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.859
 in the mountain is a kind of sacred 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.030
 always as broken son I have broken 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.850
 I'm thinking of something like that here 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.139
 this knife i will put the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.850
 texte change a little bit own 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:41.150
 station becker throw design and so on 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.389
 further and yes you can see that's all 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.620
 for centuries already stands empty and in 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.230
 you do not want any of these hunger games 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.850
 blocks but only items 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.680
 can record and each other 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.600
 can knock yes and as a second success 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.970
 Did I think so ? 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.470
 if you do not want the bonner in the 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.700
 side still with pure squeezing but 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.769
 on the side back rather such a success 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.510
 what has lived on trees will also 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.480
 pretty funny with offered and otherwise 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.400
 What 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.690
 yes, I do not want to store for a long time now 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.890
 So if you have any ideas 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.440
 then write in the comments 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.840
 if not then I 'll stop soon 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.190
 new video and then I will too 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.040
 even that he attacked 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.810
 and me my plans for the empty ones 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.629
 still communicate areas here 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.160
 also more details in the tower 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.450
 go in or something or in the 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.459
 go in tunnels so be curious 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.459
 every case until the next video and
