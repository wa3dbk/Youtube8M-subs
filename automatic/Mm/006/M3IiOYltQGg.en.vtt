the<00:02:48.110> kids<00:02:48.470> have<00:02:48.739> been<00:02:48.860> cooking<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.489> really

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
the kids have been cooking and really

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.460 
the kids have been cooking and really
soft<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:50.660> we're<00:02:50.810> going<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.989> puree<00:02:51.260> it

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
soft and then we're going to puree it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.240 
soft and then we're going to puree it
and<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.430> potatoes<00:02:53.000> were<00:02:53.030> back<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.900> real<00:02:54.800> creamy

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
and the potatoes were back a real creamy

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.730 
and the potatoes were back a real creamy
texture<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.510> soup

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
texture to the soup

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.530 
texture to the soup
but<00:02:57.890> we'll<00:02:58.040> stay<00:02:58.280> yellow<00:02:58.640> fat<00:02:59.090> because<00:02:59.420> we

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
but we'll stay yellow fat because we

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.930 
but we'll stay yellow fat because we
don't<00:02:59.720> have<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.020> add<00:03:00.170> any<00:03:00.440> cream<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:01.550> I'll<00:03:01.760> be

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
don't have to add any cream and I'll be

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.750 
don't have to add any cream and I'll be
back<00:03:02.120> when<00:03:02.360> I'm<00:03:02.480> ready<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.930> do<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.200> next<00:03:03.230> step

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.670 

so<00:03:07.760> like<00:03:07.940> soup<00:03:08.210> has<00:03:08.420> been<00:03:08.450> cooking<00:03:09.080> after<00:03:09.350> it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
so like soup has been cooking after it

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.410 
so like soup has been cooking after it
came<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.160> boil<00:03:10.460> for<00:03:10.790> about<00:03:10.910> thirty<00:03:11.300> minutes

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
came to a boil for about thirty minutes

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.540 
came to a boil for about thirty minutes
and<00:03:11.930> now<00:03:12.080> what<00:03:12.260> I'm<00:03:12.380> going<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.740> do<00:03:13.070> is<00:03:13.340> to

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
and now what I'm going to do is to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.790 
and now what I'm going to do is to
strain<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.180> solvent<00:03:14.660> out<00:03:14.960> of<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.380> soup<00:03:15.650> an

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
strain the solvent out of the soup an

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.120 
strain the solvent out of the soup an
inch<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.980> we're<00:03:19.130> just<00:03:19.160> going<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:20.860> pour<00:03:21.860> the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
inch so we're just going to pour the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.290 
inch so we're just going to pour the
soup<00:03:22.400> into<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:23.510> strainer<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.760> I'm<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.210> to

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
soup into a strainer and I'm going to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.790 
soup into a strainer and I'm going to
get<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.630> solid<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:29.000> then<00:03:29.300> I'm<00:03:30.080> going<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.530> take

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
get the solid and then I'm going to take

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.720 
get the solid and then I'm going to take
the<00:03:31.040> hot<00:03:31.250> pot<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:32.150> put<00:03:32.780> them<00:03:32.960> into<00:03:33.730> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
the hot pot and put them into the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.020 
the hot pot and put them into the
container<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:36.050> my<00:03:36.230> blender<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:37.670> want<00:03:37.850> to<00:03:37.940> do

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
container of my blender you want to do

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.000 
container of my blender you want to do
this<00:03:38.150> carefully<00:03:38.420> because<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.290> liquid<00:03:39.620> the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
this carefully because the liquid the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.820 
this carefully because the liquid the
soup<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.400> hot<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.090> when<00:03:41.720> you're<00:03:41.870> sure<00:03:42.080> a<00:03:42.320> hot

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
soup is hot so when you're sure a hot

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:53.050 
soup is hot so when you're sure a hot
liquid<00:03:43.510> careful<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:51.010> just<00:03:52.010> keep<00:03:52.310> draining

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.440 

and<00:03:59.739> then<00:04:00.400> we're<00:04:00.549> going<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.730> puree<00:04:01.180> the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
and then we're going to puree the

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.490 
and then we're going to puree the
vegetables<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.650> return<00:04:03.549> them<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.150> pot

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
vegetables and return them to the pot

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.300 
vegetables and return them to the pot
adding<00:04:05.500> liquid<00:04:06.489> as<00:04:07.329> needed<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.650> know<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:08.860> soup

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
adding liquid as needed to know the soup

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.770 
adding liquid as needed to know the soup
of<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.730> consistency<00:04:10.540> we<00:04:10.780> decide<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:13.390> let<00:04:13.689> me

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
of the consistency we decide so let me

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.580 
of the consistency we decide so let me
just<00:04:13.989> finish<00:04:14.340> straining<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.489> suit<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.840> then

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
just finish straining the suit and then

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.890 
just finish straining the suit and then
offshore<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:25.240> don't<00:04:25.300> want<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.539> put<00:04:25.690> too

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
offshore a you don't want to put too
