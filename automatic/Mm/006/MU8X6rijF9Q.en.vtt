 2 green tomatoes 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.995
 1 strand turnip 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.580
 1 pack of parsley green 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.970
 1 paprika, 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 1 teaspoon whole pepper, 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.851
 1 coffee spoon of whole caraway seeds 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 1 tablespoon of salt. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 Homemade grated sugar soup. 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 Preparation: 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.100
 Let's cook in cold water, 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.220
 the washed meat. 

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:06.686
 Except the liver. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 Meanwhile, we peel the vegetables. 

00:02:53.534 --> 00:02:55.534
 When the soup is boiled, let us pour out his foam. 

00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:41.092
 We put the vegetables in. 

00:04:16.376 --> 00:04:18.376
 Add the spices. 

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:28.329
 When the soup is almost ready, we put the chicken breast into it. 

00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:38.272
 Boil your homemade tarragon in plenty of salt water. 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.540
 We remove the soup from the cooked vegetables. 

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.396
 Then the meat. 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.280
 Finally, we filter the soup to avoid being confused. 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.760
 When our soup is cooked 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.800
 filtered, rinsed with cold water, 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.300
 then mix with a tiny cooking oil. 

00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:56.052
 Or put it on the soup fat. 

00:06:58.278 --> 00:07:00.278
 Mix it and it won't stick together. 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.760
 We are located. 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.220
