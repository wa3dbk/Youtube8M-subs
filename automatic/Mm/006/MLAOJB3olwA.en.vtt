00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
completely sometimes depending on the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.610 
completely sometimes depending on the
foundation<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.060> use<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.660> can<00:02:54.019> still<00:02:54.260> see<00:02:54.440> my

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
foundation I use I can still see my

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.350 
foundation I use I can still see my
pores<00:02:54.920> up<00:02:55.130> close<00:02:55.489> but<00:02:55.760> obviously<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.239> don't

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
pores up close but obviously I don't

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.569 
pores up close but obviously I don't
really<00:02:56.690> but<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.230> don't<00:02:57.470> really<00:02:57.739> have<00:02:57.980> big<00:02:58.280> pores

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
really but I don't really have big pores

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.400 
really but I don't really have big pores
so<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:58.940> don't<00:02:59.180> really<00:02:59.299> have<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.780> problem<00:02:59.989> from

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
so I don't really have that problem from

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.380 
so I don't really have that problem from
a<00:03:00.470> file<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.799> can<00:03:00.890> see<00:03:01.040> my<00:03:01.190> pores<00:03:01.519> but<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.269> know

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
a file you can see my pores but you know

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.640 
a file you can see my pores but you know
I<00:03:02.510> thought<00:03:02.870> I'd<00:03:03.049> let<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.290> guys<00:03:03.440> know<00:03:03.620> about

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
I thought I'd let you guys know about

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.069 
I thought I'd let you guys know about
that<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.060> only<00:03:05.239> negative<00:03:05.690> thing<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.959> have

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
that so the only negative thing I have

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.710 
that so the only negative thing I have
to<00:03:06.200> say<00:03:06.230> about<00:03:06.440> this<00:03:06.680> primer<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.720> it's

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
to say about this primer is that it's

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.630 
to say about this primer is that it's
quite<00:03:09.140> expensive<00:03:09.530> here<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:09.920> Australia<00:03:10.400> it's

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
quite expensive here in Australia it's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.699 
quite expensive here in Australia it's
roughly<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.090> same<00:03:11.239> price<00:03:11.510> as<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.840> foundation

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
roughly the same price as a foundation

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.979 
roughly the same price as a foundation
so<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.950> next<00:03:13.130> time<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.370> big<00:03:13.970> w<00:03:14.390> price<00:03:14.690> line

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
so the next time that big w price line

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.750 
so the next time that big w price line
