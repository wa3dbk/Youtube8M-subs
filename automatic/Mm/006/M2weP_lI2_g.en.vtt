these<00:05:00.650> right<00:05:00.919> now<00:05:01.069> than<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.370> was<00:05:01.400> in<00:05:01.699> my<00:05:01.819> review

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
these right now than I was in my review

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.080 
these right now than I was in my review
how<00:05:03.650> do<00:05:03.710> they<00:05:03.830> feel<00:05:04.039> comfortable<00:05:04.430> they're

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
how do they feel comfortable they're

how do they feel comfortable they're
very<00:05:05.330> comfortable<00:05:05.569> okay<00:05:06.259> we<00:05:06.560> showed<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:07.310> lot<00:05:07.580> of

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
very comfortable okay we showed a lot of

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.019 
very comfortable okay we showed a lot of
ambient<00:05:07.909> noise<00:05:08.770> my<00:05:09.770> bet<00:05:10.099> is<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.370> these<00:05:10.789> are

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:11.029 
ambient noise my bet is that these are

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:16.779 
ambient noise my bet is that these are
the<00:05:11.150> non<00:05:12.819> wireless<00:05:13.819> version<00:05:15.430> but<00:05:16.430> they're

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
the non wireless version but they're

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.820 
the non wireless version but they're
really<00:05:17.240> similar<00:05:17.750> it's<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:20.319> 1056<00:05:21.319> versus

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
really similar it's the the 1056 versus

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.439 
really similar it's the the 1056 versus
the<00:05:21.949> 10<00:05:22.159> 60s<00:05:22.729> i<00:05:22.849> think<00:05:23.090> if<00:05:23.180> i<00:05:23.270> remember

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
the 10 60s i think if i remember

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.390 
the 10 60s i think if i remember
correctly<00:05:23.840> okay<00:05:24.740> i<00:05:24.770> want<00:05:24.889> you<00:05:25.039> to<00:05:25.129> look<00:05:25.250> at

correctly okay i want you to look at

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.029 
correctly okay i want you to look at
them<00:05:25.550> and<00:05:26.000> tell<00:05:26.270> me<00:05:26.419> which<00:05:26.509> pair<00:05:26.779> they<00:05:26.900> are

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
them and tell me which pair they are

so my favorite I think are the Harman
Kardon<00:05:33.319> nc's<00:05:34.039> with<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:35.000> noise<00:05:35.180> cancellation

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 
Kardon nc's with the noise cancellation

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.010
