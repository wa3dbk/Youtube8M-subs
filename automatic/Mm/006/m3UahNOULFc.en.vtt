 to do this kind of thing at home 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.150
 past the time that already covers the 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.130
 washings that we offer and the 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.900
 person arises if he prefers to be 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.910
 let's teach how to do this washing and 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.380
 maintenance at home or follow

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.310
 our technical service we follow the 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.170
 bandit giving that wig every time

 Our clients bring it 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.470
 what we do is check that the 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.200
 quality of education in conditions 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.450
 return it to combing clean tip if it is 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.030
 necessary to carve the wig if it were 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.460
 necessary or repair some seam that 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.280
 it was necessary to sew again 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.800
 It is extremely complicated to place a 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.290
 wig in a skull and that you notice already of 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.270
 first that is seated to the form 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.460
 of the skull because nobody has a skull 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.420
 totally asymmetric then there's 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.160
 skulls that be 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.170
 so better because it has an oval shape 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.510
 a more perfect shape and there are skulls that 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.650
 for having a small 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.810
 asymmetry in the neck or a small 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.760
 symmetry at the temples do not adapt 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.400
 well then that's where the work of

 sewing workshop adapted in 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.010
