problem<00:00:13.679> here<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.250> battery<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.379> then<00:00:17.330> what

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
problem here is a battery and then what

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.590 
problem here is a battery and then what
happens<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.199> battery<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:20.600> stops

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
happens is the battery just stops

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.310 
happens is the battery just stops
charging<00:00:21.980> and<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.910> might<00:00:24.289> initially<00:00:25.289> think

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
charging and you might initially think

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.390 
charging and you might initially think
that<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:27.109> motherboard<00:00:28.109> or<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
that it's the motherboard or on the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.229 
that it's the motherboard or on the
battery's<00:00:29.880> data<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.630> thought<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
battery's data like I thought and

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
battery's data like I thought and
mybinding<00:00:33.239> battery<00:00:33.660> might<00:00:33.989> even<00:00:34.170> go<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.680> far

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
mybinding battery might even go as far

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.220 
mybinding battery might even go as far
as<00:00:35.010> buying<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.430> new<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:36.079> motherboard<00:00:37.079> or

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
as buying a new one motherboard or

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.299 
as buying a new one motherboard or
something<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
something like that or get the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.240 
something like that or get the
motherboard<00:00:38.790> place<00:00:39.559> but<00:00:40.559> after<00:00:40.829> doing<00:00:40.980> some

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
motherboard place but after doing some

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.900 
motherboard place but after doing some
research<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:44.570> found<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.700> actually

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
research I found out that it's actually

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.410 
research I found out that it's actually
a<00:00:48.750> power<00:00:49.289> Cordish<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.430> Bill<00:00:53.699> updated<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
a power Cordish so and Bill updated the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.510 
a power Cordish so and Bill updated the
BIOS<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.110> stuff<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.920> didn't

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
BIOS and stuff like that but that didn't

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
BIOS and stuff like that but that didn't
that<00:00:56.940> didn't<00:00:57.270> fix<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.570> problem<00:00:57.780> here

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that didn't fix a problem here

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.970 
that didn't fix a problem here
even<00:00:58.829> give<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.160> better<00:00:59.870> view<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.770> see

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
even give it a better view here you see

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.490 
even give it a better view here you see
I<00:01:02.010> finally<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.730> charging<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.899> went

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
I finally got it charging of it I went

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
I finally got it charging of it I went
the<00:01:04.650> route<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.040> um<00:01:05.250> actually<00:01:05.970> buying<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the route of um actually buying the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
the route of um actually buying the
battery<00:01:07.110> also<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.860> don't<00:01:08.040> feel<00:01:08.220> bad<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.430> you

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
battery also so don't feel bad if you

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.649 
battery also so don't feel bad if you
already<00:01:09.350> been<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.560> route<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.659> you

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
already been that route like I have you

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.929 
already been that route like I have you
know<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.990> now<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:13.439> two<00:01:13.830> batteries<00:01:14.280> which

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
know so now I got two batteries which

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.460 
know so now I got two batteries which
doesn't<00:01:15.600> let<00:01:15.659> me<00:01:15.780> run<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.200> first

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
doesn't let me run with the first

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.850 
doesn't let me run with the first
battery<00:01:17.750> let's<00:01:18.750> sit<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> focus<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.799> little

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
battery let's sit for the focus a little

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.850 
battery let's sit for the focus a little
better

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.900 

so<00:01:26.550> on<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:28.320> solution<00:01:28.800> for<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.370> I<00:01:29.400> said<00:01:29.550> is<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
so on the solution for like I said is a

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.530 
so on the solution for like I said is a
power<00:01:30.660> adapter<00:01:31.260> better<00:01:31.590> power<00:01:31.830> of<00:01:32.010> that<00:01:32.190> but

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
power adapter better power of that but

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.520 
power adapter better power of that but
what<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> had<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.910> had<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.530> replacement

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
what I had was I had the replacement

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.490 
what I had was I had the replacement
adapter<00:01:37.980> which<00:01:38.220> didn't<00:01:38.850> work<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.230> that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
adapter which didn't work you know that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.680 
adapter which didn't work you know that
these<00:01:40.830> non-standard<00:01:41.430> replacement<00:01:42.180> adapters

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
these non-standard replacement adapters

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.680 
these non-standard replacement adapters
that<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.900> get<00:01:43.320> online<00:01:44.190> on<00:01:44.430> eBay<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:45.270> they

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
that you get online on eBay they they

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.780 
that you get online on eBay they they
don't<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.620> the<00:01:46.740> trick<00:01:47.010> on<00:01:47.580> them

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
don't they don't do the trick on them

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.260 
don't they don't do the trick on them
they<00:01:47.940> just<00:01:48.710> they<00:01:49.710> don't<00:01:49.740> work<00:01:50.160> on<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.940> BIOS

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
they just they don't work on the BIOS

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.830 
they just they don't work on the BIOS
just<00:01:51.570> stopped<00:01:51.840> recognizing<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.390> at

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
just stopped recognizing you know at

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.350 
just stopped recognizing you know at
least<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.350> day<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> lot<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> 2d<00:01:56.430> 20<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.180> is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the BIOS just stopped recognizable so um

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.300 
the BIOS just stopped recognizable so um
what<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> end<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.220> doing<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.000> end<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.390> buying
