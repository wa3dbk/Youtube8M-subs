00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
of an entry hole for this so that way

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.600 
of an entry hole for this so that way
now<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.140> can<00:02:08.500> drill<00:02:08.709> this

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610

and not worry about whether I'm going to

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.980 
and not worry about whether I'm going to
crack<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.910> or<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.180> now<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.480> other<00:02:15.720> thing

in and out just the way I am get rid of
the<00:02:24.830> deceases<00:02:25.830> coming<00:02:26.520> out<00:02:28.790> there<00:02:29.820> I'm

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
the deceases coming out there I'm

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.890 
the deceases coming out there I'm
through<00:02:30.800> okay<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:33.240> now<00:02:33.480> I'll<00:02:34.470> lower<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:34.920> down

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
through okay so now I'll lower this down

loosen this and you can see from one end
to<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.130> other<00:02:41.250> I'm<00:02:42.240> perfectly<00:02:43.110> perpendicular

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
to the other I'm perfectly perpendicular

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.520 
to the other I'm perfectly perpendicular

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
over here I've got a little piece of wax

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.500 
over here I've got a little piece of wax
paper<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:50.340> I'm<00:02:50.700> going<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.970> place<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
paper here so I'm going to place the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.130 
paper here so I'm going to place the
glue<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.740> is<00:02:53.000> pen<00:02:54.000> makers<00:02:54.390> CA<00:02:54.900> glue

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
glue and this is pen makers CA glue

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.660 
glue and this is pen makers CA glue
alright<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:56.010> has<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.550> bit<00:02:56.610> of

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
alright it has a little bit of

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.250 
alright it has a little bit of
elasticity<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.630> which<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.780> kind<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.080> nice

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
elasticity to it which is kind of nice

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.650 
elasticity to it which is kind of nice
so<00:02:58.950> it'll<00:02:59.730> give<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.850> little<00:02:59.970> bit<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.210> flex<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.630> it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
so it'll give a little bit of flex to it

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.980 
so it'll give a little bit of flex to it
I'm<00:03:01.230> going<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> put<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.650> few<00:03:01.860> drops<00:03:02.300> on<00:03:03.300> here<00:03:03.840> and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
I'm going to put a few drops on here and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.380 
I'm going to put a few drops on here and
this<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.260> also<00:03:04.530> thicker

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
this is also thicker

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.580 
this is also thicker
we've<00:03:06.390> already<00:03:06.630> roughed<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.200> tube<00:03:07.410> up

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
we've already roughed the tube up

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.920 
we've already roughed the tube up

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
this set a second and now if you if you

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.180 
this set a second and now if you if you
have<00:03:39.510> accelerator<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.290> can<00:03:40.440> use<00:03:40.560> accelerator

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
have accelerator you can use accelerator

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.910 
have accelerator you can use accelerator
to<00:03:41.760> make<00:03:42.300> this<00:03:42.450> dry<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.750> little<00:03:42.900> faster<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.590> like

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
to make this dry a little faster I like

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.850 
to make this dry a little faster I like
to<00:03:44.280> use<00:03:44.459> CA<00:03:44.730> glue<00:03:45.030> like<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:45.720> because<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.500> can

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
to use CA glue like this because I can

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.170 
to use CA glue like this because I can
now<00:03:47.100> turn<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:48.030> less<00:03:48.330> than<00:03:48.450> five<00:03:48.690> minutes

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
now turn this in less than five minutes

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.120 
now turn this in less than five minutes
the<00:03:51.180> next<00:03:51.450> step<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:52.380> we're<00:03:52.650> going<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.830> square

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
the next step is we're going to square

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.840 
the next step is we're going to square
the<00:03:53.310> ends<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:55.020> actual<00:03:56.010> append<00:03:56.400> blank<00:03:56.640> and
