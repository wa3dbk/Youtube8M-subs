vegetables<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:14.989> know<00:04:15.110> once<00:04:15.319> they've<00:04:15.560> been

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
vegetables you know once they've been

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.920 
vegetables you know once they've been
there<00:04:16.400> they've<00:04:16.729> been<00:04:16.940> blanched<00:04:17.269> or<00:04:17.630> whatever

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
there they've been blanched or whatever

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.390 
there they've been blanched or whatever
they<00:04:18.260> do<00:04:18.320> in<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.590> factory<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.100> order<00:04:19.310> to

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
they do in the factory in order to

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.039 
they do in the factory in order to
freeze<00:04:19.669> them<00:04:19.880> so<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.329> don't<00:04:20.570> think<00:04:20.750> they<00:04:20.870> need

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
freeze them so I don't think they need

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.080 
freeze them so I don't think they need
to<00:04:21.079> be<00:04:21.169> cooked<00:04:21.500> again<00:04:21.620> just<00:04:22.160> heat<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:23.060> I

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
to be cooked again just heat it so I

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.870 
to be cooked again just heat it so I
didn't<00:04:23.889> cook<00:04:24.889> them<00:04:25.100> they<00:04:25.280> aren't<00:04:25.460> these<00:04:25.669> are

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
didn't cook them they aren't these are
