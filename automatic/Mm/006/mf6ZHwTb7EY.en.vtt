00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 what the people my name is benny de 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:13.380
 boer not in any case it is today 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.830
 That's why you can actually do it 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.900
 this mw2 metvix corboz in the video at 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.680
 it can not remember best yet 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.779
 I've seen it for a short while 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.849
 actually be and now even 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.080
 four people four people only wanted people 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.080
 four people age 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.620
 people yes that was a quick insight into 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.329
 the kriegskasse link in the description 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.710
 who did not see the video but me 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.530
 think most have seen it 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.219
 and people like the video of the area was 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.460
 a war crupp may only be 0 8 seconds 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.159
 So I'm really sorry 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.659
 I am particularly iron tips as 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.369
 do you get it working i mean i 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.859
 I'm really happy if someone knows me 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.630
 can go 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.429
 the video was once extremely entered 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.649
 and somehow I do not talk though 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:12.050
 it is like because I can pretty 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.190
 So arrogant about me I'm not 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.840
 I can tell you that, I mean 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.950
 treat him youtuber the same I know 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.369
 not necessarily arrogance now 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.960
 to do 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.340
 but also the exercise youtuber less 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.149
 or greater is perfect for me 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.459
 I definitely do not care 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.940
 completely and that came over again something yes 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:31.700
 I admit it but I am definitely 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.069
 not and that is pair also ready scopes 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.250
 I actually gave my name to people 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.319
 bad if you are even two 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.930
 seconds remains then is already 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:47.119
 Much bad for a few people and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.740
 that should get rid of, then afterwards 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.950
 If you do not judge a blow is not a star 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.600
 camp 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.850
 Well then I come to a topic 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.810
 that absolutely must be bribed and 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.159
 so that baker and therefore make and 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.649
 he knew of course I wanted as 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.899
 pictured alberto faker because I have something 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.630
 had to see students and because I was extreme 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.009
 Many cats do palette as if they were 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.230
 for example, albert like the inventor of 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.660
 cat and quick seeing and if 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.190
 if you do that yourself then you are a field 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.110
 and tries to copy 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.610
 then people never said that 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.230
 the ice cream is his skin drink 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.230
 should represent where I thought up 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.470
 and the bad but that was all on 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.200
 so the question can not be received 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.940
 to the questions on the assertion there 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.980
 I replied because that's me 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.860
 something has provoked in the future 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.670
 I stopped doing that which no longer 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.670
 answer to 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.079
 because I do not want to imitate me 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.030
 have never tried to make someone 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.260
 I do not want to imitate anyone and it 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.640
 apparently there are people who can 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.230
 accept that they are now small 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.140
 girl he survives something with that 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.420
 then maybe bigger can keep up 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.690
 the biggest was her role model or I know 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.010
 and they want to defend him 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.540
 or, of course, they also go to some 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.190
 Masters also really went constructive 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.139
 criticism from that is alright 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.389
 but you really should 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:08.609
 consider if you are really in the right place 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.810
 is because I say so as I said 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.120
 solutions and is called an electrician 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.950
 you play well and ours 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.410
 Put some metal music though you have metal 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.569
 likes to hear music by itself 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.019
 as a sandwich maker you would have a wallisch 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.329
 my politics the first of the cool 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.780
 games out and then still 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.150
 Metal music only at airbus is called 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.560
 not that he was the first and 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.730
 That's why I always think it's pretty 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.980
 nonsensical I will I try 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.530
 I will also try this cat and 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.030
 to talk about this quickly when saving 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.980
 I have to admit it can really be something 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.689
 after albert try but I have neither 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.390
 the intention to make someone else 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:52.900
 and neither intend somehow 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.239
 to copy someone because a human would 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.739
 but remember this is not that 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.900
 important there is already one of them 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.439
 does the same and then it does not bring 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.790
 to do it to someone because of that, well then 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.620
 there are still the people who say at 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.599
 my birth ripped follow I 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.220
 do not know his name but I say 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.190
 At that time, like me, no one knows that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.099
 animal no idea how to pronounce it 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.620
 that I try to imitate him 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.030
 actually not straight up i became 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.289
 made aware of the whole people 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.220
 after I fool my first 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.500
 have uploaded and so I knew I 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.539
 It may all have come because a few 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.940
 people wanted to know as well as me 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.430
 wast projection could and only 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.570
 get a left-footed and son and I 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.770
 thought me why economy is 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.630
 continue I had no idea 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.810
 from all american people like 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.710
 do the same and store the white house 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.990
 have because they do not have to do the same 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.210
 even as if they were the inventors of 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.490
 but you have to say that 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.440
 It's already that's always been me 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.159
 my since the game is coming out 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.440
 but a kind of maybe a few 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:02.110
 Shi and fooling always existed 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.669
 on the first day it was true that 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.710
 I put internet opponents and 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.449
 somehow something made art or 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.919
 that's also crazy 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.750
 even if the best advance therefore 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.970
 that's why I can do that 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.710
 say that nobody invented the research 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.180
 has and as I said I do my like 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.440
 it's also me with that 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.030
 I 've never had corners before 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.020
 as seen on youtube and that's why 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.200
 finally not that I somehow 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.850
 after doing or whatever 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.830
 every case my book i was already on 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.060
 a completely different kind so I have 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:40.180
 never in exactly the same way 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.590
 seen how differently did that good and that 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.480
 which is always the problem of course 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.450
 if you do not have a cat and a link then 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.960
 Sometimes you do not know what to say 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.760
 should 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.950
 Well, finally, I can still 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.860
 say that I really get rid of something 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.720
 should somehow be different faker you can 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.910
 fast or whatever you have 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.590
 pretty eye-catching things when you look 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.520
 exactly the same thing exactly does exactly 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.250
 The same says but I can you from me 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.570
 I definitely do not say anyone after that 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.650
 yet and I think I speak for many 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:13.810
 youtube who think the same way and so 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.120
 I would say that I am now 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:20.680
 I say goodbye to it first of the right 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.440
 neckars and alright i already have today 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.270
 ate a pack and did not dare 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.210
 less to compare with toppings 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.639
 my hope is delicious though 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:34.340
 I am with you 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:43.389
 yes then I say goodbye okay 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:43.389
 that would be you are unique 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.400
 Oh my God
