pedal<00:04:17.260> sensor<00:04:18.260> assembly<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.950> if<00:04:19.400> those<00:04:20.000> three

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
pedal sensor assembly and if those three

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.969 
pedal sensor assembly and if those three
studs<00:04:20.660> right<00:04:20.780> they're<00:04:21.079> going<00:04:21.289> to<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.620> pedal

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
studs right they're going to this pedal

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.310 
studs right they're going to this pedal
bracket<00:04:22.400> so<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.210> have<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.479> get<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.750> off<00:04:23.960> to

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
I've got the box back in with a new

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.500 
I've got the box back in with a new
heater<00:05:35.710> core<00:05:35.979> I'm<00:05:36.940> going<00:05:37.120> to<00:05:37.180> put<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.360> pedal

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
heater core I'm going to put the pedal

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.290 
heater core I'm going to put the pedal
back<00:05:37.830> I'm<00:05:38.830> gonna<00:05:39.010> start<00:05:39.220> reassembling<00:05:39.610> things

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
back I'm gonna start reassembling things

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.040 
back I'm gonna start reassembling things
now<00:05:41.020> kind<00:05:41.710> of<00:05:41.800> goes<00:05:41.979> that<00:05:42.280> same<00:05:42.580> that<00:05:43.300> put<00:05:43.960> it

now kind of goes that same that put it

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.450 
now kind of goes that same that put it
back<00:05:44.169> together<00:05:44.320> is<00:05:44.620> the<00:05:44.740> opposite<00:05:45.100> of<00:05:45.190> putting

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
back together is the opposite of putting

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.920 
back together is the opposite of putting
it<00:05:45.550> together<00:05:45.669> now<00:05:45.970> if<00:05:46.030> I<00:05:46.150> run<00:05:46.270> into<00:05:46.479> some<00:05:46.690> major

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
it together now if I run into some major

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.240 
it together now if I run into some major
issue<00:05:47.620> all<00:05:47.979> let<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.430> know<00:05:48.520> on<00:05:48.639> the<00:05:48.729> next<00:05:48.850> video

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
this dark blue connector is exactly the

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.830 
this dark blue connector is exactly the
match<00:05:58.870> for<00:05:59.229> this<00:05:59.349> light<00:05:59.680> blue<00:05:59.889> connector<00:06:00.840> and

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
match for this light blue connector and

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.420 
match for this light blue connector and
they<00:06:01.930> will<00:06:02.139> plug<00:06:02.380> into<00:06:02.590> each<00:06:02.800> other<00:06:03.009> and<00:06:03.250> when
