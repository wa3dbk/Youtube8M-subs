00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.980
 3 photos offer clues about the limits of the benevolent giant snake god 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:17.250
 of florida a python took refuge in the replies via devouring an alligator 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.949
 half of the prey was found in the stomach of the sector 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.669
 according to the forensic evidence the snake was 4 meters long 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.669
 the length of the dune line was 2 meters 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.240
 this means that the pdl has chosen an animal engraved along half of the 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.410
 its dimensions 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.770
 a 6 to 10 meter long snake should have no problem exercising 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.260
 his hold on man 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.310
 sorry. 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.310
 maps could swallow 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 remember the attack suffered by the diagnosis 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.830
 the snake that rises 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830
 motor ship the mouth almost 180 degrees 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.830
 shows all the teeth another hidden feature or snakes 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.370
 giants 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.690
 inner antigone 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.660
 It consists of two separate subscription account accounts 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.250
 I have this ingenious structure allows these snakes to enlarge the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.190
 jaws beyond the size of their skull to swallow presence 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.090
 you already know look at these two jaws that move independently 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.860
 if I am a second hand 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.930
 I'm trying to convince a hi-flyer elastic ligament you're using for 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.930
 their to the hello season dimension 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 but there must be a maximum opening 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.530
 and the man 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 falls within this limit 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.020
 the answer is how giant snakes swallow latex 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.540
 Syria shares the same happiness as they come 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.159
 policemen are villa d'este 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.869
 widening your mouth 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.869
 dragging of the judges 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.070
 starting from top to bottom 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.510
 DVD recorders will not be able to change the secret question 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.659
 the victim is completely moral 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.779
 but there is another incredible feature of the structure of 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.439
 giant snakes 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.829
 thanks to serpent god it is normally found at the bottom of the moon 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:46.219
 but when the giant snakes ingest big preys 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.809
 trachea is carried in altum out coming out of the mouth 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.400
 you're like a kind of respirator 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.400
 speeches and jaws 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:03.039
 the snake was reading the most voluminous part of solitude 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.139
 and this implies maximum enlargement of the mouth 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.479
 made possible by another secret weapon 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.479
 a layer of skin contacts gray 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.529
 the attack so fragile proves how flexible the skin is 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:18.649
 of the snake 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:22.359
 we are in the mascarpone these policemen are in desperation 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.799
 trying to remove the anaconda's teeth from her arm 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.369
 reality world is another one 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.749
 melendugno lecce, puglia expands a common paving 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.699
 this elastic material is not visible when the venomous snake 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.859
 however, its teams can see that the skin of the snake can 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.119
 widen up to more than three times its normal wisdom 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:55.319
 good the body of man and put times wider than the head of the 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.829
 painter 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.319
 and therefore it is possible that September is so great by several completely 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.969
 to hold wow 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:08.349
 this opinion is approaching. Maximum Expansion Online Snake Limit 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.389
 giant has been revealed 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.169
 no 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.209
 that noise of the python heard by soundcloud perhaps meant that 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.710
 the animal could not go on bologna another photo taken by wusam 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.449
 shows why 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.879
 makes me understand the fate of 50 scientists 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.279
 this photo is from a slightly different angle 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.279
 but there's a problem 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.689
 thisiskaylin 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.689
 what way to ingest some giant snake 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:49.749
 I trust you the doomed can enlarge jaw engine upwards 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:52.889
 the sparrow 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.770
 but the giant snakes 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.409
 they cannot widen the mouth laterally 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.659
 alike 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.669
 this means that when the python have added man's shoulders 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.099
 123 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.029
 yes, the answer we are looking for 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.929
 the part that goes from the neck to the shoulders of an adult man is an obstacle that 

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:14.929
 not even giant snakes can get around 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.529
 now the possibility exists 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.979
 if the man had fallen on his side the jaws of the python could have 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.059
 to open up to drag man's body within himself 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.569
 and complete the work 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.469
 of scientists who have studied this photo believe that this was the 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.469
 fate of there is a good mood 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.490
 incredible stories 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.700
 they tell of large animals removed from the bodies of giant snakes 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.700
 almost all the bones broken in two 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.870
 hahaha this could be fate says a glove 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.809
 an autopsy on the guardhouse reveals that the snakes have indeed broken 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:04.300
 most of his bones n 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.310
 muller still no scientific evidence exists today 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.619
 showing that giant snakes break the bones of the mirror spins 

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:16.039
 Rome disappeared from the power of 4 tons 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.800
 you might be able to get the sun off
