00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.870

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
 Charles 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.419
 hello here we are again in the kitchen 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.390
 from the read to prepare a recipe 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.640
 super rich the brit and banking the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.040
 immaculate how are you going to clean it well 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.440
 well to each very happy then we are going to 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.070
 make a recipe super easy nutritious 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.949
 we are going to provide you with this many vitamins 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.600
 so we turn now to the recipe for 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.180
 different cosmetics to the intense 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.489
 Mackerel winds and its partners that are 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.979
 fabulous these have spinach are 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.140
 miss teen these are with spinach are at 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.110
 final house are very easy to do 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.070
 review we are going to incorporate a cup of 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.540
 water this water to a bear we're going to 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.360
 put to boil we have a little bit of 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.100
 boiling water already 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.290
 They are three cups of flour with flour 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.450
 common wheat if they want action with other 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.210
 flours can also be weights and 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.230
 two eggs nothing more to cali with a 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.280
 little house of water and we are going to add a 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.280
 little house of wings 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.260
 well that's pretty much a cup of 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.760
 flour heard for from a house 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.500
 so that you continue because not all 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.640
 they have the spoon of a cup always 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.790
 we have more putting the Caribbean eggs 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.609
 so they are ready quickie 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.189
 we go 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:55.280
 stirring this seems it is not so 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.490
 but they are like that we are going to add 150 grams 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.590
 of spinach already chopped if they want the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.980
 Bleaching can not do it stung 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.070
 nothing else for him to cook directly 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.650
 we're going to put that out there because the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.140
 silent thorn 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:16.730
 so do not lose the vitamins we turn off the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.570
 fire and here they go seeing apart returning 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.890
 fast extraigo is going away 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:28.390
 forming as if it were the puree I 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.740
 I add huevito, if you want, you can 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.740
 leave it directly 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.040
 and do it without eggs and a trickle of 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.900
 oil add a little oil 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.340
 of sunflower and it looks good too if 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.410
 games for those who do not eat eggs 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.269
 let's put a little bag is going to be like 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.930
 if it were when they do the 1,015 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.379
 rich gifted with potatoes like that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.510
 what is the bread 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.489
 and now you add more to deputy leads 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.650
 more or less two more houses of flour but 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.319
 we are looking at second that the amount 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.189
 of liquid that certain eggs have 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.049
 and what the dough needs when it is not there 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.239
 they put those who can converse puts you 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.909
 salt is we make it laugh 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.069
 especially to invest a little more 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.090
 do not put a whole living yes 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.930
 because we have to form a mass film 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:26.980
 come now I'm going to use my hands let's go 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.660
 putting together a firm mass 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.630
 It is quite liquid yet 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.060
 and over there instead of two cups of flour 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.640
 three houses may need a house and a half 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.640
 but it's pretty much what you need 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.170
 and 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.680
 these recent but very easy to 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.709
 doing it has to be peeling potatoes not 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.629
 It has to be puree and I much 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.150
 with potatoes I do not work because the potato 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.819
 fan falls heavy and that as governments 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.890
 healthy I try to use all things 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.750
 this that they provide energy they feed and 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.370
 be healthy does not mean that the potato 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.040
 It is not healthy but tried to 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.900
 bring the focus because there are so many 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.060
 people who can not eat it and so they go 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.930
 doing and can eat mine that is the same 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.450
 a certain ready we have the mass made 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.050
 this is a mass that is defined the 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.050
 texture 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.870
 Here we have the dough already made and the 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.930
 We are cutting as you can see and 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.479
 we are forming the this shea roll 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.310
 I'm giving so you're talking about changing 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.700
 cut it 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.700
 the rolls were putting the hair 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.520
 and then we're cutting clear but 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:59.620
 well pretty much all the same measure more 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:03.490
 or less the truth without drying they are cutting 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.430
 and this seems like it costs that it's very 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.100
 tedious but it's really easy super 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.310
 easy and they are so light they are delicious 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.660
 you can not believe we're going to go 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.689
 going through the roller this is a 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.879
 year that was 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:22.860
 If you do not want to do not pass, you do not have 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.049
 needs equally so that they remain 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.289
 more formaditos more armadito and a little 

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:31.110
 lighter is good very good will 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:36.439
 go throwing the bio keys to the water is 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.439
 Warm care without getting burned 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.010
 stirring a little I touch it a lot 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.750
 but there until it rises exact 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.060
 it's a few minutes until it gets up 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:55.139
 time is super easy 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:06:00.150
 let's go putting this we have the 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:02.540

 healthy do not use tomatoes like that in the 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.780
