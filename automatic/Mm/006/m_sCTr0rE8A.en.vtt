00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
the third law of motion - every action

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.180 
the third law of motion - every action
is<00:00:11.430> people<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.120> opposite<00:00:12.809> reaction<00:00:13.380> by<00:00:13.950> push

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
is people and opposite reaction by push

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.530 
is people and opposite reaction by push
against<00:00:14.520> the<00:00:14.670> great<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.940> didn't<00:00:15.270> think<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.450> was

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
against the great you didn't think I was

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.600 
against the great you didn't think I was
gonna<00:00:15.690> answer<00:00:15.840> that<00:00:15.990> digital<00:00:16.560> if<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.430> push

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
gonna answer that digital if you push

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.190 
gonna answer that digital if you push
against<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> ground<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.630> ground<00:00:18.660> pushes

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
against the ground the ground pushes

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.490 
against the ground the ground pushes
back<00:00:19.350> against<00:00:19.710> heels<00:00:20.000> so<00:00:21.000> if<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.349> a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
back against heels so if I do this in a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.060 
back against heels so if I do this in a
serve<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.939> still<00:00:24.810> ate<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.380> fights<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:25.800> my

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
serve and I still ate the fights here my

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.990 
serve and I still ate the fights here my
leg<00:00:26.460> knee<00:00:26.630> joint<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.440> flexion<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.400> extend

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
leg knee joint I do flexion now I extend

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.790 
leg knee joint I do flexion now I extend
I<00:00:30.180> push<00:00:30.420> against<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> graphic<00:00:31.230> ground<00:00:31.440> pushes

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I push against the graphic ground pushes

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
I push against the graphic ground pushes
against<00:00:32.070> me<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.820> every<00:00:33.059> action<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.570> nikohl<00:00:33.960> not

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
against me so every action is nikohl not

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
against me so every action is nikohl not
reaction<00:00:34.890> why<00:00:35.220> does<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.400> when<00:00:35.910> you're

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
reaction why does that when you're

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.330 
reaction why does that when you're
questioning<00:00:36.500> was<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.650> the<00:00:37.769> same<00:00:37.949> as<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
questioning was it the same as the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.060 
questioning was it the same as the
linear<00:00:38.580> okay<00:00:39.239> surround<00:00:39.690> reaction<00:00:40.199> forces<00:00:40.500> yes

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
linear okay surround reaction forces yes

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.190 
linear okay surround reaction forces yes
okay<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.760> I'm<00:00:41.880> creating<00:00:42.540> ground<00:00:42.809> reaction

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
okay so I'm creating ground reaction

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.860 
okay so I'm creating ground reaction
forces<00:00:43.829> by<00:00:44.070> pushing<00:00:44.610> against<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> ground<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
forces by pushing against the ground the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.299 
forces by pushing against the ground the
ground<00:00:46.079> pushing<00:00:46.380> against<00:00:46.770> me

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
ground pushing against me

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.020 
ground pushing against me
it<00:00:47.640> starts<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:49.020> knee<00:00:49.290> extension<00:00:50.160> let's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
it starts with this knee extension let's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.030 
it starts with this knee extension let's
take<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> serve<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.840> an<00:00:51.960> example<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.860> knee

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
take the serve as an example this knee

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.180 
take the serve as an example this knee
extension<00:00:53.550> creates<00:00:54.450> linear<00:00:54.870> forces<00:00:55.469> going

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
extension creates linear forces going

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.580 
extension creates linear forces going
upwards<00:00:56.969> vertically<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.379> being

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
upwards vertically that is now being

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.970 
upwards vertically that is now being
translated<00:00:59.070> into<00:00:59.520> hip<00:01:00.300> rotation<00:01:00.989> angularly

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
translated into hip rotation angularly

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.410 
translated into hip rotation angularly
and<00:01:02.460> front<00:01:03.420> rotation<00:01:04.020> angularly<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.240> my

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
and front rotation angularly and then my

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.540 
and front rotation angularly and then my
arm<00:01:06.630> swinging<00:01:06.930> forward<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.250> ground

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
arm swinging forward so the ground

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.570 
arm swinging forward so the ground
reaction<00:01:08.910> forces<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> basis<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:11.490> we

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
reaction forces are the basis of what we

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.190 
reaction forces are the basis of what we
call<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:11.940> kinetic<00:01:12.210> link<00:01:12.600> system<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
call the kinetic link system or the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.040 
call the kinetic link system or the
kinetic<00:01:13.560> chain<00:01:14.179> so<00:01:15.179> that's<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.810> combination

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
kinetic chain so that's the combination

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.050 
kinetic chain so that's the combination
of<00:01:16.500> linear<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.100> angular<00:01:17.190> but<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> starts<00:01:17.940> with

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
of linear and angular but it starts with

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.029 
of linear and angular but it starts with
linear<00:01:18.390> momentum<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:19.080> vertically<00:01:19.590> then

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
linear momentum going vertically then

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.440 
linear momentum going vertically then
there's<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.399> linear<00:01:20.729> momentum<00:01:21.030> going

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
there's that linear momentum going

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.779 
there's that linear momentum going
horizontally<00:01:22.440> I'm<00:01:22.920> annoyed<00:01:23.190> if<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.520> answered

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
horizontally I'm annoyed if I answered

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.550 
horizontally I'm annoyed if I answered
your<00:01:23.819> question<00:01:23.940> for<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.479> had<00:01:24.899> some<00:01:25.170> stuff<00:01:25.380> in

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
your question for that had some stuff in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.800 
your question for that had some stuff in
there<00:01:25.709> yeah<00:01:26.369> yeah<00:01:27.209> though<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.569> was<00:01:27.690> very

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
there yeah yeah though that was very

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
there yeah yeah though that was very
good<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.319> is<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> same<00:01:29.550> as<00:01:29.610> linear

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
good so is it is that the same as linear

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.669 
good so is it is that the same as linear
yet<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.569> that<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> linear<00:01:31.020> moment<00:01:31.319> it's<00:01:31.590> not

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
yet is that the linear moment it's not

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.889 
yet is that the linear moment it's not
the<00:01:31.950> same<00:01:32.220> exactly<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.179> then<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.750> it

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
the same exactly but up then but it

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.260 
the same exactly but up then but it
allows<00:01:34.319> you<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
allows you to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.510 
allows you to
reduce<00:01:36.020> linear<00:01:36.439> momentum<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:37.130> ground

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
reduce linear momentum to ground

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.600 
reduce linear momentum to ground
reaction<00:01:37.790> forces<00:01:38.240> yes<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:39.490> explain<00:01:40.490> the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
reaction forces yes I explain the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.190 
reaction forces yes I explain the
difference<00:01:40.909> between<00:01:40.939> a<00:01:41.180> pinpoint<00:01:41.780> server<00:01:42.049> and

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
difference between a pinpoint server and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.300 
difference between a pinpoint server and
a<00:01:42.229> platform<00:01:42.500> server

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
a platform server

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.960 
a platform server
sure<00:01:44.950> that's<00:01:45.950> been<00:01:46.159> some<00:01:46.369> research<00:01:46.700> in<00:01:46.939> that

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
sure that's been some research in that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.480 
sure that's been some research in that
actually<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.530> simple<00:01:49.100> answer<00:01:49.220> to

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
actually and and the simple answer to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.870 
actually and and the simple answer to
this<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:50.000> from<00:01:50.570> reaction<00:01:51.049> forces<00:01:51.350> know<00:01:51.830> if<00:01:52.670> you

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
this is from reaction forces know if you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.690 
this is from reaction forces know if you
serve<00:01:53.149> with<00:01:53.869> this<00:01:54.080> kind<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.799> platform<00:01:55.220> of

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
serve with this kind of a platform of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.480 
serve with this kind of a platform of
motion<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.899> get<00:01:57.110> fairly<00:01:58.070> good<00:01:58.250> ground

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
motion you get fairly good ground

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.410 
motion you get fairly good ground
reaction<00:01:58.789> forces<00:01:59.330> if<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.350> use<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.799> back<00:02:01.039> leg

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
reaction forces if you use the back leg

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.779 
reaction forces if you use the back leg
as<00:02:02.420> much<00:02:02.720> as<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.020> do<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.289> front<00:02:03.439> leg<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:04.070> by

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
as much as you do the front leg and by

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.539 
as much as you do the front leg and by
bringing<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.240> foot<00:02:05.600> up<00:02:05.840> which<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.799> 10-point

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.210 
bringing the foot up which is a 10-point
I<00:02:07.610> would<00:02:07.729> probably<00:02:07.909> put<00:02:08.330> up<00:02:08.479> possession<00:02:09.259> you

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
I would probably put up possession you

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.820 
I would probably put up possession you
typically<00:02:10.819> if<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.209> can<00:02:11.390> keep<00:02:11.600> your<00:02:11.830> horses

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
typically if you can keep your horses

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.559 
typically if you can keep your horses
going<00:02:13.160> between<00:02:13.370> your<00:02:14.120> base<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.540> support

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
going between your base of support

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.320 
going between your base of support
between<00:02:15.290> your<00:02:15.590> feet<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:16.549> typically<00:02:17.060> will

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
between your feet you typically will

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.759 
between your feet you typically will
create<00:02:19.030> more<00:02:20.030> ground<00:02:20.390> reaction<00:02:20.690> forces<00:02:21.200> so

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
create more ground reaction forces so

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.490 
create more ground reaction forces so
can<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.400> create<00:02:22.640> some<00:02:23.269> more<00:02:23.780> forces<00:02:24.319> by<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
can you create some more forces by the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.039 
can you create some more forces by the
pivot<00:02:24.709> point<00:02:25.100> yes<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:25.940> it's<00:02:26.090> minor<00:02:26.360> there's

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
pivot point yes but it's minor there's

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.110 
pivot point yes but it's minor there's
not<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.290> huge<00:02:27.680> difference<00:02:27.790> remember<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.030> in

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
not a huge difference remember that in

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.729 
not a huge difference remember that in
different<00:02:29.450> ways<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.810> create<00:02:29.959> force<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.590> can

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
different ways to create force you can

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.740 
different ways to create force you can
create<00:02:30.920> force<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:31.519> way<00:02:31.760> if<00:02:32.299> you<00:02:32.450> think<00:02:32.660> of

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
create force this way if you think of

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.960 
create force this way if you think of
John<00:02:32.989> McEnroe<00:02:33.590> picture<00:02:34.220> him<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.459> your<00:02:34.700> mind

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
John McEnroe picture him in your mind

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.780 
John McEnroe picture him in your mind
serving<00:02:35.810> where<00:02:36.440> he<00:02:36.739> had<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.860> lot<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.099> horizontal

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
serving where he had a lot of horizontal

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.380 
serving where he had a lot of horizontal
rotation<00:02:38.360> in<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.110> serve<00:02:39.920> right<00:02:40.220> where<00:02:40.940> she<00:02:41.120> had

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
rotation in a serve right where she had

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.420 
rotation in a serve right where she had
someone<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.750> like<00:02:41.989> Boris<00:02:42.320> Becker<00:02:42.620> or<00:02:43.040> Edward

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
someone to like Boris Becker or Edward

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.599 
someone to like Boris Becker or Edward
had<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> lot<00:02:44.239> more<00:02:44.410> vertical<00:02:45.410> action<00:02:45.609> both

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
had a lot more vertical action both

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.599 
had a lot more vertical action both
reduce<00:02:47.120> force<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:49.010> part<00:02:49.340> of<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.489> is

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
reduce force and so part of that is

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.280 
reduce force and so part of that is
whatever<00:02:50.120> you're<00:02:50.480> most<00:02:50.600> comfortable<00:02:50.750> with

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
whatever you're most comfortable with

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.620 
whatever you're most comfortable with
however<00:02:51.769> I<00:02:51.920> having<00:02:52.190> said<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:53.299> research

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
however I having said that the research

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.400 
however I having said that the research
does<00:02:53.900> show<00:02:53.930> that<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.350> pinpoint<00:02:55.090> sir<00:02:56.410> allows

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
does show that the pinpoint sir allows

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.460 
does show that the pinpoint sir allows
you<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.739> create<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:58.130> few

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
you to create a few

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.290 
you to create a few
more<00:03:00.010> forces<00:03:00.490> than<00:03:00.670> has<00:03:00.820> been<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.120> platform

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
more forces than has been the platform

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.530 
more forces than has been the platform
sir<00:03:01.720> festivities<00:03:02.340> if<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.610> keep<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.000> forces

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
sir festivities if you keep you forces

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.780 
sir festivities if you keep you forces
between<00:03:04.840> your<00:03:05.050> base<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.350> support

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.729 

well<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.629> hopefully<00:03:09.840> you're<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.319> forward

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
well and hopefully you're going forward

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.149 
well and hopefully you're going forward
so<00:03:10.890> much<00:03:11.040> did<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.730> have<00:03:11.879> that<00:03:12.090> people<00:03:12.360> Italy

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
so much did you have that people Italy

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.069 
so much did you have that people Italy
import<00:03:14.159> as<00:03:14.280> well<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:15.329> guy<00:03:15.510> again<00:03:15.750> that's<00:03:15.930> an

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
import as well the guy again that's an
