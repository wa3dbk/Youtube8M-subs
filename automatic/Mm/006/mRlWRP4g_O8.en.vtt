this is an easy way to make an inset
what<00:00:04.440> I've<00:00:04.589> done<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:05.040> I've<00:00:05.640> cut<00:00:05.850> thin<00:00:06.150> boards

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
what I've done is I've cut thin boards

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.910 
what I've done is I've cut thin boards
and<00:00:07.130> thicker<00:00:08.130> boards<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:09.300> will<00:00:09.920> together

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
and thicker boards that will together

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.690 
and thicker boards that will together
stack<00:00:11.880> up<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.150> make<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.900> thickness<00:00:13.860> bits<00:00:14.549> like

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
stack up to make a thickness bits like

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.359 
stack up to make a thickness bits like
the<00:00:14.849> rest<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.210> my<00:00:15.330> box<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.529> inset<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.070> for

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
the rest of my box that the inset is for

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
to the edge of my table take my little

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.130 
to the edge of my table take my little
triangle<00:00:51.460> here<00:00:51.700> that<00:00:51.730> has<00:00:52.030> an<00:00:52.150> angle<00:00:52.480> has<00:00:52.960> an

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
triangle here that has an angle has an

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.750 
triangle here that has an angle has an
angled<00:00:53.410> edge<00:00:53.590> on<00:00:53.860> it<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:56.310> find<00:00:57.310> the<00:00:57.520> center

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
angled edge on it and find the center

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.650 
angled edge on it and find the center
and<00:00:58.680> make<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.890> line<00:01:00.160> through<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.730> so<00:01:01.480> now<00:01:01.630> I

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
and make a line through that so now I

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.070 
and make a line through that so now I
have<00:01:02.020> these<00:01:02.260> lines<00:01:02.680> on<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.670> cardboard<00:01:04.270> I'm

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
have these lines on the cardboard I'm

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.450 
have these lines on the cardboard I'm
going<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.680> do<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.920> same<00:01:06.160> thing<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:08.460> final

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
going to do the same thing to the final

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.570 
going to do the same thing to the final
piece<00:01:10.300> that<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.930> will<00:01:11.140> cut<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.470> end<00:01:11.620> set<00:01:11.920> from

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.300 

find<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.760> center<00:01:19.090> by<00:01:19.420> making<00:01:20.229> two<00:01:20.530> diagonals

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.960 

and<00:01:24.310> then<00:01:25.350> I'll<00:01:26.350> take<00:01:26.530> my<00:01:26.680> triangle<00:01:27.310> make

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
and then I'll take my triangle make

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.440 
and then I'll take my triangle make
everything<00:01:28.270> square<00:01:28.869> here<00:01:29.880> use<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.060> ruler<00:01:31.270> as

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
everything square here use the ruler as

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:40.440 
everything square here use the ruler as
an<00:01:31.600> extension<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.380> now<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:39.640> have<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.119> center

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
an extension and now I have the center

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.320 
an extension and now I have the center
line<00:01:40.660> on<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.619> board<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:46.090> all<00:01:46.240> I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
line on the board like this now all I

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.930 
line on the board like this now all I
have<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.630> do<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:47.229> line<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.710> center<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.759> two

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
have to do is line the center of the two

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.910 
have to do is line the center of the two
lines<00:01:49.240> here<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.780> all<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.350> have<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.770> is

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
lines here and all I have to do is

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.540 
lines here and all I have to do is
decide<00:01:51.250> on<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.759> height<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:53.110> board<00:01:53.399> or<00:01:54.399> you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
decide on the height of the board or you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:04.960 
decide on the height of the board or you
know<00:01:54.610> where<00:01:54.820> I<00:01:54.850> want<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.300> inset<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.770> rest

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.850 

it<00:02:05.540> was<00:02:05.690> about<00:02:05.870> an<00:02:06.020> inch<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.350> half<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.740> the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
it was about an inch and a half on the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.580 
it was about an inch and a half on the
sample<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.310> that's<00:02:07.430> about<00:02:07.550> what<00:02:07.760> I<00:02:07.790> have<00:02:08.060> here

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
sample and that's about what I have here

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.250 
sample and that's about what I have here
so<00:02:09.850> now<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:10.880> will<00:02:11.030> take<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.330> pencil<00:02:11.660> line<00:02:11.960> and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
so now I will take a pencil line and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.390 
so now I will take a pencil line and
draw<00:02:13.130> around<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.980> will<00:02:19.160> give<00:02:19.280> you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
draw around this and this will give you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.470 
draw around this and this will give you
my<00:02:19.520> general<00:02:19.790> place<00:02:20.240> for<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.130> being<00:02:22.130> set<00:02:22.480> now

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
my general place for the being set now

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.720 
my general place for the being set now
in<00:02:23.600> order<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.900> cut<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.290> I'll<00:02:25.010> just<00:02:25.280> set<00:02:25.520> this

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
in order to cut that I'll just set this

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.580 
in order to cut that I'll just set this
on<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.060> end<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.750> my<00:02:26.960> table<00:02:27.710> here<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:30.940> and

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
on the end of my table here this and

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.870 
on the end of my table here this and
then<00:02:33.590> with<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.830> Olfa<00:02:34.130> knife<00:02:36.130> set<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.370> into

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
then with the Olfa knife set that into

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.550 
then with the Olfa knife set that into
the<00:02:38.000> pencil<00:02:38.390> line<00:02:38.540> or<00:02:38.750> just<00:02:38.780> outside<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
the pencil line or just outside the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.710 
the pencil line or just outside the
pencil<00:02:39.890> line<00:02:40.010> because<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.400> want<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.790> inset<00:02:41.630> to

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
pencil line because I want the inset to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.940 
pencil line because I want the inset to
be<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.140> little<00:02:42.350> bit<00:02:42.470> larger

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
be just a little bit larger

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.980 
be just a little bit larger
once<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.400> cloth<00:02:43.610> goes<00:02:43.940> over<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> board<00:02:44.780> and

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
once the cloth goes over the board and

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.780 
once the cloth goes over the board and
into<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.530> inset<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.130> will<00:02:46.250> make<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.580> hole<00:02:46.760> a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
into the inset it will make the hole a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.490 
into the inset it will make the hole a
little<00:02:46.880> smaller<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.810> would<00:02:48.020> like<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.320> have

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
little smaller so I would like to have

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.590 
little smaller so I would like to have

I've just outside push my square we were
up<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.100> edge<00:03:13.220> like<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:14.200> make<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.230> second

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
up to the edge like that make a second

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:23.440 
up to the edge like that make a second
cut<00:03:17.860> no<00:03:18.860> I'll<00:03:19.130> take<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:22.000> ruler<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.150> do<00:03:23.300> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
cut no I'll take the ruler and do the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.020 
cut no I'll take the ruler and do the
same<00:03:23.690> thing<00:03:24.050> for<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.739> base<00:03:25.459> of<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.810> square

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
same thing for the base of the square

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:40.750 
same thing for the base of the square
window<00:03:29.030> here<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:31.810> cut<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:33.019> out

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760

and now I have a window and I'm going to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.830 
and now I have a window and I'm going to
glue<00:03:46.980> out<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.400> boards<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.030> laminate<00:03:48.690> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
always glue out the heavier boards when

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.780 
always glue out the heavier boards when
you're<00:04:03.510> doing<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:03.990> because<00:04:04.800> this<00:04:05.190> if<00:04:05.670> you

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
you're doing this because this if you

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.490 
you're doing this because this if you
blow<00:04:05.970> out<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.180> pin<00:04:06.390> board<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:06.900> may<00:04:07.050> tend<00:04:07.320> to

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
blow out the pin board it may tend to

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.480 
blow out the pin board it may tend to
warp<00:04:08.390> as<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.660> put<00:04:09.840> them<00:04:09.960> together<00:04:10.020> these<00:04:10.860> also

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
warp as you put them together these also

warp as you put them together these also
have<00:04:11.640> been<00:04:11.760> cut<00:04:12.000> with<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.270> grain<00:04:12.420> running
