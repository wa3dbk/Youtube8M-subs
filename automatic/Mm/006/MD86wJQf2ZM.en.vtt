diamond foot will do is they pump with
these<00:00:24.570> little<00:00:24.750> feet<00:00:26.900> feet<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.990> pain<00:00:28.140> yeah<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.529> I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
these little feet feet to pain yeah so I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
these little feet feet to pain yeah so I
probably<00:00:28.740> clever<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.519> took<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> feet<00:00:29.910> away

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
probably clever and took the feet away

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.580 
probably clever and took the feet away
and<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.269> use<00:00:30.449> them<00:00:30.630> there's<00:00:31.230> also<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.439> reason

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
and not use them there's also a reason

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
and not use them there's also a reason
for<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> fetus<00:00:32.130> they<00:00:32.550> stopped<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> holes<00:00:33.270> so

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
for the fetus they stopped the holes so

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.440 
for the fetus they stopped the holes so
again<00:00:34.140> we've<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> dot<00:00:34.829> far<00:00:35.070> away<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> feet<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
again we've a dot far away the feet and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.090 
again we've a dot far away the feet and
