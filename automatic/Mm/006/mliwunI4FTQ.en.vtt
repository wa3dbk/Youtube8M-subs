 Consider the installation option 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.920
 milling sidewalls perform milling 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.759
 all necessary parts according to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.759

 facade there are no traces of construction fingers 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.720
 provides for the opening of the facade of his 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.720
 inside 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.440
 LED can be pasted into the profile

 step 1 paste the led strip into 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.690
 profile recommended tape width 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.690
 8 millimeters 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.840
 step 2 close the led strip 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.420
 polycarbonate profile 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.459
 polycarbonate profile diffuses light 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.200
 from led case and lighting 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.940
 internal space 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.940
 effective comfortable for eyes

 profile can be pasted decorative 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.910
 insert

 requirements 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.390
 thickness must be from 0 7 to 0 9 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.780
 millimeters 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.070
 for example it may be plastic width 5 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.310
 centimeters for the top profile and 6 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.990
 centimeters for medium profile now 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.730
 I will tell in more detail how it is 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.750
 to make 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.050
 put the profile on horizontal 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.200

 top slot profile for efficient 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.959
 gluing use the load in a piece 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.690
 steel timber 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.519
 length appropriate request to 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.220
 to press a decorative strip to a profile 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.860
 until the glue activates the profile 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.630
 and come with a length of 4 meters each 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.720
