00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
just turned on the feed motor he's

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:55.060 
just turned on the feed motor he's
feeding<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.490> table<00:01:49.060> that's<00:01:50.060> wrapping<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:54.070> the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
feeding the table that's wrapping it the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.309 
feeding the table that's wrapping it the
other<00:01:55.219> direction<00:01:55.579> he's<00:01:55.880> feeding<00:01:56.179> it<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.659> now

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
other direction he's feeding it and now

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.550 

d<00:02:15.780> travel<00:02:16.579> coming<00:02:17.579> up<00:02:18.200> dry<00:02:19.200> fitting<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
d travel coming up dry fitting it up and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:37.660 
d travel coming up dry fitting it up and
down<00:02:24.409> laughing<00:02:25.409> down<00:02:26.360> okay<00:02:30.709> got<00:02:31.709> cool

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.000 

near<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.390> pump<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:38.960> think<00:02:39.560> we<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:39.740> tried<00:02:39.980> a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
near the pump I think we just tried a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.600 
near the pump I think we just tried a
couple<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.400> different<00:02:40.490> spindle<00:02:41.420> speeds

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
couple of different spindle speeds

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:55.280 
couple of different spindle speeds
show<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> chef

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.630 

that's<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.409> different<00:02:56.709> spindle<00:02:57.040> speed<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
that's a different spindle speed for the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.699 
that's a different spindle speed for the
horizontal<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.049> sort<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.349> shift<00:02:59.560> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
horizontal so you sort of shift the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.100 
horizontal so you sort of shift the
higher<00:02:59.920> speed<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> lower<00:03:00.670> speed<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.329> they<00:03:01.959> have

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
higher speed a lower speed so they have

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.710 
higher speed a lower speed so they have
the<00:03:02.290> vertical<00:03:02.620> ahead<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.519> quill<00:03:03.790> so

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
the vertical ahead just so the quill so

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.110 
the vertical ahead just so the quill so
the<00:03:04.840> team<00:03:05.049> will<00:03:05.230> wrap<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:05.890> feed<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.519> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
the team will wrap it and feed and the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.770 
the team will wrap it and feed and the
need<00:03:07.360> feed<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.349> rapid<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.180> that's<00:03:10.180> about<00:03:10.540> it

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
need feed and rapid and that's about it

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.270 
need feed and rapid and that's about it
thank<00:03:11.349> you<00:03:11.409> very<00:03:11.590> much<00:03:11.769> for<00:03:11.920> watching<00:03:12.220> the
