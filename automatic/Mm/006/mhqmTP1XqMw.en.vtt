Game<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.330> Thrones<00:00:24.619> knows<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:25.949> he's<00:00:26.070> doing

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400 
Game of Thrones knows what he's doing
visually<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> think<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.840> will<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
visually I think this will be the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.690 
visually I think this will be the
best-looking<00:00:30.470> Thor<00:00:31.470> movie<00:00:31.710> considering<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
best-looking Thor movie considering the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.110 
best-looking Thor movie considering the
first<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.059> what<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.690> was<00:00:33.809> good<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
first one what it was good but it was I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.780 
first one what it was good but it was I
think<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.300> could<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.600> visually<00:00:37.110> better<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
think it could be visually better so I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
think it could be visually better so I
feel<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.170> will<00:00:40.410> really<00:00:40.440> pick<00:00:40.920> up

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
feel like this one will really pick up

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.930 
feel like this one will really pick up
and<00:00:41.340> I'll<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.790> feel<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.480> threat

life-time<00:01:21.090> even<00:01:22.090> started<00:01:22.840> if<00:01:22.990> you<00:01:23.020> even<00:01:23.410> watch

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
life-time even started if you even watch

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.280 
life-time even started if you even watch
the<00:01:23.830> trailer<00:01:24.220> it's<00:01:24.400> like<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.730> universe

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the trailer it's like the universe

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.570 
the trailer it's like the universe
before<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.380> universe<00:01:26.740> where<00:01:26.920> Kurt<00:01:27.160> was

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
before the universe where Kurt was

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.100 
before the universe where Kurt was
created<00:01:28.060> there<00:01:28.300> was<00:01:28.480> something<00:01:28.870> it<00:01:29.020> was

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
created there was something it was

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.260 
created there was something it was
darkness<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.830> I'm<00:01:30.520> guessing<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.060> was<00:01:31.150> the

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
darkness and I'm guessing it was the

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.100 
darkness and I'm guessing it was the
Dark<00:01:31.480> Elves<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.880> really<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.870> Dark

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
Dark Elves and they really the Dark

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.830 
Dark Elves and they really the Dark
Elves<00:01:35.320> want<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.890> bring<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:37.090> world<00:01:37.240> back<00:01:37.420> into

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
Elves want to bring the world back into

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.740 
Elves want to bring the world back into
darkness<00:01:38.260> probably<00:01:39.250> by<00:01:39.400> destroying<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
darkness probably by destroying the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.220 
darkness probably by destroying the
whole<00:01:40.930> universe<00:01:41.320> including<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.370> nine<00:01:42.550> realms

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
whole universe including the nine realms

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.820 
whole universe including the nine realms
so<00:01:44.230> that<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:44.920> plot<00:01:45.220> details<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.090> basic

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
villain it's not the anos or Thanos

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.949 
villain it's not the anos or Thanos
could<00:02:31.580> be<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.940> but<00:02:32.060> not<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.420> main<00:02:32.569> villain

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959

lead-up to Thea knows one last thing

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.569 
lead-up to Thea knows one last thing
this<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.440> best<00:02:54.830> thing<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:56.170> think<00:02:57.170> is<00:02:57.709> that

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
this is the best thing I think is that

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.800 
this is the best thing I think is that
Joss<00:02:59.420> Whedon<00:02:59.900> has<00:03:00.340> said<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:02.480> he<00:03:02.720> has

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
Joss Whedon has said that he has

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.300 
Joss Whedon has said that he has
finished<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.260> first<00:03:03.530> draft<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.220> script

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
and he is working on rewrites but he

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.550 
and he is working on rewrites but he
says<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:07.100> story<00:03:07.519> is<00:03:07.820> very<00:03:08.090> good<00:03:08.359> and<00:03:08.560> there

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
says the story is very good and there
