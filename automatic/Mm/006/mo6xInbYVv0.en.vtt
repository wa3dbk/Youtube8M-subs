00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
with the ground and just come up like

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.090 
with the ground and just come up like
that<00:00:59.390> now<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.780> exercise<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.500> practices

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
that now and exercise the practices

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.890 
that now and exercise the practices
basically<00:01:02.970> just<00:01:03.659> toss<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.409> drop<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.900> start

basically just toss it up drop it start
doing<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.259> advanced<00:01:07.560> juggling<00:01:08.009> with<00:01:08.100> your

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
doing the advanced juggling with your

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
doing the advanced juggling with your
feet<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.570> hard<00:01:09.810> on

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
non-dominant foot now let's practice and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:33.020 
non-dominant foot now let's practice and
make<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.520> happen

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.190 

now<00:01:34.030> let's<00:01:34.210> talk<00:01:34.360> about<00:01:34.420> some<00:01:34.810> things<00:01:35.050> that

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
now let's talk about some things that

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.930 
now let's talk about some things that
could<00:01:35.320> go<00:01:35.440> wrong<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.860> how<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.250> can<00:01:36.460> fix<00:01:36.700> them

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
could go wrong and how you can fix them

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.460 
could go wrong and how you can fix them
so<00:01:37.479> if<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:37.660> find<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.170> ball<00:01:38.350> is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
remember it should be even with the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
moving getting me down stays the same

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.290 
moving getting me down stays the same
you<00:01:55.690> just<00:01:55.720> pop<00:01:56.170> up<00:01:56.470> alright<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.580> last<00:01:57.820> make

it<00:02:02.440> easier<00:02:02.770> for<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.070> start<00:02:03.310> juggling

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
it easier for you to start juggling

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.389 
it easier for you to start juggling
after<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.320> feel<00:02:05.470> comfortable<00:02:05.740> with<00:02:06.100> advanced

after you feel comfortable with advanced

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.639 
after you feel comfortable with advanced
foot<00:02:06.640> juggling<00:02:07.119> then<00:02:07.570> try<00:02:07.869> out<00:02:08.020> on<00:02:08.200> one<00:02:08.410> foot

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
foot juggling then try out on one foot

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.560 
foot juggling then try out on one foot
how<00:02:08.979> many<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.429> do<00:02:09.550> in<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.759> row<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.149> then

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570
