00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:10.990
 Arirang No. 5, a satellite observing the whole earth , succeeded in entering the orbit of space 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.080
 6:00 world-class commercial and operational in about six months early in September observation satellite 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 After you have done, you will go into normal mission performance. 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 Reporter Lee Jung-woo reports 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.779
 The launch vehicle of the Russian word for the multi-purpose Samsung Arirang No. 5 is funny 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.180
 Arirang, launched from the coronal to the Russian space, 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.490
 I entered 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:43.920
 Arirang No. 5, the trolley ground located in Antarctica 32 minutes after launch and the first contact 6 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:48.570
 1 hour and 27 minutes later , we succeeded in communicating with the Norwegian Forest Alvard ground station 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 Microwave will be launched on the ground and will be reflected in August 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.400
 If you do, you will know exactly how many grills are on the ground. 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.070
 You can get stereoscopic images 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:07.260
 Resolution is 1m Look at the warrant of Arirang office fired in Japan last May 7m 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.840
 The sea is falling, but regardless of the night and day cloudy weather, 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.360
 Possible all-weather satellite 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.750
 How this signal processing techniques depending on whether we can not see now Analects 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 Great deal of information that they can create 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:28.110
 In this way, the information extraction is much more varied. 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:33.030
 Arirang said that the final operation will be delayed, 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:38.040
 After six months of initial operation, we will be on a full-scale mission. 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:43.200
 Multipurpose service satellite Earth Observation after Arirang The name of the electric railroad radar 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.790
 Already with the 4th Arirang 3 in the bow , we now extend the application range of 1-axis video 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.250
 I will leave. 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.990
 Satellites such as the United States and France leading the global commercial satellite video sales market 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:59.460
 It serves as a bridgehead to reduce technology gap with developing countries 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:04.470
 Our satellite satellites are now quite advanced to advanced dictation. 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.800
 We can get the projectile technology and shoot at our land whenever we want. 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.810
 I think we should create such a program. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:17.820
 The launch of the multi-purpose satellite Arirang No. 5 has been in the midst of advanced countries' 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.920
 Things skills while Ali on the site in the field of gender creates the potential world market 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:25.010
 It's open. 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.010
