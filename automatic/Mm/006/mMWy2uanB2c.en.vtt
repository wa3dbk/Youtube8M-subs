this year again we will be able to show
that<00:01:40.640> we<00:01:40.940> are<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.240> fighting<00:01:41.540> force<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.990> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
that we are the fighting force and the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.630 
that we are the fighting force and the
real<00:01:42.500> opposition<00:01:42.979> here<00:01:43.190> in<00:01:43.280> Wales

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
real opposition here in Wales

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.120 
real opposition here in Wales
you<00:01:44.510> know<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:44.930> don't<00:01:45.020> win<00:01:45.290> any<00:01:45.440> seats<00:01:45.500> are<00:01:45.950> you

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
you know you don't win any seats are you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.830 
you know you don't win any seats are you
well<00:01:46.520> I'm<00:01:46.610> very<00:01:46.640> confident<00:01:47.180> we<00:01:47.330> can<00:01:47.420> do<00:01:47.570> very

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840

very well
and<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.890> think<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.159> we<00:01:49.220> got<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> fighting

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
and I think that we got a fighting

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.430 
and I think that we got a fighting
chance<00:01:49.940> in<00:01:50.119> many<00:01:50.360> areas<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:51.140> look<00:01:51.170> at<00:01:51.380> the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
chance in many areas you look at the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.649 
chance in many areas you look at the
