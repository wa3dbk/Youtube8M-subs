00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:14.849
 simple smokehouse option 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:18.570
 home conditions in our case 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.250
 the smokehouse is made of titanium which 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.730
 this time is no longer used for 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:30.929
 boiling water took took mean for 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 basis of only let's say it is so 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.770
 casing part of the hole which were 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:43.129
 superfluous they were closed by all sorts 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.039
 close these bolts samorezika me 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:52.100
 that's also taken 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.100
 barrel 200-liter sawed in half 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.379
 loaded this very cylinder into this barrel 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.449
 dumped with sand turned out like a thermos 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.449
 electric tile is put inside 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:15.630
 electric tile further it will be us 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.939
 give temperature and smoke from the same 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.770
 titanium turned part 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.759
 detail means well actually where 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.540
 Laid the product and the pallet 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:33.450
 suspended on a wire 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:36.450
 so that the fat does not drip to the public to the birds 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.380
 can a bunch of options you can right on 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.100
 tile to put 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.020
 a small log short with green 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.740
 a or aspen or 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.869
 twigs spun around live no difference in our 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:00.290
 case we have small alder chips 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.290
 This on the tile is put pan 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.480
 Yes 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:18.270
 set the install itself install 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:21.420
 top thread plus this smokehouse in 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.220
 that we don't need to keep track of the wood 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.620
 and so on we turn on the electric stove and 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:34.580
 we can install the regulator in any 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.950
 position so we have repeatedly increased chips 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.150
 what's really important 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.070
 chips before we fall asleep 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:03:07.400
 you tortured a little bit so that she did not immediately 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:03:10.890
 start all believe in this version we 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:19.829
 do smoked bacon before this we 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:22.610
 smoked chicken legs chicken so fat 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:29.820
 naturally pre-prepared 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:32.959
 options a lot of pieces are small but 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.959
 quite appetizing 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:08.720
 further cover from the same data type 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:20.060
 we cover the lid we promise to close 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:24.280
 electricity to heat not 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:28.539
 ran off we use a sweatshirt 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.539
 covering believe as part of a tight-tight 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:47.979
 well now twenty minutes and you can go 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:53.419
