stacks<00:02:04.570> over<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.990> my<00:02:05.140> ladle<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.620> oh<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.790> the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
stacks over in my ladle and oh that the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.059 
stacks over in my ladle and oh that the
only<00:02:07.150> difference<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.630> would<00:02:07.720> say<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.259> when

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
only difference I would say is that when

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.619 
only difference I would say is that when
I<00:02:09.099> spread<00:02:09.429> this<00:02:09.610> on<00:02:09.819> my<00:02:10.060> wrists

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
I spread this on my wrists

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.650 
I spread this on my wrists
it<00:02:10.720> was<00:02:11.050> more<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.349> an<00:02:11.710> oily<00:02:12.340> texture<00:02:13.180> meaning

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
it was more of an oily texture meaning

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.589 
it was more of an oily texture meaning
it<00:02:13.810> stayed<00:02:14.170> longer<00:02:14.740> on<00:02:15.040> my<00:02:15.190> hand

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
it stayed longer on my hand

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.339 
it stayed longer on my hand
and<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.670> evaporated<00:02:17.670> quickly<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.810> lasts

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
and this evaporated quickly this lasts

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.830 
and this evaporated quickly this lasts
for<00:02:19.560> about<00:02:19.700> three<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.730> four<00:02:21.060> hours<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.719> this

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
for about three to four hours and this

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.050 
for about three to four hours and this
lasts<00:02:22.139> the<00:02:22.379> whole<00:02:22.409> day<00:02:22.799> so<00:02:23.549> even<00:02:23.969> though

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
lasts the whole day so even though

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.670 
lasts the whole day so even though
they're<00:02:24.239> both<00:02:24.389> under<00:02:24.689> perfume<00:02:25.200> which<00:02:25.409> means

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
they're both under perfume which means

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.410 
they're both under perfume which means
it's<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.040> bit<00:02:26.159> more<00:02:26.340> concentrated<00:02:27.060> than<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
it's a bit more concentrated than the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.780 
it's a bit more concentrated than the
vaporizer<00:02:29.239> it's<00:02:30.239> still<00:02:31.069> obviously<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.340> did

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
vaporizer it's still obviously this did

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.970 
vaporizer it's still obviously this did
exceed<00:02:33.239> because<00:02:33.689> of<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.989> price<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.829> you're

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
exceed because of the price that you're

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.410 
exceed because of the price that you're
paying<00:02:35.189> for<00:02:35.340> any<00:02:35.790> fitting<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.359> would

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
paying for any fitting in it I would

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.220 
paying for any fitting in it I would
have<00:02:36.659> returned<00:02:37.439> it<00:02:37.590> back<00:02:37.889> but<00:02:38.639> yes<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:39.840> if<00:02:40.109> you
