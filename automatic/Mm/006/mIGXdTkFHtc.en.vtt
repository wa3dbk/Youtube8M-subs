00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.340 

so

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
so

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.170 
so
okay<00:05:23.250> so<00:05:23.310> I'll<00:05:23.730> put<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.150> on<00:05:24.420> this<00:05:24.600> side<00:05:24.930> here

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
okay so I'll put this on this side here

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.460 
okay so I'll put this on this side here
put<00:05:27.180> this<00:05:27.330> on<00:05:27.570> this<00:05:27.900> side<00:05:28.230> like<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:30.320> there<00:05:31.320> we

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
put this on this side like so there we

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:38.320 
put this on this side like so there we
go

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.149 

as<00:05:38.900> you<00:05:39.050> see<00:05:39.229> with<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.500> lid<00:05:39.650> closed<00:05:39.919> you

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
as you see with the lid closed you

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.469 
as you see with the lid closed you
actually<00:05:40.460> get<00:05:40.610> your<00:05:40.639> date<00:05:40.909> and<00:05:41.030> time<00:05:41.210> at<00:05:41.389> the

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
actually get your date and time at the

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.879 
actually get your date and time at the
top<00:05:43.810> so<00:05:44.810> that's<00:05:44.990> still<00:05:45.199> visible<00:05:45.620> and<00:05:45.800> then

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
top so that's still visible and then

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.720 
top so that's still visible and then
when<00:05:45.979> you<00:05:46.039> open<00:05:46.250> it<00:05:46.280> up<00:05:46.400> you<00:05:46.610> get<00:05:46.939> your<00:05:47.120> screen

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.830 

so

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
so

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.900 
so
