all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.410> my<00:00:01.530> first<00:00:01.800> youtube<00:00:02.129> video

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
all right this is my first youtube video

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.660 
all right this is my first youtube video
so<00:00:03.210> we'll<00:00:03.360> see<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:03.659> it<00:00:03.689> goes<00:00:03.780> here<00:00:04.400> this<00:00:05.400> video

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
so we'll see how it goes here this video

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.980 
so we'll see how it goes here this video
is<00:00:05.790> going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.940> be<00:00:06.089> how<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.509> tell<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
is going to be how to tell the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.440 
is going to be how to tell the
difference<00:00:07.020> between<00:00:07.440> an<00:00:07.919> allis-chalmers<00:00:08.490> WD

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
difference between an allis-chalmers WD

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.419 
difference between an allis-chalmers WD
45<00:00:10.099> and<00:00:11.099> analysis<00:00:11.910> WD<00:00:13.130> now<00:00:14.130> there's<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
45 and analysis WD now there's a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.240 
45 and analysis WD now there's a
significant<00:00:14.969> difference<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.509> if<00:00:16.100> you<00:00:17.100> need

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
significant difference here if you need

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.099 
significant difference here if you need
more<00:00:17.460> power<00:00:17.760> you're<00:00:18.300> going<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> WD

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
more power you're going to want the WD

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.380 
more power you're going to want the WD
45<00:00:19.939> it<00:00:20.939> has<00:00:21.119> about<00:00:21.740> 1/3<00:00:22.740> more<00:00:23.039> horsepower<00:00:23.609> than

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
45 it has about 1/3 more horsepower than

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.500 
45 it has about 1/3 more horsepower than
the<00:00:24.539> older<00:00:24.810> WD<00:00:25.820> probably<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> easiest<00:00:27.269> way<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the older WD probably the easiest way to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.370 
the older WD probably the easiest way to
tell<00:00:27.980> would<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.310> look<00:00:29.519> at<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:31.080> older

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
tell would be to look at the the older

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680 
tell would be to look at the the older
tractor<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:32.969> see<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.329> here<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
tractor you can see right here on the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.889 
tractor you can see right here on the
side<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> engine<00:00:35.480> it's<00:00:36.480> kinda<00:00:36.690> hard<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
side of the engine it's kinda hard to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.479 
side of the engine it's kinda hard to
tell<00:00:37.110> let<00:00:37.290> me<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.590> if<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.920> point<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.250> out

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
tell let me see if I can point this out

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.010 
tell let me see if I can point this out
but<00:00:39.360> there's<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.629> cover<00:00:39.930> plate<00:00:40.170> right<00:00:41.160> here

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
but there's a cover plate right here

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.180 
but there's a cover plate right here
this<00:00:43.020> cover<00:00:43.290> plate<00:00:44.719> is<00:00:45.719> held<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.469> six

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
this cover plate is held on with six

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.090 
this cover plate is held on with six
bolts<00:00:47.780> I'll<00:00:48.780> take<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> shot<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.890> back

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
bolts I'll take a shot of the back

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.279 
bolts I'll take a shot of the back
portion<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:54.289> anyway

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
portion of it here so you can see anyway

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.880 
portion of it here so you can see anyway
it's<00:00:55.710> fairly<00:00:56.039> fairly<00:00:56.940> distinctive<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:58.620> sticks

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it's fairly fairly distinctive it sticks

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.959 
it's fairly fairly distinctive it sticks
out<00:00:59.039> beyond<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.570> the<00:01:00.570> engine<00:01:01.670> this<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
out beyond the the engine this is the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.350 
out beyond the the engine this is the
older<00:01:03.300> WD<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.680> we'll<00:01:04.920> go<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> WD<00:01:05.519> 45<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
older WD now we'll go to the WD 45 and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.609 
older WD now we'll go to the WD 45 and
take<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> look<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.780> side<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.200> engine

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.140 

alright

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
alright

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.899 
alright
this<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.299> WD<00:01:15.780> 45<00:01:16.229> don't<00:01:16.979> want<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> rely<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
this is WD 45 don't want to rely on a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.780 
this is WD 45 don't want to rely on a
decal<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:20.070> could<00:01:20.189> buy<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> put

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
decal because you could buy that and put

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.940 
decal because you could buy that and put
it<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> tractor<00:01:21.470> but<00:01:22.470> let's<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it on a tractor but let's look at the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
it on a tractor but let's look at the
side<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.340> engine<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:25.770> almost<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:27.390> some

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
side of this engine this almost has some

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.990 
side of this engine this almost has some
resemblance<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.350> plate<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
resemblance to a plate but it's just a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.840 
resemblance to a plate but it's just a
Ledge<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.140> casting<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> engine<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
Ledge in the casting of the engine you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.609 
Ledge in the casting of the engine you
can<00:01:32.970> definitely<00:01:33.390> tell<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> difference<00:01:33.689> if

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
can definitely tell the difference if

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.270 
can definitely tell the difference if
you<00:01:34.799> need<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.930> scroll<00:01:36.930> back<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:38.040> at<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
you need to scroll back and look at the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
you need to scroll back and look at the
other<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.610> I'll<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> backside<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
other one I'll go to the backside of it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.660 
other one I'll go to the backside of it
now<00:01:41.090> don't<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.210> confused<00:01:42.570> by<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:44.549> other

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
now don't be confused by this the other

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.300 
now don't be confused by this the other
one<00:01:44.790> had<00:01:44.909> six<00:01:45.090> bolt<00:01:45.390> heads<00:01:45.680> this<00:01:46.680> has<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
one had six bolt heads this has this

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.370 
one had six bolt heads this has this
doesn't<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> those<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.329> then<00:01:49.110> here's<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
doesn't have those and then here's the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
doesn't have those and then here's the
back<00:01:49.590> portion<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> see<00:01:50.729> how<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.909> does<00:01:51.030> not

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
back portion you can see how it does not

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.899 
back portion you can see how it does not
stick<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.600> beyond<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> engine<00:01:52.700> but<00:01:53.700> rather

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
stick out beyond the engine but rather

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.270 
stick out beyond the engine but rather
the<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:55.070> casting<00:01:56.070> line<00:01:56.280> bends<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.790> around

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
the the casting line bends on around

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.280 
the the casting line bends on around
alright
