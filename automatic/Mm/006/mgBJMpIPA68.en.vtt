00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.789 
that you know I'm not gonna make the
games<00:01:33.090> any<00:01:33.390> better<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.770> they

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
games any better because they know they

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.440 
games any better because they know they
can<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> same<00:01:36.119> amount<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.390> money

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
can just get the same amount of money

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.600 
can just get the same amount of money
for<00:01:36.900> minimal<00:01:37.259> profit<00:01:37.740> nominal<00:01:38.340> profit

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
for minimal profit nominal profit

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.580 
for minimal profit nominal profit
minimal<00:01:38.939> work<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.409> do

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
minimal work they know they can just do

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.350 
minimal work they know they can just do
a<00:01:40.619> minimum<00:01:41.100> amount<00:01:41.159> work<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> same

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
a minimum amount work and get the same

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
a minimum amount work and get the same
amount<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.659> profit<00:01:42.869> every<00:01:43.470> single<00:01:43.799> year<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
amount of profit every single year and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.210 
amount of profit every single year and
that's<00:01:44.640> kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.030> why<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.630> downhill

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
that's kind of why it's going downhill

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.160 
that's kind of why it's going downhill
also<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:48.060> they<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:48.810> want

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
also because they just they don't want

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.319 
also because they just they don't want
to<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.860> improve<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> game<00:01:50.939> anymore<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to have to improve the game anymore you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.280 
to have to improve the game anymore you
know<00:01:51.420> they<00:01:51.570> don't<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.990> make<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
know they don't have to make it a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.899 
know they don't have to make it a
different<00:01:52.770> game<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.220> why<00:01:53.340> titanfall<00:01:53.729> is

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
different game that's why titanfall is

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
colleges do not have that good a hit

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.039 
colleges do not have that good a hit
detection<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.639> honestly<00:03:33.269> will<00:03:33.449> never<00:03:33.629> buy<00:03:33.810> them

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
detection I honestly will never buy them

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.530 
detection I honestly will never buy them
purely<00:03:34.439> because<00:03:34.739> it's<00:03:35.579> not<00:03:35.849> like<00:03:36.120> they<00:03:36.269> can't

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
purely because it's not like they can't

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.240 
purely because it's not like they can't
have<00:03:36.840> amazing<00:03:37.379> hit<00:03:37.500> detection<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.099> had

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
have amazing hit detection like we had

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.219 
have amazing hit detection like we had
him<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.489> work<00:03:38.699> for<00:03:38.879> two<00:03:39.000> like<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.329> had<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.199> we

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
him on work for two like we had and we

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.710 
him on work for two like we had and we
do<00:03:40.500> have<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.919> ghosts<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:42.209> think<00:03:42.389> it's

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
do have in ghosts and I think it's

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.080 
do have in ghosts and I think it's
honestly<00:03:43.379> just<00:03:43.470> stupid<00:03:44.099> that<00:03:44.430> they<00:03:44.819> haven't

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
honestly just stupid that they haven't

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.740 
honestly just stupid that they haven't
had<00:03:45.419> flag<00:03:46.199> good<00:03:46.439> hit<00:03:46.590> detection<00:03:46.709> for<00:03:47.310> years

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
had flag good hit detection for years
