00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.569
 square like these 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.089
 which you belong 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.560
 today we are going to talk about the game against Puebla next 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.039
 a courtship that he has here at home 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.230
 if this is so 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.810
 my complicated northern rival in the past 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.390
 tournaments 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.359
 two important matches against them 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.009
 have been round-trip matches of many goals and I hope this match 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.050
 It can be the same and you can get the result that you need. 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.460
 to be in 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.970
 populate a team with trade and can be very dangerous 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.350
 if you tell him that he's coming to lose and everything but I think against blue cross 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.030
 there we make good matches and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.680
 and now it's windy that has good players coming doing things right 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.250
 to the 'best the last matches have been given the results but it is not 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.050
 to trust they can not do 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.110
 very good things and we all need to be very attentive to 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.520
 to do what the coach asks us and be able to come out with the result 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.810
 what players this explosive company imposed 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.070
 project forward or forward times 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030
 very good players whoever I am, I think that's what the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.170
 characterize locke 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 they unfold very well the balls that they have and they go towards lugo there is no other 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.840
 that's what you have to be very attentive and we try to counteract that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.930
 there must be when before you can attack 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.600
 the volume of shortly after turns out a turkey the last matches 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.590
 lack silvina judge doing things well the team is 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.410
 it was fought with intensity also the round trips and I think that 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.230
 it's the only thing that has been lacking 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.680
 returns to the leaks that are offered are presented to us for 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.470
 handle better match in Doha after the result 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 favorable and hence try to avoid being 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.429
 They found for this Saturday 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.940
 a different stadium 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.110
 with this 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.210
 summits fourth part of the market a finished knowledge 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.240
 this cessation 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.180
 not because it does not fail that the Easter people support much more because it is 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.000
 I can feel 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.180
 well with the team is not that the team can do things well so that 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.339
 they feel very much still and that the team 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:13.419
 the behavior that is optimal for people to take cracked when they 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.080
 remove the people we can some show 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.430
 if it's why 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.529
 I took it on that side 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.269
 the other contribution is for safety borg 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.289
 for this reason 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.780
 with greater benefit to them are not any 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.570
 given moment and that your team support what is the most important thing that 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.589
 the team can do things well for 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:33.769
 for those who wish 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.950
 hello cesar villaluz team player blue cross invited them this Saturday at 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.129
 five in the afternoon at the blue stadium
