00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
couple days and very friendly so it's

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.490 
couple days and very friendly so it's
pretty<00:00:33.690> obvious<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.230> he'd<00:00:34.770> been<00:00:34.950> lost<00:00:36.500> as

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500

interested in keeping the cat and he

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.950 
interested in keeping the cat and he
probably<00:00:41.820> ended<00:00:42.030> up<00:00:42.120> taking<00:00:42.300> him<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
