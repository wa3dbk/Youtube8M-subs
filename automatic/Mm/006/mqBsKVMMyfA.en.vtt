00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.350 

today<00:00:00.659> I<00:00:00.690> wanted<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.140> show<00:00:01.620> you<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:02.370> base<00:00:02.790> design

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
today I wanted to show you a base design

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.800 
today I wanted to show you a base design
that<00:00:04.350> I've<00:00:04.830> come<00:00:05.130> up<00:00:05.310> with<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:05.879> incorporates

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
that I've come up with that incorporates

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.110 
that I've come up with that incorporates
the<00:00:07.170> elevator<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:08.010> was<00:00:08.130> used<00:00:08.370> mostly<00:00:08.970> for

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
the elevator that was used mostly for

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.049 
the elevator that was used mostly for
the<00:00:09.660> rock<00:00:10.559> bases<00:00:11.179> I'm<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:13.160> modded<00:00:14.160> server<00:00:14.460> so

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the rock bases I'm on a modded server so

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.170 
the rock bases I'm on a modded server so
I<00:00:15.509> have<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> lot<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.619> resources<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:17.940> able<00:00:17.970> to

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
I have a lot of resources to be able to

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.890 
I have a lot of resources to be able to
build<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:20.150> but<00:00:21.150> I'm<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.480> demonstrating

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
build this but I'm just demonstrating

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.900 
build this but I'm just demonstrating
the<00:00:22.619> basic<00:00:22.920> concept<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.490> base<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:28.910> tie

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the basic concept so this base is a tie

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.720 
the basic concept so this base is a tie
at<00:00:30.510> its<00:00:30.689> highest<00:00:30.990> point<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:32.579> gonna

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
at its highest point so we're gonna

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.319 
at its highest point so we're gonna
start<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.480> by<00:00:33.750> building<00:00:34.790> sighs<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.090> can't

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
start out by building sighs we can't

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:46.190 
start out by building sighs we can't
hear<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.960> obviously<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.040> would<00:00:43.640> I<00:00:45.110> live<00:00:46.110> we

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
hear and obviously you would I live we

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
hear and obviously you would I live we
got<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.500> Miller's<00:00:47.100> billboard<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
got on Miller's billboard and I get a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.750 
got on Miller's billboard and I get a
basic

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.760 

since<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:54.000> playing<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.450> a<00:00:54.480> modded<00:00:54.900> server<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
since I'm playing on a modded server it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
since I'm playing on a modded server it
doesn't<00:00:56.340> allow<00:00:56.640> me<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.900> do<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:58.230> elevator

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
doesn't allow me to do the elevator

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
doesn't allow me to do the elevator
exactly<00:00:59.400> as<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.760> would<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.450> feeling

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
exactly as it would but I have a feeling

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.240 
exactly as it would but I have a feeling
that<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.200> how<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.710> gonna<00:01:01.860> be<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
that this how it's gonna be in the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.640 
that this how it's gonna be in the
future<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.730> rust<00:01:03.000> anyway<00:01:03.450> I<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> actually

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
future of rust anyway I have to actually

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.730 
future of rust anyway I have to actually
build<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.690> mock-up<00:01:07.760> on<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.140> though<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.170> blocks

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
build a mock-up on it though that blocks

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.540 
build a mock-up on it though that blocks
over<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.100> those<00:01:11.310> sites<00:01:13.010> now<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.310> we're<00:01:14.460> at

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
over to those sites now that we're at

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.929 
over to those sites now that we're at
the<00:01:14.640> top<00:01:14.850> we're<00:01:15.090> gonna<00:01:15.210> build<00:01:15.510> our<00:01:15.690> floor<00:01:16.170> here

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939

as you can see we're building

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.560 
as you can see we're building
living<00:01:22.860> space<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.730> the

and<00:04:33.850> I'm<00:04:34.030> getting<00:04:34.210> some<00:04:34.540> like

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.890 

so<00:04:40.190> here<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:40.520> see<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.940> basic<00:04:41.090> design

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.450 

first<00:04:44.560> floor<00:04:44.860> or<00:04:45.190> if<00:04:45.370> they're<00:04:45.639> having<00:04:45.669> came<00:04:46.180> up

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.420 

we<00:04:48.669> play<00:04:48.910> sleeping<00:04:49.360> bags<00:04:49.569> and<00:04:50.500> also<00:04:51.509> surgeons

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
we play sleeping bags and also surgeons

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.870 
we play sleeping bags and also surgeons
first<00:04:54.860> bottom<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.220> it'll<00:04:56.580> notice<00:04:57.000> that

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
first bottom and it'll notice that

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.070 
first bottom and it'll notice that
furnace

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.110 

from<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.349> top<00:05:03.560> of<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.860> floor<00:05:04.129> here<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:04.789> it'll

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
from the top of the floor here so it'll

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.580 
from the top of the floor here so it'll
have<00:05:05.330> access<00:05:05.840> to

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.790 

suppose<00:05:10.540> which<00:05:11.540> means<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:12.110> we<00:05:12.260> can<00:05:12.410> fill<00:05:12.650> up

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
suppose which means that we can fill up

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.730 
suppose which means that we can fill up
that<00:05:12.980> entire<00:05:13.310> layer

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
that entire layer

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.860 
that entire layer
viruses<00:05:15.640> come<00:05:16.330> up

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
viruses come up

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.589 
viruses come up
refill

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.430 

Miller<00:05:21.929> downside<00:05:22.529> to<00:05:22.679> this

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
Miller downside to this

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.790 
Miller downside to this
can't<00:05:23.740> actually<00:05:24.070> see<00:05:24.520> which<00:05:24.820> furnaces<00:05:25.450> on<00:05:25.660> or

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
can't actually see which furnaces on or

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.939 
can't actually see which furnaces on or
that's<00:05:27.490> it

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.680 

so<00:05:33.949> I<00:05:34.009> placed<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.460> fire<00:05:34.729> up<00:05:35.060> here

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.650 

we<00:05:37.990> actually<00:05:38.380> do<00:05:38.980> have<00:05:39.310> the<00:05:39.640> option<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.120> remove

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
we actually do have the option to remove

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.700 
we actually do have the option to remove
these<00:05:41.200> internal<00:05:41.860> pillars<00:05:42.250> if<00:05:42.460> we<00:05:42.610> want<00:05:42.850> to

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
these internal pillars if we want to

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.740 
these internal pillars if we want to
and<00:05:43.919> it<00:05:44.070> does<00:05:44.370> actually<00:05:44.789> help<00:05:45.240> make<00:05:45.389> it<00:05:45.570> feel<00:05:45.720> a

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
and it does actually help make it feel a

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.480 
and it does actually help make it feel a
lot<00:05:45.930> more<00:05:45.990> it's<00:05:46.710> not

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
lot more it's not

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.580 
lot more it's not
so<00:05:49.030> I<00:05:49.090> got<00:05:49.240> those<00:05:49.419> pillars<00:05:49.870> out<00:05:50.080> now<00:05:50.410> you<00:05:50.470> can

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
so I got those pillars out now you can

00:05:50.590 --> 00:06:00.159 
so I got those pillars out now you can
see<00:05:50.949> if

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.240 

or<00:06:00.259> things<00:06:00.560> up<00:06:00.800> here

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:13.719 
please
okay<00:06:06.650> so<00:06:06.800> I<00:06:07.430> put<00:06:07.999> in<00:06:08.419> some<00:06:09.490> windows<00:06:12.370> it<00:06:13.370> still

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
okay so I put in some windows it still

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.600 
okay so I put in some windows it still
would<00:06:13.939> need<00:06:14.150> to<00:06:14.300> upgrade<00:06:14.509> those<00:06:14.930> two<00:06:15.409> stone

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:27.950 

it<00:06:18.849> looks<00:06:19.180> a<00:06:19.330> lot<00:06:19.419> nicer

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.719 

so<00:06:28.350> you<00:06:28.500> know<00:06:28.650> you<00:06:28.770> can<00:06:28.919> spend<00:06:29.039> a<00:06:29.280> lot<00:06:29.430> of<00:06:29.460> time

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
so you know you can spend a lot of time

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.590 
so you know you can spend a lot of time
here

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
here

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.980 
here
I've<00:06:32.600> done<00:06:32.870> it<00:06:32.900> here<00:06:33.620> let's<00:06:34.070> up<00:06:34.280> there

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
I've done it here let's up there

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:50.100 
I've done it here let's up there
fire<00:06:36.500> are<00:06:36.949> your<00:06:38.380> furnaces<00:06:39.699> your<00:06:40.699> storage

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.110 

this<00:06:50.500> again<00:06:51.040> is<00:06:51.310> where<00:06:51.550> you<00:06:51.760> would<00:06:51.820> have<00:06:51.940> your

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
this again is where you would have your

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.550 
this again is where you would have your
sleeping<00:06:53.020> bags<00:06:54.270> let's<00:06:55.270> make<00:06:55.600> our<00:06:55.810> way<00:06:55.840> down

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.550 

now<00:06:59.620> as<00:07:00.220> you<00:07:00.490> can<00:07:00.640> see<00:07:00.850> this<00:07:01.270> isn't<00:07:01.600> the

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
now as you can see this isn't the

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.620 
now as you can see this isn't the
prettiest<00:07:03.340> looking<00:07:03.700> house<00:07:03.940> I<00:07:04.210> think<00:07:04.390> get<00:07:04.510> it

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
prettiest looking house I think get it

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.230 
prettiest looking house I think get it
all<00:07:04.750> upgraded<00:07:05.520> that's<00:07:06.520> the<00:07:06.700> side<00:07:06.910> the<00:07:07.060> point

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
all upgraded that's the side the point

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.020 
all upgraded that's the side the point
there's<00:07:07.900> a<00:07:07.960> lot<00:07:08.080> you<00:07:08.230> can<00:07:08.380> do<00:07:08.560> to<00:07:08.910> decorate<00:07:09.910> it

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
there's a lot you can do to decorate it

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.090 
there's a lot you can do to decorate it
but<00:07:10.980> you<00:07:11.980> get<00:07:12.130> the<00:07:12.310> idea<00:07:12.730> I<00:07:13.000> mean<00:07:13.480> the<00:07:14.440> basic

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
but you get the idea I mean the basic

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.220 
but you get the idea I mean the basic
concept<00:07:15.730> of<00:07:15.880> it<00:07:16.120> and<00:07:16.330> the<00:07:16.510> reasoning<00:07:17.050> behind

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.230 
concept of it and the reasoning behind

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.350 
concept of it and the reasoning behind
it<00:07:17.650> being<00:07:17.860> like<00:07:18.220> this<00:07:18.430> is<00:07:18.700> because<00:07:19.120> the

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 
it being like this is because the

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.510 
it being like this is because the
highest<00:07:19.750> that<00:07:19.930> you<00:07:20.110> can<00:07:20.320> grow<00:07:21.090> c4<00:07:22.140> is<00:07:23.140> up<00:07:24.070> three

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 
highest that you can grow c4 is up three

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.880 
highest that you can grow c4 is up three
blocks<00:07:25.470> so<00:07:26.470> by<00:07:27.250> doing<00:07:27.310> this<00:07:28.560> they<00:07:29.560> can<00:07:29.590> blow

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:29.890 
blocks so by doing this they can blow

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.360 
blocks so by doing this they can blow
out<00:07:29.920> the<00:07:30.190> whole<00:07:30.370> bottom<00:07:30.730> of<00:07:30.820> the<00:07:30.940> base

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
out the whole bottom of the base

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.730 
out the whole bottom of the base
they'd<00:07:33.370> have<00:07:33.610> to<00:07:33.760> destroy<00:07:34.270> it<00:07:34.900> before<00:07:35.380> they

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:35.740 
they'd have to destroy it before they

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.100 
they'd have to destroy it before they
could<00:07:35.800> even<00:07:36.040> get<00:07:36.520> to<00:07:36.910> your<00:07:37.330> things

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.629 

so<00:07:40.680> I<00:07:40.740> hope<00:07:40.919> you<00:07:41.069> like<00:07:41.189> this<00:07:41.340> video

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 
so I hope you like this video

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.399 
so I hope you like this video
I<00:07:42.729> have<00:07:42.969> a<00:07:42.999> few<00:07:43.300> other<00:07:43.419> base<00:07:43.629> designs<00:07:44.110> that<00:07:44.349> I

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:44.409 
I have a few other base designs that I

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:47.959 
I have a few other base designs that I
was<00:07:44.680> working<00:07:45.430> on<00:07:45.550> so

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:47.969 

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:51.799 

we're<00:07:48.089> upward<00:07:48.389> since<00:07:48.659> awesome<00:07:49.229> thanks
