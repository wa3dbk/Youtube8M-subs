 roy somers and nice that you look at 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.379
 new tutorial from zoom.nl 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.480
 and this tutorial I'm going to show you how 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.519
 this effect 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.580
 as you can see this photo has been converted to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.190
 black and white and here in the highlights 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.779
 sevilla glow just to be easy 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.010
 create and call this effect 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.010
 therefore 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.380
 but she and monochrome effect sevilla 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.189
 press m and then command shift 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.869
 f or on for the windows computer ctrl 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.350
 shift f 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.410
 to enter this mode, tap this bar 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.280
 and we are going to redevelop the photo 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.110
 actually being able to work 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.969
 fold in more 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.579
 and I also beat this and I beat this 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 so we actually only do things 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.289
 which we will now use 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.800
 let's see we switch to the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.199
 next photo to convert the photo 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.420
 go to black and white below standard 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 to black and white and already have the photo 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.629
 black and white well that is not yet the case 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.769
 difficult 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.900
 then turn the photo again 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.490
 edit to your own taste I'm going for a moment 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.130
 slightly increase the contrast 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.740
 and the clamart i the brightness slightly 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.619
 more up and whether I always do 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 beautiful in a black and white photo 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.540
 then used spot 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.420
 split shades here at the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.360
 highlights also a block 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.390
 if you click on it you can see this now 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.920
 go over it with your mouse and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 you can see it being high 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.049
 get a certain color well to one 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.119
 beautiful sevilla flirting find out 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.159
 we simply click here and then squeeze 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.409
 you almost always have the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.500
 good color 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.700
 we press the cross and you will see that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.979
 the color can also change here 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.299
 but we are not going to do that because 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.369
 to work precisely 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.380
 just click on this block properly 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.280
 you can put a resume accent with the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.990
 Increasing saturation will get you more 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.500
 color and down do well we sit him 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.360
 around 35 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.370
 I usually find that for most 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.370
 photos this is a nice true 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.640
 now you basically have everything 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.630
 the effect accurate next photo 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.220
 go and do i see stilts and then go 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.930
 we to black and white 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.580
 a split shades and in and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.350
 highlights or 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.510
 in the shadows you can in 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.019
 shadows also exactly the same 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.019
 you go to this one 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.900
 and that I want him here will 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.480
 show a difference 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.060
 so this is a shadow in this is in and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.739
 highlights well it's far from the one 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.360
 different which is actually beautiful and 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.510
 for this photo I find it for example 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.120
 in the shade the best so we do 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.459
 sepia shade in the shadows 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.780
 this can be edited to your own taste well then 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.709
 you can adjust the saturation it up 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.709
 or not 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.680
 now so now we go to great 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.350
 next photo 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.120
 so please own the same you click on 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.519
 black and white to display the photo in black and white 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.920
 and you do the highlights 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.310
 on sevilla and then you actually have one 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.530
 photo to make it even a bit narrower 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.530
 you can make the shadows 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:33.739
 also check another color 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:36.450
 for example green red purple way out 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.900
 what all known effect is so if you 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.160
 close it on blue cloth and we do the 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.220
 saturation a little bit to 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.220
 down 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.269
 I find it personal 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.010
 so nice no they nice nice atmosphere 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.660
 this picture 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.640
 whatever you can do if you and the high 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.880
 lights and shadows have some color 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.370
 given the balance tool with the balance tool 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.690
 between those two things they determine you 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.019
 for example, move all the way to the left 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.980
 you see that the color shades more 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.050
 blue 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.170
 as soon as i put it to the right so here 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:14.099
 so that the highlights mer dominate 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:19.430
 usually at 0 you are fine by now 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.430
 approximately at minus 10 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.870
 well and so you actually have again 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.550
 the more creative and photo we go to the 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.199
 next picture we'll take that first 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.510
 just a little bit of a boost 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.010
 with lighting so reasonably dark photos 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.650
 namely shot out of hand with a 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.419
 30 seconds 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.940
 yes if you do not have a tripod it is 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:43.320
 somewhat trickier 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:46.010
 We put it back to black and white 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.010
 at the highlights 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.990
 sevilla and the damage must be covered 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.289
 you can do blue with the country chair 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.389
 weather will choose a little balance 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.340
 it is just a nice balance 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.740
 you can do another nice thing at the 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.889
 photo shows that we now have weird effect 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.370
 go and you throw a little one 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.370
 vignette 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.900
 then you see that the famia still has it here 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.450
 my trusted is going a bit 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.830
 feather 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.680
 so you see that he is also here one 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.169
 little sevilla tint as soon as i get it 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.210
 so go all the way to the left and exactly 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.280
 same but then with black then it gets 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.380
 that has a blue tint 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.789
 I usually like it 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.300
 with these types of effects if you have a small one 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:39.660
 little bit to the right key that a little 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:44.610
 bit like a dreamy glow 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.139
 have actually had your operation leaked 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.760
 thanks for looking i hope this 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.750
 did you help anyway 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.520
