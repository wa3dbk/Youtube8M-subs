00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
home one of the most important things

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
home one of the most important things
that<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.280> thought<00:01:05.850> about<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.810> way<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that I thought about was the way the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.530 
that I thought about was the way the
kitchen<00:01:07.500> could<00:01:07.830> extend<00:01:08.250> itself<00:01:08.610> into<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
kitchen could extend itself into the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
kitchen could extend itself into the
house<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> house<00:01:10.290> could<00:01:10.530> extend<00:01:10.830> itself

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
house and the house could extend itself

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580 
house and the house could extend itself
and<00:01:11.400> turn<00:01:11.520> back<00:01:11.880> into<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> kitchen<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:13.320> what

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and turn back into the kitchen now what

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.740 
and turn back into the kitchen now what
I<00:01:13.620> mean<00:01:13.830> by<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:14.370> you<00:01:14.940> can<00:01:14.970> prepare<00:01:15.450> food

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
I mean by that is you can prepare food

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.570 
I mean by that is you can prepare food
here<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.230> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> prepare<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.010> actually<00:01:17.370> in

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
here or you can prepare it actually in

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120 
here or you can prepare it actually in
the<00:01:17.610> fireplace<00:01:18.150> which<00:01:18.720> has<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.710> wood-fired

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the fireplace which has a wood-fired

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.500 
the fireplace which has a wood-fired
oven<00:01:20.550> so<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.120> thinking<00:01:21.150> about

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
oven so when you're thinking about

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.480 
oven so when you're thinking about

the<00:02:22.769> kitchen<00:02:23.159> here<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:24.239> use<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.629> a
