00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.439
 in warner bros this means 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:27.510
 say some smart people of 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.210
 this has arisen from a movie one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.710
 movie they do not even know when it's going to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.640
 arise look at this video of the orca charly 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.629
 charly de la warner bros notice the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 date of your life May 27, 2015 what 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.479
 means this friends it means of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.760
 who has uploaded the video at the same time 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:54.239
 that the rest of youtubers were 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.750
 uploading the videos I think it's great 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.850
 that the warner makes a movie about 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.369
 charly charly why then because it has 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.199
 many followers this topic so 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.350
 have to take advantage I've gone to the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.210
 official page that appears here abajito 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.960
 official website charly charly 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.900
 look what's here here is the post 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.950
 from the movie charly charly what 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.580
 they went up on May 28 May 28 what 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.130
 they went up 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.960
 look what he says here soon 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.170
 means that I do not think they have 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.640
 the script will have the draft but not 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.190
 they have the final script because they do not 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.630
 they know what they 're going to do about this they're going 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.460
 to get scared but we all know that 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.840
 this is a face this is like any 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.090
 another movie they have made about the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.110
 ouija etc. etcetera etcetera et sobre 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.030
 other themes of the mystery is exaggerated to 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.390
 what to sell to fill the rooms 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.090
 that this is what people like and 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.520
 I have gone further and gave to see this is 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.940
 of now it is uploading videos of 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.729
 charly charly now these weeks I 've 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.290
 gone to a search first page comes out 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.280
 This is the first one that always comes out of 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.640
 2014 we are no longer talking about 2015 be 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.890
 also in 2014 but half a little more 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.510
 more work as my friends say 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.320
 Mexicans and here on September 11 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.970
 2013 we have one on November 14 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.340
 we have another but from 2011 that means 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.730
 this is because this is not a fashion for 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.950
 now it has become known now maybe 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.200
 have taken advantage of those of the warner to 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.110
 maybe take out a project they had in 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.290
 we will not know this, it is a 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.940
 mystery I leave you this friends and I hope 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.959
 that you draw your own conclusion 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.340
 it's because of the movie it's a face that all 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.660
 We know it 's a country but it's a fake or 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.700
 we are fools all of us who have climbed 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.930
