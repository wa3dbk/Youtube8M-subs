00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.640
 another product presentation of 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.160
 global phishing 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.219
 we want to give you a cat today 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.340
 to present to display and that of 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.679
 Articles 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.710
 the part is pretty awesome because of that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.810
 responds to movement or vibration 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.910
 and of course that has a huge advantage 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.080
 because you can do this style I have here 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 times two variants of the good grip 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.260
 or attach to the route holder and 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.850
 although it will be you once 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.930
 visually displayed and that via the led 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.360
 here at the side 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.420
 you get that in four colors and that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.980
 in white red green and blue I have now 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.800
 here times two to the front of the green and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.170
 in red and the sound will be yours of course 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.120
 also or an acoustic signal 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.340
 you also get over these 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.440
 waterproof membrane as I can find 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.210
 her from very very quiet to ultra 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.059
 set it up so you're there at night 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.100
 definitely also awake from the yes 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.680
 absolute advantage of this to anze pointer 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.359
 as I said, it does not work 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.040
 like a conventional to indicator like 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.470
 For example, you can fight it in the field 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 used as the string would have only 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.970
 over a cog run but her clip 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.070
 the easily here 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.630
 in the world trade , it is often like that 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.280
 the bible has to be complete that is called the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.810
 cord can not run that has 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.850
 Of course here is the advantage that he 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.070
 still triggers and with yes 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.810
 We can participate over the terminal 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.909
 have their very big grip or else 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.140
 thin very very variable switches the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.000
 here on page one 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.390
 and then he is already sharp and indeed 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.460
 You can tell already when I am against 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.729
 type and it is really easy enough 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.340
 just one move out of one 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.549
 Vibration like in case of failure 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.689
 and the bite indicator triggers yes we 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.100
 I do not think that's any better 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.860
 Of course you can of course 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 even with a good bell fish the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.040
 Personally, I do not like it that much 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.200
 which you have often routed him at the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.360
 sharpener mounted so they there 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.770
 then you have the largest possible lever 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.299
 Of course not after the bite 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.180
 that is, during the up 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.980
 bimmelt 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.750
 the route bell is there the whole time 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.730
 this world to display of coffee counter 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.250
 the much better choice as I said 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.440
 you get in four led colors from now 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.000
 she looks at you at global phishing 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.000
 have fun collecting
