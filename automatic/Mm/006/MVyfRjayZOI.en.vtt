know um I had a check engine light on
yesterday<00:00:33.410> oh<00:00:35.109> and<00:00:36.109> I<00:00:36.230> said<00:00:36.469> it<00:00:36.590> was<00:00:36.680> for<00:00:36.859> my

yesterday oh and I said it was for my
EGR<00:00:37.609> valve<00:00:37.940> at<00:00:38.300> first<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.109> then<00:00:39.530> I<00:00:39.739> cleaned

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
EGR valve at first and then I cleaned

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.720 
EGR valve at first and then I cleaned
that<00:00:40.579> out<00:00:40.730> next<00:00:41.180> thing<00:00:41.449> you<00:00:41.570> know<00:00:41.750> um<00:00:42.730> my

that out next thing you know um my
idle<00:00:44.449> is<00:00:44.629> going<00:00:45.079> kind<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.769> retarded<00:00:46.629> it

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
idle is going kind of retarded it

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.540 
idle is going kind of retarded it
has<00:00:47.809> said<00:00:48.079> multiple<00:00:48.640> misfires<00:00:49.640> or<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.690> cold<00:00:51.550> p0

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
has said multiple misfires or a cold p0

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.360 
has said multiple misfires or a cold p0
300<00:00:54.670> muffled<00:00:55.670> P<00:00:55.879> oh<00:00:56.059> oh<00:00:56.600> three<00:00:57.199> hundred<00:00:57.620> so

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
300 muffled P oh oh three hundred so

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.299 
300 muffled P oh oh three hundred so
that's<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.239> multiple<00:00:59.719> misfire<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.010> I<00:01:01.039> think<00:01:01.129> I

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
that's the multiple misfire so I think I

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.040 
that's the multiple misfire so I think I
honestly<00:01:01.670> just<00:01:01.760> need<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.269> change<00:01:02.539> my<00:01:02.600> spark

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
honestly just need to change my spark

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.990 
honestly just need to change my spark
plugs<00:01:03.350> I<00:01:03.800> changed<00:01:04.189> my<00:01:04.280> spark<00:01:04.549> plugs<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:04.970> I

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
plugs I changed my spark plugs and I

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.850 
plugs I changed my spark plugs and I
still<00:01:05.210> got<00:01:05.329> the<00:01:05.449> same<00:01:05.659> problem<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.439> I<00:01:06.619> got<00:01:06.829> a

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
my air filter for the new year I'll

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.039 
my air filter for the new year I'll
change<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.170> PCV<00:01:36.710> valve<00:01:37.040> oh<00:01:37.570> you<00:01:38.570> know<00:01:38.689> just<00:01:38.719> a

few things
minor<00:01:40.159> tuna<00:01:40.640> fish<00:01:40.960> just<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.049> make<00:01:42.200> sure<00:01:42.229> I'll

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
minor tuna fish just to make sure I'll

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.109 
minor tuna fish just to make sure I'll
be<00:01:42.590> good<00:01:42.740> coming<00:01:43.100> into<00:01:43.219> the<00:01:43.430> new<00:01:43.549> year<00:01:43.789> because

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
be good coming into the new year because

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.359 
be good coming into the new year because
this<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.110> don't<00:01:45.560> know<00:01:45.710> like<00:01:46.009> this<00:01:46.159> is

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
this I don't know like this is

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.160 
this I don't know like this is
crazy<00:01:46.549> it'll<00:01:47.060> be<00:01:47.149> running<00:01:47.299> perfectly<00:01:47.750> farm

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
crazy it'll be running perfectly farm

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.600 
crazy it'll be running perfectly farm
then<00:01:49.009> it<00:01:49.130> hits<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.399> certain<00:01:49.640> cylinder<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:51.610> yeah

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
then it hits a certain cylinder and yeah

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.740 
then it hits a certain cylinder and yeah
it<00:01:53.000> starts<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.479> really<00:01:53.659> fluctuate<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.750> I'm

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
it starts to really fluctuate so I'm

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.800 
it starts to really fluctuate so I'm
thinking<00:01:57.109> it's<00:01:57.259> my<00:01:57.409> spark<00:01:57.740> plugs<00:01:58.039> or<00:01:58.250> my<00:01:58.460> um

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
thinking it's my spark plugs or my um

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.609 
thinking it's my spark plugs or my um
coil<00:01:59.810> like<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.920> said<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.130> uh<00:02:01.450> I'm<00:02:02.450> gonna<00:02:03.259> put<00:02:03.500> my

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
coil like I said I uh I'm gonna put my

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.910 
coil like I said I uh I'm gonna put my
obd2<00:02:04.399> on<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.420> see<00:02:05.750> what<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:05.960> says<00:02:06.170> see<00:02:06.649> if<00:02:06.740> it'll

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
obd2 on it see what it says see if it'll

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.740 
obd2 on it see what it says see if it'll
blow<00:02:07.250> me<00:02:07.399> anything<00:02:07.700> back<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.330> let<00:02:08.450> me<00:02:08.479> know<00:02:08.599> um

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
blow me anything back and let me know um

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.140 
blow me anything back and let me know um
if<00:02:10.840> not<00:02:11.260> then<00:02:14.220> how<00:02:15.220> does<00:02:15.280> he<00:02:15.460> was<00:02:15.760> going<00:02:16.060> on

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
if not then how does he was going on

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.580 
if not then how does he was going on
that's<00:02:19.150> probably<00:02:19.570> exactly<00:02:19.750> what's<00:02:20.410> gonna

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
that's probably exactly what's gonna

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.330 
that's probably exactly what's gonna
known<00:02:20.890> as<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> misfire<00:02:21.820> somebody<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.310> take<00:02:24.310> care
