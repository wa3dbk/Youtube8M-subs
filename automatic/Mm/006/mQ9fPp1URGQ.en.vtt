pretty<00:01:33.689> decent<00:01:33.900> weather<00:01:34.229> especially

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
pretty decent weather especially

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
pretty decent weather especially
compared<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> winter<00:01:35.430> anywhere<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:35.790> 60

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
compared to the winter anywhere from 60

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
compared to the winter anywhere from 60
to<00:01:36.240> 68<00:01:36.720> degrees<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.470> go<00:01:37.590> through<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> month

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
to 68 degrees as we go through the month

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
to 68 degrees as we go through the month
and<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> Climate<00:01:39.150> Prediction<00:01:39.180> Center<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and the Climate Prediction Center in the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.480 
and the Climate Prediction Center in the
meteorologist<00:01:40.470> they're<00:01:40.650> saying<00:01:40.979> there's<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
meteorologist they're saying there's a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.819 
meteorologist they're saying there's a
higher<00:01:41.790> than<00:01:42.119> average<00:01:42.229> likelihood<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
higher than average likelihood that it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.260 
higher than average likelihood that it
could<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.009> even<00:01:44.220> warmer<00:01:44.579> than<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.060> on

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
could be even warmer than that on

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
could be even warmer than that on
average<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.259> general<00:01:46.470> throughout<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
average and in general throughout the

average and in general throughout the
entire<00:01:47.430> month<00:01:47.700> let's<00:01:48.270> talk<00:01:48.450> about<00:01:48.600> rainfall

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
entire month let's talk about rainfall

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
entire month let's talk about rainfall
this<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.619> found<00:01:49.799> interesting<00:01:50.040> there's<00:01:50.850> not

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
this I found interesting there's not

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.179 
this I found interesting there's not
much<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.590> El<00:01:52.799> Nino<00:01:53.159> is

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
much going on here and as El Nino is

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.789 
much going on here and as El Nino is
beginning<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.850> wind<00:01:54.119> down<00:01:54.439> for<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> first

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
beginning to wind down for the first

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.990 
beginning to wind down for the first
time<00:01:56.040> since<00:01:56.939> last<00:01:57.540> October<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.710> don't<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
time since last October I don't see a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.209 
time since last October I don't see a

during the winter and early spring
typically<00:02:06.479> means<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.869> will<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.170> cooler<00:02:07.920> than

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
typically means we will be cooler than

typically means we will be cooler than

also drier than normal when it comes to

also drier than normal when it comes to
rainfall<00:02:12.690> well<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
rainfall well this

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.810 
rainfall well this
the<00:02:13.560> first<00:02:13.770> map<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.130> I've<00:02:14.220> seen<00:02:14.460> looking<00:02:14.730> a

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
the first map that I've seen looking a

the first map that I've seen looking a

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
month out that does not say that we have

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.080 
month out that does not say that we have
a<00:02:16.920> good<00:02:17.160> chance<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.520> being<00:02:17.670> drier<00:02:17.910> than<00:02:18.030> normal

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
a good chance of being drier than normal

a good chance of being drier than normal
ec<00:02:18.840> means<00:02:19.140> equal<00:02:19.590> chances<00:02:20.070> meanings<00:02:20.430> there's

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
ec means equal chances meanings there's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.310 
ec means equal chances meanings there's
not<00:02:20.760> enough<00:02:21.000> skill<00:02:21.360> there's<00:02:21.810> nothing<00:02:22.110> going

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
not enough skill there's nothing going

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320 
not enough skill there's nothing going
on<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.770> atmosphere<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.670> skew<00:02:24.030> them<00:02:24.180> one

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
on in the atmosphere to skew them one

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.000 
on in the atmosphere to skew them one
way<00:02:24.480> or<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.660> other<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.110> pretty<00:02:25.500> much<00:02:25.650> on

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
way or the other so pretty much on

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.380 
way or the other so pretty much on
average<00:02:26.280> will<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.700> average<00:02:27.090> precipitation

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
average will be average precipitation

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.540 
average will be average precipitation
wise<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.290> we're<00:02:28.440> also<00:02:28.590> talking<00:02:28.920> about<00:02:29.190> May

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
wise but we're also talking about May

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.430 
wise but we're also talking about May
which<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:29.940> markedly<00:02:30.390> drier<00:02:30.810> than<00:02:31.080> early

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
which is markedly drier than early

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.260 
which is markedly drier than early
spring<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> winter<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.760> typically<00:02:33.150> we

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
spring in the winter so typically we

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.510 
spring in the winter so typically we
don't<00:02:33.300> see<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.930> much<00:02:34.140> precipitation<00:02:34.530> all

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
don't see that much precipitation all

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.060 
don't see that much precipitation all
the<00:02:35.880> daily<00:02:36.210> rainfall<00:02:36.450> records<00:02:37.140> are<00:02:37.380> less<00:02:37.860> than

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
the daily rainfall records are less than

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.290 
the daily rainfall records are less than
an<00:02:38.160> inch<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.520> every<00:02:38.910> day<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.210> month

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
an inch for every day in the month

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.420 
an inch for every day in the month
except<00:02:39.690> for<00:02:39.900> an<00:02:40.080> outbreak<00:02:40.470> there<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.070> 60's

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
except for an outbreak there in the 60's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.280 
except for an outbreak there in the 60's
and<00:02:41.490> 80's<00:02:41.610> where<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:42.000> had<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> couple<00:02:42.810> 1<00:02:43.110> inch

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and 80's where we had a couple 1 inch

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
and 80's where we had a couple 1 inch
rain<00:02:43.500> storms<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.070> we<00:02:44.400> don't<00:02:44.580> get<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.760> much

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
rain storms so we don't get that much

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.580 
rain storms so we don't get that much
rain<00:02:45.390> in<00:02:45.570> May<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:45.810> right<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:46.200> we're<00:02:46.500> looking

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
rain in May so right now we're looking

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.190 
rain in May so right now we're looking
at<00:02:46.860> normal<00:02:47.670> precipitation<00:02:47.970> looking<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:48.960> far

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
at normal precipitation looking this far

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.710 
at normal precipitation looking this far
out<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.620> somewhat<00:02:50.520> higher<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.270> chance<00:02:51.540> of

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
out and somewhat higher of a chance of

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.450 
out and somewhat higher of a chance of
above<00:02:52.290> normal<00:02:52.350> temperatures<00:02:52.980> well<00:02:53.310> let's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
above normal temperatures well let's

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.640 
above normal temperatures well let's
finish<00:02:53.850> up<00:02:54.120> April<00:02:54.600> first<00:02:54.840> here<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.560> we're

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
finish up April first here and we're

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.810 
finish up April first here and we're
going<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.830> finish<00:02:55.920> up<00:02:56.100> on<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> pretty<00:02:56.460> decent

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
going to finish up on a pretty decent

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.460 
going to finish up on a pretty decent
note<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.150> have<00:02:57.330> this<00:02:57.480> higher<00:02:58.020> pressure

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
note we have this higher pressure

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.260 
note we have this higher pressure
building<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.220> but<00:02:59.640> it's<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.790> onshore<00:03:00.000> flow

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
building in but it's the onshore flow

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.330 
building in but it's the onshore flow
the<00:03:00.720> west<00:03:00.960> wind<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.530> yes<00:03:01.800> we're<00:03:02.010> going<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.250> be

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the west wind that yes we're going to be

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.800 
the west wind that yes we're going to be
drier<00:03:02.640> but<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:03.000> will<00:03:03.150> have<00:03:03.300> some<00:03:03.480> morning

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
drier but we will have some morning
