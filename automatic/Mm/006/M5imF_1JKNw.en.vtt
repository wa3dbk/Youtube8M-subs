 how to activate the 4g on the iphone 5 from 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 the procedure is very simple first 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.490
 that the entire phone must be updated to 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.490
 the latest version 7.1 of ais so that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.140
 can configure this option but before 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.090

 leave questions comments 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.629
 suggestions to activate the 4g is 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.710
 we just enter here by the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.530
 option of adjustments we go to adjustments where 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.170
 we come back here we go to the first option 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.300
 it's like the fourth option where it says 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.480
 mobile data and here on mobile data 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.820
 we have the option to activate 4g now it's 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.250
 very important for example I'm going to in this 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.989
 moment is I have the wifi activated I'm going to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.190
 deactivate it so that you see a 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.440
 thing 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.330
 in this case I have a data plan for 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.340
 that 4g works 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.409
 we must have data obviously and in addition 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.550
 in our city it has to be 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.680
 enabled the use of 4g ie the lte 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.400
 besides that and in these moments how 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.960
 they were here up clear 3g other 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.870
 important requirement for us 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.630
 work the 4g is that we should change 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.990
 the chip since the chip that they install us 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.720
 normally or the sim card 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.130
 and it must be special so it can be 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.799
 the 4g remained active here the 4g up is 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.750
 will disconnect the trance is disconnected without 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.390
 however it reconnects to 13 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.210
 because it's because the chip and I have 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.550
 does not allow me the connection to 4g so 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.310
 It is very important of what 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.180
 have them change their chip because for 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.700
 that the 4g or lte works should also 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.970
 change the chip should be special to 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.830
 be able to manage and navigate in that network that 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.210
