hop<00:00:30.510> few<00:00:31.510> people<00:00:31.750> said<00:00:32.020> they<00:00:32.140> wanted<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:32.650> do

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
hop few people said they wanted to do

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.710 
hop few people said they wanted to do
for<00:00:33.100> Easter<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:33.640> it<00:00:33.910> looked<00:00:34.090> really<00:00:34.239> easy<00:00:34.510> and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
for Easter and it looked really easy and

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.660 
for Easter and it looked really easy and
it<00:00:34.810> really<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.170> easy<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:35.890> I<00:00:35.920> just<00:00:36.310> figured

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
it really is easy so I just figured

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.270 
it really is easy so I just figured
instead<00:00:37.239> of<00:00:37.750> working<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.410> out<00:00:38.530> on<00:00:38.860> video

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
instead of working it out on video

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.700 
instead of working it out on video
because<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:39.760> will<00:00:39.940> take<00:00:40.210> 15<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.750> 20<00:00:41.050> minutes<00:00:41.410> to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
because it will take 15 to 20 minutes to

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.920 
because it will take 15 to 20 minutes to
do<00:00:42.100> it<00:00:42.280> I<00:00:42.460> would<00:00:42.730> show<00:00:42.970> you<00:00:43.000> exactly<00:00:43.600> what<00:00:43.899> I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
do it I would show you exactly what I

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.650 
do it I would show you exactly what I
used<00:00:44.230> for<00:00:44.500> what<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:45.010> how<00:00:45.940> I<00:00:45.970> put<00:00:46.329> it<00:00:46.450> together

circle it's a 1 inch circle and I popped
this<00:03:53.180> up<00:03:53.449> on<00:03:54.639> dimensionals

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
this up on dimensionals

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.750 
this up on dimensionals
under<00:03:56.000> Stampin<00:03:56.449> Up<00:03:56.599> dimensionals<00:03:57.579> popped<00:03:58.579> it

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
under Stampin Up dimensionals popped it

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.140 
under Stampin Up dimensionals popped it
up<00:03:58.849> on<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.359> face<00:04:00.400> for<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.489> whiskers<00:04:01.939> I

up on on the face for the whiskers I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.479 
up on on the face for the whiskers I
just<00:04:02.479> took<00:04:02.720> my<00:04:04.359> Fiskars<00:04:05.359> trimmer<00:04:05.859> and<00:04:06.859> I

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
cardstock cut it in half and I boot it

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.050 
cardstock cut it in half and I boot it
before<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:14.930> glued<00:04:15.259> down<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.799> nose<00:04:16.039> you<00:04:16.820> could

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
before I glued down the nose you could

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.849 
before I glued down the nose you could
see<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.389> right<00:04:17.419> there<00:04:18.370> now<00:04:19.370> for<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.479> paws<00:04:21.260> of

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
see it right there now for the paws of

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.610 
see it right there now for the paws of
the<00:04:21.889> lower<00:04:22.370> part

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
the lower part

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.420 
the lower part
what<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:24.650> did<00:04:24.980> was<00:04:25.160> basically<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:26.300> same<00:04:26.330> idea

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
what I did was basically the same idea

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.670 
what I did was basically the same idea
was<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.460> punched<00:04:29.030> out<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.390> white<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.140> a<00:04:30.380> large

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
was I punched out the white and a large

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.420 
was I punched out the white and a large
oval<00:04:31.250> punch<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:32.200> then<00:04:33.200> I<00:04:33.260> punched<00:04:33.890> out<00:04:34.070> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
oval punch and then I punched out the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.550 
oval punch and then I punched out the
pink<00:04:35.120> in<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.560> smaller<00:04:37.340> oval<00:04:37.880> punch<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.630> to

pink in the smaller oval punch and to

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.050 
pink in the smaller oval punch and to
get<00:04:39.800> this<00:04:40.700> curve<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.660> you<00:04:41.870> see<00:04:42.110> right<00:04:42.380> there

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
get this curve that you see right there

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:51.030 
get this curve that you see right there
what<00:04:44.060> I<00:04:44.090> did<00:04:44.510> was<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:45.760> stuck<00:04:46.760> this<00:04:47.090> piece<00:04:47.420> inside

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.350 

the<00:04:52.040> large<00:04:52.970> oval<00:04:53.510> punch<00:04:54.580> then<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.760> punched<00:04:55.820> it

the large oval punch then I punched it
out<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:56.840> then<00:04:57.170> I<00:04:57.290> curved<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.950> edges<00:04:58.480> the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
out and then I curved the edges the

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.620 
out and then I curved the edges the
little<00:04:59.810> tiny<00:05:00.170> toes<00:05:00.650> I<00:05:01.040> cut<00:05:01.580> with<00:05:02.270> the

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
little tiny toes I cut with the

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.690 
little tiny toes I cut with the
crop-a-dile<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:04.610> big<00:05:04.910> the<00:05:05.300> bigger<00:05:05.570> size

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
crop-a-dile the big the bigger size

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.080 
crop-a-dile the big the bigger size
which<00:05:07.700> is<00:05:08.140> 3/16<00:05:09.140> of<00:05:09.830> us<00:05:10.040> of<00:05:10.340> a<00:05:10.580> circle<00:05:10.940> this

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
which is 3/16 of us of a circle this

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.510 
which is 3/16 of us of a circle this
punch<00:05:11.510> I<00:05:11.780> cut<00:05:12.260> three<00:05:12.500> of<00:05:12.590> those<00:05:12.710> for<00:05:13.010> each<00:05:13.160> paw

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
punch I cut three of those for each paw

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.140 
punch I cut three of those for each paw
and<00:05:13.970> then<00:05:14.570> for<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.050> for<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.710> hand<00:05:16.310> paws<00:05:16.700> I

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
and then for that for the hand paws I

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.700 
and then for that for the hand paws I
know<00:05:17.390> what<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.720> call<00:05:17.960> those<00:05:18.580> what<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.610> did<00:05:19.970> was<00:05:20.210> I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
know what to call those what I did was I

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.040 
know what to call those what I did was I
punched<00:05:21.710> out<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:24.010> smaller<00:05:25.010> oval<00:05:25.520> punch<00:05:26.050> just

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
punched out the smaller oval punch just

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.920 
punched out the smaller oval punch just
this<00:05:27.200> one<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:28.570> I<00:05:29.570> drew<00:05:30.460> three<00:05:31.460> scallops<00:05:32.120> and<00:05:32.630> I

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
this one and I drew three scallops and I
