00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
update or if I should just wait on it

and<00:03:57.569> then<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:58.260> s<00:03:58.560> when<00:03:58.860> s<00:03:59.069> is<00:03:59.280> easy

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
and then just be s when s is easy

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.270 
and then just be s when s is easy
instead<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.840> just<00:04:01.109> farming<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.650> randomly<00:04:02.099> and

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
instead of just farming it randomly and

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.230 
instead of just farming it randomly and
get<00:04:02.459> spots<00:04:02.819> down<00:04:03.150> here<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.629> take<00:04:03.780> not<00:04:04.019> a<00:04:04.049> hero

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.290 

tough<00:04:08.840> decision<00:04:09.610> I'm<00:04:10.610> definitely<00:04:10.880> going<00:04:11.210> to

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
tough decision I'm definitely going to

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.420 
tough decision I'm definitely going to
end<00:04:11.420> up<00:04:11.510> taking<00:04:11.930> orange<00:04:12.200> bein<00:04:12.410> out<00:04:12.620> though<00:04:12.890> and

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
end up taking orange bein out though and

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.330 
end up taking orange bein out though and
using<00:04:14.230> probably<00:04:15.230> mole<00:04:15.380> Tanika<00:04:15.920> just<00:04:16.160> because

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
using probably mole Tanika just because

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.160 
using probably mole Tanika just because
the<00:04:16.489> damage<00:04:16.730> output<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.390> more<00:04:17.600> pain<00:04:17.900> isn't

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
the damage output the more pain isn't

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.750 
the damage output the more pain isn't
enough<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.800> all<00:04:18.860> my<00:04:19.010> buildings<00:04:19.459> are<00:04:19.580> just

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
enough and all my buildings are just

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.370 
enough and all my buildings are just
dying<00:04:22.090> from<00:04:23.090> my<00:04:23.210> next<00:04:23.540> three<00:04:23.750> attempts<00:04:24.260> I'm

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
dying from my next three attempts I'm

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.340 
dying from my next three attempts I'm
just<00:04:24.560> going<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:25.040> run<00:04:25.700> our<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.420> see<00:04:26.630> how<00:04:26.780> r<00:04:27.050> runs

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
just going to run our and see how r runs

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.410 
just going to run our and see how r runs
with<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:27.710> base<00:04:27.980> setup<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.610> if<00:04:28.670> our<00:04:28.880> sucks

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
with this base setup and if our sucks

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.420 
with this base setup and if our sucks
with<00:04:30.140> this<00:04:30.320> base<00:04:30.560> set<00:04:30.830> up<00:04:30.920> i'm<00:04:31.070> definitely

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
with this base set up i'm definitely

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.680 
with this base set up i'm definitely
going<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.610> change<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:31.970> right<00:04:32.000> away<00:04:32.270> but<00:04:32.450> I<00:04:32.630> know

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
going to change it right away but I know

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.210 
going to change it right away but I know
this<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.140> good<00:04:33.320> base<00:04:33.500> setup<00:04:33.770> if<00:04:34.010> you<00:04:34.130> have

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
this is a good base setup if you have

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.340 
this is a good base setup if you have
magic<00:04:34.610> towers<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.210> I<00:04:35.900> think<00:04:36.110> it's<00:04:36.230> pretty

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
magic towers and I think it's pretty

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.900 
magic towers and I think it's pretty
good<00:04:36.530> base<00:04:36.650> set<00:04:36.860> up<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.130> if<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:37.370> have<00:04:37.580> just

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
good base set up to if you have just

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.440 
good base set up to if you have just
normal<00:04:38.870> towers<00:04:39.230> as<00:04:39.380> well<00:04:39.790> but<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:41.000> problem<00:04:41.330> is

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
normal towers as well but the problem is

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.830 
normal towers as well but the problem is
is<00:04:41.630> you<00:04:41.810> need<00:04:42.230> at<00:04:42.470> least<00:04:42.500> 50<00:04:43.460> tries<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:44.660> know<00:04:44.810> I

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
is you need at least 50 tries you know I

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.720 
is you need at least 50 tries you know I
mean<00:04:45.080> to<00:04:45.200> get<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.440> perfect<00:04:45.680> spawns<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.490> s

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
mean to get the perfect spawns and s

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.280 
mean to get the perfect spawns and s
that<00:04:47.060> way<00:04:47.180> all<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.450> buildings<00:04:47.810> are<00:04:47.930> taken<00:04:48.200> out

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
that way all the buildings are taken out

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.920 
that way all the buildings are taken out
properly<00:04:48.740> some<00:04:49.070> heroes<00:04:49.400> are<00:04:49.610> held<00:04:49.790> back<00:04:50.060> some

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
properly some heroes are held back some

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.110 
properly some heroes are held back some
heroes<00:04:51.290> go<00:04:51.500> straight<00:04:51.830> for<00:04:52.100> it<00:04:52.160> this<00:04:52.970> would

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
heroes go straight for it this would

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.090 
heroes go straight for it this would
actually<00:04:53.240> be<00:04:53.480> a<00:04:53.570> team<00:04:54.020> up<00:04:54.200> on<00:04:54.410> Vlad's<00:04:54.740> in<00:04:55.010> the
