it right now is fast mags
I<00:01:18.950> like<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.670> CPU<00:01:21.479> obviously<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> keeps<00:01:22.350> your

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
I like the CPU obviously it keeps your

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.850 
I like the CPU obviously it keeps your
crosshairs<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.170> more<00:01:25.320> steady<00:01:25.590> when

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
crosshairs a little bit more steady when

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.649 
crosshairs a little bit more steady when
you're<00:01:25.979> aiming<00:01:26.070> down<00:01:26.280> sights<00:01:26.610> laser<00:01:27.330> sight

you're aiming down sights laser sight
shrink<00:01:28.080> ins<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.619> cone<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.310> can

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
shrink ins up that cone and you can

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
shrink ins up that cone and you can
actually<00:01:30.390> cook<00:01:30.570> scope<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.990> little<00:01:31.020> easier<00:01:31.590> with

people<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> variable<00:01:44.850> zoom<00:01:45.000> scope

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
people like the variable zoom scope

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.139 
people like the variable zoom scope
better<00:01:45.899> than<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.350> stock<00:01:47.070> scope<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.119> a

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
better than the stock scope I'm not a

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
better than the stock scope I'm not a
huge<00:01:48.360> fan<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.570> variable<00:01:48.990> zoom<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.770> go

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
huge fan of variable zoom so I just go

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.520 
huge fan of variable zoom so I just go
with<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.100> stock<00:01:50.310> scope<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.350> switching<00:01:52.350> out

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
with the stock scope but switching out

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.990 
with the stock scope but switching out
fast<00:01:52.740> mags<00:01:52.979> with<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.280> variable<00:01:53.549> zoom<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
fast mags with that variable zoom you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.149 
fast mags with that variable zoom you
can<00:01:54.149> still<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.659> old-school<00:01:54.930> sniping<00:01:55.500> but

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
can still do that old-school sniping but

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.209 
can still do that old-school sniping but
if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:57.240> going<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> quick<00:01:58.710> scope<00:01:59.009> or

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
if you are going to be a quick scope or

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.370 
if you are going to be a quick scope or
I<00:01:59.460> guess<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.030> would<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.270> relevant<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:01.079> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I guess this would be relevant for you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.410 
I guess this would be relevant for you
know<00:02:01.500> both<00:02:01.710> cases<00:02:02.009> some<00:02:02.880> perks<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.240> you're

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
know both cases some perks that you're

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.149 
know both cases some perks that you're
going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.630> want<00:02:03.810> definitely<00:02:04.350> use<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.890> one

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
going to want definitely use is one

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.889 
going to want definitely use is one
toughness<00:02:05.640> obviously<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.509> reduces

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
toughness obviously you know reduces

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.749 
toughness obviously you know reduces
that<00:02:06.930> flinch<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.560> can't<00:02:08.340> stress<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.580> enough

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that flinch I can't stress that enough

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.270 
that flinch I can't stress that enough
with<00:02:09.149> sniper<00:02:09.420> rifles<00:02:09.869> toughness<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.890> very

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
with sniper rifles toughness is very

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.010 
with sniper rifles toughness is very
very<00:02:11.520> important<00:02:12.000> especially<00:02:12.180> with<00:02:12.510> those

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
very important especially with those

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.010 
very important especially with those
long<00:02:13.140> shots<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.070> also<00:02:14.730> dexterity<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:15.900> your

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
long shots and also dexterity if your

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.720 
long shots and also dexterity if your
quickscoper<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.830> want<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.100> Dexter<00:02:17.430> young

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
quickscoper you want that Dexter young

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.430 
quickscoper you want that Dexter young
because<00:02:18.390> you're<00:02:18.690> constantly<00:02:19.050> going<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.380> be

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
because you're constantly going to be

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.950 
because you're constantly going to be
running<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.160> you're<00:02:20.520> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.670> want<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.970> be

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
running and you're going to want to be

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.260 
running and you're going to want to be
able<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.260> aim<00:02:22.440> faster<00:02:23.400> after<00:02:23.550> sprinting<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
able to aim faster after sprinting and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.390 
able to aim faster after sprinting and
that's<00:02:24.420> what<00:02:24.600> dexterity<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.230> does<00:02:25.650> along<00:02:26.190> with

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
that's what dexterity to does along with

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.830 
that's what dexterity to does along with
you<00:02:26.490> know<00:02:26.610> obviously<00:02:26.880> mentally<00:02:27.210> an<00:02:27.360> object's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
you know obviously mentally an object's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.750 
you know obviously mentally an object's
a<00:02:27.870> little<00:02:28.050> quicker<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:29.010> those<00:02:29.370> are<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.550> two

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
a little quicker but those are the two

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.150 
a little quicker but those are the two
perks<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.270> are<00:02:30.390> very<00:02:30.570> essential<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.160> a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
perks that are very essential to a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.700 
perks that are very essential to a
quickscoping<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.750> guess<00:02:33.900> regular<00:02:34.110> sniping

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
quickscoping and I guess regular sniping

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.510 
quickscoping and I guess regular sniping
so<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:36.000> ahead<00:02:36.300> check<00:02:37.140> these<00:02:37.380> classes<00:02:37.950> out<00:02:38.160> I

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
so go ahead check these classes out I

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.690 
so go ahead check these classes out I
know<00:02:38.810> there's<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.080> lot<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.350> attachments

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
know there's not a lot of attachments

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.520 
know there's not a lot of attachments
for<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.850> gun<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.330> didn't<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.870> too

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
for this gun so I didn't really have too

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.950 
for this gun so I didn't really have too
many<00:02:43.650> attachments<00:02:44.370> setups<00:02:44.790> obviously<00:02:45.750> just

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
many attachments setups obviously just

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.100
