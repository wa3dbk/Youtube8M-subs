00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.680 
completely seriously he was obsessed
with<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:41.880> felt<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.360> I<00:03:42.660> should

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
with it and so I just felt like I should

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.229 
with it and so I just felt like I should
probably<00:03:43.230> also<00:03:43.739> give<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.340> try<00:03:44.580> also<00:03:45.060> it's

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.780 
probably also give it a try also it's
very<00:03:45.360> anime<00:03:45.900> inspired<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.519> can

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
very anime inspired and so I I can

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.160
