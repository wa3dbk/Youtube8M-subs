the<00:02:19.989> two<00:02:20.140> surfaces<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.489> scissors

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
the two surfaces of the of the scissors

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.180 
the two surfaces of the of the scissors
here<00:02:22.510> what<00:02:22.900> we<00:02:23.050> have<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.440> whole<00:02:23.650> bunch<00:02:23.890> of

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
here what we have is a whole bunch of

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.890 
here what we have is a whole bunch of
what<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.459> call<00:02:24.730> shear<00:02:25.030> pairs<00:02:25.330> which<00:02:25.570> are<00:02:25.690> just

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
what I call shear pairs which are just

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.740 
what I call shear pairs which are just
exactly<00:02:26.320> like<00:02:26.590> scissors<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:28.180> shafts<00:02:28.480> are

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
exactly like scissors and the shafts are

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.479 
exactly like scissors and the shafts are
turning<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.290> they<00:02:29.410> force<00:02:29.739> those<00:02:30.010> those

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
turning and they force those those

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.090 
turning and they force those those
scissors<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:31.180> come<00:02:31.390> together<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:32.680> there<00:02:32.920> at

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
scissors to come together right there at

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.940 
scissors to come together right there at
the<00:02:33.280> joint<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.140> material<00:02:35.140> falling<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.739> there

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the joint and material falling in there

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.560 
the joint and material falling in there
it's<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:36.430> like<00:02:36.730> having<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.120> whole<00:02:37.270> line<00:02:37.540> of

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
it's just like having a whole line of

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.729 
it's just like having a whole line of
scissors<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.200> whole<00:02:38.290> bunch<00:02:38.320> of<00:02:38.590> people

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
scissors and a whole bunch of people

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.990 
scissors and a whole bunch of people
just<00:02:39.010> snip<00:02:39.160> snip<00:02:39.310> snip<00:02:39.340> snip<00:02:39.640> snip<00:02:39.670> all

just snip snip snip snip snip all

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.300 
just snip snip snip snip snip all
simultaneously<00:02:40.680> doing<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.830> as<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.280> goes

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
simultaneously doing that as it goes

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.979 
simultaneously doing that as it goes
across<00:02:42.519> it's<00:02:43.090> one<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> things<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.870> can

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
across it's one of the things that can

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.949 
across it's one of the things that can
happen<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.620> when<00:02:45.130> you're<00:02:45.580> cutting<00:02:45.959> paper

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
happen is when you're cutting paper

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.070 
happen is when you're cutting paper
you're<00:02:47.470> sort<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:47.920> keeping<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> two<00:02:49.090> halves<00:02:49.720> of

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
you're sort of keeping the two halves of

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.020 
you're sort of keeping the two halves of
the<00:02:50.230> blade<00:02:50.500> tight<00:02:50.860> together<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.489> then<00:02:51.880> they

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the blade tight together and then they

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.670 
the blade tight together and then they
shear<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.510> paper<00:02:52.720> quite<00:02:53.019> nicely<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.560> get

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
shear the paper quite nicely and you get

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.070 
shear the paper quite nicely and you get
a<00:02:53.709> nice<00:02:53.920> clean<00:02:54.250> cut<00:02:54.600> well<00:02:55.600> what<00:02:55.810> can<00:02:55.930> also

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
a nice clean cut well what can also

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.509 
a nice clean cut well what can also
happen<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:56.769> you<00:02:56.860> turn<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.190> scissors

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
happen is if you turn the scissors

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.850 
happen is if you turn the scissors
sideways<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.690> can<00:02:58.870> get<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.049> situation<00:02:59.709> where

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
sideways you can get a situation where

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.520 
sideways you can get a situation where
the<00:03:00.040> paper<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.640> laying<00:03:01.600> right<00:03:01.750> between<00:03:02.170> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
not sheared at all well you can have

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.699 
not sheared at all well you can have
exactly<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.390> same<00:03:07.600> situation<00:03:07.870> here<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.470> this

seven inch gap between each cutter so

seven inch gap between each cutter so
that<00:03:18.640> we<00:03:18.730> get<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> good<00:03:19.030> shearing<00:03:20.019> action<00:03:20.200> at

action<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:17.500> we<00:04:17.590> really<00:04:17.799> like<00:04:17.980> when<00:04:18.160> the

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
action that we really like when the

action that we really like when the

blades are really close together the

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.449
