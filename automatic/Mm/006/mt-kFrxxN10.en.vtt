00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.210
 There's Felipe. 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.040
 we are here with access and four in my 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.020
 foot or bedroom was neither playing 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.820
 show the old one is for you over there 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.859
 useful for those who are having difficulty 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.960
 with in-game naval battles right in this 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 game the naval battles will be ready 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.599
 balance at a certain point where 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.760
 you with the weak ship in any way 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.630
 can win a battle continued the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.969
 stronger 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.980
 no matter the fuck you have to do 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.410
 In other words, if you advance, teach 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.210
 history will pass through places of greater 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.610
 The difficulty is that in more 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 powerful stronger ships will you 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.329
 see that your difficulty will start to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 increase if you are not that power of the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.020
 In fact, your 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.050
 point will be very angry for not 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.940
 even get the board and the ship 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.210
 because they are far superior to yours 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.739
 This is a simple way to solve this problem. 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.140
 this to the next we know that for 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.910
 invade is for board ship needed 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.650
 start a battle with this ship like this. 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.720
 will have to deal enough damage to 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.299
 incapacitate the ship by defending which 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.640
 This is difficult to understand, almost impossible. 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 without stopping and conmebol time to train 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 and it's quite complicated this way 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.400
 unable to pair the boat is 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.530
 if a hull and jump on another boat 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.900
 killing the entire crew making some 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.689
 extra goals for killing ships of 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.299
 towers per barrel of gunpowder then his 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.130
 side and flag and so ship is yours 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.110
 You can use it to fix jec. 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.150
 steal all the merchandise he had in the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.640
 ship are finally connected in this happens 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.530
 very faulty shape even in 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.420
 programming issue guys do not 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.860
 think about this possibility and now 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.079
 can take advantage of what is the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.600
 we know that after starting a 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.700
 naval battle we can not go out there 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.159
 without the battle ending or you 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.439
 escape from the place but you can leave the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.329
 rudder before starting a battle looks 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.979
 and where is the fault or without 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.469
 that you see the same organ is of a level 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.210
 far superior to jackson with you know 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.820
 that you will not get will not have 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.409
 chance with battle will pay and it will 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.659
 send the circus deep ocean of 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.369
 The first thing you do in Faria is helmet. 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.979
 with beautiful ship side hull 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.659
 No, calculate the team fills me up so that 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.670
 You know it 's the plan you're going to 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.560
 reach the ship and very carefully 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.349
 not to beat, not to say 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.090
 seemed hostile, because every boat in the 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.549
 streets or to start a battle if you 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.530
 cause not separate the ships and the 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.690
 its likely that whoever knocks 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.790
 before the battle when you get up there 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.049
 can you put the blame on the population 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.970
 whole bids 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.950
 This when you kill everyone down there. 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.450
 climb up to the towers to kill the gains 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.099
 who are upstairs when you have 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.690
 sure that there is no one else in the 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.420
 boat can make a contribution to your 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.489
 ship and only gives an attack on the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.930
 independent attack ship you give 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.329
 game will recognize as if you had 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.459
 just incapacitated the ship and how 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.810
 There's no more crew up there. 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.209
 you can simply meet the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.459
 extra goals such as zeal destroyed 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.980
 flags or barrels of gunpowder of 60 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.890
 that is, if you have just invaded a minor 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.099
 level 50 which could only do this 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.170
 with an ultra- jumbo ship equipped itself 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.090
 which is to go through the part of the naval battle 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.489
 that is great for training 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.769
 resources to equip your ship with each 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.739
 bord of mer warner which lies to the south of 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.150
 map is going to win from 3 to 4 thousand and they 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.160
 have a cult way of speaking more 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.810
 money and resources for the ship has stopped 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.389
 for example, you can only record this video 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.569
 I emphatically emphasized what ship I 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.980
 vi and the board 156 smaller if it is too much 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.049
 thing and anyway you end up having 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.819
 difficulties with naval battles now 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.829
 You can use these m here to talk. 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.989
 resources and money to equip your 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.879
 ship and more in the future do not need 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.949
 use this here even because neither the battle 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.810
 naval is one of the most 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.549
 ship invasion to the other you will not 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.169
 want to stop doing this in the game right? 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.209
 well the rest is that it just gets fast 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.190
 useful here for you if you have 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.810
 suggestion that something really cool 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.389
 that failure is worth making a video about 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.129
 cesp 4 forte comments below and this 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.760
 liked it or not and if you already know the channel 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.829
 what to do 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.310
 thank worth persisting and spoke 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.310
 to the next
