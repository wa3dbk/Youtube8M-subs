hey<00:00:00.390> guys<00:00:00.599> it's<00:00:00.780> matt<00:00:00.900> and<00:00:01.230> welcome<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.070> sort

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hey guys it's matt and welcome to a sort

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.740 
hey guys it's matt and welcome to a sort
of<00:00:02.340> behind<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.730> scenes<00:00:02.790> of<00:00:03.179> how<00:00:03.300> we<00:00:03.360> mapped<00:00:03.600> on

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
of behind the scenes of how we mapped on

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.539 
of behind the scenes of how we mapped on
runescape<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.500> how<00:00:04.740> we<00:00:04.799> go<00:00:04.920> accurate<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
runescape and how we go accurate to the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.579 
runescape and how we go accurate to the
actual<00:00:05.819> game<00:00:05.910> so<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.750> majority<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.319> map

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
actual game so the majority of the map

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.200 
actual game so the majority of the map
we<00:00:07.799> use<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.160> map<00:00:08.429> as<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:08.910> can<00:00:09.030> see<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
we use this map as you can see the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.450 
we use this map as you can see the
pixels<00:00:09.570> fit<00:00:09.900> felling<00:00:10.349> neatly<00:00:10.530> into<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.860> grid<00:00:11.190> so

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
pixels fit felling neatly into a grid so

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.280 
pixels fit felling neatly into a grid so
we<00:00:11.910> use<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.389> basically<00:00:12.750> map<00:00:12.960> down<00:00:13.139> about

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
we use this to basically map down about

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.200 
we use this to basically map down about
ninety<00:00:13.650> percent<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.040> map<00:00:14.219> it's<00:00:14.610> it's

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
ninety percent of the map it's it's

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.550 
ninety percent of the map it's it's
fairly<00:00:15.450> simple<00:00:15.690> really<00:00:16.109> it's<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:16.289> time

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
fairly simple really it's just time

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560 
fairly simple really it's just time
consuming<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.310> recorded<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> size<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570

have the g on it i took a few of the
maps<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.220> made<00:00:29.340> references<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.210> one

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
maps and made references on this one

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.749 
maps and made references on this one
getting<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> fairly<00:00:31.140> accurate<00:00:31.230> idea<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:32.550> big

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
getting a fairly accurate idea how big

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.819 
getting a fairly accurate idea how big
the<00:00:32.910> places<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.420> thankfully<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.620> grand

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the places are thankfully the grand

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.470 
the places are thankfully the grand
exchange<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> only<00:00:35.670> big<00:00:35.940> change<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
exchange was the only big change on the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
exchange was the only big change on the
map<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.899> most<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> went<00:00:37.440> till<00:00:37.590> noticed<00:00:38.070> also

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
map so most of it went till noticed also

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.340 
map so most of it went till noticed also
since<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.329> month<00:00:39.540> only<00:00:39.660> causes<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> free<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
since this month only causes the free to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.959 
since this month only causes the free to
play<00:00:40.379> area<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> few<00:00:41.129> places<00:00:41.219> missing<00:00:41.820> I

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
play area with a few places missing I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.490 
play area with a few places missing I
didn't<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.540> things<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.809> tutorial<00:00:43.379> island

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
didn't have things like tutorial island

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440 
didn't have things like tutorial island
and<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> jewelry<00:00:44.100> reader<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.149> rather

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and the jewelry reader on it so rather

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.700 
and the jewelry reader on it so rather
than<00:00:45.930> my<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.110> through<00:00:46.320> them<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.649> I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
than my way through them like I

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.110 
than my way through them like I
did<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> grand<00:00:47.250> exchange<00:00:47.460> took<00:00:47.879> another

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
did was the grand exchange took another

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360 
did was the grand exchange took another
map<00:00:48.360> loads<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.110> pain<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.890> scaled

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
map loads it into pain and then scaled

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.529 
map loads it into pain and then scaled
it<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.610> fit<00:00:50.789> over<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> other<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.329> basically

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it to fit over the other one basically

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.779 
it to fit over the other one basically
by<00:00:51.989> trial<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.469> error<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> took<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.640> while

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
by trial and error so I took a while

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
by trial and error so I took a while
until<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> roughly<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> same<00:00:54.809> size<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.559> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
until you roughly the same size here you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
until you roughly the same size here you
can<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.520> fallible<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
can see that this is fallible on the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.490 
can see that this is fallible on the
left<00:00:57.420> hand<00:00:57.570> side<00:00:57.629> I've<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> old<00:00:58.230> map

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
left hand side I've got the old map

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.229 
left hand side I've got the old map
whereas<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> other<00:00:59.399> side<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.879> replaced<00:01:00.180> by

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
whereas the other side is replaced by

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.819 
whereas the other side is replaced by
the<00:01:00.359> new<00:01:00.449> marks<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.870> took<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.050> big<00:01:01.260> place<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.710> took

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the new marks I took a big place I took

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.799 
the new marks I took a big place I took
a<00:01:01.980> big<00:01:02.160> right<00:01:02.370> section<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.940> new<00:01:03.090> map<00:01:03.300> so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
a big right section of the new map so

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.859 
a big right section of the new map so
get<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> fairly<00:01:04.650> accurate<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.510> added

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
get it fairly accurate and then I added

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.140 
get it fairly accurate and then I added
the<00:01:07.110> jewelry<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.159> well<00:01:08.189> after<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the jewelry like that as well after that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
the jewelry like that as well after that
I<00:01:09.180> drew<00:01:09.450> over<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.900> pen<00:01:10.110> tool<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.619> give<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
I drew over with the pen tool to give it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.800 
I drew over with the pen tool to give it
defined<00:01:11.369> lines<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> old<00:01:12.270> map<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
defined lines like on the old map so

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.480 
defined lines like on the old map so
it's<00:01:13.020> basically<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.530> correct<00:01:13.890> size<00:01:14.130> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
it's basically the correct size is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.940 
it's basically the correct size is
fairly<00:01:15.150> accurate<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> best<00:01:16.439> best<00:01:16.860> i

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
fairly accurate but it's the best best i

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.929 
fairly accurate but it's the best best i
could<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
could do what you can see with the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.330 
could do what you can see with the
tutorial<00:01:18.420> islands<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.770> Underground's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
tutorial islands here the Underground's

tutorial islands here the Underground's
especially<00:01:20.729> ferox<00:01:21.090> sewers<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> angels
