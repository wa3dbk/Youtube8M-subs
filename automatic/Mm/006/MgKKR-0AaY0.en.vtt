interior is softer shock absorbing TPU

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.190 
interior is softer shock absorbing TPU
and<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> dotted<00:00:42.420> pattern<00:00:42.780> in

and you can see this dotted pattern in
the<00:00:43.290> inside<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:44.309> shock<00:00:44.610> absorption<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the inside for shock absorption so I

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
the inside for shock absorption so I
have<00:00:46.350> an<00:00:46.469> iPhone<00:00:46.559> 5<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.280> which<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.579> pop<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
have an iPhone 5 here which will pop in

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.880 
have an iPhone 5 here which will pop in
it's<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:48.899> bit<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.379> tight

installation<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.030> results<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
installation but that results in a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.010 
installation but that results in a
really<00:00:51.930> good<00:00:52.890> fit<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.670> comes<00:00:53.879> time<00:00:54.840> that
