00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and I actually like it even more now

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.770 
and I actually like it even more now
than<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.920> did<00:01:34.950> back<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:35.820> I've<00:01:36.509> actually

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
than I did back then I've actually

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.899 
than I did back then I've actually
figured<00:01:37.049> out<00:01:37.259> how<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> apply<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> better<00:01:38.610> what

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
figured out how to apply it better what

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
figured out how to apply it better what
primer<00:01:39.240> works<00:01:39.600> well<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.140> everything

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
primer works well with it and everything

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.359 
primer works well with it and everything
so<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:42.329> foundation<00:01:42.930> calls<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.950> apply

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
so the foundation calls for you to apply

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
so the foundation calls for you to apply
with<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:44.640> fingers<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.509> me<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
with your fingers and for me that is the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.050 
with your fingers and for me that is the
best<00:01:46.350> way<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> apply<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.340> apply<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.030> my

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
best way to apply it I apply it with my

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
best way to apply it I apply it with my
fingers<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.200> behind<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.920> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
fingers and then I go behind it and I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.499 
fingers and then I go behind it and I
blend<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:51.180> Beauty<00:01:51.479> Blender

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
blend it out with my Beauty Blender

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.600 
blend it out with my Beauty Blender
around<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.259> edges<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.399> make<00:01:53.579> sure

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
around the edges and just to make sure

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.819 
around the edges and just to make sure
that<00:01:53.880> everything<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:55.110> seamlessly

flawless<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.869> know<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.110> lot<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.289> people<00:02:10.530> saying

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
flawless I know a lot of people saying

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.950 
flawless I know a lot of people saying
that<00:02:10.800> they<00:02:10.950> had<00:02:11.129> issues<00:02:11.700> finding<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.420> good

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
that they had issues finding a good

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.670 
that they had issues finding a good
to<00:02:13.170> use<00:02:13.350> under<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.550> try<00:02:15.180> using<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.780> Becca

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
to use under it I try using the Becca

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.730 
to use under it I try using the Becca
statement<00:02:17.250> under<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.610> when<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.000> use<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.740> it

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
statement under it when I use that it

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.160 
statement under it when I use that it
would<00:02:19.890> either<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.700> move<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.510> primer<00:02:21.900> around

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
would either like move the primer around

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.860 
would either like move the primer around
or<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:23.040> would<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:24.180> will<00:02:24.390> leave<00:02:24.570> like

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
or it would like it will leave like

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.960 
or it would like it will leave like
splotchiness<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.400> wouldn't<00:02:26.700> blend

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
splotchiness like it wouldn't blend

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.330 
splotchiness like it wouldn't blend
perfectly<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.320> knew<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.860> foundation

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
perfectly so I knew that foundation

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.610 
perfectly so I knew that foundation
probably<00:02:29.610> was<00:02:29.700> too<00:02:29.910> thick<00:02:30.210> or<00:02:30.480> just<00:02:31.380> because

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
probably was too thick or just because

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.030 
probably was too thick or just because
it<00:02:31.770> had<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.400> silicone<00:02:33.770> feeling<00:02:34.770> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
it had like that silicone feeling it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.130 
it had like that silicone feeling it
didn't<00:02:35.340> allowed<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.120> foundation<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.020> move

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
didn't allowed the foundation to move

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.230 
didn't allowed the foundation to move
around<00:02:37.290> my<00:02:37.530> face<00:02:37.710> properly<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.610> purchased<00:02:39.150> a
