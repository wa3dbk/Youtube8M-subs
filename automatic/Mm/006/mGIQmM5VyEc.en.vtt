00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.130
 all boys are j and here we are 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.589
 here finally at the fourteenth 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.960
 episode of the james victory an episode 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.349
 which opens immediately with the purchase of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.000
 aldair weiler goes well anyway 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.789
 Belgian defender of the ajax team of the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.880
 season paid around 49,000 credits a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.490
 purchase all in all very good that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.960
 as I had announced to you anyway 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.859
 it will also be useful for the next team 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.689
 what I'll do is a player we say 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.360
 I liked it short because anyway a 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.010
 excellent keep it as a player 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.399
 very physical maybe it is not very fast 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.590
 since however the speed 69 however 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.960
 does a lot of physicality anyway in the middle of the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.879
 defense a little as a companion than if 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.480
 company as you know is faster and more 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.010
 paid however I decide not to deploy it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.579
 in the first game since I had 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.489
 only 80 in shape and well aligned 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.680
 couple of factual owner that would be 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.000
 composed of company and vertonghen in 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 however it forms the first game this 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.330
 here I said against a team 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.130
 very very strong but I can't find it 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.140
 practically no problem has given 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.060
 the opponent was quite scarce e 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 thanks to the usual mirallas I can 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.220
 however to find much much goals 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.020
 beautiful collective however often 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.600
 difficult even if these shoots at 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.880
 example here as in the case of the 30 were 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.560
 really very easy 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.759
 in any case , my opponent does not 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.819
 surrenders and finds at 73 is me looks like a 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.670
 goal with song and a few minutes later 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.380
 he even finds his second goal e 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.119
 with fabregas for 3 to 2 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.099
 however the game closes here and therefore 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.899
 I find a very very good victory 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.310
 as it leads to 18 points 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.369
 so we are going to win the division e 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.840
 one for the second time in a row the 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.569
 team 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.709
 I really like my belgium 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:01.349
 really a lot and many are telling me 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:04.349
 to buy benteke team of the season 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.709
 I'll be able to buy it quietly though 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.239
 I repeat in a couple of episodes anyway 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.039
 in the second game against one 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.540
 opponent that made me a little 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.329
 angry from a certain point of view 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.730
 because he did a lot of ball possession 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.500
 and useful, however, was poor in defense because 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.569
 look at it left some hallucinating holes 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.310
 here, however, I decide to make a goal of the 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.010
 shit that I really didn't want 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.650
 do but I had the creative right-back 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.060
 50 shooting and I did not trust to pull e 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.450
 since my opponent was creating 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.180
 scoring chances is continuously after i 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.380
 his long ball possessions is that I have 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.170
 decided to score immediately 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.819
 however I find this collapse with 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.069
 lukaku from outside the area the 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.340
 forty-fifth that actually has me 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.190
 given a lot of security and just 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.920
 still 45th I find this second goal 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.470
 perhaps more fortunate than perhaps to the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.270
 second, it really is pure power 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.989
 however it does show the finishing of 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.880
 Lukaku 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.440
 and here comes the best punishment that 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.940
 have you ever done it before 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.190
 I said it was fuchs a 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.019
 bit of episodes ago but look here that goal 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.510
 who made mertens please tell me 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.390
 where can I send this goal to some 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.810
 competition to something because really 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.870
 unbelievable 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.610
 at least for me because I have the punishments of the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.880
 generally not seen every day with 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.090
 an effect so post goal really from 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.190
 type 35 meters really a beautiful 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.250
 goal so put a like now 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.660
 for this goal after joking 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.890
 however also in the next episode 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.569
 you will see a truly spectacular goal 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.010
 with a new player of course 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.780
 new team 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.220
 I assure you that also paul along too 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.319
 where to send somewhere because it is 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.329
 truly beautiful action concluded 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.100
 with a great goal anyway how are you 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.120
 seeing I find so many goals especially 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.620
 mirallas very very fit 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.530
 also marks a goal here again 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.310
 That number now haunts me that number 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.730
 he does n't know what to say 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.760
 here also fli and let's say this game is 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.709
 been a bit the fair of the goal is anyway 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.440
 returning to the speech of before mind 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.600
 that you told me many to buy 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.000
 he instead of martin estimated the season 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.880
 for a simple factual reason for 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.250
 we say for the fact that mind that 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.250
 it changes a lot compared to his 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.930
 suv version while mertens changes almost 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.270
 I went to see even the 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.560
 statistics in play or in any case like 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.090
 they play a little what review you have 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.950
 finally right, as well anyway 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.370
 three that changes a lot 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.200
 while mertens in fact the same as me 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.669
 enough as well as putting people who 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.860
 could become together with the boss 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.650
 really the star of the team then 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.070
 benteke tod's kids cost over 280 thousand 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.540
 anyway criticism would enrich 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.850
 would enrich God I do not know how it is 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.270
 say lol 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:57.020
 however if in any case it would still give a 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:00.800
 much higher value to the team e 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.479
 however I won division 1 for the 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.940
 second time go for the package 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.550
 meeting is unfortunately no one to find 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.210
 smalling and kind this Arabic to what then 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.150
 sells rho it seems a thousand to the star and 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.470
 however it should be a bit of a contract and a 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.770
 bit of physical form that they do anyway 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.440
 always convenient for this last game 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.000
 instead I don't show you all the goals because 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.639
 it ended well 8 to 5 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.620
 but I'll show you a few goals like that 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.330
 just to show you mine anyway 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.430
 opponent didn't have a great team 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:37.580
 he was adept at playing that damn thing 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.580
 should york and scored in all ways is 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.320
 really as absurd as it played a role 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.240
 wrong a wrong module but not 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.350
 I know it was Jesus 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.030
 anyhow 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.400
 nothing the team like I said things 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.070
 speech is complete if not 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.020
 maybe oh well appartement and that maybe 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.110
 I could buy so every now and then the 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.020
 silver player and as he goes 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:05.130
 forward here I'll try to upgrade it with 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.860
 some graft perhaps even bronze though 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.480
 here I doubt any of you 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.290
 asked me to buy brothers of 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.670
 hazard of lukaku but here I do not know 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.250
 when they can be useful in 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.230
 division 1 players of the genus perhaps 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.170
 lukaku the left-back can be me 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.110
 useful since it is very strong but hazard 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.150
 it's not weird what's guys anyway 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.160
 the episode is almost completed I will 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.220
 remember to leave a nice one like a 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.720
 comment 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.270
 and sign up if you have n't already done so 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.960
 we have reached the 3500 members are 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.450
 really happy and not the guys there 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.060
 leave these last goals by bent and that 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.970
 this game is literally 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.920
 unleashed and white tea even where 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.440
 send maybe with the punishment of 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.150
 mertens and of themes also what of it 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.920
 think if you are good at tracks 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.640
 punishment or anything like that 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.920
 in conclusion 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.860
 and then we're also thinking if you have gods 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.470
 very beautiful goals maybe registered with the 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.840
 hd pvr send me what i could do 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.680
 maybe I could make some tops 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.470
 five for example of goals that would be 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.950
 really very interesting and a lot 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:18.920
 fun to do too so here we go 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.440
 see you tomorrow with a new video e 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.810
 with a new team like I already had 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.480
 said he will be an inherited pirani players 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.130
 blue in the form bla bla bla 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.590
 but I assure you that it did not go well and 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:33.310
 tomorrow you will discover everything 15 you see 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.310
 beautiful tomorrow
