00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.510
 Unfortunately 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.460
 I just wanted to say something briefly and that 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.980
 im why i got grade gold award and stuff like that 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.730
 because he explains it to me quickly like that 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.520
 I have worked here 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.380
 found out so erich shows you 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.010
 First what if you are ne cut 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.399
 you take the best field f7 because we 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.920
 then here are still 123 fields weeks 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.420
 we already at their headquarters 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.300
 So who is really nice if somehow 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.980
 yet as nationals hereby struggles on s7 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.519
 because when we take that brings us 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.280
 nothing because we still do 123 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.140
 454 fields until we get there 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 For now , the field is out here 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.160
 always the best because it is always close 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.539
 tuned and so and for the royals 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.239
 It would be just the here 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.600
 That's why I recommend you 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.690
 if you wanted to help that national 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.300
 team wins engaged s7 of so that we 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.580
 all the un riyad get but says 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.780
 Make yourselves fast as her gold award 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.550
 Gets as I actually quite 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.440
 easy he would actually have only 20 rounds 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.759
 or so win with your team that 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.950
 means you need server where your team 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.659
 wins and not you so i have in 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.450
 last time got silver and today 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.710
 today I already have gold and you 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.070
 See, I do not really have many 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.659
 Points since 27,000 you get the most 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.860
 So for the rounds I won 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.299
 you just have to win 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.780
 win round 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.299
 so that here the field is conquered and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.649
 she can not get her good ward 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.670
 out before the round is over and so on 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.770
 because otherwise it will not be for you 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.560

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.909
