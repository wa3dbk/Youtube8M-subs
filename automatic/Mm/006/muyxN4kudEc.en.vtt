00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.970
 the truth is a proceeding 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.940
 very humble very hard worker who comes to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.299

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.460
 boys who come up the first 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.150
 division that has told us that not yet 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.270
 unfortunately he has not been champion and 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.150
 and it would be nice to beat you in a title 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.260
 to all the fans of the america and we 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.870

 play the club world cup but we are 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.710
 aware that we have two tournaments 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.200
 before the club world cup in the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.180
 which is very important to us 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.380
 the local tournament and the concachampions 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.610
 we want to repeat the championship so 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.470
 you have to keep working the best 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.260
 Take your way to get what 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.380
 best possible to December and consider 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.710
 complete team and that we can make a 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.710
 good paper 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.560
 it's not going to be a very very championship 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.780
 competitive have come good reinforcements 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.130

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.290
 to the air want the league be follow 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.070
 growing with a European reinforcement that 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.240
 have come I think it's going to grow a lot and 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.000
 it seems that it is a reflection not the 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.670
 demonstration of what he is doing 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.320
