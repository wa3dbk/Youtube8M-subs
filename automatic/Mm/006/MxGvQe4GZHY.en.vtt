what<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.500> guys<00:00:01.680> doing<00:00:01.949> now<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.190> just<00:00:02.669> going<00:00:03.240> to

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
what the guys doing now is just going to

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.329 
what the guys doing now is just going to
pick<00:00:03.480> out<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.780> four<00:00:03.959> corners<00:00:04.410> on<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.100> tent

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
pick out the four corners on the tent

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.039 
pick out the four corners on the tent
they<00:00:05.850> will<00:00:06.000> be<00:00:06.150> watching<00:00:06.330> it's<00:00:06.750> probably

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
they will be watching it's probably

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.230 
they will be watching it's probably
about<00:00:07.170> five<00:00:07.500> past<00:00:07.859> well<00:00:08.370> when<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.700> started<00:00:09.120> -

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
about five past well when it started -

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.940 
about five past well when it started -
probably<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.960> sets<00:00:10.200> out<00:00:10.349> about

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
probably it sets out about

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.120 
probably it sets out about
so<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.460> God<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.570> new<00:00:12.719> air<00:00:13.019> be<00:00:13.230> from<00:00:13.710> Bango

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
so what God is the new air be from Bango

the technology that we've built into

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.609 
the technology that we've built into
this<00:00:27.119> has<00:00:27.359> been<00:00:27.539> about<00:00:27.689> twelve<00:00:28.109> years<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.560> the

process to get the stage where we've got

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.900 
process to get the stage where we've got
a<00:00:33.540> product<00:00:33.809> that's<00:00:33.960> very<00:00:34.290> easy<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.980> pitch<00:00:35.280> very

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
a product that's very easy to pitch very

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.690 
a product that's very easy to pitch very
stable

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.819 

pressures<00:00:40.540> that<00:00:40.690> go<00:00:40.840> into<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.350> air<00:00:41.590> beams

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
pressures that go into the air beams

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.220 
pressures that go into the air beams
themselves<00:00:42.040> only<00:00:42.610> in<00:00:42.790> about<00:00:42.970> 12<00:00:43.329> or<00:00:43.480> 15<00:00:43.600> pounds

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
themselves only in about 12 or 15 pounds

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.510 
themselves only in about 12 or 15 pounds
per<00:00:44.290> square<00:00:44.379> inch<00:00:44.620> so<00:00:44.860> it's<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.129> very<00:00:45.340> low

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
per square inch so it's a very low

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.790 
per square inch so it's a very low
pressure<00:00:45.760> system<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:47.020> reason<00:00:47.200> for<00:00:47.470> that<00:00:47.530> is

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
pressure system the reason for that is

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.069 
pressure system the reason for that is
that<00:00:48.040> if<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.610> using<00:00:49.059> high<00:00:49.390> pressure<00:00:49.449> say

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
that if you using high pressure say

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.530 
that if you using high pressure say
seven<00:00:50.650> people<00:00:50.680> per<00:00:51.100> square<00:00:51.220> inch<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:51.820> you<00:00:52.329> had

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
seven people per square inch and you had

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.240 
seven people per square inch and you had
temperature<00:00:52.989> drops<00:00:53.230> from<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:53.530> nice<00:00:53.680> sunny<00:00:54.010> day

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
temperature drops from a nice sunny day

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.329 
temperature drops from a nice sunny day
to<00:00:54.309> a<00:00:54.579> cold<00:00:55.030> night<00:00:55.360> say<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.900> 30<00:00:56.170> degree<00:00:56.320> drop<00:00:56.530> you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
to a cold night say a 30 degree drop you

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.329 
to a cold night say a 30 degree drop you
could<00:00:57.519> lose<00:00:57.730> up<00:00:58.089> to<00:00:58.300> 10%<00:00:58.870> of<00:00:59.350> your<00:00:59.500> pressure<00:00:59.739> in

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
could lose up to 10% of your pressure in

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.490 
could lose up to 10% of your pressure in
the<00:01:00.519> poles<00:01:00.760> which<00:01:01.329> we<00:01:01.570> do<00:01:01.720> have<00:01:01.900> multipoles

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
the poles which we do have multipoles

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.460 
the poles which we do have multipoles
and<00:01:03.159> that's<00:01:03.309> not<00:01:03.460> what<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.790> want<00:01:04.030> so<00:01:04.470> with

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
and that's not what you want so with

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.310 
and that's not what you want so with
clubs<00:01:06.159> 15<00:01:06.490> pounds<00:01:06.940> you<00:01:07.119> might<00:01:07.300> lose<00:01:07.570> maybe<00:01:08.110> two

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
clubs 15 pounds you might lose maybe two

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.680 
clubs 15 pounds you might lose maybe two
pounds<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.710> pressure<00:01:08.920> it's<00:01:09.700> only<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.180> same<00:01:10.420> as

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
pounds of pressure it's only the same as

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.900 
pounds of pressure it's only the same as
a<00:01:10.990> normal<00:01:11.259> tent<00:01:11.680> is<00:01:12.160> we<00:01:12.280> all<00:01:12.430> would<00:01:12.550> take<00:01:12.729> it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
a normal tent is we all would take it

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.060 
a normal tent is we all would take it
wet<00:01:13.119> or<00:01:13.360> dries<00:01:13.750> out<00:01:14.080> you've<00:01:14.530> got<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.800> trim<00:01:14.979> it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
wet or dries out you've got to trim it

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.580 
wet or dries out you've got to trim it
all<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> time<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:16.149> it's<00:01:16.300> exactly<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.869> same<00:01:17.050> as

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
all the time so it's exactly the same as

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.100 
all the time so it's exactly the same as
you<00:01:17.770> would<00:01:17.890> do<00:01:18.100> with<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.550> normal<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:19.119> what<00:01:20.050> the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
you would do with a normal to what the

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.420 
you would do with a normal to what the
guys<00:01:20.350> have<00:01:20.470> been<00:01:20.530> doing<00:01:20.770> in<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.950> cap<00:01:21.130> laps

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
guys have been doing in the cap laps

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.279 
guys have been doing in the cap laps
down<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.149> side<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.420> they've<00:01:22.750> just<00:01:22.780> been<00:01:22.990> put

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
down the side and they've just been put

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.430 
down the side and they've just been put
in<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.530> valves<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.070> we<00:01:25.030> keep<00:01:25.509> about<00:01:25.840> separate

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
in the valves in we keep about separate

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.889 
in the valves in we keep about separate
when<00:01:26.830> we<00:01:26.920> take<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.220> tent<00:01:27.460> down<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:28.720> so

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
when we take the tent down just so

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.419 
when we take the tent down just so
obviously<00:01:29.259> oh<00:01:29.410> we've<00:01:29.560> got<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:30.160> know<00:01:30.280> where

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
obviously oh we've got you know where

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.550 
obviously oh we've got you know where
they<00:01:30.550> are<00:01:30.670> but<00:01:31.300> it's<00:01:31.960> not<00:01:32.110> something<00:01:32.440> happy

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
they are but it's not something happy

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.100 
they are but it's not something happy
with<00:01:32.830> their<00:01:33.009> staying

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
with their staying

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.270 
with their staying
technology<00:01:34.800> itself

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.310 

which<00:01:37.730> is<00:01:37.850> what<00:01:38.030> we've<00:01:38.210> al<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:38.840> if<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.080> pump

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
which is what we've al so if the pump

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.040 
which is what we've al so if the pump
falls<00:01:39.590> out<00:01:40.040> yes<00:01:40.370> come<00:01:40.820> out<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.450> then<00:01:41.630> what<00:01:41.960> we

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
falls out yes come out and then what we

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.600 
falls out yes come out and then what we
take<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.350> takedown<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.770> we'll<00:01:43.010> see<00:01:43.190> how<00:01:43.430> easy

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
take the takedown and we'll see how easy

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.540

five<00:03:34.800> past<00:03:35.130> I've<00:03:35.610> got<00:03:35.790> exactly<00:03:36.090> rough<00:03:36.390> that

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
five past I've got exactly rough that

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.440 
five past I've got exactly rough that
one<00:03:36.900> -<00:03:37.320> that's<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.620> ten<00:03:37.830> up<00:03:38.070> in<00:03:38.340> five<00:03:39.000> minutes

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
one - that's the ten up in five minutes

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.050 
one - that's the ten up in five minutes
now<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:39.989> few<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.709> first<00:03:40.950> I'm<00:03:41.130> doing<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.610> it

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
now a few of the first I'm doing that it

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.900 
now a few of the first I'm doing that it
might<00:03:42.270> take<00:03:42.570> me<00:03:42.780> 10<00:03:43.410> minutes<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.459> put<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.790> up

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
might take me 10 minutes to put it up

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.390 
might take me 10 minutes to put it up
now<00:03:45.900> cover<00:03:46.170> things<00:03:46.440> have<00:03:46.620> come<00:03:46.770> up<00:03:46.830> on<00:03:47.130> some<00:03:47.370> of

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
now cover things have come up on some of

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.880 
now cover things have come up on some of
the<00:03:47.700> internet<00:03:48.450> forums<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.959> challenges<00:03:49.470> there

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
the internet forums and challenges there

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.000 
the internet forums and challenges there
must<00:03:50.190> be<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> catch<00:03:50.850> it's<00:03:51.720> sewing<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.620> up<00:03:52.709> what's

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
must be a catch it's sewing it up what's

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.100 
must be a catch it's sewing it up what's
the<00:03:53.100> catch

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
the catch

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.270 
the catch
and<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.650> put<00:03:54.830> it<00:03:54.920> away<00:03:55.010> well

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
and you put it away well

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.520 
and you put it away well
the<00:03:56.760> reverse<00:03:57.000> sequence<00:03:57.270> is<00:03:57.810> probably<00:03:58.260> quicker

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
the reverse sequence is probably quicker

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.430 
the reverse sequence is probably quicker
than<00:03:59.310> actually<00:03:59.640> putting<00:03:59.850> it<00:04:00.030> up<00:04:00.210> so<00:04:00.930> what

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
than actually putting it up so what

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.110 
than actually putting it up so what
we'll<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.920> guys<00:04:02.070> are<00:04:02.280> now<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.730> bend

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
we'll do is the guys are now just bend

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.360 
we'll do is the guys are now just bend
down<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.690> take<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.290> valves<00:04:04.620> out<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.250> what

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
down and take the valves out and what

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.820 
down and take the valves out and what
you're<00:04:05.550> here<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.380> explodes<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.710> air

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
you're here is and explodes that the air

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.190 
you're here is and explodes that the air
exhausted<00:04:08.670> through<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.970> jews<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.840> reason

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
exhausted through the jews the reason

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.810 
exhausted through the jews the reason
that<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.710> air<00:04:10.800> that<00:04:10.950> comes<00:04:11.160> with<00:04:11.400> PBS

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
that is that the air that comes with PBS

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.420 
that is that the air that comes with PBS
which<00:04:12.630> allows<00:04:12.930> snakes<00:04:13.410> then<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.130> followed

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
which allows snakes then to be followed

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.710 
which allows snakes then to be followed
it<00:04:14.520> up<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:15.180> put<00:04:15.390> away

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.840 

so<00:04:18.320> this<00:04:18.590> particular<00:04:18.830> one<00:04:19.040> is<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.370> six-person

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
so this particular one is the six-person

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.450 
so this particular one is the six-person
