about 10 or 11 pounds I found I found a
couple<00:00:38.170> of<00:00:38.350> about<00:00:38.590> eleven<00:00:38.950> pounds<00:00:39.130> there

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
couple of about eleven pounds there

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.390 
couple of about eleven pounds there
before<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.260> we've<00:00:41.380> got<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.650> fat<00:00:41.860> cop<00:00:42.130> side

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
before so we've got the fat cop side

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.580 
before so we've got the fat cop side
here<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.760> can<00:00:45.940> see<00:00:46.210> here<00:00:46.660> that<00:00:47.079> the

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
here and then you can see here that the

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.880 
here and then you can see here that the
grain<00:00:48.280> is<00:00:48.730> going<00:00:49.410> horizontally<00:00:50.410> around<00:00:50.680> this

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
grain is going horizontally around this

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.520 
grain is going horizontally around this
way<00:00:51.100> so<00:00:51.160> when<00:00:51.640> we're<00:00:51.789> done<00:00:51.989> cooking<00:00:52.989> this<00:00:53.260> guy

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
way so when we're done cooking this guy

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.330 
way so when we're done cooking this guy
will<00:00:53.890> be<00:00:54.039> slicing<00:00:55.649> opposite<00:00:56.649> direction<00:00:57.010> this

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
will be slicing opposite direction this

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.920 
will be slicing opposite direction this
way<00:00:57.579> so<00:00:57.640> that's<00:00:57.879> very<00:00:58.180> important<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.750> always

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
way so that's very important to always

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.660 
way so that's very important to always
take<00:00:59.260> notice<00:00:59.530> of<00:00:59.739> which<00:00:59.920> way<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.250> grain<00:01:00.489> is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
take notice of which way the grain is

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.540 
take notice of which way the grain is
going<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:02.320> I<00:01:02.350> like<00:01:02.590> to<00:01:02.739> do<00:01:02.890> some<00:01:03.280> people
