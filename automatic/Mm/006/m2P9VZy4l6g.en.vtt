00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.759
 hello my dear friends and warmly 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.980
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.199
 my channel gmx.de today it's about 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 five things you might still have 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.410
 did not know about the minecraft 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.140
 Playstation 3 edition this is one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.699
 small facts series or tip series the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.050
 I would like to introduce, of course 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.980
 always on your reaction 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.990
 I have been around many times 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.880
 asked if I could do something 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.560
 So that would be so martin five facts 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 So every time I follow one 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.160
 from this fact series upload all 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.610
 Tips could be called as one 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.309
 would like to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.690
 while that's always five facts or five 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.730
 Tips or five things you do not 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.320
 Of course, as I said before, I knew it 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.270
 your reaction to so if you like that 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.620
 want to see or see more often 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.969
 the video a thumbs up and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.379
 if you have any facts 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.670
 of course you also in the comments 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.379
 Maybe I'll do that too 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.120
 a form where he will send me 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.680
 but can be very good if you are still 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.719
 the console refers because there are enough 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.340
 youtuber that on the pc to pc already 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.989
 make minecraft is as good as clear 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.670
 identical from now that it is on the pc 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.559
 Of course, there are more features 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.240
 will also give some things it only 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.530
 on the console will give by therefore is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.630
 it is very practical and then too 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.060
 even if here in this day 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.430
 i believe only 1 or a fact 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.140
 it only works on the console 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.850
 It's difficult as I said my quasi 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.530
 identical what the art what the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 Indian sun go and so on the action 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.310
 but I'm just trying on that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.960
 focus on console versions and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.090
 I laber not great for the event to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.100
 even with the first fact on it and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.509
 dying from now on 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 we only use it for ourselves 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.070
 in the eye or a potion of the expensive 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 is rebutted by paying the wage tax 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.810
 to make wage stop but did you know 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.790
 that one single wage died in 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.409
 The one in the oven is five blocks 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.759
 Melt cooking or water always 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.159
 So I could do it for example 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.869
 throw twelve iron ore into an oven and 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.549
 I could be twelve with a wage stop 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.320
 blocks or two iron ore blocks 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.329
 Of course that would melt with everyone 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.189
 block same example works with twelve 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.840
 vice stones or twelve raw 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.310
 meat that would work the same way 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.780
 So you see it in the background when I am 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.000
 you can throw in a wage stop 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.740
 so that twelve burn function and also cook 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.740
 or fulfill melting functions 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.820
 Yes 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.820
 ala 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.189
 picture ap / christian zinc sloboda age of 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.189
 mass destruction 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.140
 since the 90's the electrons were added 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.030
 with the electrons we can place 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.189
 place a coffer and space as 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.250
 a trophy as an example 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.500
 and if there is a certain place in 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.209
 number of materials to do in the chest 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.349
 but we have since these materials also 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.909
 in the chest 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.260
 that is just a change rudis very much 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.420
 Practical powers I believe with 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.359
 obsidian and an end eye and wemmel 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.099
 dismantle this chest with care 1 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.870
 We can backpack you as a kind 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.700
 use it when we use it with a normal one 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.650
 picking it up breaks down dialogic 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.989
 again in obsidian blocks and in 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.359
 an eye logical but it even comes 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.650
 now whether they are ancient and practical 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.659
 At this backpack we have the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.459
 all the inventories when it comes to 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.870
 For example, the torches or eat out 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.549
 is probably just the chest out 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.290
 somewhere they take us 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.849
 materials from the Torau animals 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.959
 need and then build again 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.970
 weigh the pickaxe as I said 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.500
 cautiousness 1 must be there otherwise 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.180
 that breaks down as I said that's it 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.979
 practical because we get us then eg 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.479
 From the box a few torches and something 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.280
 to eat and then we build the whole 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.690
 again and cultures, there are currently 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.370
 we have a double, so to speak 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.810
 Inventory the whole time doing what mine 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.250
 opinion is very practical and also 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.650
 a very important tip you also the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.989
 would have to spoil and as I said changes 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.639
 and you save with obsidian and one 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.319
 So, the end of your eye should not be quite whole 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.329
 to be so heavy and yes that was 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.069
 fekter moto2 reddot effect is mine 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.959
 opinion also very interesting because 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.849
 if a hit from a skeleton 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.859
 Rob is shot this crib one 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.629
 record called mallory this 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.729
 you only get melody vinyl record 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.169
 So this traffic happens 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:00.519
 is very rare that a war of 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.319
 a skeleton is shot but if 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.879
 once it happens the chance is 100 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.260
 percent or is the chance at 100 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.930
 percent that crib one 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.489
 vinyl record rob called melody and for 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.319
 the people who are interested in it like this 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.000
 sound record sounds in those 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.780
 if I just play you or the one 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.370
 I'm just a little one 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.370
 Detail of this record 1 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.860
 yes, the fourth effect at the same time 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.360
 a small look on the console and 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.310
 Although if you have a beacon directly 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.840
 side by side portal placed briefly 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.610
 before you go in one more block from 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.440
 the nice portal degrades that goes 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.600
 of course only creative mode and 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.820
 Income the complete design of the new 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.380
 could change portals times an accurate 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.150
 upload tutorial yet but you 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.860
 See it when you wake up then the timing 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.140
 as I said it is in the online mode 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.700
 and the creative mode i believe in 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.320
 Survival mode would be the whole game too 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.810
 difficult therefore ye see that a 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.460
 nice portal still active but complete 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.290
 Of course, without a frame could build a reason 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.210
 what you want, it is also always the 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.710
 most important, therefore, the most important thing about them 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.320
 effect and on this glitsch is that 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.000
 right next to it 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.670
 nice portal a beacon is a 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.890
 active beacon and the only one 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.300
 deficient in this lightning is that one 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.350
 now the sea ​​that was not there unfortunately 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.970
 can use more 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.560
 because we'll see you when you 're there 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.450
 you can not go into it anymore 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.220
 Ether succeeded it is unfortunately only one 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.110
 small decorations gritsch the but 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.150
 in my opinion is very funny and 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.160
 Still worth it here in this effect 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.960
 series to be just fifth and last 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.090
 Effect is in my opinion also very 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.370
 interesting because with the help of a pearl 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.780
 you can go outside the neckars 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.880
 You only have to squeak 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.140
 a highest place of the neckar and where 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.940
 is the bedrock blog one can 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.500
 logically do not mine brown 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.720
 you just have to with the 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.400
 novelle look at l2 press the 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.080
 throw chapel and then you end up 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.490
 even on the roof of the neckar and 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.200
 You can then do whatever you want 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.210
 actually the perfect place for it 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.490
 Making a xp form that many do 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.200
 youtube youtube already do that many 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.450
 Minecraft players in any case and 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.010
 You can also get a new one up there 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.320
 Mainboard so you always 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.570
 when we go to the neckar in total 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.120
 always that and and yes what he does is 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.590
 as I said your thing 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.210
 in the case in my opinion one 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.370
 very interesting effect you know 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.110
 should or should know and therefore also 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.550
 should take advantage of that was it too 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.290
 already for the first episode of this 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.330
 effect series as I said who's source 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.070
 continue to want to see with newer fixie 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.900
 but as I said only on the console 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.880
 I'm drawn white this sequence points 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.320
 he was referring to the pc version i 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.760
 do not know if that with the head portal 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.340
 Also on the pc so does the 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.870
 currently that you are the frame of 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.310
 I do not know how to change city portals 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.470
 I try to to this edge 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.000
 put and nofx find out the only 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.680
 to hit the console that is 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.150
 of course very difficult but me 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.979
 try my best and i hope 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.199
 Of course, this is the same series for you 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.970
 I also like to make out 15 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:20.460
 of course depends on your support 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.139
 from so yes as I said if you do that 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.550
 you still want to see the video 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.810
 a thumbs up writes quietly 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.190
 the things in the comments effect 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.900
 by comments maybe not
