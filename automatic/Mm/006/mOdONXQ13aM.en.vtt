huh good little tip our info um right
here<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.759> driver<00:00:06.000> side<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.420> can<00:00:06.540> have<00:00:06.690> two

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
here on the driver side you can have two

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.790 
here on the driver side you can have two
home<00:00:07.730> two<00:00:08.730> connectors<00:00:09.320> ones<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.469> me<00:00:10.559> black

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
home two connectors ones with me black

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.740 
home two connectors ones with me black
ones<00:00:11.040> would<00:00:11.160> be<00:00:11.190> gray<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.849> gray<00:00:11.880> ones<00:00:12.330> for<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
ones would be gray the gray ones for the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.240 
ones would be gray the gray ones for the
ABS<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.559> black<00:00:13.769> ones<00:00:14.009> for<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.309> brakes<00:00:16.070> as<00:00:17.070> you

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
ABS the black ones for the brakes as you

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.290 
ABS the black ones for the brakes as you
can<00:00:17.460> see<00:00:17.730> I'm<00:00:18.270> doing<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.660> brake<00:00:18.869> job<00:00:20.300> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
can see I'm doing the brake job the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.890 
can see I'm doing the brake job the
sensors<00:00:21.750> out<00:00:22.910> that's<00:00:23.910> how<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> old<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.720> looks

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
sensors out that's how the old one looks

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.740 
sensors out that's how the old one looks
like<00:00:25.109> here's<00:00:26.010> how<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.250> new<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.640> looks<00:00:26.670> like

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.310 

so<00:00:33.750> that's<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.750> slap<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.870> some<00:00:36.930> brake

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
so that's that I slap on some brake

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.700 
so that's that I slap on some brake
cream<00:00:37.620> oh<00:00:37.770> yeah<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:42.120> break<00:00:42.989> sensors<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.559> only

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
cream oh yeah so break sensors are only

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.580 
cream oh yeah so break sensors are only
on<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.129> side<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.260> passenger<00:00:46.260> side<00:00:46.410> is

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so this is the passenger side this is

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.910 
so this is the passenger side this is
how<00:01:37.380> we'll<00:01:37.560> look<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.579> one<00:01:38.790> arm<00:01:39.030> sensor

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
how we'll look this was one arm sensor

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.429 
how we'll look this was one arm sensor
and<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.250> sensor<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:42.119> gonna<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.600> great

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and the sensor is gonna be great

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:51.740 
and the sensor is gonna be great
we<00:01:43.560> should<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.979> great

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.840 

okay<00:01:52.750> there<00:01:52.930> we<00:01:53.049> go<00:01:53.080> see<00:01:54.009> this<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.549> great

okay there we go see this is a great

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.609 
okay there we go see this is a great
sensor<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:56.740> for<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.159> ABS<00:01:58.290> then<00:01:59.290> you<00:01:59.409> be<00:01:59.590> a

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
sensor it's for the ABS then you be a

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.270 
sensor it's for the ABS then you be a
sensor<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.299> just<00:02:01.509> want<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.750> show<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:01.990> on<00:02:02.890> the
