00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.799
 hello patrick and hello there 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.230
 here is the shock team that will do 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.209
 advance this magnificent car and 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.620
 try to erase I believe patrick the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.590
 bad memories of last year's 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:48.549
 rally the targets since it's going to be 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.379
 pretty brief last year so that's 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.819
 what is it and it's true that a lot 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.260
 of horses in these is the fat 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.599
 cavalry on it so we're a little 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.340
 control them or not but that's when 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:03.519
 not even too much experience ignites 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:11.470
 and then the pressure is the same the fault 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:12.480
 experience chin in all hope so 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.620
 it means pilots 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.980
 the first time wins while there 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.870
 see the trust 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.909
 yes the voice the car is ready or not 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.930
 to the car and that's it it's doing it 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.739
 this year's first laps 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.250
 or no, you can not train or 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.250
 no 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.390
 time is okay modest landing of 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.100
 his car but here it is the match that 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.370
 I have the old kg in New York 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.830
 I bought his mechanics and with 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.560
 etienne who helped at the beginning we all 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.180
 hesitates here we are staged 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.170
 in front of a box because he did everything 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.090
 Okay 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.580
 it's good, it's good 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.060
 a passion who who really takes 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.690
 a lot of time in doses of your work 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.840
 I'm still a little surprised 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.070
 that the free time the password is 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.670
 to do mechanics when the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:17.730
 mechanics game talent is little Sebastian 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:23.730

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:25.680
 club he has here in the garage absolutely 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.700
 so history etienne dubois a little 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.700

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.740

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.520

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.520
 bodywork the polyester that master 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.710
 it's good patrick so his sims and 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.840
 if they give in a little while a small 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.500
 little more than a week a little more 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.880
 of a week the bomber 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.500

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:20.190

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:22.500

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.050
