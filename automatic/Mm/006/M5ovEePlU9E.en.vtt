00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 nice guys here sector and welcome back 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.339
 this new commentaries before 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.379
 starting with the topic is true e 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.570
 I really wanted to inform you that 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.280
 images that you will not see 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.440
 will be made by me but by a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.299
 but this is my American boy 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.619
 notice it doesn't matter since what 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.240
 I want to show you what I want 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.640
 make you understand through these images 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.330
 it is what really affects the connection 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.250
 on black ops 2 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.140
 of course this test was 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 then performed by two different consoles 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 it was not a shared screen 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.920
 consequence also from two connections 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.719
 different said that we leave immediately with 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 in the first clip where we can see 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.710
 that the player 1 or the one in the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.050
 top of the screen already has 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.270
 under player 2 while it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.370
 he doesn't even see prayer 132 like 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.510
 reported by the writings above that me 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.210
 sorry but I could not remove 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.890
 of a 133 millisecond delay 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.110
 late than in the world of online 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.050
 especially in a fps as can be 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.160
 call of duty makes a lot of difference 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.989
 precisely because as these demonstrate 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.359
 images that a good possession 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.649
 connection first sees the enemy one 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.870
 once you have turned the corner then 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.369
 benefits in many circumstances 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.439
 now for those who have doubts why 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.790
 still did n't understand what it was in 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.659
 able to make the connection on this 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.700
 call of Duty 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.920
 I hope that with these images some 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.049
 doubt any questions if he can 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.610
 raise because it improves boys admit 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.990
 sorry to say black ops 2 is a 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.299
 great game but with a great deal 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.189
 lack of connection 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.600
 unfortunately it is not a video game that is not 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.640
 more based on the life of a player 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.680
 but it is based on the connection to 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.880
 own provision and therefore for me 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.439
 this is not a game and in my opinion more 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.000
 it goes on and more so but me 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.829
 I hope for you and I hope I'm wrong 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.860
 absolutely because otherwise he would not have 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.329
 more sense then it wouldn't even have us 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.189
 you buy the games even from these 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.140
 images we can see as in 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.610
 screen below the successful player a 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.960
 see the enemy while in the side of 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.490
 above we can see that still ne 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.570
 mykonos tip therefore there is a slowness 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 that a huge lake is this 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.509
 interferes goes to influence a lot 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.060
 in player score results 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.350
 is in my opinion if he does not know if he still does not 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.280
 you have taken this game if you do not have 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.350
 a good connection 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 my advice absolutely is that 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.160
 not to take it from these last farms 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.450
 which we can see as in the part of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.890
 below the screen 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.599
 the player is now on his feet 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.470
 while in the upper part we can 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.450
 note that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.060
 it is therefore almost still on its knees 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.450
 slowness will really come in boys 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.100
 immense 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.780
 I hope with these images sum of 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.640
 have made to understand how much it really is 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.620
 the connection on how much is important 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.150
 really can affect a result 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.070
 in a determined game 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.320
 performance so maybe below and 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.580
 leave me some comments you know what 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.200
 think of it 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.940
 having said that, guys, I'll finish this one 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.860
 this video is quite important for 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.820
 what concerns me I hope he lived 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.070
 liked I hope it can be 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.840
 so interesting result 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.840
 let me like you already champions
