00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
that looks pretty active to me we're

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.160 
that looks pretty active to me we're
about<00:02:48.010> eight<00:02:48.310> kilometers<00:02:48.640> from<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.599> volcano

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
about eight kilometers from the volcano

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.929 
about eight kilometers from the volcano
and<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.470> erupting<00:02:50.920> rocks<00:02:51.129> might<00:02:51.459> look<00:02:51.640> small

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
and the erupting rocks might look small

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.149 
and the erupting rocks might look small
but<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.720> largest<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.470> them<00:02:53.620> are<00:02:53.769> actually<00:02:54.129> the

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
but the largest of them are actually the

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.490

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.460 
crust of only 10 kilometers thickness
inside<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.610> crust<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.840> mantle

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.830 

but<00:05:15.040> why<00:05:15.310> does<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.700> mantle<00:05:16.120> melt<00:05:16.450> when<00:05:16.720> it's

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
but why does the mantle melt when it's

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.170 
but why does the mantle melt when it's
drawn<00:05:17.260> upwards<00:05:17.770> into<00:05:18.010> the<00:05:18.100> space<00:05:18.430> created<00:05:19.150> by

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.930 
drawn upwards into the space created by
the<00:05:19.390> plates<00:05:19.980> basic<00:05:20.980> science<00:05:21.340> states<00:05:21.610> that<00:05:21.820> if

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
the plates basic science states that if

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.510 
the plates basic science states that if
you<00:05:22.060> reduce<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.750> pressure<00:05:23.380> of<00:05:23.740> anything<00:05:24.280> its

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
you reduce the pressure of anything its

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.790 
you reduce the pressure of anything its
melting<00:05:25.240> point<00:05:25.510> will<00:05:25.690> also<00:05:26.140> be<00:05:26.290> reduced<00:05:26.470> or

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
melting point will also be reduced or

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.860 
melting point will also be reduced or
its<00:05:27.010> boiling<00:05:27.280> point<00:05:27.460> it's<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.180> same<00:05:28.420> idea<00:05:28.690> so

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
its boiling point it's the same idea so

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.640 
its boiling point it's the same idea so
I'm<00:05:28.960> gonna<00:05:29.050> show<00:05:29.380> you<00:05:29.410> with<00:05:30.010> this<00:05:30.190> hot<00:05:30.400> water

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
I'm gonna show you with this hot water

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.840 
I'm gonna show you with this hot water
right<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.890> temperature<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:33.460> water<00:05:33.520> at

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
right the temperature of this water at

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.520 
right the temperature of this water at
the<00:05:33.940> moment<00:05:33.970> is<00:05:35.820> 85<00:05:36.820> degrees<00:05:37.200> Celsius<00:05:38.200> okay

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
the moment is 85 degrees Celsius okay

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.680 
the moment is 85 degrees Celsius okay
now<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:38.950> boiling<00:05:39.460> point<00:05:39.730> of<00:05:39.880> water<00:05:39.940> is<00:05:40.390> a

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
now the boiling point of water is a

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.540 
now the boiling point of water is a
hundred<00:05:41.110> degrees<00:05:41.230> Celsius<00:05:41.770> so<00:05:41.800> clearly<00:05:42.250> that

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
hundred degrees Celsius so clearly that

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.450 
hundred degrees Celsius so clearly that
is<00:05:43.390> not<00:05:43.420> boiling<00:05:43.840> at<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.170> moment<00:05:44.500> but<00:05:44.770> if<00:05:45.250> I

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
is not boiling at the moment but if I

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.260 
is not boiling at the moment but if I
reduce<00:05:45.640> the<00:05:46.000> pressure<00:05:46.110> inside<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.440> flask

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.080 

check<00:05:52.270> that<00:05:52.450> out<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:53.860> pressure<00:05:54.280> inside<00:05:54.760> the

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
check that out the pressure inside the

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.910 
check that out the pressure inside the
flask<00:05:55.630> has<00:05:56.620> been<00:05:56.920> reduced<00:05:57.400> and<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:59.170> water<00:05:59.440> is

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
flask has been reduced and the water is

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.890 
flask has been reduced and the water is
boiling<00:06:00.460> at<00:06:01.300> 85<00:06:02.230> degrees<00:06:03.270> Celsius<00:06:04.300> the

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
boiling at 85 degrees Celsius the

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.590 
boiling at 85 degrees Celsius the
pressure<00:06:05.230> inside<00:06:05.830> there<00:06:06.100> is<00:06:06.280> lower<00:06:06.610> therefore

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
pressure inside there is lower therefore

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.200 
pressure inside there is lower therefore
its<00:06:07.810> boiling<00:06:08.200> point<00:06:08.710> is<00:06:08.980> lower<00:06:09.670> as<00:06:09.970> well

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
its boiling point is lower as well

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.900 
its boiling point is lower as well
and<00:06:13.050> that's<00:06:13.289> pretty<00:06:13.710> much<00:06:13.919> what's<00:06:14.430> happening

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
and that's pretty much what's happening

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.360 
and that's pretty much what's happening
with<00:06:15.330> our<00:06:15.479> volcano<00:06:15.660> and<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:16.680> mantle<00:06:17.190> beneath

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370

Iceland<00:06:20.160> in<00:06:20.280> half<00:06:20.550> move<00:06:21.210> apart<00:06:21.690> the<00:06:22.199> mantle<00:06:22.770> is

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
Iceland in half move apart the mantle is

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.070 
Iceland in half move apart the mantle is
slowly<00:06:23.520> moving<00:06:23.880> upwards<00:06:24.389> as<00:06:24.660> it<00:06:24.870> moves

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
slowly moving upwards as it moves

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.770 
slowly moving upwards as it moves
upwards<00:06:25.380> the<00:06:26.009> pressure<00:06:26.460> is<00:06:26.820> decreasing<00:06:27.479> and

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
upwards the pressure is decreasing and

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.080 
upwards the pressure is decreasing and
as<00:06:27.900> that<00:06:28.080> pressure<00:06:28.410> reduces<00:06:29.130> the<00:06:29.490> melting

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
as that pressure reduces the melting

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.300 
as that pressure reduces the melting
point<00:06:30.360> of<00:06:30.570> the<00:06:30.990> mantle<00:06:31.440> reduces<00:06:31.889> also<00:06:32.190> which

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
point of the mantle reduces also which

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.700 
point of the mantle reduces also which

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
means the mantle the hot solid rock

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.230

if<00:07:17.430> it's<00:07:17.550> nice<00:07:17.730> and<00:07:17.970> gloopy<00:07:18.240> then<00:07:18.900> the

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
if it's nice and gloopy then the

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.750 
if it's nice and gloopy then the
pressure<00:07:19.380> is<00:07:19.650> going<00:07:19.800> to<00:07:19.860> build<00:07:20.160> up<00:07:20.400> in<00:07:20.640> those

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760 
pressure is going to build up in those

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.240 
pressure is going to build up in those
bubbles<00:07:21.120> until<00:07:21.390> eventually<00:07:21.570> it's<00:07:21.990> going<00:07:22.140> to

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.250 
bubbles until eventually it's going to

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.010 
bubbles until eventually it's going to
explode<00:07:23.250> the<00:07:23.520> magma<00:07:23.910> out<00:07:24.120> of<00:07:24.570> the<00:07:24.630> volcano

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
explode the magma out of the volcano

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:37.480 
explode the magma out of the volcano
abyss<00:07:25.950> like<00:07:26.850> a<00:07:26.910> bottle<00:07:27.240> of<00:07:27.300> pop

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:43.539
