00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.700 
finish up this rate right here I'm at
47%<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.539> deciding<00:01:03.960> where<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> attack

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
47% and deciding where I want to attack

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
47% and deciding where I want to attack
from<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.670> there<00:01:05.790> isn't<00:01:05.939> open<00:01:06.360> mortar

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
from you can see there isn't open mortar

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.480 
from you can see there isn't open mortar
on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> left<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.439> well<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> dark<00:01:08.250> elixir

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.190 
on the left as well as the dark elixir
drill<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> makes<00:01:09.299> sense<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.630> attack<00:01:09.960> from

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
drill so it makes sense to attack from

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.399 
drill so it makes sense to attack from
there<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.580> drop<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.090> Queen<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.200> see

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
rather than target that open mortar

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.270 
rather than target that open mortar
she's<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.259> gonna<00:01:16.350> go<00:01:16.500> ahead<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.740> slam<00:01:17.009> onto

breakers<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.450> raid<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.319> set

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
breakers to the raid you can just set

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.630

your<00:02:14.530> queen<00:02:14.799> on<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> walls<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.400> let<00:02:15.519> your

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
your queen on the walls and let your

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.970 
your queen on the walls and let your
troops<00:02:15.909> break<00:02:16.150> through<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:17.349> feel<00:02:17.379> this<00:02:17.920> is

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
troops break through and I feel this is

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.440 
troops break through and I feel this is
the<00:02:18.190> right<00:02:18.340> direction<00:02:18.519> for<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.909> game<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.180> don't

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the right direction for the game I don't

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.910 
the right direction for the game I don't
like<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.599> lot<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.989> random<00:02:20.379> stuff<00:02:20.590> where<00:02:20.799> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
like a lot of the random stuff where the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.009 
like a lot of the random stuff where the
Queen<00:02:21.519> will<00:02:21.730> shoot<00:02:21.970> left<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.360> right<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.750> same

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
Queen will shoot left and right and same

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.360 
Queen will shoot left and right and same
with<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.230> king<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.620> guess<00:02:23.950> they're<00:02:24.099> gonna<00:02:24.220> have

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
with the king I guess they're gonna have

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.009 
with the king I guess they're gonna have
to<00:02:24.400> fix<00:02:24.700> him<00:02:24.879> sometime<00:02:25.269> soon<00:02:25.480> maybe<00:02:25.720> they<00:02:25.870> can

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
to fix him sometime soon maybe they can

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.869 
to fix him sometime soon maybe they can
make<00:02:26.140> him<00:02:26.319> focus<00:02:26.500> on<00:02:26.799> builder<00:02:27.159> huts<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:27.819> I

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
make him focus on builder huts but I

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.250 
make him focus on builder huts but I
think<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.299> is<00:02:28.420> definitely<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:28.810> step<00:02:29.049> in<00:02:29.170> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
think this is definitely a step in the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.630 
think this is definitely a step in the
right<00:02:29.379> direction<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.069> it's<00:02:30.220> bringing<00:02:30.430> more

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
right direction and it's bringing more

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.850 
right direction and it's bringing more
clarity<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.420> game<00:02:31.659> so<00:02:32.349> one<00:02:32.530> last<00:02:32.709> example

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
clarity to the game so one last example

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.229 
clarity to the game so one last example
