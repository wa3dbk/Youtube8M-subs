00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
Search and Destroy league play I was

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.900 
Search and Destroy league play I was
really<00:00:07.170> really<00:00:07.560> happy<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:08.040> how<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.250> did<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.730> this

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
really really happy of how I did in this

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.390 
really really happy of how I did in this
game<00:00:09.150> because<00:00:09.929> not<00:00:10.260> only<00:00:10.290> was<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.740> likely<00:00:11.160> play

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
game because not only was it likely play

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.650 
game because not only was it likely play
which<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> lot<00:00:11.880> more<00:00:11.910> challenging<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.389> pay

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
which is a lot more challenging you pay

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.850 
which is a lot more challenging you pay
against<00:00:12.929> teams<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.349> stuff<00:00:13.440> these<00:00:13.679> were

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
against teams and stuff these were

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.890 
against teams and stuff these were
masters<00:00:14.400> players<00:00:14.700> as<00:00:15.000> well<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.389> think<00:00:15.719> they<00:00:15.780> had

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
masters players as well I think they had

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.420 
masters players as well I think they had
one<00:00:16.109> platinum<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.560> their<00:00:16.740> team<00:00:16.949> but<00:00:17.220> other

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
one platinum on their team but other

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.279 
one platinum on their team but other
than<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.359> told<00:00:18.570> me<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.720> most<00:00:19.140> of

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
than that it just told me that most of

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.380 
than that it just told me that most of
these<00:00:19.380> people<00:00:19.890> are<00:00:20.160> gonna<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.880> able<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.180> shoot

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
these people are gonna be able to shoot

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.050 
these people are gonna be able to shoot
back<00:00:21.720> which<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.859> what<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.039> do<00:00:23.160> really<00:00:23.550> do<00:00:23.880> about

I'm<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.189> make<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> mistake<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
I'm like here I kind of make a mistake I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.429 
I'm like here I kind of make a mistake I
know<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.090> should<00:01:09.510> probably<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.930> ran<00:01:10.140> away<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439

know I should probably just ran away and
gone<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.680> streaks<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.100> had<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
gone for streaks but I had to go for the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.310 
gone for streaks but I had to go for the
disarmer<00:01:12.180> wise<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.689> able<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> so

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
disarmer wise on to be able to get it so

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.469 
disarmer wise on to be able to get it so
it<00:01:13.979> was<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.189> oh<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.700> still<00:01:15.000> learning<00:01:15.210> I'm

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
it was like oh I'm still learning I'm

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
it was like oh I'm still learning I'm
learning<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.930> lot<00:01:15.960> doing<00:01:16.470> me<00:01:16.650> play<00:01:16.860> because

learning a lot doing me play because
it's<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.210> improve<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.110> much

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
it's with you you you improve so much

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.990 
it's with you you you improve so much
more<00:01:19.560> when<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> play<00:01:19.950> against<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.820> players

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
more when you play against good players

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.460 
more when you play against good players

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
because you kind of have to learn to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560 
because you kind of have to learn to
outsmart<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.220> out<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:23.640> them<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> do

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
things you normally wouldn't do without

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.560 
things you normally wouldn't do without
you<00:01:26.549> doing<00:01:26.759> public<00:01:27.030> which<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.330> why<00:01:27.540> I

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.760 
all right just looks like when you see
in<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.480> thing<00:02:20.900> rather<00:02:21.110> than<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.470> seeing

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
in the thing rather than the seeing
