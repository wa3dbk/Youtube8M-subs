players yeah you need to give up your
dragons<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:48.319> get<00:01:48.499> these<00:01:48.679> things<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:49.459> then

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
dragons to get these things and then

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.419 
dragons to get these things and then
just<00:01:49.609> craft<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.389> so<00:01:51.079> there's<00:01:51.799> almost<00:01:52.069> no
