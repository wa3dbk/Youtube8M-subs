the double amount of points for any kill
streak<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.730> swarm<00:03:06.120> what<00:03:06.300> normally<00:03:06.600> cost

streak so that swarm what normally cost
them<00:03:06.959> two<00:03:07.170> thousand<00:03:07.739> points<00:03:08.010> would<00:03:08.880> now<00:03:09.090> be

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
them two thousand points would now be

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.240 
them two thousand points would now be
four<00:03:09.540> thousand<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.830> best<00:03:11.070> way

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
four thousand and that is the best way

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
resort again I believe most of the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.110 
resort again I believe most of the
secondaries<00:03:34.530> are<00:03:34.560> way<00:03:34.980> over<00:03:35.190> P<00:03:35.489> obviously<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
secondaries are way over P obviously the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.380 
secondaries are way over P obviously the
cap<00:03:36.299> for<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.870> 23<00:03:37.350> other<00:03:37.500> type<00:03:37.769> 45<00:03:38.390> but

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
cap for it to be 23 other type 45 but

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.199 
cap for it to be 23 other type 45 but
yeah<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.980> secondaries<00:03:41.549> at<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.850> moment

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
yeah the the secondaries at the moment

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.130 
yeah the the secondaries at the moment
are<00:03:42.269> just<00:03:42.510> ridiculous<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:45.540> snipers<00:03:46.019> have

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
are just ridiculous and the snipers have

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.840 
are just ridiculous and the snipers have
never<00:03:46.380> had<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.709> good<00:03:46.890> let's<00:03:47.220> face<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.730> guys

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
never had it so good let's face it guys

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.610 
never had it so good let's face it guys
you<00:03:48.060> know<00:03:48.150> I'm<00:03:48.269> not<00:03:48.299> hating<00:03:48.570> on<00:03:48.780> snipers<00:03:49.350> I

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
you know I'm not hating on snipers I

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.400 
you know I'm not hating on snipers I
wish<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.280> called<00:03:50.549> quick<00:03:50.730> scope<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:51.360> at<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
wish I called quick scope but at the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.470 
wish I called quick scope but at the
moment<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:53.220> snipers<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.760> got<00:03:53.940> best<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.299> both

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
moment the snipers have got best of both

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.900 
moment the snipers have got best of both
worlds<00:03:54.900> they've<00:03:55.440> obviously<00:03:55.560> got<00:03:55.890> ability<00:03:56.519> to

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
worlds they've obviously got ability to

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.030 
worlds they've obviously got ability to
quickscope<00:03:57.390> at<00:03:57.690> close<00:03:57.930> range<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.560> they've

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
quickscope at close range and they've

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.310 
quickscope at close range and they've
got<00:03:59.220> obviously<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.850> greater<00:04:00.269> advantage<00:04:01.110> at

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
got obviously a greater advantage at

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.900 
got obviously a greater advantage at
long<00:04:01.500> range<00:04:01.709> hence<00:04:01.980> because<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.580> using<00:04:02.850> a

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
long range hence because the using a

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.300 
long range hence because the using a
sniper<00:04:03.180> rifle<00:04:03.350> but<00:04:04.350> yet<00:04:04.590> if<00:04:04.739> they<00:04:04.890> miss<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.190> at

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
sniper rifle but yet if they miss you at

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.100 
sniper rifle but yet if they miss you at
close<00:04:05.730> range<00:04:06.030> with<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.299> bolt<00:04:06.570> action<00:04:06.720> sniper

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
close range with a bolt action sniper

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.000 
close range with a bolt action sniper
rifle<00:04:07.890> all<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.760> have<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.030> do<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.420> quickly
