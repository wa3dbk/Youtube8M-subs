that's<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.500> range<00:00:58.770> problem<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.050> what's

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that's a range problem here so what's

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
that's a range problem here so what's
interesting<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.739> makes<00:01:02.190> us<00:01:02.280> want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> look

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.830 
interesting is it makes us want to look
at<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:02.879> these<00:01:02.969> batteries<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.420> what

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
at what these batteries are what

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.329 
at what these batteries are what
decisions<00:01:04.530> Tesla's<00:01:04.830> made<00:01:05.010> around<00:01:05.159> these

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
decisions Tesla's made around these

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.490 
decisions Tesla's made around these
batteries<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.479> what's<00:01:06.990> interesting<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
batteries and and what's interesting is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500 
batteries and and what's interesting is
that<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.130> batteries<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.670> very<00:01:09.210> important

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that the batteries are very important

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.789 
that the batteries are very important
the<00:01:09.600> car<00:01:09.780> they're<00:01:09.960> very<00:01:10.140> important<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> the

gross<00:03:26.900> profits<00:03:27.349> hmm<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:28.010> they<00:03:28.129> really<00:03:28.400> do<00:03:28.579> need

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
gross profits hmm so they really do need

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.670 
gross profits hmm so they really do need
