the pit goes into the rigid attention

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.910 
the pit goes into the rigid attention
taller<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.950> you<00:00:37.950> place<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> whole<00:00:38.520> thing<00:00:38.850> into

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.660 

because<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.399> tension<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:04.250> now<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.430> try<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
because the tension on it now you try to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.789 
because the tension on it now you try to
do<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.270> piggies<00:01:06.630> go<00:01:06.869> through<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.680> you're

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
do the piggies go through and you're

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.969 
do the piggies go through and you're
feeling<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> levers<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.229> lot<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
feeling for the levers in the lot that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830 
feeling for the levers in the lot that
feel<00:01:11.189> tighter<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.030> adjust<00:01:12.420> your<00:01:12.600> tension

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
feel tighter so adjust your tension

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.890 
feel tighter so adjust your tension
accordingly<00:01:13.740> you've<00:01:13.920> got<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> reveal<00:01:14.900> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
accordingly you've got to reveal the

accordingly you've got to reveal the
leave<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.380> further<00:01:16.650> tightest<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.930> common

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
leave that further tightest a common

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
leave that further tightest a common
mistake<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.350> people<00:01:19.619> tend<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.880> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
mistake that people tend to make on this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.580 
mistake that people tend to make on this
is<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.439> over<00:01:23.180> lift<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.479> leavers<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.320> don't

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
is to over lift the leavers you don't

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.050 
is to over lift the leavers you don't
want<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.850> at

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
want to do that because they have at

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
want to do that because they have at
least<00:01:27.240> things<00:01:27.540> pronouncing<00:01:28.140> pick<00:01:28.409> notches<00:01:28.950> on

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
least things pronouncing pick notches on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.630 
least things pronouncing pick notches on
them<00:01:29.479> lock<00:01:30.479> when<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.470> over<00:01:32.100> lift<00:01:32.250> them<00:01:32.460> so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
them lock when you over lift them so

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.450 
them lock when you over lift them so
keep<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.060> small<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.829> analogy<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> man

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
keep it small the analogy is a man

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.310 
keep it small the analogy is a man
crawling<00:01:35.909> under<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> barbed<00:01:36.540> wire<00:01:36.630> fence<00:01:36.810> he

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
keeps his head down little movements you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.160 
keeps his head down little movements you
just<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.400> through<00:01:41.430> try<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> lift<00:01:42.210> them<00:01:45.170> another

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
just go through try to lift them another

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.380 
just go through try to lift them another
mistake<00:01:46.740> people<00:01:47.070> tend<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.579> make<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> or

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
mistake people tend to make on this or

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.520 
mistake people tend to make on this or
picking<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.110> general<00:01:49.680> rule<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.100> found<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> that

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
picking a general rule I found is that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.440 
picking a general rule I found is that
they<00:01:52.530> used<00:01:52.740> too<00:01:52.979> much<00:01:53.250> tension<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:54.180> they're

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
they used too much tension or they're

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.200 
they used too much tension or they're
all<00:01:54.750> they<00:01:54.960> stick<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.799> rigid<00:01:56.430> idea<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
all they stick to this rigid idea of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.789 
all they stick to this rigid idea of
everything<00:01:57.659> has<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.140> feather-light

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
everything has to be feather-light

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.260 
everything has to be feather-light
tension<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> other<00:01:59.850> end<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
tension so it's the other end of the
