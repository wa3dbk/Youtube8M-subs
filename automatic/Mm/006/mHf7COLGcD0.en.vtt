taggings not my forte but it's a review
so<00:01:56.400> it's<00:01:56.760> not<00:01:57.180> about<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:57.810> tagging<00:01:59.150> tag<00:02:00.150> my

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
so it's not about my tagging tag my

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.110 
so it's not about my tagging tag my
cat's<00:02:00.630> name<00:02:01.159> by<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.220> way<00:02:02.430> my<00:02:02.610> cat's<00:02:02.880> name<00:02:03.000> is

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
cat's name by the way my cat's name is

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.649 
cat's name by the way my cat's name is
Skippy<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:04.250> he<00:02:05.250> had<00:02:05.550> his<00:02:05.700> 18th<00:02:06.120> birthday<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
Skippy and he had his 18th birthday a

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.490 
Skippy and he had his 18th birthday a
few<00:02:06.720> days<00:02:07.080> ago<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.159> he's<00:02:08.340> really<00:02:08.550> old

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.800 

it's<00:02:13.500> actually<00:02:14.340> has<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.580> bit<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.030> harder<00:02:15.510> nib

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
it's actually has a bit of a harder nib

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.980 
it's actually has a bit of a harder nib
than<00:02:16.170> some<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.340> other<00:02:17.550> markers<00:02:18.360> I've<00:02:18.510> used

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
than some of the other markers I've used

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.950 
than some of the other markers I've used
so<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.400> really<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.150> get<00:02:21.630> right

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
so it's you really have to get right

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.980 
so it's you really have to get right
flat<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.300> like<00:02:24.300> whatever<00:02:24.600> you're<00:02:24.780> writing

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
flat on the like whatever you're writing

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.700 
flat on the like whatever you're writing
on<00:02:25.350> if<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.250> want<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:27.650> like<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> full-size

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
on if you want it to be like a full-size

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.040 
on if you want it to be like a full-size
line<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:32.460> lines<00:02:32.700> seem<00:02:33.000> very<00:02:33.210> consistent

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
line the lines seem very consistent

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.840 
line the lines seem very consistent
there's<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.830> bit<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> streak<00:02:35.490> there<00:02:36.270> but

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
there's a little bit of streak there but

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.230 
there's a little bit of streak there but
that's<00:02:38.850> just<00:02:39.120> me<00:02:39.330> going<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.810> bit<00:02:39.960> too<00:02:40.020> quick<00:02:41.240> fat

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
that's just me going a bit too quick fat

00:02:42.240 --> 00:03:13.550 
that's just me going a bit too quick fat
skinny<00:03:11.330> okay<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.510> tested<00:03:12.960> out<00:03:13.110> on<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> few

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
skinny okay so I tested out on a few

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.130 
skinny okay so I tested out on a few
different<00:03:13.650> surfaces<00:03:14.520> I'll<00:03:15.240> say<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.720> for<00:03:15.780> it

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
different surfaces I'll say this for it

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.680 
different surfaces I'll say this for it
the<00:03:16.350> nib<00:03:16.560> really<00:03:17.160> stands<00:03:17.580> up<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.030> taking<00:03:18.450> a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
the nib really stands up to taking a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.530 
the nib really stands up to taking a
beating<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.550> still<00:03:20.550> flowing<00:03:21.030> very<00:03:21.060> nicely

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
beating and still flowing very nicely

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.190 
beating and still flowing very nicely
and<00:03:21.959> not<00:03:22.110> getting<00:03:23.100> damaged<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:24.030> lot<00:03:24.240> it<00:03:24.840> writes

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
and not getting damaged a lot it writes

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.880 
and not getting damaged a lot it writes
probably<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.400> best<00:03:26.670> on<00:03:27.120> metal<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.260> plastic

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
probably the best on metal and plastic

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.430 
probably the best on metal and plastic
just<00:03:29.100> because<00:03:29.310> they're<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.640> smoothest

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
just because they're the smoothest

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.520 
just because they're the smoothest
something<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.680> did<00:03:32.070> find<00:03:32.430> though<00:03:32.730> on<00:03:33.530> plastic

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
something I did find though on plastic

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.830 
something I did find though on plastic
the<00:03:35.280> ink<00:03:35.610> or<00:03:35.940> paint

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the ink or paint

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.000 
the ink or paint
sorry<00:03:37.410> separates<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.910> crazy<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.200> separates

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
sorry separates like crazy it separates

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.460 
sorry separates like crazy it separates
into<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.340> point<00:03:41.670> where<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.170> almost<00:03:43.170> can't

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
into a point where you just almost can't

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.160 
into a point where you just almost can't
even<00:03:43.680> see<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.220> some<00:03:44.520> spots<00:03:44.880> hard<00:03:45.480> plastics

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
even see it in some spots hard plastics

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.330 
even see it in some spots hard plastics
okay<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.870> another<00:03:48.870> thing<00:03:49.230> paint<00:03:50.070> is

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
okay for it but another thing paint is

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.000 
okay for it but another thing paint is
really<00:03:52.280> pretty<00:03:53.390> transparent<00:03:54.390> like<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.110> can't<00:03:55.650> I

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
really pretty transparent like I can't I

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.760 
really pretty transparent like I can't I
wrote<00:03:56.850> on<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.090> few<00:03:57.450> things<00:03:57.900> like<00:03:58.260> painted

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
wrote on a few things like painted

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.430 
wrote on a few things like painted
surfaces<00:03:59.370> or<00:03:59.640> things<00:03:59.880> I<00:04:00.090> had<00:04:00.240> already<00:04:00.450> tagged

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
surfaces or things I had already tagged

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.930 
surfaces or things I had already tagged
and<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:03.330> just<00:04:03.720> doesn't<00:04:04.250> show<00:04:05.250> through<00:04:05.610> it

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
and it just doesn't show through it

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.240 
and it just doesn't show through it
doesn't<00:04:06.360> stand<00:04:06.660> up<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.110> test<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:08.040> show

doesn't stand up to the test to show
through<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.970> it's<00:04:09.540> very<00:04:09.750> easy<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:10.200> cover

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
through it and it's very easy to cover

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.250 
through it and it's very easy to cover
up<00:04:10.910> one<00:04:11.910> coat<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.300> paint<00:04:12.450> you'll<00:04:12.720> never<00:04:12.900> see<00:04:13.170> it

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
up one coat of paint you'll never see it

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.159 
up one coat of paint you'll never see it
again<00:04:13.340> something<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.850> did<00:04:15.209> like<00:04:15.660> about<00:04:15.690> it

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
again something I did like about it

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.250 
again something I did like about it
though<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:17.070> colors<00:04:17.580> I'll<00:04:17.940> give<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.540> the

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
though the colors I'll give it this the

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.920 
though the colors I'll give it this the
colors<00:04:19.680> really<00:04:20.190> jump<00:04:20.489> out<00:04:20.640> at<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.120> when<00:04:21.720> it's

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
colors really jump out at you when it's

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.440 
colors really jump out at you when it's
on<00:04:22.320> when<00:04:23.070> it's<00:04:23.250> juiced<00:04:23.580> up<00:04:23.820> really

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
on when it's juiced up really

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.270 
on when it's juiced up really
well<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.930> it's<00:04:25.170> on<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:26.480> surface<00:04:27.560> that's<00:04:28.560> clean

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
well and it's on a surface that's clean

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.660 
well and it's on a surface that's clean
and<00:04:29.610> when<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.720> paint's<00:04:31.110> not<00:04:31.170> separating<00:04:32.010> one

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
and when the paint's not separating one

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.000 
and when the paint's not separating one
last<00:04:32.970> thing<00:04:33.270> about<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.780> it's<00:04:34.110> possible<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.890> get

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
last thing about it it's possible to get

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.210 
last thing about it it's possible to get
drips<00:04:35.310> with<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.700> but<00:04:35.970> if<00:04:36.630> you're<00:04:37.350> looking<00:04:38.010> for

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
drips with it but if you're looking for

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.160 
drips with it but if you're looking for
something<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.700> get<00:04:38.820> lots<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.360> drips<00:04:39.660> with<00:04:39.930> I

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
something to get lots of drips with I

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.040 
something to get lots of drips with I
recommend<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.340> different<00:04:41.870> marker<00:04:42.870> that's

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
recommend a different marker that's

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.450 
recommend a different marker that's
actually<00:04:43.920> a<00:04:43.980> drip<00:04:44.310> mop<00:04:44.520> but<00:04:45.450> my<00:04:46.110> overall

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
actually a drip mop but my overall

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.910 
actually a drip mop but my overall
review<00:04:47.460> is<00:04:48.000> I'd<00:04:48.480> say<00:04:48.510> would<00:04:48.960> be<00:04:49.140> a<00:04:49.170> three<00:04:49.650> stay

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
review is I'd say would be a three stay
