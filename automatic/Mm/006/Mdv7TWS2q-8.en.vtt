00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
with intelligence it's always

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.680 
with intelligence it's always
synergistic<00:05:53.680> it's<00:05:53.860> always<00:05:54.220> add<00:05:54.820> into<00:05:55.390> an

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
synergistic it's always add into an

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.960 
synergistic it's always add into an
exponentially<00:05:56.680> growing<00:05:58.410> so<00:05:59.410> yeah<00:06:00.370> this<00:06:00.760> is<00:06:00.940> a

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
exponentially growing so yeah this is a

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.320 
exponentially growing so yeah this is a
