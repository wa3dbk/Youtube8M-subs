a lot of antioxidants and free radicals
it's<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.510> perfect<00:00:42.870> formulation<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.920> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it's not a perfect formulation but it is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.090 
it's not a perfect formulation but it is
only<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.910> our<00:00:45.149> sins<00:00:45.390> share<00:00:45.840> transformation<00:00:46.530> so

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
I love this highly highly recommend but

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.860 
I love this highly highly recommend but
it's<00:00:49.370> $45<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.480> trying<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> find<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
it's $45 so I was trying to find a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.750 
it's $45 so I was trying to find a
cheaper<00:00:52.079> alternative<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.219> past<00:00:53.460> I've

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
cheaper alternative in the past I've

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.810 
cheaper alternative in the past I've
tried<00:00:54.180> rare<00:00:55.110> minerals<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:56.340> purely

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
tried rare minerals I'm purely

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
tried rare minerals I'm purely
nourishing<00:00:56.969> facial<00:00:57.660> moisturizer<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.739> one

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
nourishing facial moisturizer this one

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950 
nourishing facial moisturizer this one
isn't<00:00:59.160> horrible<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.850> all<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> lot<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
isn't horrible at all it's got a lot of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.990 
isn't horrible at all it's got a lot of
stuff<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.489> thing<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
stuff in it but the one thing that I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.969 
stuff in it but the one thing that I
realized<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.719> skin<00:01:03.989> does<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
realized that my skin does not like and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.980 
realized that my skin does not like and
I<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.519> figured<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.939> through<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.540> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
I have figured that out through this is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.530 
I have figured that out through this is
it<00:01:07.200> doesn't<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.560> shea<00:01:07.770> butter<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.640> most<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
it doesn't like shea butter so most of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.910 
it doesn't like shea butter so most of
these<00:01:09.689> products<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.170> shea<00:01:10.500> butter<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.830> them

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
these products have shea butter in them

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.320 
these products have shea butter in them
and<00:01:11.040> that's<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> reasons<00:01:11.790> why<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and that's one of the reasons why I

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.830 
and that's one of the reasons why I
can't<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.170> use<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.010> shea<00:01:14.220> butter

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
can't really use them so shea butter

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.160 
can't really use them so shea butter
then<00:01:16.580> okay<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> tried<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.030> oasis<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
then okay I tried this oasis one this

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289 
then okay I tried this oasis one this
one<00:01:19.380> has<00:01:19.530> too<00:01:19.710> much<00:01:19.860> sodium<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.119> just

with like a little sample size in it
mixing<00:02:43.389> water<00:02:43.629> so<00:02:44.169> the<00:02:44.349> formulations<00:02:45.099> were

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219

watered<00:02:45.489> down<00:02:45.669> um<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.480> works<00:02:46.659> way<00:02:46.989> better<00:02:47.019> than

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
watered down um it works way better than

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.589
