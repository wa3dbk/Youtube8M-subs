00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.900
Can we go all together to church on Sunday?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.800
Mmh...we can take you there on Sunday, but Mom &amp; Dad have more important things to do.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.300
I think i forgot my backpack at church.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.000
Is there something important in there, that
you need today?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.300
Yes her inhaler.
Honey, could you go back and get her backpack

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
while I prepare dinner?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.300
Yes ok, if it's necessary.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.000
Hello?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Hey darling, it's so weird, there are so many clothes around, but no one is here.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.400
Can you ask the little one if I'm in the right room.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.700
Did you see the thunderbolt, too?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.500
Honey? Hello? Hello?
Are you alright?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.400
Get off of me! Get off of me!

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.400
Nice meeting you too!

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.000
Does the cat have your tongue?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.500
No.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.000
He can talk.
Does he also have a name?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You don't talk much. We'll be here for
a while, maybe we should talk.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
OK, if you like. I'm Vincent. Why are you
here?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Jasmin. It's a long story.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.500
I guess we have enough time.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.700
Do you remember the computer nerds from school?
That's me.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.200
I found something, what could be very dangerous for them, that's why I`m here.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.900
They kidnapped my brother. Since then I've been looking for him.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.300
Lucky for me i started with this building.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.700
Hey! Get up!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.300
It was nice to meet you.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.600
Shut up!

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.400
Where am I? What do you want from me?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.500
What are you doing here?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.600
I'm homeless and i wanted to sleep here.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700
A homeless guy with a gun?

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.600
Shit.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
For your own benefit, tell me what you know!

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.000
Would you believe me when I tell you,

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.000
that I'm the pizza guy?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.900
Oh you think that's funny!

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.600
Just so you know... The last one I interrogated on this chair
was found distributed in 4 plastic bags in a barrel.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.700
Where is Thomas?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I know you kidnapped him.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.700
I just want to know where he is!

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.000
Well, maybe we can make a deal.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.000
I just need information about one man. After that we can talk about your brother.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.200
Think about your next answer.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800
Thank you, not interested!

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.200
I know you,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.100
after that I'm dead anyway.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.900
Looks like you know nothing about us.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.700
Otherwise you would just be begging me to give you a headshot to make your death quick and painless.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.500
Let's do this in a different way.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.500
For every wrong answer you get a broken bone.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.000
We know more about you than you think, and
we know, that you're looking for this guy.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.900
So who is that and what do you know about him?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.300
If I'm not mistaken, that's David Montgommery.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.000
Boah, taste like shit!

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.300
How are you?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.900
As always.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.100
Are you hungry?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.400
Yes a bit.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.000
Ok I'll make something for us.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.500
Yes?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.100
David? It's Felix.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.400
How did you get my number?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.500
Maybe you should ask yourself how I know where you are!
