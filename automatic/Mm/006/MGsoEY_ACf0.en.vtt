using arm uses mcmmo and because it uses

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.350 
using arm uses mcmmo and because it uses
mcmmo<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.860> I've<00:05:20.919> got<00:05:21.129> my<00:05:21.279> sword<00:05:21.639> skill<00:05:21.969> up<00:05:22.120> i

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.050 
mcmmo and I've got my sword skill up i
can<00:05:22.629> dodge<00:05:22.870> attacks<00:05:23.219> so<00:05:24.219> obviously<00:05:24.699> someone

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
can dodge attacks so obviously someone

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.519

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
them and Chuck in and never wat next

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:24.790 
them and Chuck in and never wat next
step<00:06:19.060> is<00:06:19.839> to<00:06:19.899> truck<00:06:20.469> in<00:06:20.649> a<00:06:21.009> spider<00:06:21.699> I

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.350 

now<00:06:25.800> what<00:06:26.070> we<00:06:26.190> need<00:06:26.220> to<00:06:26.400> do<00:06:26.580> is<00:06:26.760> add<00:06:27.150> a

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
now what we need to do is add a

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.360 
now what we need to do is add a
fermented<00:06:27.870> spider<00:06:27.990> I<00:06:28.230> though<00:06:28.770> I<00:06:29.040> am<00:06:29.160> aware

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
fermented spider I though I am aware

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.650 
fermented spider I though I am aware
that<00:06:29.430> not<00:06:29.760> all<00:06:29.820> of<00:06:30.090> you<00:06:30.210> will<00:06:30.240> know<00:06:30.449> how<00:06:30.600> to

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
that not all of you will know how to

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.450 
that not all of you will know how to
make<00:06:30.870> a<00:06:30.930> fermented<00:06:31.440> spider<00:06:31.530> so<00:06:32.100> I'll<00:06:32.220> show<00:06:32.400> you

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
make a fermented spider so I'll show you

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.750 
make a fermented spider so I'll show you
the<00:06:32.520> recipe<00:06:32.910> what<00:06:33.330> you<00:06:33.479> need<00:06:33.660> is<00:06:33.870> one<00:06:34.229> spider<00:06:34.530> I

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
the recipe what you need is one spider I

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.350 
the recipe what you need is one spider I
one<00:06:35.760> sugar<00:06:36.389> and<00:06:36.600> one<00:06:37.590> brown<00:06:38.160> mushroom<00:06:38.639> all<00:06:39.120> on

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
one sugar and one brown mushroom all on

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.879 
one sugar and one brown mushroom all on
top<00:06:39.540> of<00:06:39.570> each<00:06:39.690> other<00:06:39.870> and<00:06:40.110> that<00:06:40.470> makes<00:06:40.710> a

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
top of each other and that makes a

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.129 
top of each other and that makes a
fermented<00:06:41.460> spider<00:06:41.550> right<00:06:41.850> so<00:06:42.360> let's<00:06:42.810> add<00:06:43.080> that

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
fermented spider right so let's add that

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:49.820 
fermented spider right so let's add that
to<00:06:43.680> our<00:06:43.710> potion<00:06:47.900> awesome<00:06:48.900> now<00:06:49.350> what<00:06:49.500> we<00:06:49.620> want

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
to our potion awesome now what we want

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.790 
to our potion awesome now what we want
to<00:06:49.949> do<00:06:50.130> is<00:06:50.340> add<00:06:50.699> some<00:06:51.060> glowstone<00:06:51.690> dust

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.980 

alrighty<00:06:55.800> so<00:06:56.340> we<00:06:56.520> have<00:06:56.669> created<00:06:57.180> some<00:06:57.479> instant

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
alrighty so we have created some instant

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.680 
alrighty so we have created some instant
damage<00:06:58.440> to<00:06:58.770> potions<00:06:59.250> but<00:06:59.340> we<00:07:00.180> cannot<00:07:00.450> throw

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
damage to potions but we cannot throw

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.510 
damage to potions but we cannot throw
them<00:07:00.870> at<00:07:00.930> people<00:07:00.960> so<00:07:01.470> the<00:07:01.590> last<00:07:01.770> step<00:07:01.950> is<00:07:02.280> to

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
them at people so the last step is to

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.629 
them at people so the last step is to
add<00:07:02.550> some<00:07:03.120> gunpowder<00:07:06.740> before<00:07:07.740> we<00:07:08.370> have<00:07:08.490> now

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 
add some gunpowder before we have now

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:11.750 
add some gunpowder before we have now
created<00:07:08.970> some<00:07:09.570> splash<00:07:10.470> potion<00:07:11.130> of<00:07:11.220> harming

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760 
created some splash potion of harming

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.420 
created some splash potion of harming
AKA<00:07:12.330> instant<00:07:12.990> damage<00:07:13.320> to<00:07:13.590> potions<00:07:14.070> which<00:07:14.250> we

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
AKA instant damage to potions which we

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.150 
AKA instant damage to potions which we
now<00:07:14.580> can<00:07:14.820> take<00:07:15.030> into<00:07:15.300> a<00:07:15.330> pvp<00:07:16.050> battle<00:07:16.380> and<00:07:16.530> kill

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
now can take into a pvp battle and kill

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.279 
now can take into a pvp battle and kill
