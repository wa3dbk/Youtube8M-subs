franchise and we realized that we wanted
to<00:01:21.909> add<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.119> couple<00:01:22.420> of<00:01:22.689> things<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.560> formula

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
to add a couple of things to the formula

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.710 
to add a couple of things to the formula
in<00:01:24.310> order<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.729> make<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.000> feel<00:01:25.180> a<00:01:25.210> little<00:01:25.540> bit

more CNC but also to add more points of

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.310 
more CNC but also to add more points of
interest<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.720> map<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.110> add<00:01:29.290> more

loves<00:01:34.360> harvesting<00:01:34.990> Tiberian<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.560> mean<00:01:35.710> they

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
loves harvesting Tiberian I mean they

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.530 
loves harvesting Tiberian I mean they
are<00:01:35.950> crazy<00:01:36.280> about<00:01:36.490> Tiberium<00:01:37.120> and<00:01:37.240> wanted<00:01:37.480> to

are crazy about Tiberium and wanted to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.300 
are crazy about Tiberium and wanted to
figure<00:01:37.659> out<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.900> way<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.590> get<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.830> into<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.130> game

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
figure out a way to get it into the game

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.130 
figure out a way to get it into the game
but<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.270> have<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.540> make<00:01:40.659> sense<00:01:40.690> with<00:01:41.110> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
but to have it make sense with the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.170 
but to have it make sense with the
fiction<00:01:41.620> as<00:01:42.130> well<00:01:42.159> as<00:01:42.340> add<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.670> new<00:01:42.940> strategic

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
fiction as well as add a new strategic

layer<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.710> gameplay<00:01:45.010> so<00:01:45.729> we<00:01:46.180> took<00:01:46.479> this

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
layer to to the gameplay so we took this

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.770 
layer to to the gameplay so we took this
idea<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.380> having<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:48.010> high<00:01:48.700> level<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.210> mobility

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
idea of having a high level of mobility

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.719 
idea of having a high level of mobility
in<00:01:49.900> terms<00:01:50.260> of<00:01:50.440> and<00:01:50.590> action<00:01:51.159> in<00:01:51.280> terms<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
in terms of and action in terms of the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.219 
in terms of and action in terms of the
gameplay<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.540> thought<00:01:52.720> how<00:01:53.050> can<00:01:53.080> we

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
gameplay and we thought how can we

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.140 
gameplay and we thought how can we
absolutely<00:01:53.470> double<00:01:54.159> down<00:01:54.310> on<00:01:54.520> this<00:01:54.670> but<00:01:54.940> also

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
absolutely double down on this but also

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.850 
absolutely double down on this but also
give<00:01:55.479> fans<00:01:55.780> some<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.229> what<00:01:56.380> they<00:01:56.500> want<00:01:56.740> in

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
give fans some of what they want in

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.350 
give fans some of what they want in
terms<00:01:56.890> of<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.370> Tiberium<00:01:57.880> harvesting

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360

visual challenges I feel we had was to
represent<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:03.270> kind<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.390> an<00:02:04.720> unprecedented

we got where we are now and what we
ultimately<00:02:15.069> decided<00:02:15.970> was<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.480> having

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
ultimately decided was that having

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.630 
ultimately decided was that having
players<00:02:17.409> put<00:02:17.680> down<00:02:17.799> refineries<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.519> these

played<00:02:23.019> into<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.349> fiction<00:02:23.680> anymore<00:02:24.040> but<00:02:24.400> it

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
played into the fiction anymore but it

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.070 
played into the fiction anymore but it
also<00:02:24.610> didn't<00:02:25.000> play<00:02:25.120> into<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> gameplay<00:02:25.720> as

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
also didn't play into the gameplay as

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.589 
also didn't play into the gameplay as
well<00:02:26.110> anymore<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.400> what<00:02:27.549> we<00:02:27.670> did<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:28.060> we<00:02:28.450> have

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
well anymore so what we did is we have

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.479 
well anymore so what we did is we have
this<00:02:28.720> crystal<00:02:29.170> capture<00:02:29.530> mechanic<00:02:30.010> where

deposited into four different zones on

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.949 
deposited into four different zones on
and<00:02:36.489> then<00:02:36.939> you<00:02:37.030> can<00:02:37.180> go<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:37.510> capture<00:02:37.840> those

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
and then you can go and capture those

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.479 
and then you can go and capture those
crystals<00:02:38.409> with<00:02:38.560> one<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.799> your<00:02:38.859> vehicles<00:02:39.069> and

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
move it back to your deployed zone or

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.629 
move it back to your deployed zone or
one<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.379> the<00:02:41.469> auxilary<00:02:41.859> deploy<00:02:42.189> zones<00:02:42.489> that

one of the auxilary deploy zones that

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.119 
one of the auxilary deploy zones that
you<00:02:42.730> can<00:02:42.879> capture<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.599> created<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.680> number<00:02:44.889> of

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
you can capture we created a number of

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.369 
you can capture we created a number of
different<00:02:46.030> concepts<00:02:46.569> played<00:02:46.959> with<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.109> bunch

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
different concepts played with a bunch

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.809 
different concepts played with a bunch
of<00:02:47.469> different<00:02:47.560> looks<00:02:47.980> until<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:48.430> settle<00:02:48.609> upon

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
of different looks until we settle upon

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.819 
of different looks until we settle upon
one<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.569> felt<00:02:49.810> was<00:02:50.499> going<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.739> be

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
one that we felt was going to be

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.009 
one that we felt was going to be
visually<00:02:51.219> recognizable<00:02:51.909> to<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.120> player<00:02:52.359> so

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
visually recognizable to the player so

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.839 
visually recognizable to the player so
we<00:02:53.560> settled<00:02:53.889> upon<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.189> idea<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.579> being<00:02:54.760> a

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
we settled upon the idea that being a

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.110 
we settled upon the idea that being a
large<00:02:55.319> crystal<00:02:56.319> shard<00:02:56.680> with<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.549> mechanical

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
large crystal shard with a mechanical

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.879 
large crystal shard with a mechanical
ring<00:02:58.389> around<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.900> another<00:02:59.500> thing<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.739> we

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
ring around it another thing that we

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.470 
ring around it another thing that we
wanted<00:03:00.129> to<00:03:00.189> do<00:03:00.340> was<00:03:00.519> really<00:03:00.700> bring<00:03:01.030> by<00:03:01.180> blue

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
wanted to do was really bring by blue

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.149 
wanted to do was really bring by blue
Tiberium<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.079> make<00:03:02.169> it<00:03:02.290> very<00:03:02.500> interesting<00:03:02.799> so

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
Tiberium and make it very interesting so

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.069 
Tiberium and make it very interesting so
you'll<00:03:03.310> also<00:03:03.489> find<00:03:03.819> blue<00:03:04.269> Tiberium<00:03:04.719> crystals

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
you'll also find blue Tiberium crystals

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.869 
you'll also find blue Tiberium crystals
which<00:03:05.379> give<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.709> twice<00:03:06.159> as<00:03:06.340> many<00:03:06.459> upgrade

out<00:03:15.310> from<00:03:15.639> the<00:03:15.760> network<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.150> then<00:03:16.510> needs<00:03:16.750> to

out from the network and then needs to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.000 
out from the network and then needs to
be<00:03:16.930> collected<00:03:17.379> or<00:03:17.469> else<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.709> going<00:03:17.859> to

continue accumulating at the surface so

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.839 
continue accumulating at the surface so
you<00:03:20.260> can<00:03:20.469> use<00:03:20.590> them<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.799> your<00:03:20.829> benefit<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.699> can
