 we are here cooperative and there is the army streets with last name gillette 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.000
 tomorrow that competition that I think will be important presence 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.979
 after that 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.559
 obviously your career 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.949
 what you think is doing 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.079

 the truth I believe that tomorrow I will feel very safe 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.909
 very motivated 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.790
 wanting to give the best of me 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.890
 I'm going against the eight best divers in the world but 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.700
 I think that nothing is impossible and 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.880
 if you put it as a goal 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.880
 weigh and propagate probabilities that you can do it 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.310
 and hopefully we have to be very successful 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.430
 clear added today's society 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.770
 good feels 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.899
 the vibra or up osorto we trust in total in tone 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.149
 yes it is very important also because of the way you are doing everything 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.530
 have 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.949
 carried all that preparation that to this level and is a sales success what 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.500
 you have new york 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.180
 I want you to know that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.440
 what am I going to throw all the desire that I can is not going to stay in me I'm going to 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.720
 compete with 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.540
 Now I have a very concentrated with all my heart and I hope that they are given 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.420
 things do not 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.710
 the opposite has happened or with you and him in relation to other sports tuc 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.840
 out of home pri you will already know who is that opportunity 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.910
 is a 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.189
 motivation a map or a pressure becomes 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.770
 the one who feels at home with your people how to handle that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.740
 well I think that 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.660
 from the point of view of the other athletes 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.470
 I think it's good not to be in your house with him 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.480
 with your people who love you 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.740
 who knows you 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 I think that as I do not feel pressured 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.289
 per cent I feel the opposite motivated 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.250
 n 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.039
 and good at csi high pressure 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.460
 all I want is to show the Mexican people 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.909
 what good we have been working well and that Mexicans 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.520
 in this sport we can not 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.549
 we all dream the election is a reality 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.229
 has dreamed this weekend 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.630
 here in the city of mexico in this international competition 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.159
 the dreamed you have imagined this situation 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.399
 yes yes this one seems to be too much 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:24.599
 but not just this 3d week since the workouts do not work for 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.409
 that 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.109
 right now you can not correct much and that what exists in the 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.269
 training 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.200
 percent preparation is what the ok to talk about because he 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.729
 for me tomorrow 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:36.499
 neither 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.289
 how good is the only thing 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.529
 in melo trackwise entering another field in our sport and equine 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.120
 you must be oblivious to this 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.120
 has undergone many changes at the managerial level 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:52.839
 the exit of the musi if I am in the heron other people that you think acidente 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:57.099
 first intention on the situation at administrative level in our sport 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.739
 the truth yes I am a little bit strange for the same thing that was in qatar china 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.999
 England 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.999
 p I do not know very well this 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.579
 the truth I do not see much television 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.180
 all I think is 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.099
 or what I want is that the support does not stop for any sport 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.879
 for not only us who are giving results for other athletes 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:22.979
 youth 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.629
 what good can advance and and that the scandal 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:27.979
 they are working 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.629
 percent 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.299
 It is the only thing I can say 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.010
 and for example there when I left the divers who is the first thing that 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.429
 you think here first month 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.110
 that the trainer the coach coach 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.809
 end and good me in those already trainings 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.919
 I imagine it is a competition 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.359
 in him why I already go down the stairs plains something 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.860
 well out there for to save road 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.659
 it's something there I think about my competition 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:52.819
 ii 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.889
 and he says he spoke very little and today the truth like this 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.139
 talkative bue 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.709
 but now they say that in the competitions etc previous to the competitions what 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.489
 very little 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.019
 but it is because 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.159
 Well now because I feel pressured something like that but because I want 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.960
 be like a competition 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.230
 and be focused on the sixth Vatican before 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.150
 after posing with us because we are serious commitments 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.919
 no no no and do not reveal and talk sixth here I am 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.759
 how are you thinking everything 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.169
 but he there I am concentrated 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.340
 I'm already 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.159
 I know that my coach is here 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.749
 I know that the judges are going to be on this side and on the other the truth is there 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.659
 they delete efe percent and good I am or not on a trampoline 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.169
 the cycle the people that work for me 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.680
 the living thing 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.430
 but but good 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.770
 because I think work 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.280
 I do not know the truth, it was difficult for me in that you stop 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.490
 transcend moment cases the legs and one of the arms since my childhood 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.779
 although from my childhood but 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.349
 but good tomorrow is a new competition 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.170
 lÃ¼thi can be a very good opportunity 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.099
 your house up to president then you've got years 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.099
 yes it serves several years the truth 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:07.749
 very well 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.550
 percent and him 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.660
 I have passed a note that there is a drain of talent in Mexico I ask this 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:17.300
 because the Mexican coach salvador nephew 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.710
 answer the australia team consider it as a brain drain or 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.139
 on the contrary it is good that Mexican coaches go 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.930
 to train vargas the redundancy to other elections and after they have the 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.530
 possibility of returning to our country and contributing what they learned were like 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.969
 you see that situation 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.589
 the truth is that it is 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.449
 if you put it a little hard 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:40.680
 m 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.810
 I can not tell you in this certain science what it is like right now in the 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.539
 nailed 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.889
 because he did not go to sit for a long time I think I still do not 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.080
 was born when I was already in australia 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.339
 percent 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.270
 I really considered him the very good coach 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.159
 but you would not like to have had 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.830
 to leave here to try to 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.339
 - Steel cd another new life 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:05.219
 percent 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.960
 we have very good mexican trainers here 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.360
 p all he says and guano we are giving the results 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:14.400
 I believe that 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.539
 that is not necessary 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:20.789
 bring coaches from other countries or what the Mexicans go 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.839
 I believe that everyone works better in their country with their people 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.419
 and well that's important that equip athlete feel happy with his 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.360
 coach 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.529
 and that block 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.529
 the import of opportunity to talk with savior in some 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.119
 competition to dialogue is to stay with him is great friend 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:39.930
 michetti was supporting us right now 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.099
 England 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:42.789
 in the preliminary 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:44.550

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.949
