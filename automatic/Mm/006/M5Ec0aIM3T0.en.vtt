that going on there but but but then
psychologically<00:02:58.090> if<00:02:58.210> you<00:02:58.330> look<00:02:58.450> at<00:02:58.600> people

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
psychologically if you look at people

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.820 
psychologically if you look at people
we're<00:02:59.650> all<00:02:59.770> made<00:03:00.010> up<00:03:00.220> very<00:03:00.820> very<00:03:00.970> differently

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
we're all made up very very differently

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.920 
we're all made up very very differently
almost<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:03.330> neuroscientific<00:03:04.330> level<00:03:04.750> that's

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
almost a neuroscientific level that's

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.990 
almost a neuroscientific level that's
rather<00:03:05.200> than<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.440> psychological<00:03:06.010> level<00:03:06.040> and

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
rather than a psychological level and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.600 
rather than a psychological level and
the<00:03:07.150> way<00:03:07.330> people<00:03:07.720> respond<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.500> fear<00:03:09.190> and

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
the way people respond to fear and

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.430 
the way people respond to fear and
excitement<00:03:10.980> changes<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:13.990> report<00:03:14.320> we

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
excitement changes and in this report we

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
excitement changes and in this report we
look<00:03:14.470> at<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:16.060> kind<00:03:16.420> of<00:03:16.480> intricate<00:03:17.460> goings-on

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
look at the kind of intricate goings-on

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.570 
look at the kind of intricate goings-on
within<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.120> brain<00:03:19.360> of<00:03:20.080> different<00:03:20.590> people<00:03:20.920> so

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
within the brain of different people so

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.640 
within the brain of different people so
it<00:03:21.730> says<00:03:21.910> there's<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.480> lot<00:03:22.660> more<00:03:22.900> really

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
it says there's a lot more really

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.800 
it says there's a lot more really
nowadays<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.180> roller<00:03:25.390> code<00:03:25.660> it's

nowadays to the the roller code it's

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.810 
nowadays to the the roller code it's
more<00:03:25.960> of<00:03:26.020> an<00:03:26.110> experience<00:03:26.200> let's<00:03:27.010> say<00:03:27.220> rather

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
more of an experience let's say rather

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.000 
more of an experience let's say rather
than<00:03:28.120> just<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.660> roller<00:03:28.900> coaster<00:03:29.050> it's<00:03:29.560> not<00:03:29.710> just

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
than just a roller coaster it's not just

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.130 
than just a roller coaster it's not just
sitting<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.430> car<00:03:30.640> for<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:31.240> minute<00:03:31.600> minute<00:03:31.990> and

the brain that are being played with is

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.610 
the brain that are being played with is
that<00:03:38.490> yet<00:03:39.490> that's<00:03:40.210> it<00:03:40.420> really<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:40.870> mean<00:03:41.380> what

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
that yet that's it really I mean what

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.910 
that yet that's it really I mean what
what<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.100> some<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.250> people<00:03:45.550> who<00:03:45.760> have

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
what the the some of the people who have

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.360 
what the the some of the people who have
studied<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.370> have<00:03:49.240> found<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.800> rides<00:03:50.800> often

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
studied this have found that rides often

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.660 
studied this have found that rides often
work<00:03:51.550> best<00:03:51.870> when<00:03:52.870> they<00:03:53.290> are<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.530> narrative<00:03:54.370> when

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
work best when they are a narrative when

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.430 
work best when they are a narrative when
they<00:03:54.790> tell<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.000> story<00:03:55.360> so<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:56.260> have<00:03:56.290> a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
they tell a story so you you have a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.930 
they tell a story so you you have a
build<00:03:56.770> up<00:03:57.040> where<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.400> create<00:03:57.910> the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
build up where you create the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.110 
build up where you create the
trepidation<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.140> anticipation<00:04:00.120> when

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
trepidation and the anticipation when

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.820 
trepidation and the anticipation when
you're<00:04:01.270> queueing<00:04:01.750> perhaps<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.500> when<00:04:02.710> you're

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
you're queueing perhaps and when you're

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.510 
you're queueing perhaps and when you're
looking<00:04:03.010> at<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.460> a<00:04:03.600> massive<00:04:05.220> track<00:04:06.220> that
