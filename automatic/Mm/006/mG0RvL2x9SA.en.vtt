course<00:02:20.230> you've<00:02:20.380> got<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.770> smog<00:02:21.069> as<00:02:21.400> well<00:02:21.819> that

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
course you've got the smog as well that

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.620 
course you've got the smog as well that
that<00:02:23.170> really<00:02:23.470> helps<00:02:23.890> differentiate<00:02:24.630> Lewis

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
that really helps differentiate Lewis

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.140 
that really helps differentiate Lewis
and<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.319> rest<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.800> enemy<00:02:27.190> from<00:02:27.910> our

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
here is we basically have the a case

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.080

the ak-47 so most people are going to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.869 
the ak-47 so most people are going to
refer<00:02:42.579> to<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.939> as<00:02:43.150> an<00:02:43.769> ak-47<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.189> reality<00:02:45.760> is

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
refer to this as an ak-47 the reality is

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.740 
refer to this as an ak-47 the reality is
is<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> more<00:02:46.810> modern<00:02:47.170> version<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.650> 74

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
is this is a more modern version of 74

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.300 
is this is a more modern version of 74
again<00:02:49.750> when<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.049> think<00:02:50.319> of<00:02:50.439> terrorists<00:02:51.069> you

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
again when you think of terrorists you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.550 
again when you think of terrorists you
think<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.700> insurgents<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.659> think<00:02:53.260> most

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
think of insurgents I think most

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.740 
think of insurgents I think most
Americans<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.579> for<00:02:55.209> that<00:02:55.329> matter<00:02:55.569> most

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
Americans and for that matter most

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.559 
Americans and for that matter most
audiences<00:02:56.290> around<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.859> world<00:02:57.569> automatically

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
audiences around the world automatically

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.080 
audiences around the world automatically
consider<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.220> ak-47<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.430> as<00:03:00.579> soon<00:03:00.730> as<00:03:00.879> someone

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
consider the ak-47 so as soon as someone

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.960 
consider the ak-47 so as soon as someone
sees<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.510> ak-47<00:03:02.409> for<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.280> majority<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.760> your

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
sees the ak-47 for the majority of your

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.789 
sees the ak-47 for the majority of your
audience<00:03:04.120> they're<00:03:04.900> going<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.140> assume<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.739> is

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
audience they're going to assume this is

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.009 
audience they're going to assume this is
an<00:03:06.069> enemy<00:03:06.220> character<00:03:06.909> so<00:03:07.450> again<00:03:07.629> here<00:03:07.810> we<00:03:07.840> have

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
an enemy character so again here we have

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.369 
an enemy character so again here we have
the<00:03:08.200> full<00:03:08.409> size<00:03:08.879> ak-47<00:03:09.900> here<00:03:10.900> we've<00:03:11.109> got<00:03:11.139> a

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
the full size ak-47 here we've got a

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.460 
the full size ak-47 here we've got a
smaller<00:03:11.920> version<00:03:12.459> this<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.690> close<00:03:14.019> quarter

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
smaller version this is a close quarter

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.379 
smaller version this is a close quarter
combat<00:03:14.500> version<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:15.670> you'll<00:03:15.819> see<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
combat version so you'll see that the

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.920 
combat version so you'll see that the
forearm<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.530> much<00:03:18.159> smaller<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:19.180> barrel<00:03:19.690> is

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
forearm is much smaller the barrel is

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.929 
forearm is much smaller the barrel is
shorter<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.620> then<00:03:21.040> we've<00:03:21.189> got<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.370> folding

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
shorter and then we've got the folding

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.110 
shorter and then we've got the folding
stock<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.889> far<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.250> two<00:03:24.430> weapons<00:03:24.879> that<00:03:24.970> I've

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
stock so far the two weapons that I've

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.869 
stock so far the two weapons that I've
showed<00:03:25.359> you<00:03:25.389> are<00:03:25.780> very<00:03:26.670> realistic<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.849> terms

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
showed you are very realistic in terms

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.119 
showed you are very realistic in terms
of<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.359> actual<00:03:28.540> weapons<00:03:29.349> being<00:03:29.590> used<00:03:29.680> by<00:03:30.069> the

shotgun as I've said before is pretty

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.520 
shotgun as I've said before is pretty
common<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.150> see<00:03:43.419> among<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.810> insurgents<00:03:44.379> in

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
common to see among the insurgents in

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.430 
the shorter AK close quarter combat
version<00:03:54.819> are<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.449> choices<00:03:55.569> that<00:03:55.840> we've<00:03:56.109> made

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
version are the choices that we've made

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.430 
version are the choices that we've made
for<00:03:56.470> our<00:03:56.799> enemy<00:03:57.400> now<00:03:58.329> again<00:03:58.959> if<00:03:59.079> you<00:03:59.199> were<00:03:59.319> to

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
for our enemy now again if you were to

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.229 
for our enemy now again if you were to
go<00:03:59.530> on<00:03:59.739> google<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.430> were<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.849> do<00:04:01.000> some

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
go on google and you were to do some

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.970 
go on google and you were to do some
research<00:04:01.419> on<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.260> insurgents<00:04:02.799> and<00:04:02.889> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
research on the insurgents and the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.920 
research on the insurgents and the
philippines<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.970> would<00:04:04.150> see<00:04:04.359> that<00:04:04.389> it's<00:04:04.690> very

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
philippines you would see that it's very

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.949 
philippines you would see that it's very
common<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.919> insurgents<00:04:06.430> will<00:04:06.579> use<00:04:06.959> m16s

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
common that the insurgents will use m16s

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.680 
common that the insurgents will use m16s
and<00:04:08.079> other<00:04:08.680> surplus<00:04:09.340> American<00:04:10.000> weapons<00:04:10.389> and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
and other surplus American weapons and

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.839 
and other surplus American weapons and
again<00:04:11.349> I<00:04:11.379> made<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.799> conscious<00:04:12.159> decision<00:04:12.370> to

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
again I made a conscious decision to

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.909 
again I made a conscious decision to
stay<00:04:13.180> away<00:04:13.510> from<00:04:13.569> that<00:04:13.810> even<00:04:14.650> though<00:04:14.739> it's

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
stay away from that even though it's

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.009 
stay away from that even though it's
realistic<00:04:15.370> those<00:04:16.150> weapons<00:04:16.419> are<00:04:16.780> too

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
realistic those weapons are too

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.259 
realistic those weapons are too
reminiscent<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:18.489> weapons<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.000> are
