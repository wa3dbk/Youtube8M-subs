00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.670
 and a very good performance boat 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.910
 this boat is a new model in 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.590
 reality is renewed is not it if 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.260

 renovating more stylized lines 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.230
 achieving better internal conformity 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.450

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.510
 the latest modifications it makes to 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.730

 the engine the engine we recommend 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.030
 150 horses in this case the brand of 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.340
 well route that is an engine that has 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.130
 Three-year warranty is an engine that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.959
 can take to the south lakes because 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.970
 having direct oil injection no 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.340
 pollutes the environment there is no smoke 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.420
 there is no smell there is no oil in the river in 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.620
 the water the lakes so that allows and 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.970
 what one can take you anywhere 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.060
 of the world is a motor that at 2700 turns 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.890
 you were already regulating the speed of 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.950
 glide 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.770
 he developed a speed of 45 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.230

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.150
 as you said at the beginning is a 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.420
