00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.189
 sometimes you can not just silence the question of meaning 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.649
 during a night ride against the clock for example from 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.099
 south through Germany under the tables to the Austrian border 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.260
 the highway a7 is the scene of a kind of Cameron Volvo XC 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.050
 Background of the event no commercial 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.099
 by the thermal m6 by ac Schnitzer acts as the main actor 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.210
 much with 552 hp and a top speed of 325 kilometers 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.210
 in front of dumb 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.660
 Full throttle as long as no speed limit brakes 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.030
 unwritten rule of this nighting the fever more than 1000 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 Motorway kilometer should go 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.430
 after 40 minutes, the ten-cylinder technical Hamburg approaches 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 After three quarters of an hour, we drive through the Elbtunnel 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.670
 Average speed up to now 212 kilometers per hour 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.520
 And now it follows only a completely flat three tracks of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.240
 Route section direction Hannover 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.240
 it is one o'clock at night 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.170
 despite the first refueling stop, the average speed continues to climb 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.439
 Although there are delays here, a construction site should slow down 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.840
 By the way, all speed limits are meticulously respected by bad press 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.130
 you can not afford it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.130
 ac carvers 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.320
 that the consumption values ​​of the m6 technical at full load they are around the 30 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.750
 Liters are not really surprising 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.750
 the question of meaning does not arise here 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.930
 the second fuel stop we experience behind Hildesheim at the rest stop Cards West 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.290
 but every second counts and the sex does not stand longer than 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.829
 necessary 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.829
 Hunold 70 liters Super Plus to take 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.729
 the driver changes 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:40.549
 in front of the orange 6% lie the Kassler mountains now is torque 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.549
 asked 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.239
 Tempo 300 and more is possible on German roads that documented 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.239
 This nightly drive impressive 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.090
 for imitation that is not recommended the risk of others 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.200
 Underestimating road users is simply too big 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.929
 the traffic is increasing and it is now 4 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.929
 important and stop have the helpers 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:24.209
 the sports suspension and the high-performance brake system one 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.209
 indispensable basis for this express freight 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.250
 the average speed is still lower despite minor disabilities 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:39.599
 well above the 200th Nama Creek including refueling, mind you 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.929
 highest concentration in seventh gear approaches the thermal 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.929
 Munich Ring 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.989
 Change to the motorway in the direction of Salzburg 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.989
 the speed limit is on tour again 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.649
 a cut of 206 kilometers per hour 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:04.899
 almost unbelievable given four refueling stops 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:08.729
 Cherries that the truck-columns become poets the last hundred kilometers 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:09.689
 are approaching 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.689
 conventional approaches the German-Austrian border 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.169
 Tyrol is ahead of us after a good five hours driving time, the rest is a formality 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.270
 down from the highway and at dawn over to the old one 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.170
 Border station to Kiefersfelden the journey time a total of five hours and 14 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.819
 Minutes equals an average of 204 kilometers per hour 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.039
 and we have nothing of it now but as I said this question wanted so synonymous 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.169
 do not ask 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.979
 the stand supervision 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.469
 in the upper street so possible Oesterle
