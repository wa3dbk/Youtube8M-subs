expected
this<00:02:09.730> episode<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.470> new<00:02:11.650> opening<00:02:11.890> because

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
this episode was a new opening because

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.760 
this episode was a new opening because
we<00:02:12.910> are<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.360> new<00:02:13.630> one<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.260> we<00:02:14.380> are<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.740> new

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
we are on new one and we are in a new

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.940 
we are on new one and we are in a new
story<00:02:15.310> arc<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.760> all<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.770> expected<00:02:17.770> like<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
story arc and all that I expected like a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.630 
story arc and all that I expected like a
new<00:02:18.190> opening<00:02:18.460> but<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.390> didn't<00:02:19.720> get<00:02:19.960> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
new opening but we didn't get it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.200 
new opening but we didn't get it
probably<00:02:21.640> because<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.670> studio<00:02:25.000> doesn't

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
probably because the the studio doesn't

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.630 
probably because the the studio doesn't
want<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.690> like<00:02:25.840> spoiled<00:02:26.380> paper<00:02:26.620> or<00:02:27.040> what's
