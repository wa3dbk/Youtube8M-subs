the<00:01:11.860> magnetic<00:01:12.280> grenade<00:01:12.580> um<00:01:12.850> just<00:01:13.840> because<00:01:14.080> I

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
the magnetic grenade um just because I

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.860 
the magnetic grenade um just because I

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
could deny areas and I also maxed for

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.649 
could deny areas and I also maxed for
armor<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.850> little<00:01:19.000> recovery<00:01:19.330> that's

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
armor and the little recovery that's

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.380 
armor and the little recovery that's
left<00:01:19.930> after<00:01:20.140> that<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.850> found<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:21.970> armor<00:01:22.299> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
left after that I found that armor and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.719 
left after that I found that armor and
agility<00:01:22.630> didn't<00:01:23.530> really<00:01:23.740> work<00:01:23.950> for<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.340> 3v3
