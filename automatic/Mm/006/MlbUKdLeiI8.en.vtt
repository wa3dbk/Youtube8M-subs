00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.450
 to 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:19.200
 hello how about how video 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.600
 a tutorial to make a cannon 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.170
 potions of damage 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.450
 for example here we have level 1 level 2 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.210
 level 3 depending on where we put the 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.730
 tnt will go farther or closer 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.620
 the position then now let's put 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:44.480
 level 1 in the barn 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.480
 with everything my name for someone 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.350
 this button we run 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.980
 we see that a fired firing comes out 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.410
 every year now we have approved with the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.420
 level 2 that is further away still 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.589
 let's go fast 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.589
 where they have 2 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.229
 They see that I was there but I was already 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.250
 testing 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.250
 those points 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.210
 of the animals that remained 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.480
 then you can escape 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.140
 this one tries with these challenges 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.000
 can not 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.000
 now let's try level 3 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.880
 we learn the button and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.659
 let's go where it was 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.659
 went outside 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.250
 the thing is that we're going to learn how 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.510
 do a cannon equal but first 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.510
 let's do against these 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.009
 or medical move 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.009
 out outside 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.590
 they do not leave me they do not let me 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.770
 good today 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.000
 God 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.610
 two 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.910
 well we send the nation 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.590
 like how to do this 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.810
 how do you do this time 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.810
 first we make a row of four 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.810
 Couples 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.180
 in this we put the dispenser looking at the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.430
 Water 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:54.000
 We made a hole for water to follow 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.599
 Now the next thing is to put the cuts 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.599
 repeat 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.760
 and from here we go 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.990
 23 42 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.350
 this 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.350
 plus 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.220
 now we join the party 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.060
 and this we put 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.060
 what yes 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.930
 now what would be missing would be 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.629
 damage positions or one thing do not forget 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.579
 here there were remains since I had counted 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.950
 that were four actually this is 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.450
 remove and they are in total 5 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.480
 to do so that there is time 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.640
 enough for the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.440
 the position can come out right in the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.440
 moment that you try 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.720
 it works perfectly 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.730
 well you can see as anxiety justly 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:15.180
 to cnt and throw it then I can 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:18.510
 you could cover it so discover 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.510
 just like the other 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:28.260
 and this is also a canyon 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.510
 in a different way 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:38.540
 this is good because things do not 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.140
 they break the floor and nothing around them 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.470
 they only take the damage to the one that is 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.470
 crazy 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.759
 and they only hurt then it serves 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.889
 enough to attack someone without 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.710
 need to destroy 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:01.129
 well then that was it with the seal 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.319
 liked and so please I ask them a like 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.620
 see you until next time 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.620
 goodbye
