00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
right here in the corner where it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.130 
right here in the corner where it
bridges<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> gap<00:02:32.209> between<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.660> two<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:32.990> kind

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
bridges the gap between the two and kind

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.780 
bridges the gap between the two and kind
of<00:02:33.260> holds<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.920> it's<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.400> don't<00:02:34.670> say<00:02:34.760> a

of holds it in and it's I don't say a
little<00:02:35.090> stable<00:02:35.390> it's<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.870> really<00:02:36.110> thick<00:02:36.380> gauge

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
little stable it's a really thick gauge

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.340 
little stable it's a really thick gauge
stable<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:38.090> then<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.330> put<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:39.050> front

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
stable and then you put in the front

beautiful<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.080> door<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.470> then<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.040> put<00:02:43.310> in

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
beautiful that door and then you put in

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.360 
beautiful that door and then you put in
lastly<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.180> panel<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:45.560> got<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.040> make<00:02:46.160> sure

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
lastly this panel you got to make sure

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.070 
lastly this panel you got to make sure
there's<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.700> little<00:02:46.970> panel<00:02:47.600> down<00:02:47.720> here<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:47.989> the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
there's a little panel down here on the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.610 
there's a little panel down here on the
floor<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:49.820> take<00:02:50.090> off<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:51.110> connect<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
floor that you take off to connect the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.140 
floor that you take off to connect the
floor<00:02:51.890> heater<00:02:52.130> there's<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.489> floor<00:02:52.730> heater<00:02:52.880> and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
floor heater there's a floor heater and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.390 
floor heater there's a floor heater and
all<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.930> electricity<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:54.590> need<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.920> to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
all the electricity you just need to to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.610 
all the electricity you just need to to
make<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.670> connections<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:57.290> then<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.530> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
make the connections and then in the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.380 
make the connections and then in the
ceiling<00:02:58.040> there's<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.550> couple<00:02:58.850> places<00:02:59.030> where

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
ceiling there's a couple places where

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.610 
ceiling there's a couple places where
you<00:02:59.510> need<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.750> make<00:02:59.780> connections<00:03:00.320> for<00:03:00.470> all<00:03:00.530> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
you need to make connections for all the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.770 
you need to make connections for all the
heater<00:03:00.800> so<00:03:01.070> heater<00:03:01.700> here<00:03:02.150> there's<00:03:02.690> a

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
heater so heater here there's a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.090 
heater so heater here there's a
connection<00:03:03.170> up<00:03:03.380> there<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.769> need<00:03:03.950> to

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
connection up there that you need to

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.400 
connection up there that you need to
make<00:03:04.280> heater<00:03:05.090> here<00:03:05.510> there's<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.840> connection<00:03:06.170> up

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
make heater here there's a connection up

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.960 
make heater here there's a connection up
there<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.680> need<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.860> make<00:03:06.950> heaters<00:03:07.730> here

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
there you need to make heaters here

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.370 
there you need to make heaters here
connection<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.690> then<00:03:08.870> in<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.050> front<00:03:09.260> there's

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
connection and then in the front there's

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.770 
connection and then in the front there's
a<00:03:09.530> small<00:03:09.800> heater<00:03:10.010> as<00:03:10.130> well<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:11.300> there's<00:03:11.480> one

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
a small heater as well so there's one

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.970 
a small heater as well so there's one
two<00:03:12.130> three<00:03:13.239> four<00:03:14.239> five<00:03:14.840> heaters<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.800> is

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
two three four five heaters but this is

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.740 
two three four five heaters but this is
probably<00:03:16.730> an<00:03:16.880> extra<00:03:17.090> one<00:03:17.269> so<00:03:17.300> I<00:03:17.480> would<00:03:17.540> say

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
probably an extra one so I would say

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.190 
probably an extra one so I would say
that<00:03:17.900> six<00:03:18.140> heaters<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.900> I'll<00:03:20.900> tell<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.170> a

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
that six heaters and I'll tell you a

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.600 
that six heaters and I'll tell you a
little<00:03:21.230> bit<00:03:21.410> more<00:03:21.769> about<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.070> performance

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
little bit more about the performance

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.790 
little bit more about the performance
later
