 program uned booty and taking the picture 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.679
 did some operating system of some 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:13.130
 in software, now we start 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:16.759
 we will extract what is on Monday mo 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.640
 time the right and extract action les 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.759
 will leave a folder the folder only 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.759
 with title contains the program that 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.759
 let's use let's click 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.030
 right and run as administrator in 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.290
 the case of windows xp only double 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.200
 click 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.440
 once it opens it will be here in 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.010
 the interface of what the program is and 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.180
 we have to have a sample gen usb 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.730
 mine preferably that the usb be that 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.270
 you format to have nothing like 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.740
 come has nothing and to format what 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.100
 only thing that we have to be is click 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.060
 right format here the come out as 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.390
 this and initial 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.090
 of accepting and automatically this form 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.810
 they have their sb 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.420
 but he will lose his files so 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.240
 save them somewhere else 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.340
 and good once it is of our usb 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:26.739
 clean formatted let's start here 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:31.360
 we choose the stew option in this part 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:35.590
 floppy disk and made floor silos 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.970
 here in priority type let's mark your 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.250
 usb drive 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.630
 in the unit we have to verify 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.580
 what letter is assigned to our 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.660
 our usb in my case how can 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.440
 observe in the letter i then here what 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.840
 I leave it as it is and in this part 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.740
 let's choose the route where 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.590
 find the system 20 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.570
 because forgiveness the system that they were going to 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.130
 use in this case I'm going to flip 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.260
 the baby system 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:16.030
 we are going to open and we are going to accept 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.860
 want you have these options you have 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.640
 already modified so that no 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.570
 error we will accept and automatically 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.060
 is starting to flip what our 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.209
 usb 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.330
 and good as you see, it does not take anything at all 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.599
 these materials that we are going to occupy for 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.730
 be in the description of the video and by 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.720

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.810
 Facebook page 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.270

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.239
 and in the meantime I want to thank you for 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.420
 the support that the videos send almost 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.120
 we reached 600 subscribers 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.990
 true thank you very much day 10 the ones that I 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.730
 follow 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.730

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.069
 and here one 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:18.030
 to see once the 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:20.310
 drip of our from our usb says that 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.229
 we have to restart now I do not 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.240
 I do but you do it because it's very 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.340
 convenient since if they can not arise 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.240
 errors when flipping and I 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.240
