start recording some of these things I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.649 
start recording some of these things I
do<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.460> they're<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.700> complete<00:01:09.210> waste<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.600> my

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
do so they're not complete waste of my

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
time but yeah I do this a lot on the

I<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.939> somebody<00:01:29.939> sent<00:01:30.360> me<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.250> world<00:01:32.250> map<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
I I somebody sent me the world map and I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
I I somebody sent me the world map and I
promptly<00:01:33.780> lost<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.470> my<00:01:34.590> computer<00:01:34.880> so

anyway you can get all the way up here
and<00:01:41.479> yeah<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.930> pretty<00:01:43.020> cool<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and yeah I think it's pretty cool I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.819 
and yeah I think it's pretty cool I
think<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.189> tall<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:45.380> if<00:01:46.380> i'm

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
think it's as tall as you can get if i'm

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.520 
think it's as tall as you can get if i'm
not<00:01:46.920> mistaken<00:01:49.100> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.250 

yeah<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.580> went<00:01:53.760> off<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.750> good<00:01:54.990> thing<00:01:55.140> it's

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
yeah so I went off think good thing it's

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.740 
yeah so I went off think good thing it's
