00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.440
 next we will work with the object drawing mode iberostar the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.810
 granddaughters of simple drawing 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.989
 we started creating a new document 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:10.909
 i go to choose 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.909
 the tool 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.990
 this time we are going to make sure that the way of using objects if this one 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.150
 activate what is this engine 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.079
 we click or it does not appear 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.299
 a dark gray below the icon we know that this activated 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.089
 we go to a document and we create our figure 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.229
 the difference of t them drawing mode to the combined 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.740
 these figures are already protected and are not so delicate 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.979
 to others that are next or over 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.979
 we can try this by creating another figure 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.280
 and look at it, darla does not affect the previous one 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.350
 just like in the combined drawing mode here we can also move 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.610
 in a flexible way 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.100
 our figures 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.200
 just that you have to take into account that before you avoid them for example if I 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.020
 I stand on the edge of this circle and tried to avoid clicking 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.910
 To assess the reliability of sewers is to move it 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.070
 this is because the figure is selected here 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.940
 so that the part of the flexible division works I have to click 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.090
 can you object 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 then I stand on the edge 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.770
 with the cursor changes I click stepchild 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.500
 there does work 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.799
 so remember to be able to paint the kick that is not selected 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.230
 but they are attached outside elsewhere 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.370
 and now we can change it 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.380
 perfect 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 another important feature of the mode 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.430
 of objects is that to change the properties of the river odiel 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.380
 outline we have to go select 1 there was another individually but that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.370
 we simply click on the figure 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.540
 and in the properties panel we can change 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.770
 one with the other 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.429
 without having to select the 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.909
 individually we click for example on the path we change the color 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.210
 also in the project 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.150
 from the way 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.380
 very simple 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.870
 we change in size 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.850
 of the transplant and in 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.890
 the style itself 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.420
 if we want it to be with shots and we want them to be in some other way 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.589
 and we can also change other values ​​that we will see later on then 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.479
 assuming about the drawing mode of objects we understand that the figures are 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:22.049
 create 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.120
 in a way or less fragile as they come grouped together we can also change 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.389
 easily the feature without having to choose 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.929
 each item individually and the layout that the fill is treated as a 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:34.730
 single element 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.180
 if we move in its time unlike other mode of drawing 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.789
 then we will see the simple drawing tools 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:45.409
 that although its name indicates it is a simple sexually it can be done 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.469
 very interesting things with 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.159
 these two tools that are the together that are 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.659
 under the first 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.919
 tremosa quique tool rectangles simple and tool or west 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.949
 let's start with clearly rectangle we always click 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.949
 then in the document we are clicas clás 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:06.229
 we have 1 rectangle that is common and current however when we go to 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.329
 stop of properties 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.190
 we see some options d the mission 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.689
 this figure already create for example 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.829
 the consul in the rectangle we can change here 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.589
 the roundness of the corners 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.209
 of our figure 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.149
 can be 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.449
 inward can also be 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.089
 out as we see the example 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.199
 If we want to return to that original, we simply press the button 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.999
 restore 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.400
 yes we want 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.569
 different pure curves for each corner of the square we press this 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.159
 chain and so we tell you 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.159
 that we do not want the values ​​to be the same for all the corners 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.269
 and this way we increase the value of the corner let's say 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.729
 upper left 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.739
 see how only that value is modified 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.739
 if we do it with the lower right corner 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.199
 we have now 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.719
 a different curvature for each 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.779
 we set 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.779
 and we left it as it was in an original way 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.509
 if we try now with 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.509
 the tool of how not simple 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.479
 we also see some interesting editing capabilities 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.930
 we are click the figure in the properties panel we can change the radius 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.219
 inside 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:25.169
 good figure to create so some circles with the police and if you 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.319
 in the middle 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.319
 if we remove the past we can weigh a little better 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.160
 that we carry as it is a circle same hour 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.279
 and totally stuffed however to regret another interior 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.589
 we see how we have other types of figures we can do 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.680
 with this option 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.890
 here we have the initial angle that indicates where from where 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.849
 will begin the circumference 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.400
 of our object 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.400
 and the final angle where it ends 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.270
 we see then that the tools of simple form is 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.659
 are similar to those in the object drawing mode with the difference 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.720
 that we can adjust the values ​​of the figure without having 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.370
 to make mistakes again 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.100
 in the next elections we will see how these techniques are combined and 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.879
 apply to create graphics 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:16.749
 Interesting
