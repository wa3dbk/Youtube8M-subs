truism just like how it is on the field
and<00:03:32.019> I've<00:03:32.200> yet<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.470> see<00:03:32.590> almost<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.580> same

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
and I've yet to see almost the same

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.520 
and I've yet to see almost the same
thing<00:03:34.060> twice<00:03:34.300> minus<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.810> hit<00:03:34.959> stick<00:03:35.230> but

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
thing twice minus a hit stick but

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.920 
thing twice minus a hit stick but
sars-like<00:03:36.190> catches<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.030> midair<00:03:37.510> collisions

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
sars-like catches and midair collisions

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.690 
sars-like catches and midair collisions
I've<00:03:38.050> yet<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.290> see<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.560> same<00:03:38.860> animation<00:03:39.280> twice

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
I've yet to see the same animation twice

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.020 
I've yet to see the same animation twice
my<00:03:40.300> only<00:03:40.480> uh<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:42.070> know<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.489> guess<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.880> could

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
my only uh you know I guess you could

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.300 
my only uh you know I guess you could
say<00:03:43.239> issue<00:03:43.540> with<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.050> affinity<00:03:44.650> engine<00:03:45.100> and

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
say issue with the affinity engine and

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.190 
say issue with the affinity engine and
i'm<00:03:45.400> pretty<00:03:45.700> sure<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.390> producers<00:03:46.780> down

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
i'm pretty sure that the producers down

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.080 
i'm pretty sure that the producers down
there<00:03:47.410> know<00:03:47.590> about<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.190> that<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.970> know

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
there know about it is that you know

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.810 
there know about it is that you know
it's<00:03:49.269> kind<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.830> kind<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:50.920> rubbery<00:03:51.370> i<00:03:51.580> guess

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
it's kind of a kind of rubbery i guess

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.100 
it's kind of a kind of rubbery i guess
you<00:03:51.940> could<00:03:52.090> say<00:03:52.269> you<00:03:52.330> know<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.600> players<00:03:52.840> kind

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
you could say you know the players kind

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.020 
you could say you know the players kind
of<00:03:53.200> get<00:03:53.440> up<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.890> know<00:03:54.010> weird<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.910> know

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
of get up you know weird and you know

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.400 
of get up you know weird and you know
harness<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.480> be<00:03:55.540> kind<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.840> like<00:03:55.989> falling

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
harness to be kind of like falling

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.720 
harness to be kind of like falling
behind<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.800> back<00:03:56.980> but<00:03:57.190> i<00:03:57.250> know<00:03:57.310> that's<00:03:57.580> all

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
behind the back but i know that's all

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.370 
behind the back but i know that's all
part<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.120> physics<00:03:58.540> party<00:03:58.720> once<00:03:59.170> they<00:03:59.320> to

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
part of the physics party once they to

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.070 
part of the physics party once they to
net<00:03:59.739> up<00:03:59.950> no<00:04:00.580> man<00:04:00.790> 13<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.330> gonna<00:04:01.510> be<00:04:01.660> even<00:04:01.900> a

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
net up no man 13 is gonna be even a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.120 
net up no man 13 is gonna be even a
bigger<00:04:02.320> monster

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
bigger monster

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.190 
bigger monster
it<00:04:03.190> already<00:04:03.460> is<00:04:03.750> one<00:04:04.750> thing<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:04.960> I<00:04:05.140> did

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
it already is one thing that I did

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.110 
it already is one thing that I did
notice<00:04:05.560> about<00:04:05.770> playing<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.400> game<00:04:06.610> is<00:04:06.880> that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
notice about playing the game is that

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.720 
notice about playing the game is that
you<00:04:07.870> know<00:04:08.050> based<00:04:08.560> on<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.830> physicality<00:04:09.250> if

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
you know based on the physicality if

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.580 
you know based on the physicality if
you're<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.910> small<00:04:10.240> player<00:04:10.630> you<00:04:11.020> really<00:04:11.350> can't

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
you're a small player you really can't

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.920 
you're a small player you really can't
expect<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.130> truck<00:04:12.400> someone<00:04:12.820> but<00:04:13.540> at<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.720> same

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
expect to truck someone but at the same

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.680 
expect to truck someone but at the same
time<00:04:14.200> your<00:04:14.530> size<00:04:14.800> can<00:04:15.250> be<00:04:15.490> an<00:04:15.760> asset<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.540> as

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
time your size can be an asset to you as

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.750 
time your size can be an asset to you as
far<00:04:16.930> as<00:04:17.020> making<00:04:17.200> tackle<00:04:17.739> say<00:04:18.370> friendship

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
far as making tackle say friendship

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.860 
far as making tackle say friendship
you're<00:04:18.880> going<00:04:19.030> out<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.270> tackle<00:04:19.630> Darren

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
you're going out to tackle Darren

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.440 
you're going out to tackle Darren
Sproles<00:04:20.140> you<00:04:21.010> go<00:04:21.160> high<00:04:21.430> on<00:04:21.640> him<00:04:21.850> you're

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
Sproles you go high on him you're

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.850 
Sproles you go high on him you're
grabbing<00:04:22.720> nothing<00:04:22.960> but<00:04:23.260> air<00:04:23.410> because<00:04:23.710> he's

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
grabbing nothing but air because he's

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.830 
grabbing nothing but air because he's
all<00:04:24.010> about<00:04:24.130> five<00:04:24.490> foot<00:04:24.730> something<00:04:25.240> yeah

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
all about five foot something yeah

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.690 
all about five foot something yeah
absolutely<00:04:26.080> another<00:04:27.070> thing<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.370> notice<00:04:27.670> about

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
absolutely another thing I notice about

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.640 
absolutely another thing I notice about
running<00:04:28.390> is<00:04:28.510> that<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.720> lot<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:29.020> times<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.410> played

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
running is that a lot of times I played

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.140 
running is that a lot of times I played
now<00:04:29.860> see<00:04:30.130> what<00:04:30.310> madness<00:04:30.520> doing<00:04:30.910> with<00:04:31.030> this

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
now see what madness doing with this

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.090 
now see what madness doing with this
making<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.600> more<00:04:31.720> realistic<00:04:32.230> you<00:04:32.650> know<00:04:32.680> in

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
making it more realistic you know in

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.740 
making it more realistic you know in
terms<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:33.580> running<00:04:33.880> into<00:04:33.940> your<00:04:34.240> home<00:04:34.390> player

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
terms like running into your home player

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.680 
terms like running into your home player
and<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.890> know<00:04:35.980> I<00:04:36.010> last<00:04:36.430> year<00:04:36.640> you<00:04:36.790> can<00:04:36.940> even

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
and you know I last year you can even

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.090 
and you know I last year you can even
almost<00:04:37.990> like<00:04:38.110> run<00:04:38.320> through<00:04:38.530> your<00:04:38.650> players<00:04:38.890> and

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
almost like run through your players and

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.410 
almost like run through your players and
keep<00:04:39.280> moving<00:04:39.670> or<00:04:39.760> they<00:04:39.880> will<00:04:40.000> keep<00:04:40.150> going

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
keep moving or they will keep going

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.790 
keep moving or they will keep going
because<00:04:40.600> it's<00:04:40.840> almost<00:04:41.140> like<00:04:41.320> they<00:04:41.440> weren't<00:04:41.620> a

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
because it's almost like they weren't a

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.460 
because it's almost like they weren't a
true<00:04:42.040> object<00:04:42.250> but<00:04:42.700> this<00:04:42.880> year<00:04:43.210> like<00:04:43.960> if<00:04:44.290> you

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
true object but this year like if you

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.050 
true object but this year like if you
got<00:04:44.650> an<00:04:44.740> open<00:04:45.010> field<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.640> you<00:04:45.730> do<00:04:45.850> have<00:04:46.000> a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
got an open field and you do have a

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.630 
got an open field and you do have a
cross<00:04:46.360> route<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.260> players<00:04:47.560> collide<00:04:48.310> like

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
cross route and the players collide like

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.040 
cross route and the players collide like
you<00:04:48.730> can<00:04:48.850> run<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.300> plane<00:04:49.510> I<00:04:49.690> can<00:04:49.840> cost

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
you can run to you on a plane I can cost

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.510 
you can run to you on a plane I can cost
you<00:04:50.170> a<00:04:50.260> touchdown<00:04:50.680> just<00:04:50.920> like<00:04:51.070> how<00:04:51.250> it<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.490> a

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
you a touchdown just like how it is a

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.130 
you a touchdown just like how it is a
real<00:04:51.790> life<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.240> know<00:04:52.330> since<00:04:52.600> we<00:04:52.720> had<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:52.870> little

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
real life you know since we had a little

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.380 
real life you know since we had a little
early<00:04:53.410> actually<00:04:53.710> play<00:04:53.980> with<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.250> BD<00:04:54.640> kill<00:04:55.060> up<00:04:55.240> at

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
early actually play with a BD kill up at

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.870 
early actually play with a BD kill up at
the<00:04:55.480> office<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:56.200> one<00:04:56.920> thing<00:04:56.950> that<00:04:57.190> makes<00:04:57.520> mad

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
the office and one thing that makes mad
