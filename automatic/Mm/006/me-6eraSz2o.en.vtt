00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.560
 a nice accessory that has just come out in stores is the polaroid pogo 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.120
 it's a pocket printer you have the dimensions are are minimal stands 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.249
 in one hand 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.369
 twitter runs on battery and then d 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.460
 recharging with its charger then nothing a display that simply has me 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.100
 this 2 get out 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.380
 on and off and has a vsb port on which to connect and portable devices but 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.800
 the funny thing that also works wireless so it works with the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.339
 bluetooth does not charge inside charge approx 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.270
 10 sheets opens 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.830
 so elite the card is a special card this one that is marked 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.310
 behind the polaroids we say produced specifically because this 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.079
 printer has no inks 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.670
 are based 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 assumed is to a system that is called 0 inter that this one 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.820
 which hub practically insert some crystals of ink dento the paper 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.850
 which are then graded by arcs until the machine is running at 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.120
 paper 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.120
 fits 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.410
 inside the device 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.380
 turns on again 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.370
 the ex machine we now do a test for example we want to print one 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.329
 photo from 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.520
 phone with my wife no phone whatever it is 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.290
 this case is a new system so to change android we go on 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.740
 camera we take a picture that we took recently for example 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.120
 this one 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.850
 ok we want to print this 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.380
 photography then I and I say to share this image 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.380
 all through the bluetooth system 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.229
 I choose 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.229
 the polaroid and identified head 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.179
 I am asked the polaroid code is that 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.799
 price in this case you know 0 0 0 0 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.099
 okaidi 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.819
 if you see the spy here 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.159
 the device started flashing got to this 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.500
 killer transfer is taking place 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.990
 and about as soon as the transfer is finished it takes about a minute 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.990
 the printers start to work and you hear the noise 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.480
 soon you will see the sheet of paper come out with 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.590
 photography obviously formed 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.180
 it's very small quality and pretty low amateur 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:59.209
 let's say so they take around with friends to have a picture that 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.300
 actually 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.320
 there is a photo that we can show 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.790
 to the hiragana friends and when we took our picture there is finally 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.300
 this tool that 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.150
 I must admit 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.589
 miss ago to have the photographers of the era of typing 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.570
 here it is the photo is out of course it makes me a little 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.740
 a little bit of cooked and the orgullo quality I can secure and it is not the best but it is 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.940
 similar to that of the old polaroid the funny thing is that the photo is a 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.759
 adhesive 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.399
 so you can detach the perpendicular 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:39.009
 in the back because it makes it a nice gadget to stick to where 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.369
 the more you like it then just unplug the film 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:45.569
 in a moment 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.460
 you managed to do it, here it is 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.090
 is a sticker which opens laptop pc door cost that I have not moved now is 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.039
 completely 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:58.729
 you can apc callate portable entry polaroid pogo costs 50 euros in my opinion 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:59.569
 Eccom 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.930
 the toy that 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.359
 for those who take photographs 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.930
 it can be nice because maybe at the end of a trip one takes a picture 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.209
 I remember a beautiful photograph waiting for the best prints that I always recommend 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.289
 of if this can be a gift I remember a thought to leave 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.320
 the card costs more or less 20 30 cents 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.160
 for every for every print here is certainly not a cheap thing for between 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.620
 possibility of potassium in the pocket prints the 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.069
 certainly is on the fly 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:28.879
 if you're interested
