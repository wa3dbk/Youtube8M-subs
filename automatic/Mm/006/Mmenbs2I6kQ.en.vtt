00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
of them are surprising I thought there

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.890 
of them are surprising I thought there
would<00:03:44.620> be<00:03:44.650> more<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.250> more<00:03:45.760> people<00:03:46.450> trying<00:03:46.780> to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
would be more and more people trying to

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.870 
would be more and more people trying to
get<00:03:46.959> bail<00:03:47.230> by<00:03:47.530> he's<00:03:47.709> just<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.190> expensive<00:03:48.610> or

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
get bail by he's just so expensive or

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.610 
get bail by he's just so expensive or
things<00:03:49.060> like<00:03:49.269> 5<00:03:49.540> million<00:03:49.870> coins<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.560> you

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
things like 5 million coins and you

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.440

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
could probably just get messy in that

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.360
