morning to you you know I have small
kids<00:00:46.920> I've<00:00:47.160> used<00:00:47.370> formula<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> past<00:00:48.360> can't

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
kids I've used formula in the past can't

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.510 
kids I've used formula in the past can't
say<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.379> I've<00:00:49.469> ever<00:00:49.500> heard<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:49.920> bacteria

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
say that I've ever heard that bacteria

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.680 
say that I've ever heard that bacteria
can<00:00:50.730> grow<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.660> about

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
can grow in it what do we know about

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.080 
can grow in it what do we know about
this<00:00:52.020> particular<00:00:52.199> type<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.739> bacteria<00:00:53.399> right

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this particular type of bacteria right

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.470 
this particular type of bacteria right
well<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.500> formula<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.579> not

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
well we know that that formula is not

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
well we know that that formula is not
sterile<00:00:58.109> which<00:00:58.289> means<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.920> be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
sterile which means it can be

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.810 
sterile which means it can be
contaminated<00:01:00.030> bacteria<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.199> grow<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
contaminated bacteria can grow in it and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.960 
contaminated bacteria can grow in it and
and<00:01:03.199> it<00:01:04.199> does<00:01:04.500> require<00:01:04.729> testing<00:01:05.729> by<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and it does require testing by the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060 
and it does require testing by the
manufacturer<00:01:06.840> which<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.229> done<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.740> case

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
manufacturer which was done in this case

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.600 
manufacturer which was done in this case
I<00:01:08.400> think<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.380> certainly<00:01:10.560> an<00:01:11.040> infection

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I think this is certainly an infection

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.880 
I think this is certainly an infection
that<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:12.000> occur<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.900> very<00:01:13.170> rare<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.860> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that can occur but it's very rare so I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.440 
that can occur but it's very rare so I
don't<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.460> there's<00:01:14.850> any<00:01:15.030> reason<00:01:15.420> for

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
don't think it's there's any reason for

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.940 
don't think it's there's any reason for
panic

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
panic

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.420 
panic
of<00:01:17.220> course<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.700> wouldn't<00:01:18.030> recommend<00:01:18.420> using<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
of course I wouldn't recommend using the

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.300 
of course I wouldn't recommend using the
formula<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> lot<00:01:20.850> number<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.630> gave

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
formula with a lot number that you gave

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
formula with a lot number that you gave
but<00:01:23.310> there<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:23.610> ways<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.090> making<00:01:24.479> formula

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
but there are ways of making formula

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.420 
but there are ways of making formula
safer<00:01:26.509> dr.<00:01:27.509> BAE<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.350> suggest<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.100> moms<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
safer dr. BAE you suggest that moms and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.310 
safer dr. BAE you suggest that moms and
dads<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.729> use<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.030> formula<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.079> lot

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
dads not use the formula with the lot

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
dads not use the formula with the lot
number<00:01:31.619> that's<00:01:31.799> been<00:01:31.950> provided<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:33.540> a

number that's been provided to be a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
number that's been provided to be a
concern<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> perhaps<00:01:34.290> some<00:01:34.950> other<00:01:35.159> Lots<00:01:35.430> may

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
concern that perhaps some other Lots may

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.700 
concern that perhaps some other Lots may
have<00:01:36.210> been<00:01:36.390> contaminated<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:37.200> well<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
have been contaminated as well and the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
have been contaminated as well and the
and<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> word<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:39.060> contamination

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and the word is that that contamination

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.760 
and the word is that that contamination
can<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:40.320> well<00:01:40.530> occur<00:01:40.860> after<00:01:41.579> shipping<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:43.560> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
can very well occur after shipping it is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.920 
can very well occur after shipping it is
possible<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.850> because<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.780> have

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
possible and and because you can have

possible and and because you can have
contamination<00:01:46.770> after<00:01:47.220> shipping<00:01:47.549> there<00:01:47.909> are

contamination after shipping there are

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.679 
contamination after shipping there are
ways<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.390> make<00:01:49.070> baby<00:01:50.070> formula<00:01:50.670> safer<00:01:51.420> and

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
always use sterile water you should

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.270 
always use sterile water you should
refrigerate<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.170> baby<00:02:01.619> formula<00:02:01.920> after

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
refrigerate the baby formula after

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.530 
refrigerate the baby formula after
making<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.380> use<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.040> within<00:02:05.250> 24<00:02:06.030> hours<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
making it and use it within 24 hours and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.240 
making it and use it within 24 hours and
preferably<00:02:07.049> if<00:02:07.320> you're<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.860> use<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
preferably if you're going to use to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
preferably if you're going to use to
make<00:02:08.670> leave<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> formula<00:02:09.569> out<00:02:09.690> use<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.289> within

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
make leave the formula out use it within

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.890 
make leave the formula out use it within
four<00:02:10.890> hours<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.910> those<00:02:12.090> are<00:02:12.300> ways<00:02:12.420> because

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
four hours so those are ways because

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.800 
four hours so those are ways because
again<00:02:13.170> there<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:13.530> a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
again there is a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.020 
again there is a
possibility<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.410> contamination<00:02:15.190> but

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
possibility of contamination but

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.570 
possibility of contamination but
typically<00:02:16.540> all<00:02:16.959> these<00:02:17.470> powdered<00:02:18.069> formulas

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
typically all these powdered formulas

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.430 
typically all these powdered formulas
are<00:02:18.760> tested<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.830> they<00:02:20.830> are<00:02:21.390> safe<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.959> again

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
are tested and they are safe so again

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.229 
are tested and they are safe so again
there's<00:02:23.860> no<00:02:24.010> reason<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.550> panic<00:02:24.790> at<00:02:25.120> this

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
there's no reason for panic at this

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.640 
there's no reason for panic at this
quickly<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.840> gotta<00:02:25.989> ask<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.410> about<00:02:26.470> this

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
quickly I gotta ask you about this

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.160
