00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
now and just swirling it in and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.410 
now and just swirling it in and
attacking<00:01:16.500> off<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> excess<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.400> i'm<00:01:18.210> just

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.440 

just<00:01:24.369> like<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:24.789> know<00:01:24.850> it<00:01:25.030> looks<00:01:25.210> really

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
just like that I know it looks really

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.389 
just like that I know it looks really
really<00:01:25.899> tough<00:01:26.079> but<00:01:26.530> it's<00:01:26.649> great<00:01:26.890> because<00:01:27.100> then

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
really tough but it's great because then

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.919 
really tough but it's great because then
you<00:01:27.549> can<00:01:27.700> sort<00:01:27.909> of<00:01:28.030> just<00:01:28.240> buff<00:01:28.539> it<00:01:28.689> out<00:01:30.929> okay

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
you can sort of just buff it out okay

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.809 
you can sort of just buff it out okay
basically<00:01:32.170> like<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.799> and<00:01:33.280> then<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.609> do<00:01:33.729> the

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
basically like that and then you do the

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:43.130 
basically like that and then you do the
same<00:01:34.030> on<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.240> other<00:01:34.299> side

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.959 

and<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:44.979> after<00:01:45.250> you've<00:01:45.369> done<00:01:45.520> all<00:01:45.579> that<00:01:45.789> you

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
and then after you've done all that you

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.639 
and then after you've done all that you
want<00:01:46.149> to<00:01:46.179> go<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.359> the<00:01:46.539> other<00:01:46.630> shade<00:01:46.990> which<00:01:47.500> is

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
want to go to the other shade which is
