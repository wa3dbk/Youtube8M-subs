00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
obviously only really in such a short

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.139 
obviously only really in such a short
time<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:26.109> a<00:00:26.619> pretty<00:00:27.430> steep<00:00:27.640> learning<00:00:27.849> curve

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:28.149 
time it's a pretty steep learning curve

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.929 
time it's a pretty steep learning curve
but<00:00:28.919> something<00:00:29.919> that<00:00:29.949> I'm<00:00:30.130> really<00:00:30.730> really

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
but something that I'm really really
