this video is just a quick highlight of
my<00:00:05.180> painted<00:00:06.180> air<00:00:06.299> box<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.960> front<00:00:07.429> engine<00:00:08.429> cover

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
my painted air box in front engine cover

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.690 
my painted air box in front engine cover
this<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.290> actually<00:00:10.679> an<00:00:10.769> air<00:00:10.920> box<00:00:11.130> off<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:12.030> 92

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
this is actually an air box off of a 92

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.230 
this is actually an air box off of a 92
500<00:00:14.700> e<00:00:14.759> or<00:00:14.940> e<00:00:15.120> for<00:00:16.250> 2400<00:00:17.250> either<00:00:17.369> basically<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
500 e or e for 2400 either basically the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.070 
500 e or e for 2400 either basically the
same<00:00:18.390> air<00:00:18.539> box

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
same air box

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.509 
same air box
I<00:00:19.250> used<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.400> 92<00:00:20.880> because<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:22.140> emblem<00:00:22.830> of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
I used in 92 because the emblem of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.470 
I used in 92 because the emblem of
silver<00:00:23.850> emblem<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.330> top<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:25.230> removable

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
silver emblem on the top is removable

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
silver emblem on the top is removable
which<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:28.320> very<00:00:28.529> helpful<00:00:28.800> when<00:00:29.369> doing<00:00:29.730> this

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
which was very helpful when doing this

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.020 
which was very helpful when doing this
project<00:00:31.279> because<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> could<00:00:32.489> take<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> emblem

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
project because I could take the emblem

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.799 
project because I could take the emblem
off<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.390> paint<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.750> put<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.110> back<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:35.809> well

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
off and paint it and put it back on well

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.920 
off and paint it and put it back on well
it<00:00:36.870> wasn't<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.200> easy<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.719> logo<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
it wasn't so easy was the logo on the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.310 
it wasn't so easy was the logo on the
sides<00:00:41.120> what<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> did<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.540> painted<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.079> box

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
sides what I did was I painted this box

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.240 
sides what I did was I painted this box
red<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.969> actually<00:00:45.360> used<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.930> krylon<00:00:46.500> fusion

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
red I actually used a krylon fusion

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.060 
red I actually used a krylon fusion
which<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.460> designed<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:47.969> plastic<00:00:48.920> first<00:00:49.920> time

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
which is designed for plastic first time

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.590 
which is designed for plastic first time
I've<00:00:50.219> used<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.550> paint<00:00:50.850> krylon<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.329> always<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
I've used that paint krylon is always a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.360 
I've used that paint krylon is always a
good<00:00:51.809> paint<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.620> know<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> colors<00:00:53.160> never

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
good paint but you know the colors never

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.340 
good paint but you know the colors never
match<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:53.969> factory<00:00:54.510> Mercedes<00:00:54.930> colors<00:00:57.350> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
match the the factory Mercedes colors so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.860 
match the the factory Mercedes colors so
I<00:00:58.859> painted<00:00:59.430> everything<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> Krylon

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
I painted everything with the Krylon

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
I painted everything with the Krylon
fusion<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.649> red<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.160> let<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> cure<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
fusion in red and let it cure and then I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.109 
fusion in red and let it cure and then I
hand<00:01:04.229> painted<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> mercedes-benz<00:01:05.519> letters

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
hand painted the mercedes-benz letters

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.179 
hand painted the mercedes-benz letters
using<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.920> chrome<00:01:07.920> silver<00:01:08.610> paint<00:01:09.740> bit<00:01:10.740> tedious

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
using a chrome silver paint bit tedious

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.910 
using a chrome silver paint bit tedious
and<00:01:11.430> time-consuming<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and time-consuming to do that but it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.660 
and time-consuming to do that but it
turned<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.460> good<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:16.280> also<00:01:17.280> spent

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
turned out really good I also spent

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.460 
turned out really good I also spent
quite<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.909> bit<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.180> time<00:01:18.360> masking<00:01:18.930> off<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> edge

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
quite a bit of time masking off the edge

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.609 
quite a bit of time masking off the edge
of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> air<00:01:19.950> box<00:01:20.189> where<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> clamps<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:21.960> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
of the air box where the clamps are you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.050 
of the air box where the clamps are you
can<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> didn't<00:01:23.820> want<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
can see right there I didn't want the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.399 
can see right there I didn't want the
clamps<00:01:26.540> tightening<00:01:27.540> down<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.869> paint<00:01:28.200> that

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
clamps tightening down on paint that

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.380 
clamps tightening down on paint that
would<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.740> chip<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> paint<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> left<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
would just chip the paint so I left a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
would just chip the paint so I left a
black<00:01:30.630> edger<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> way<00:01:31.439> around<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> air

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
black edger all the way around the air

come off so if you paint the air box and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.520 
come off so if you paint the air box and
then<00:02:12.450> want<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.750> star<00:02:12.959> different<00:02:13.319> color

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
