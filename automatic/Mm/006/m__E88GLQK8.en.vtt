00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.340 
would have learnt me more points in the
bordello<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.910> Rolex<00:02:53.450> Submariner<00:02:53.930> in

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
bordello and the Rolex Submariner in

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.949 
bordello and the Rolex Submariner in
solid<00:02:54.739> gold<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.340> piece<00:02:55.790> for<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.300> modern<00:02:56.690> man

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
solid gold is a piece for a modern man

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.560 
solid gold is a piece for a modern man
who's<00:02:57.410> not<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.650> shy<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:59.000> bit<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.269> attention

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
who's not a shy of a bit of attention

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.030 
who's not a shy of a bit of attention
and<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:01.550> think<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.180> piece<00:03:02.420> here<00:03:02.810> is<00:03:03.260> probably

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
and I think this piece here is probably

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.250 
and I think this piece here is probably
one<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.519> most<00:03:04.700> perfect<00:03:05.300> pieces<00:03:05.660> on<00:03:06.080> the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
one of the most perfect pieces on the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.580 
one of the most perfect pieces on the
market<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:07.519> serves<00:03:08.030> no<00:03:08.300> human<00:03:09.080> purpose

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
market it serves no human purpose

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.370 
market it serves no human purpose
because<00:03:10.130> if<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.970> want<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.300> diving<00:03:11.570> watch<00:03:11.930> one

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
because if you want a diving watch one

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.949 
because if you want a diving watch one
really<00:03:12.890> should<00:03:13.190> go<00:03:13.400> with<00:03:13.610> steel<00:03:14.000> but<00:03:14.840> the

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
really should go with steel but the

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.110 
really should go with steel but the
choice<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.410> gold<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:16.070> just<00:03:16.400> is<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:16.910> obnoxious

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
choice of gold it just is so obnoxious

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.180 
choice of gold it just is so obnoxious
and<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:19.310> magnificent<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.540> certainly<00:03:21.470> can't<00:03:21.980> be

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
and so magnificent it certainly can't be
