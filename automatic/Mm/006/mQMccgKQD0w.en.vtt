see there's two on the bottom which
which<00:02:12.670> technically<00:02:13.330> could<00:02:13.630> be<00:02:13.870> one<00:02:14.230> big

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
which technically could be one big

the battles keep going across the stage

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.670 
the battles keep going across the stage
is<00:02:57.880> not<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.120> because<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.450> can<00:02:58.569> see<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.930> manage

is not it because you can see I manage
that<00:02:59.830> way<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.130> windmills<00:03:00.610> rotate<00:03:01.480> Tom

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
that way the windmills rotate Tom

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.130 
that way the windmills rotate Tom
towards<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:02.980> center<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.430> stage<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.930> is

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
towards the center of the stage that is

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.870 
towards the center of the stage that is
to<00:03:05.410> help<00:03:05.620> guide<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.099> state<00:03:06.310> or<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.549> balance

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
to help guide the state or the balance

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.270 
to help guide the state or the balance
which<00:03:07.060> helps<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:08.349> know<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> batter<00:03:08.769> maneuver

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
which helps you know the batter maneuver

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.990 
which helps you know the batter maneuver
and<00:03:09.370> keep<00:03:09.580> going<00:03:09.880> up<00:03:10.090> there<00:03:10.410> um<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:12.670> know<00:03:12.790> kick

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
and keep going up there um you know kick

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.259 
and keep going up there um you know kick
like<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.180> fast-paced<00:03:13.780> don't<00:03:14.079> stay<00:03:14.530> in<00:03:14.560> one<00:03:14.680> area

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
like a fast-paced don't stay in one area

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.400 
like a fast-paced don't stay in one area
because<00:03:16.269> usually<00:03:16.450> we<00:03:16.690> are<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.900> bottom-up

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
because usually we are the bottom-up

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.849 
because usually we are the bottom-up
stash<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.549> usually<00:03:18.579> hit<00:03:18.970> or<00:03:19.150> up<00:03:19.299> or<00:03:19.450> are<00:03:19.859> they

can<00:04:36.350> pick<00:04:36.650> their<00:04:36.830> own<00:04:36.860> matching<00:04:37.610> on<00:04:37.940> sale<00:04:38.330> on

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
can pick their own matching on sale on

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.250 
can pick their own matching on sale on
the<00:04:38.510> bottom<00:04:38.840> bottom<00:04:39.500> right<00:04:39.860> in<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.070> top<00:04:40.280> left

the bottom bottom right in the top left

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.830 
the bottom bottom right in the top left
that<00:04:42.260> helps<00:04:42.590> give<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.890> stages<00:04:43.310> more<00:04:43.520> only<00:04:44.330> you

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
that helps give the stages more only you

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.840 
that helps give the stages more only you
know<00:04:44.930> feel<00:04:45.200> like<00:04:45.500> everyone<00:04:46.010> can<00:04:46.340> get<00:04:46.550> your<00:04:46.700> own

it's not too big k candles are not so

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.909 
it's not too big k candles are not so
hard<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:57.919> get<00:04:58.130> as<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:58.880> see<00:04:59.060> I<00:04:59.090> can<00:04:59.419> link<00:05:00.320> we<00:05:00.740> had

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
hard to get as you see I can link we had

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.540 
hard to get as you see I can link we had
when<00:05:01.190> I<00:05:01.310> was<00:05:01.340> his<00:05:01.610> fox<00:05:01.910> i<00:05:02.180> ko'd<00:05:02.690> them<00:05:02.900> with<00:05:03.890> um<00:05:04.100> a

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
when I was his fox i ko'd them with um a

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.180 
when I was his fox i ko'd them with um a
thing<00:05:04.820> you<00:05:04.940> had<00:05:05.090> about<00:05:05.240> 117<00:05:06.110> from<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.800> bottom

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
thing you had about 117 from the bottom

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.890 
thing you had about 117 from the bottom
rope<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:07.640> it's<00:05:07.820> not<00:05:07.940> that<00:05:08.000> hard<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.390> get<00:05:08.600> chaos

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
rope so it's not that hard to get chaos

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.840 
rope so it's not that hard to get chaos
in<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.050> stage<00:05:09.320> everything<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.400> proportionate

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
in the stage everything is proportionate

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.840 
in the stage everything is proportionate
just<00:05:11.240> right<00:05:11.540> but<00:05:12.260> um<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.890> stage<00:05:13.130> isn't<00:05:13.430> fully

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
just right but um the stage isn't fully

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.469 
just right but um the stage isn't fully
used<00:05:14.210> on<00:05:14.450> the<00:05:14.540> edge<00:05:14.720> as<00:05:15.669> you<00:05:16.669> see<00:05:16.820> I<00:05:16.850> let<00:05:17.330> some

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
used on the edge as you see I let some

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.510 
used on the edge as you see I let some
air<00:05:17.630> space<00:05:17.930> that<00:05:18.229> way<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.710> allow<00:05:18.890> someone<00:05:19.160> and
