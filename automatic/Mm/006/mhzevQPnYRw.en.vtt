00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
learnt it a number of years ago and it

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.299 
learnt it a number of years ago and it
seems<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.760> go<00:00:11.910> down<00:00:11.940> quite<00:00:12.780> well<00:00:13.049> at<00:00:13.469> different

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
seems to go down quite well at different

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.199 
seems to go down quite well at different
functions

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209

what<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.660> need<00:00:15.840> is<00:00:16.460> boxer<00:00:17.460> matches<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
little bit of nerve but let's see what

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.340 
little bit of nerve but let's see what
you<00:00:21.060> think<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.620> is<00:00:22.800> fire-eating

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
you think of this so this is fire-eating

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.139 
you think of this so this is fire-eating
strike<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> match<00:00:26.090> let<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.210> burn<00:00:27.360> and<00:00:27.920> then

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.720 

simple<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.450> how<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.379> it<00:00:34.530> done<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:35.129> first

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
simple as that how is it done well first

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.170 
simple as that how is it done well first
thing<00:00:35.879> you<00:00:35.969> need<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.350> boxing<00:00:37.350> matches<00:00:37.530> I

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
thing you need is boxing matches I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.120 
thing you need is boxing matches I
prefer<00:00:39.180> these<00:00:39.420> sorts<00:00:40.140> longer<00:00:40.680> ones

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
prefer these sorts longer ones

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.180 
prefer these sorts longer ones
it's<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> barbecue<00:00:42.420> lighting<00:00:43.260> matches<00:00:43.470> you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it's the barbecue lighting matches you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
it's the barbecue lighting matches you
can<00:00:44.220> do<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.210> shorter<00:00:45.720> normal

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
can do it with the the shorter normal

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.979 
can do it with the the shorter normal
matches<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.700> use<00:00:47.970> these<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
matches but if you use these it's just a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.880 
matches but if you use these it's just a
a<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.710> bit<00:00:49.829> easier<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.600> simply

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
a little bit easier and then you simply

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.370 
a little bit easier and then you simply
strike<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> match<00:00:53.450> let<00:00:54.450> it<00:00:54.600> burn<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:54.809> effect

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
strike the match let it burn for effect

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.750 
strike the match let it burn for effect
so<00:00:55.559> everyone<00:00:55.800> knows<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.040> it's<00:00:56.309> properly

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
so everyone knows that it's properly

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.000 
so everyone knows that it's properly
burning<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:59.360> put<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.540> your<00:01:00.630> mouth

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
burning and then put it in your mouth
tastes<00:01:02.010> disgusting<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:03.210> what<00:01:03.750> happens<00:01:04.170> is

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
tastes disgusting and what happens is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.310 
tastes disgusting and what happens is
