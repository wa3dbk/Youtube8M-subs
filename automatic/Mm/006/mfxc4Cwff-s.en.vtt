to show you how to get the skull on sand

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.950 
to show you how to get the skull on sand
box<00:00:16.049> which<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.470> probably<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.340> most<00:00:18.090> fun<00:00:18.510> skull

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
box which is probably the most fun skull

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.670 
box which is probably the most fun skull
to<00:00:19.140> get<00:00:19.320> out<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.590> all<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.250> other<00:00:20.400> maps<00:00:21.020> I<00:00:22.020> just

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
to get out of all the other maps I just

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.230 
to get out of all the other maps I just
want<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.859> give<00:00:22.980> credit<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.430> death<00:00:23.609> jr.<00:00:24.060> because

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
people it's almost impossible to do solo

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.450 
people it's almost impossible to do solo
now<00:00:37.079> probably<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> first<00:00:38.040> things<00:00:38.219> you

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
now probably one of the first things you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.970 
now probably one of the first things you
want<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.820> well<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.230> did<00:00:40.440> but

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
want to do well this is what we did but

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.830 
want to do well this is what we did but
um<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.910> want<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.210> try<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.420> find<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
um if you want to try to find it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.540 
um if you want to try to find it
yourself<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.980> know<00:00:44.239> like<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.739> into

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
yourself and you know like just go into

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.529 
yourself and you know like just go into
the<00:00:47.930> SkyDome<00:00:49.250> put<00:00:50.250> down<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> platform<00:00:51.120> grab<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the SkyDome put down a platform grab a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.479 
the SkyDome put down a platform grab a
sniper<00:00:51.989> rifle<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.710> then<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.039> scan<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
sniper rifle and then just scan the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.630 
sniper rifle and then just scan the
outside<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> map<00:00:54.570> near<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.559> towers<00:00:56.160> where

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
outside of the map near the towers where

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.400 
outside of the map near the towers where
the<00:00:56.820> sand<00:00:57.120> meets<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.629> towers<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.199> that's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the sand meets the towers because that's

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.020 
the sand meets the towers because that's
actually<00:00:58.829> how<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.010> found<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> skull<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
actually how we found the skull and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
actually how we found the skull and
that's<00:01:00.780> how<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:00.989> started<00:01:01.500> building<00:01:03.290> all<00:01:04.290> right

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that's how we started building all right

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
that's how we started building all right
now<00:01:04.680> we're<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.830> gonna<00:01:05.180> just<00:01:06.180> jump<00:01:06.360> down

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
now we're just gonna just jump down

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.100 
now we're just gonna just jump down
right<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.710> see<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:09.110> ok

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
right there as you can see and ok

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.700 
right there as you can see and ok
respond<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.240> come<00:01:12.720> over<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:12.990> we

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
respond now we just come over here we

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.679 
respond now we just come over here we
put<00:01:13.950> those<00:01:14.100> kill<00:01:14.430> balls<00:01:14.700> there<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
put those kill balls there just to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.830 
put those kill balls there just to
identify<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.180> could<00:01:18.299> easily

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
identify like just so we could easily

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
identify like just so we could easily
see<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> no<00:01:19.560> matter<00:01:19.740> where<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.189> are<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
see it no matter where you are in the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.140 
see it no matter where you are in the
map<00:01:21.439> now<00:01:22.439> I'm<00:01:22.770> basically<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> build

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
map now I'm basically just want to build

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
map now I'm basically just want to build
a<00:01:24.270> tunnel<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.740> outside<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
a tunnel because as you go outside the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
a tunnel because as you go outside the
map<00:01:26.430> those<00:01:26.700> towers<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.390> there<00:01:27.600> will<00:01:27.869> shoot<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
map those towers up there will shoot you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190 
map those towers up there will shoot you
and<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.430> die<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> want<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.110> able

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and you will die so you want to be able

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.260 
and you will die so you want to be able
to<00:01:31.380> build<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.710> tunnel<00:01:31.920> eventually<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.060> will

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to build a tunnel eventually you will

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.090 
to build a tunnel eventually you will
run<00:01:33.509> out<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.750> two<00:01:34.049> pieces<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:34.920> gonna

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
run out of two pieces so you're gonna

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.160 
run out of two pieces so you're gonna
have<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.520> creative<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.020> what

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
have to get creative this is just what

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.800 
have to get creative this is just what
we<00:01:37.200> did<00:01:37.560> sure<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.310> simple<00:01:38.700> saved<00:01:39.540> us<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.780> lot

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
we did sure it's simple saved us a lot

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
we did sure it's simple saved us a lot
of<00:01:39.930> time<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.860> want<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> create<00:01:41.400> like

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
of time and you just want to create like

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.539 
of time and you just want to create like
a<00:01:41.670> whole<00:01:42.360> building<00:01:43.020> around<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.920> skull<00:01:44.220> that

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
a whole building around the skull that

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.760 
a whole building around the skull that
or<00:01:45.540> else<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.990> will<00:01:46.200> die

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
or else you will die

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.480 
or else you will die
any<00:01:46.979> gaps<00:01:47.430> could<00:01:47.789> get<00:01:47.969> killed<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.490> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
any gaps could get killed like one the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.179 
any gaps could get killed like one the
skull<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.759> pick<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.719> this<00:01:51.929> isn't<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.469> fake<00:01:52.859> video

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
skull is pick up this isn't a fake video

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.410 
skull is pick up this isn't a fake video
now<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.649> make<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.490> gap<00:01:56.759> there<00:01:57.060> you'll

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
now if you make that gap there you'll

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.929 
now if you make that gap there you'll
just<00:01:57.659> you'll<00:01:58.079> die<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.890> simple<00:01:59.369> as<00:01:59.429> that<00:01:59.460> even

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
just you'll die as simple as that even

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.120 
just you'll die as simple as that even
in<00:02:00.060> forge<00:02:00.360> mode<00:02:00.600> there's<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.170> no<00:02:01.950> way<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
in forge mode there's really no way to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.219 
in forge mode there's really no way to
escape<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.789> I<00:02:02.939> don't<00:02:03.090> even<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.049> have

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
escape it I don't even think if you have

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.109 
escape it I don't even think if you have
like<00:02:04.530> three<00:02:04.950> hundred<00:02:05.069> percent<00:02:05.549> speed<00:02:05.789> I<00:02:05.819> don't

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
like three hundred percent speed I don't

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.389 
like three hundred percent speed I don't
think<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.539> escape<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:07.860> did<00:02:08.099> try<00:02:08.310> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
think you can escape it now we did try a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.029 
think you can escape it now we did try a
couple<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.910> other<00:02:09.060> times<00:02:09.450> without<00:02:09.959> doing<00:02:10.890> what

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
couple of other times without doing what

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.890 
couple of other times without doing what
we<00:02:11.160> did<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.549> you<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.819> see<00:02:12.000> there<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.750> is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
we did as you can see there this is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.080 
we did as you can see there this is
actually<00:02:13.260> our<00:02:13.290> saved<00:02:13.680> variant<00:02:14.129> of<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> map<00:02:14.519> no

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
actually our saved variant of the map no

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.930 
actually our saved variant of the map no
I<00:02:15.480> know<00:02:16.260> red<00:02:16.620> versus<00:02:17.010> blue<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.430> also<00:02:17.760> made<00:02:17.910> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
I know red versus blue is also made a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.759 
I know red versus blue is also made a
video<00:02:18.209> showing<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> how<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.019> get<00:02:19.260> here<00:02:19.319> but

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
you know what I just decided to make

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.289 
you know what I just decided to make
this<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.019> hell<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:27.090> yeah

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
basically what happens when you go

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.759 
basically what happens when you go
outside<00:02:28.950> as<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.549> just<00:02:29.849> get<00:02:30.840> shot<00:02:31.170> your<00:02:31.410> screen

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
outside as you just get shot your screen

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.380 
outside as you just get shot your screen
starts<00:02:32.069> blinking<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.849> towers<00:02:33.209> will

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
starts blinking then the towers will

starts blinking then the towers will
shoot<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:35.090> as<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.269> saw<00:02:36.480> before<00:02:36.510> there's

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
no one else in the party now sandbox is

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.530 
no one else in the party now sandbox is
a<00:02:40.049> really<00:02:40.380> cool<00:02:40.560> map<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.160> grid<00:02:41.519> here<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.299> you

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
a really cool map the grid here that you

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.539 
a really cool map the grid here that you
see<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.870> ground<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.590> permanently<00:02:44.220> and
