00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
really get in the way of articulation

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.570 
really get in the way of articulation
because<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> could<00:01:25.860> pop<00:01:26.009> him<00:01:26.130> off<00:01:26.220> he<00:01:26.340> needed

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
because you could pop him off he needed

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.310 
because you could pop him off he needed
to<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> sculpt<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.229> his

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to but actually the sculpt and his

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.280 
to but actually the sculpt and his
shoulders<00:01:28.740> themselves<00:01:29.479> stopped<00:01:30.479> eventually

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
as they go up which I guess helps from
