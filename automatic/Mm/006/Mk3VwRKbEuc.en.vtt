were<00:03:27.760> they<00:03:28.000> were<00:03:28.120> hitting<00:03:28.330> every<00:03:28.630> open<00:03:28.930> shot

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
were they were hitting every open shot

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.720 
were they were hitting every open shot
so<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:29.470> wasn't<00:03:29.800> one<00:03:29.890> being<00:03:30.070> into<00:03:30.280> those<00:03:30.430> games

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
so it wasn't one being into those games

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.940 
so it wasn't one being into those games
where<00:03:31.210> the<00:03:31.750> ball<00:03:31.960> just<00:03:32.200> kind<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.470> fell<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.800> our

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
where the ball just kind of fell in our

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.040 
where the ball just kind of fell in our
hands<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:33.490> I<00:03:33.520> think<00:03:33.610> that<00:03:34.000> was<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.840> best

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
hands so I think that was the the best

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.960 
hands so I think that was the the best
part<00:03:35.230> is<00:03:35.410> chip<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:35.860> far<00:03:36.100> as<00:03:36.250> we<00:03:36.430> have<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.760> major

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
part is chip so far as we have a major

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.930 
part is chip so far as we have a major
tester<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.800> I<00:03:39.040> know<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.640> was<00:03:39.760> nothing

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
tester it's so I know it was nothing

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.300 
tester it's so I know it was nothing
like<00:03:40.210> a<00:03:40.270> game<00:03:40.570> but<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.020> felt<00:03:41.290> like<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:42.160> know

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
like a game but it felt like you know

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.160 
like a game but it felt like you know
something<00:03:43.030> we<00:03:43.180> needed<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.510> win<00:03:43.720> we<00:03:43.900> have<00:03:44.050> all

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
something we needed to win we have all

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.750 
something we needed to win we have all
these<00:03:44.380> fans<00:03:44.710> you<00:03:44.980> know<00:03:45.040> all<00:03:45.190> these<00:03:45.280> people<00:03:45.340> we

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
these fans you know all these people we

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.670 
these fans you know all these people we
needed<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.150> win<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.480> game<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.140> I<00:03:47.380> thought

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
needed to win this game so I thought

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.110 
needed to win this game so I thought
that<00:03:47.860> was<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.010> best<00:03:48.370> part<00:03:48.580> about<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:49.030> it's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
that was the best part about it it's

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.390 
that was the best part about it it's
just<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.810> pride<00:03:50.110> of<00:03:50.140> my<00:03:50.410> teammates<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.310> the
