00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.799
 good to all I am art and today we are 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.340
 here in the pilot episode of how 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.650
 improve your home how you will be imagining 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.670
 with this bucket of earth that we have here 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.670
 which many people call home in this 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.400
 series we are going to try to improve this and 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.830
 that people who do not know how to build 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.620
 or do not want some tricks for 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.190
 you can see your house better then in this series 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.930
 let's learn different techniques 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.570
 so we can do this a little more 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.030
 pretty let's change both the exterior 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.550
 of the house as the interior that I eat 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.649
 you see also has a lot to be desired and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.620
 we will also improve what would be the 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.499
 around so in this series as 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.559
 you see then let's make this a 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.449
 little bit better and that people then 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.819
 like your house a little more since if 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.230
 you have a little bit of dirt there is even 

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:59.749
 some servers where you are 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.729
 forbidden to build this so good 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.190
 to do to do the pilot episode 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.140
 let's see some small tips 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.100
 let's say some little things that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.320
 we could put 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.229
 in this house although it will not be the episode 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.180
 1 episode 1 will start from this 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.549
 but it's only for you to see a 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.200
 little little advice is worth first of 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.970
 we are going to remove this land that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.700
 we have here that as you can see, it remains as 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.799
 a very ugly corner we will remove the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.020
 these corners go if you want too 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.640
 you can remove this depends on your 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.320
 taste ok you may like more than one 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.570
 way or another 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.820
 we remove the corners and we will have one 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.399
 much more dynamic house let's say more 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.909
 cheerful more different from the rest of houses 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:44.750
 since they have this kind of way so 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.490
 as rounder something impossible in 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.590
 minecraft but that has its appeal 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.990
 let's say as you see this is already a bit 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.360
 better than our initial ground house 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.250
 and now we are going to do the last retouch 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.860
 for the pilot episode so that this does not 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.170
 get too long we're going to make a 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.479
 small retouch that although very very 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.600
 simple to me the truth is that I like 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.819
 much more do it this way so 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.100
 let's see how to improve the entry of 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.300
 Our house would be direct remove 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.910
 this door and put it inside out like this 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.220
 perfect 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.010
 and we will have the door as sunken 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.900
 inside the house is an effect as well 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.270
 strange as it seems to me that is 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.330
 very very well and I always put the doors 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.740
 well and the truth is that it is very very 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.500
 so cool as you can see we've already 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.760
 improved our initial box a little 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.470
 land 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.209
 in the following episodes what 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.159
 we will improve much more until 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.950
 there is a more or less acceptable house 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.849
 within what I can do since 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.579
 it's not that I'm an expert 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.290
 builder or anything like that but 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.689
 some advice yes I think I can 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.430
 give them so that hunting is not so bad 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.340
 so I hope you liked it 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.680
 remember to comment on voting and share the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.549
 video so this is all and even another 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.549
 goodbye
