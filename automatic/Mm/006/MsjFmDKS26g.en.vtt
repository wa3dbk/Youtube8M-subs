00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
actually did I mean I guess you could

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.100 
actually did I mean I guess you could
argue<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.380> he<00:01:49.920> greenlit<00:01:50.880> adventure<00:01:51.780> time<00:01:51.990> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
argue that he greenlit adventure time of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.420 
argue that he greenlit adventure time of
initial<00:01:53.030> yeah<00:01:54.030> ya<00:01:54.240> did<00:01:54.540> yeah<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.430> that's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
initial yeah ya did yeah but that's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.800 
initial yeah ya did yeah but that's
probably<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:58.250> actually<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.729> frigid<00:02:00.060> air<00:02:00.180> show

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810

war<00:02:01.170> cartoon<00:02:02.130> notes<00:02:02.310> biggest<00:02:03.090> his<00:02:03.299> day<00:02:03.479> had<00:02:03.689> in

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
war cartoon notes biggest his day had in

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.069 
war cartoon notes biggest his day had in
awhile<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> i<00:02:06.030> guess<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.479> something<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
awhile so i guess that is something to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.260 
awhile so i guess that is something to
celebrate<00:02:08.869> but<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.110> was<00:02:10.229> saying<00:02:11.270> seeing

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
celebrate but as I was saying seeing

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.740 
celebrate but as I was saying seeing
real<00:02:12.660> was<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.200> point<00:02:13.440> where

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
real was the point where

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.750 
real was the point where
I start<00:02:14.110> stop<00:02:14.620> watching<00:02:15.100> cartoon<00:02:15.430> network
