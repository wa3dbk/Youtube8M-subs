everywhere wherever there are people and

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.580 
everywhere wherever there are people and

admits<00:02:37.090> lots<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.780> different<00:02:38.440> styles<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.310> I

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
admits lots of different styles and I

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.930 
admits lots of different styles and I
know<00:02:41.020> I<00:02:41.170> started<00:02:41.740> like<00:02:41.980> almost<00:02:42.610> everybody

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
know I started like almost everybody

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.180 
know I started like almost everybody
else<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.540> know<00:02:43.570> playing<00:02:43.930> C<00:02:44.260> F<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.590> G<00:02:44.740> chords

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
else you know playing C F and G chords

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.550 
else you know playing C F and G chords
because<00:02:45.520> that's<00:02:45.970> what<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.300> hear<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.560> rock

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
because that's what you hear on rock

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.060 
because that's what you hear on rock
radio<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:49.600> after<00:02:49.960> while<00:02:50.110> it's<00:02:50.260> not<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.740> big

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
radio but after while it's not that big

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.910 
radio but after while it's not that big
a<00:02:51.130> deal<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.670> say<00:02:52.570> what<00:02:52.990> else<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.410> there<00:02:53.680> and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
a deal to say what else is there and

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.330 
a deal to say what else is there and
then<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.160> start<00:02:54.520> finding<00:02:55.290> blues<00:02:56.290> scales<00:02:56.830> and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
then you start finding blues scales and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.000 
then you start finding blues scales and
maybe<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:58.060> leads<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.690> jazz<00:02:59.050> chords<00:02:59.770> and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
maybe that leads you to jazz chords and

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.130 
maybe that leads you to jazz chords and
then<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.250> start<00:03:00.520> thinking<00:03:00.730> well<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.810> know<00:03:01.930> is

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
then you start thinking well you know is

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.940 
then you start thinking well you know is
it<00:03:02.290> possible<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.690> kind<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.810> move<00:03:05.500> some<00:03:05.920> of

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
it possible to kind of move some of

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.250 
it possible to kind of move some of
these<00:03:06.240> internal<00:03:07.240> voices<00:03:07.510> around<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:08.140> little

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
these internal voices around a little

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
these internal voices around a little
bit<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.560> before<00:03:08.800> you<00:03:08.830> know<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.040> you're

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
bit and before you know it you're

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.950

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
in following where the instrument wants

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.930 
in following where the instrument wants
