00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.349 
for the ground that the ls1 block has
someone<00:00:19.560> mentioned<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.010> if<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.060> want<00:00:21.270> to

happens Oh speedometer works
looks<00:02:16.350> like<00:02:16.560> my<00:02:16.740> scan<00:02:17.070> gauge<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.610> turning<00:02:17.970> on

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
looks like my scan gauge is turning on

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.620 
looks like my scan gauge is turning on
see<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.180> works

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
see if it works

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.380 
see if it works
of<00:02:21.720> course<00:02:21.930> nothing's<00:02:22.230> hooked<00:02:22.410> up<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.890> so

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
of course nothing's hooked up to it so

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:35.570 
of course nothing's hooked up to it so
probably<00:02:24.390> won't<00:02:33.860> yeah<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.890> think<00:02:35.130> that's

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
probably won't yeah I think that's

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.400 
probably won't yeah I think that's
actually<00:02:36.209> doing<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.750> because<00:02:39.410> something's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
actually doing that because something's

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.600 
actually doing that because something's
not<00:02:40.590> hooked<00:02:40.860> up<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:41.430> sure<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:41.940> my<00:02:43.610> gauges

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
not hooked up I'm not sure but my gauges

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.550 
not hooked up I'm not sure but my gauges
that<00:02:44.940> can<00:02:45.120> work<00:02:45.300> are<00:02:45.540> working<00:02:45.900> my<00:02:46.140> wideband

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
that can work are working my wideband

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.090 
that can work are working my wideband
obviously<00:02:47.100> isn't<00:02:47.250> showing<00:02:47.580> anything<00:02:47.850> because

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
obviously isn't showing anything because

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.320 
obviously isn't showing anything because
actually<00:02:50.100> that's<00:02:50.280> plugged<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.000> don't<00:02:51.270> know

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
actually that's plugged in I don't know

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.060 
actually that's plugged in I don't know
once<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.600> warms<00:02:51.989> up<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.380> it'll<00:02:52.530> show

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
once that warms up if it'll show

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
once that warms up if it'll show
something<00:02:53.459> or<00:02:53.549> not<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:55.010> okay<00:02:56.010> let's<00:02:56.880> try

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
something or not but okay let's try

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:07.610 
something or not but okay let's try
windows<00:02:59.150> nice<00:03:00.470> got<00:03:01.470> windows<00:03:03.019> let's<00:03:04.019> try<00:03:06.620> let's

see<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.780> hear<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:09.930> reverse<00:03:10.200> lockout<00:03:11.120> see<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.209> it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
see I hear my reverse lockout see if it

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
but I think they definitely need to be

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.240 
but I think they definitely need to be
