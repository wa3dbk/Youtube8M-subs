00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.089 
this metaphor to celebrate migrants
because<00:02:31.719> often<00:02:32.290> when<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:32.769> think<00:02:32.799> about

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
because often when we think about

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.069 
because often when we think about
migrants<00:02:33.760> crossing<00:02:33.939> the<00:02:34.389> border<00:02:34.780> there's<00:02:35.019> a

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
migrants crossing the border there's a

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.940 
migrants crossing the border there's a
negative<00:02:35.620> association<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.579> it<00:02:37.469> so<00:02:38.469> in<00:02:38.829> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
negative association to it so in the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.339 
negative association to it so in the

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
butterfly you see two phases and again I

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.500
