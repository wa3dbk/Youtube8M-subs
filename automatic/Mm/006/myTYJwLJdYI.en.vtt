00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 
scoffs today and in this particular

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.110 
scoffs today and in this particular
video<00:00:05.569> we're<00:00:05.960> going<00:00:06.080> to<00:00:06.170> go<00:00:06.319> for<00:00:06.680> the<00:00:07.120> probably

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
video we're going to go for the probably

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.299 
video we're going to go for the probably
the<00:00:08.270> most<00:00:08.450> used<00:00:08.750> scale<00:00:09.170> in<00:00:09.530> the<00:00:09.710> in<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.100> world

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
the most used scale in the in the world

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.970 
the most used scale in the in the world
much<00:00:10.520> use<00:00:10.700> cold<00:00:11.059> in<00:00:11.240> the<00:00:11.330> world<00:00:11.540> certainly<00:00:11.980> the

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
much use cold in the world certainly the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.450 
much use cold in the world certainly the
dominant<00:00:13.610> seventh<00:00:14.230> scale<00:00:15.230> or<00:00:15.799> mixolydian

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
dominant seventh scale or mixolydian

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.400 
dominant seventh scale or mixolydian
fifth<00:00:17.300> mode<00:00:17.720> of<00:00:18.020> a<00:00:18.110> major<00:00:18.320> scale<00:00:20.140> this<00:00:21.140> is

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
fifth mode of a major scale this is

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.370 
fifth mode of a major scale this is
quite<00:00:22.340> an<00:00:22.430> interesting<00:00:22.599> scale<00:00:23.599> it's

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
quite an interesting scale it's

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.740 
quite an interesting scale it's
basically<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.220> major<00:00:25.669> scale<00:00:26.029> but<00:00:26.509> with<00:00:26.720> a

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
basically a major scale but with a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
basically a major scale but with a
flattened<00:00:27.349> seventh<00:00:27.919> note<00:00:29.290> so<00:00:30.290> if<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:30.529> think

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
flattened seventh note so if you think

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.709 
flattened seventh note so if you think
of<00:00:30.890> it<00:00:31.009> that<00:00:31.040> that<00:00:31.399> is<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:31.939> probably<00:00:32.599> the

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
of it that that is the probably the

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.100 
of it that that is the probably the
easiest<00:00:33.050> way<00:00:33.290> for<00:00:33.320> you<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.649> learn<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.690> so<00:00:35.690> it's

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
easiest way for you to learn it so it's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.880 
easiest way for you to learn it so it's
makeup<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:37.700> going<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.000> be<00:00:38.320> from<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> major<00:00:39.560> scale

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
makeup is going to be from a major scale

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.450 
makeup is going to be from a major scale
one<00:00:40.280> two<00:00:40.700> three<00:00:41.120> four<00:00:41.570> five<00:00:41.960> six<00:00:42.590> the

one two three four five six the

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.490 
one two three four five six the
flattened<00:00:43.790> seventh<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:44.420> then<00:00:44.720> obviously<00:00:45.050> one

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
flattened seventh and then obviously one

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.730 
flattened seventh and then obviously one
or<00:00:45.680> eight<00:00:45.920> at<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.550> at<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.880> top<00:00:47.030> of<00:00:47.180> it<00:00:47.270> its<00:00:48.230> DNA

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
or eight at the at the top of it its DNA

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.970 
or eight at the at the top of it its DNA
is<00:00:49.070> going<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.370> be<00:00:49.460> almost<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.450> same<00:00:50.480> as<00:00:50.980> a

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
is going to be almost the same as a

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.250 
is going to be almost the same as a
major<00:00:52.430> scale<00:00:52.730> tone<00:00:53.510> tone<00:00:54.110> semitone<00:00:54.530> tone<00:00:55.180> tone

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.370 
major scale tone tone semitone tone tone
semitone<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.920> then<00:00:58.430> its<00:00:58.579> own<00:00:58.790> on<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.120> end<00:00:59.380> so

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
semitone and then its own on the end so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.470 
semitone and then its own on the end so
just<00:01:00.410> that<00:01:00.770> change<00:01:00.800> at<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.520> end<00:01:01.700> there

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
just that change at the end there

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.590 
just that change at the end there
whole<00:01:02.930> tone<00:01:03.230> whole<00:01:03.649> tone<00:01:03.920> half<00:01:04.250> tone<00:01:04.600> whole

tone whole tone half tone whole tongue
okay<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:10.820> let's<00:01:11.270> play<00:01:11.540> this<00:01:11.690> scale<00:01:11.870> and<00:01:12.290> see

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
okay so let's play this scale and see

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:39.609 
okay so let's play this scale and see
what<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:12.740> sounds<00:01:13.040> like<00:01:13.100> with<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.490> other

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.560 

okay<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.130> mentioned<00:01:41.369> before<00:01:41.880> it's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
okay so as we mentioned before it's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.529 
okay so as we mentioned before it's
probably<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:44.189> world's<00:01:44.490> most<00:01:44.610> use<00:01:44.969> called<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
probably the world's most use called the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.660 
probably the world's most use called the
dominant<00:01:45.899> seventh<00:01:46.200> chord<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.460> course

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
dominant seventh chord and of course

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.090 
dominant seventh chord and of course
this<00:01:47.850> scale<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.450> fit<00:01:48.750> straight<00:01:49.439> away<00:01:49.679> over

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
this scale can fit straight away over

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.559 
this scale can fit straight away over
that<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.610> chord<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.179> it's<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> be

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
that that chord so it's going to be

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.539 
that that chord so it's going to be
quite<00:01:51.810> important<00:01:52.289> as<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.950> an<00:01:53.100> improviser

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
quite important as a as an improviser

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.859 
quite important as a as an improviser
that<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.569> your

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that you get to know what your

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.380 
that you get to know what your
mixolydian<00:01:55.679> or<00:01:56.100> dominant<00:01:56.549> seven<00:01:56.789> scales<00:01:57.149> are

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
mixolydian or dominant seven scales are

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.350 
mixolydian or dominant seven scales are
going<00:01:57.569> to<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:59.219> patterns<00:01:59.579> again<00:01:59.850> here<00:02:00.329> that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
going to be the patterns again here that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.749 
going to be the patterns again here that
are<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.079> multiple<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.460> are<00:02:02.549> so

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
are just multiple there there are so

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.219 
are just multiple there there are so
many<00:02:02.880> ways<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.600> play<00:02:03.810> around<00:02:03.929> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
many ways that you can play around the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.889 
many ways that you can play around the
scales<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:04.909> speak<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.060> your<00:02:06.270> teacher<00:02:06.689> or

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
scales here speak to your teacher or

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.990 
scales here speak to your teacher or
your<00:02:07.110> educator<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.190> no<00:02:08.399> doubt<00:02:08.610> they<00:02:08.819> will

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
your educator and no doubt they will

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.830 
your educator and no doubt they will
give<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.330> their<00:02:09.709> favorites<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.130> subject

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
give you their favorites on this subject

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.559 
give you their favorites on this subject
okay<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.670> finally<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.790> well<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.329> is

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
okay so finally as well with this is

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.839 
okay so finally as well with this is
it's<00:02:15.870> going<00:02:16.049> to<00:02:16.140> complete<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:18.319> set<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.849> chords

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
it's going to complete the set of chords

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.520 
it's going to complete the set of chords
scales<00:02:21.000> which<00:02:21.750> are<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.079> make<00:02:22.140> up

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
scales which are going to make up

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.250 
scales which are going to make up
something<00:02:23.420> which<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.599> which<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> slightly

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
something which is a which is a slightly

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.990 
something which is a which is a slightly
different<00:02:25.410> subject<00:02:25.980> called<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> two<00:02:26.700> five

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
different subject called the two five

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 
different subject called the two five
one<00:02:27.269> progression<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.290> we've<00:02:28.410> looked<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.829> this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
one progression and we've looked in this

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.400 
one progression and we've looked in this
series<00:02:29.400> at<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.030> major<00:02:30.269> scale<00:02:30.569> which<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
series at the major scale which is the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.530 
series at the major scale which is the
one<00:02:31.620> we've<00:02:32.310> looked<00:02:32.549> at<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.790> dorian<00:02:33.269> minor

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
one we've looked at the dorian minor

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.960 
one we've looked at the dorian minor
scale<00:02:33.870> which<00:02:34.079> is<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.349> two<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.790> of

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
scale which is the two and this of

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.520 
scale which is the two and this of
course<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.510> speed<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.930> five<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
course is going to speed the five the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.059 
course is going to speed the five the
mixolydian<00:02:38.120> dominant<00:02:39.120> seventh<00:02:39.480> scale<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
mixolydian dominant seventh scale so the

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.699 
mixolydian dominant seventh scale so the
two<00:02:41.310> five<00:02:41.670> one<00:02:42.000> progression<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:43.079> based<00:02:43.500> upon

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
two five one progression is based upon

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.370 
two five one progression is based upon
those<00:02:44.069> three<00:02:44.459> scales<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.359> tubing<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> dorian

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
those three scales the tubing the dorian

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.680 
those three scales the tubing the dorian
the<00:02:46.620> five<00:02:46.889> being<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> mixolydian<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.450> one

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the five being the mixolydian the one

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.110 
the five being the mixolydian the one
being<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.319> major<00:02:49.530> scale<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:50.639> can<00:02:50.940> work

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
being the major scale so you can work

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.379 
being the major scale so you can work
out<00:02:51.329> your<00:02:51.389> scales<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.079> your<00:02:52.170> chords<00:02:53.389> 135

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
out your scales and your chords 135

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.720 
out your scales and your chords 135
seven<00:02:54.840> from<00:02:55.440> those<00:02:55.650> three<00:02:56.010> scales<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.639> that

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
seven from those three scales and that

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.699 
seven from those three scales and that
will<00:02:56.850> give<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.209> two<00:02:57.510> five<00:02:57.810> one<00:02:58.049> progressions

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
will give you two five one progressions

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.220 
will give you two five one progressions
in<00:02:58.859> a<00:02:58.950> major<00:02:59.220> setting<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.660> let's<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.079> have<00:03:01.200> a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
in a major setting so let's just have a

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.170 
in a major setting so let's just have a
look<00:03:01.319> at<00:03:01.440> play<00:03:01.560> around<00:03:01.769> with<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.100> scale<00:03:02.430> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
look at play around with this scale and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:04:17.630 
look at play around with this scale and
see<00:03:03.569> what<00:03:03.780> we<00:03:03.930> can<00:03:04.109> do<00:03:04.260> with<00:03:04.380> it

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.190 

you<00:04:18.640> got<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.060> gives<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.660> mixolydian

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
you got that gives you the mixolydian

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.090 
you got that gives you the mixolydian
dominant<00:04:21.160> seventh<00:04:21.549> scale
