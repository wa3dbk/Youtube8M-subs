then open it up as you can see the

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.140 
then open it up as you can see the
center<00:01:31.860> caps<00:01:32.040> are<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.580> pretty<00:01:32.700> good<00:01:32.940> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
center caps are on there pretty good and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.740 
center caps are on there pretty good and
that<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:34.040> they<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.070> these<00:01:35.280> little

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
that is because they have these little

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.500 
that is because they have these little
little<00:01:36.750> latches<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.940> go<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.450> they

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
little latches that go in and they

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.470 
little latches that go in and they
attach<00:01:39.960> themselves<00:01:39.990> into<00:01:40.890> those<00:01:41.040> little<00:01:41.480> four

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
attach themselves into those little four

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.740 
attach themselves into those little four
holes<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.050> there<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:44.520> go<00:01:44.670> deep<00:01:44.850> enough<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.270> lock

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
holes in there to go deep enough to lock

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.500 
holes in there to go deep enough to lock
into<00:01:45.990> those<00:01:46.170> soap<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.310> center<00:01:47.940> cap<00:01:48.150> problem

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
into those soap the center cap problem

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.540 
into those soap the center cap problem
is<00:01:48.690> no<00:01:48.990> longer<00:01:49.260> an<00:01:49.440> issue<00:01:49.620> with<00:01:50.580> this<00:01:50.760> DIY<00:01:51.720> here

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
is no longer an issue with this DIY here

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.380 
is no longer an issue with this DIY here
so<00:01:53.550> that's<00:01:53.790> what<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:54.000> difference<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.330> between

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so that's what the difference is between

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.860 
so that's what the difference is between
the<00:01:54.780> rubik's<00:01:55.020> DIY<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.440> this<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.740> um<00:01:56.870> yeah

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
the rubik's DIY and this one um yeah

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.480 
the rubik's DIY and this one um yeah
other<00:01:58.080> than<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.260> turning<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.830> Santa<00:01:59.280> class

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
other than that turning in Santa class

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.590 
other than that turning in Santa class
it<00:01:59.850> feels<00:02:00.090> um

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
it feels um

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.270 
it feels um
it<00:02:02.600> feels<00:02:02.780> fast<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:03.740> enough<00:02:03.980> resistance

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
it feels fast but just enough resistance

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.090 
it feels fast but just enough resistance
to<00:02:05.210> keep<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.510> cube<00:02:05.810> under<00:02:06.680> control<00:02:06.980> I<00:02:07.010> can

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
to keep the cube under control I can

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.770 
to keep the cube under control I can
give<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.400> like<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.730> quarter<00:02:08.090> turn<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.570> can<00:02:08.660> do

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
give you like a quarter turn you can do

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.040 
give you like a quarter turn you can do
like<00:02:08.960> a<00:02:08.990> double<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.619> know<00:02:09.740> um<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:11.210> i<00:02:11.540> don't<00:02:11.900> i

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
like a double you know um it's i don't i

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.390 
like a double you know um it's i don't i
love<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.770> control<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.400> view<00:02:13.670> very<00:02:14.540> good

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
love the control of this view very good

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.010 
love the control of this view very good
it's<00:02:16.400> really<00:02:16.580> loose<00:02:16.880> well<00:02:17.480> i<00:02:17.540> have<00:02:17.690> mine<00:02:17.840> set

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
it's really loose well i have mine set

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.230 
it's really loose well i have mine set
really<00:02:18.230> loose<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> cue<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.030> you

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
really loose so it is a cue that you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.960 
really loose so it is a cue that you
have<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.770> know<00:02:21.770> how<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:21.980> control<00:02:22.340> cubes<00:02:22.760> with

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
have to know how to control cubes with

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.320 
have to know how to control cubes with
to<00:02:23.980> use<00:02:24.980> because<00:02:25.280> if<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.850> don't<00:02:25.970> then<00:02:26.210> you're

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
to use because if you don't then you're

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.660 
to use because if you don't then you're
just<00:02:26.390> going<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.750> be<00:02:26.980> popping<00:02:27.980> or<00:02:28.130> whatever<00:02:28.430> all

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
just going to be popping or whatever all

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.100 
just going to be popping or whatever all
over<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.940> place<00:02:29.090> if<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:29.870> you're<00:02:30.050> not

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
over the place if you if you're not

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.960 
over the place if you if you're not
going<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.350> control<00:02:30.650> on<00:02:30.710> cubes<00:02:30.950> anywhere<00:02:31.220> which

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
going to control on cubes anywhere which

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.010 
going to control on cubes anywhere which
most<00:02:32.270> of<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.480> shouldn't<00:02:32.690> have<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.840> problem

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
most of you shouldn't have a problem

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.350 
most of you shouldn't have a problem
with<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.610> i<00:02:34.640> guess<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.150> more<00:02:35.330> like

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
with that so i guess this is more like

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.390 
with that so i guess this is more like
an<00:02:35.630> intermediate<00:02:36.110> cube<00:02:36.380> because<00:02:36.800> if<00:02:37.250> you're

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
an intermediate cube because if you're

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
an intermediate cube because if you're
beginner<00:02:37.700> you're<00:02:37.940> definitely<00:02:38.090> going<00:02:38.360> to

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
beginner you're definitely going to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.390 
beginner you're definitely going to
probably<00:02:39.110> be<00:02:39.350> rough<00:02:39.530> with<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.100> then<00:02:40.250> it's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
probably be rough with it and then it's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.949 
probably be rough with it and then it's
gonna<00:02:40.550> pop<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.910> pieces<00:02:41.240> out<00:02:41.360> if<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:41.780> have<00:02:41.930> a

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
gonna pop the pieces out if you have a

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.480 
gonna pop the pieces out if you have a
set<00:02:42.200> loose<00:02:42.380> like<00:02:42.530> i<00:02:42.620> do<00:02:42.680> if<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.280> have<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.459> set

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
set loose like i do if you have it set

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.820 
set loose like i do if you have it set
tighter<00:02:43.910> then<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.170> shouldn't<00:02:45.410> run<00:02:45.500> into<00:02:45.709> that

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
tighter then you shouldn't run into that

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.660 
tighter then you shouldn't run into that
problem<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.810> yeah<00:02:47.930> basically<00:02:48.170> i<00:02:48.709> guess<00:02:49.459> that's

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
problem so yeah basically i guess that's

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.070 
problem so yeah basically i guess that's
the<00:02:49.760> that's<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.360> review<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.840> sticker

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
the that's the review the sticker

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.400 
the that's the review the sticker
quality<00:02:51.530> on<00:02:51.709> this<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:53.300> little<00:02:53.900> rough<00:02:54.170> as<00:02:54.320> you

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
quality on this is a little rough as you

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.620 
quality on this is a little rough as you
can<00:02:54.530> see<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.310> do<00:02:55.610> recommend<00:02:55.730> getting<00:02:56.270> maybe

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
can see so I do recommend getting maybe

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.750 
can see so I do recommend getting maybe
a<00:02:56.720> replacement<00:02:57.260> set<00:02:57.440> as<00:02:57.830> well<00:02:58.100> from<00:02:58.370> speak<00:02:58.640> up

other<00:03:01.880> than<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.720> stickers<00:03:03.050> have<00:03:03.200> a

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
other than that the the stickers have a

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.050 
other than that the the stickers have a
really<00:03:03.650> nice<00:03:03.770> color<00:03:04.250> scheme<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.760> them<00:03:04.910> they

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
really nice color scheme to them they

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.259 
really nice color scheme to them they
I'm<00:03:05.240> really<00:03:05.630> good<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:06.850> solving<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.940> can<00:03:08.090> see

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
I'm really good for solving you can see

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.880 
I'm really good for solving you can see
between<00:03:08.870> all<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.170> different<00:03:09.200> colors<00:03:09.650> very

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
between all the different colors very

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.190 
between all the different colors very
easily<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:10.690> recognition<00:03:11.690> becomes<00:03:11.989> really

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
easily so recognition becomes really

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.729 
easily so recognition becomes really
really<00:03:12.440> fast<00:03:12.709> um<00:03:14.080> other<00:03:15.080> than<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.380> what<00:03:15.620> you

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
really fast um other than that what you

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.199 
really fast um other than that what you
get<00:03:15.890> with<00:03:16.040> your<00:03:16.130> purchase<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.519> of<00:03:16.820> course<00:03:17.000> the

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
get with your purchase is of course the

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.310 
get with your purchase is of course the
cube<00:03:17.739> then<00:03:18.739> we<00:03:18.920> have<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.220> black<00:03:19.400> right<00:03:19.670> now

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
cube then we have it in black right now

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.620 
cube then we have it in black right now
and<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:21.620> get<00:03:21.800> two<00:03:22.310> sets<00:03:22.610> of<00:03:22.790> stickers<00:03:23.330> with<00:03:23.480> it

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
and you get two sets of stickers with it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.570 
and you get two sets of stickers with it
so<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.260> guess<00:03:24.920> that<00:03:24.950> solves<00:03:25.250> your<00:03:25.340> sticker

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
so I guess that solves your sticker

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.699 
so I guess that solves your sticker

to see if you can find that perfect cube
and<00:03:35.050> I<00:03:36.050> guess<00:03:36.739> that's<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.070> on<00:03:37.340> camera<00:03:37.610> kind<00:03:37.880> of

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.070 
and I guess that's it on camera kind of
looks<00:03:38.060> fluorescent<00:03:38.540> but<00:03:38.630> it<00:03:38.750> is<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.870> pretty

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209
