and in the comptia requirements we need
to<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.170> windows<00:00:28.529> 2000<00:00:29.220> windows<00:00:29.330> XP

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
to do this for windows 2000 windows XP

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
to do this for windows 2000 windows XP
and<00:00:30.539> Windows<00:00:30.960> Vista<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.920> video<00:00:32.279> we're

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and Windows Vista so in this video we're

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.970 
and Windows Vista so in this video we're
going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> focus<00:00:33.270> into<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> full<00:00:34.110> install<00:00:34.590> on

going to focus into a full install on
windows<00:00:35.360> 2000<00:00:36.829> before<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.980> install<00:00:38.100> windows

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879

my operating system and once I had it in

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.270 
my operating system and once I had it in
their<00:02:55.120> windows<00:02:55.810> 2000<00:02:56.380> work<00:02:56.500> properly<00:02:56.890> if<00:02:57.190> you

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
their windows 2000 work properly if you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.309 
their windows 2000 work properly if you

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
don't have it in there you will reboot

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.650 
don't have it in there you will reboot

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
queue delay in there and everything

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.690 
queue delay in there and everything
should<00:03:10.060> work<00:03:10.180> perfectly<00:03:10.569> fine<00:03:11.110> for<00:03:11.170> you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
our virtual machine and we'll see what

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.420 
our virtual machine and we'll see what
happens<00:03:43.500> move<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.620> over<00:03:44.739> from<00:03:45.070> my<00:03:45.280> other

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
process of formatting this so the format

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.830 
process of formatting this so the format
process<00:04:46.250> will<00:04:46.430> take<00:04:46.460> some<00:04:46.790> time<00:04:46.820> depending<00:04:47.300> on

more to do this format process is a

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.530 
there mine are coming directly from a
file<00:05:06.530> which<00:05:07.160> is<00:05:07.190> that<00:05:07.550> iso<00:05:08.000> file<00:05:08.240> that<00:05:08.480> I

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
file which is that iso file that I

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.300 
file which is that iso file that I
created<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.200> copy<00:05:09.410> process<00:05:09.770> on<00:05:10.160> my

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
created so the copy process on my

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.490 
created so the copy process on my
machine<00:05:10.490> goes<00:05:11.270> relatively<00:05:11.810> quickly<00:05:12.110> if

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
machine goes relatively quickly if

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.590 
machine goes relatively quickly if
you're<00:05:12.680> installing<00:05:13.010> this<00:05:13.340> from<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.700> cd-rom<00:05:14.270> or

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
you're installing this from a cd-rom or

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.770 
you're installing this from a cd-rom or
dvd-rom<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.980> access<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.670> those<00:05:16.790> devices<00:05:17.270> to

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
dvd-rom the access to those devices to

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.170 
dvd-rom the access to those devices to
those<00:05:17.990> types<00:05:18.350> of<00:05:18.500> optical<00:05:19.190> media<00:05:19.370> are<00:05:19.730> much

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
those types of optical media are much

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.180 
those types of optical media are much
slower<00:05:20.450> than<00:05:20.930> coming<00:05:21.260> directly<00:05:21.620> from<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.980> hard

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
slower than coming directly from a hard

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.370 
slower than coming directly from a hard
drive<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:22.970> may<00:05:23.210> see<00:05:23.270> yours<00:05:23.690> go<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.930> little

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
drive so you may see yours go a little

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.230 
drive so you may see yours go a little
bit<00:05:24.620> slower<00:05:24.950> than<00:05:25.250> this<00:05:25.460> if<00:05:25.760> it's<00:05:25.910> coming<00:05:26.120> from

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
bit slower than this if it's coming from

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.780 
bit slower than this if it's coming from
that<00:05:26.450> optical<00:05:27.080> media<00:05:27.230> but<00:05:28.010> if<00:05:28.190> you<00:05:28.310> are<00:05:28.550> also

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
that optical media but if you are also

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.470 
that optical media but if you are also
doing<00:05:29.210> it<00:05:29.450> from<00:05:29.600> an<00:05:29.780> iso<00:05:30.280> drive<00:05:31.280> an<00:05:31.520> ISO<00:05:31.940> image

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480

file<00:05:33.020> on<00:05:33.320> your<00:05:33.500> machine<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:34.310> nerves<00:05:34.490> will

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
file on your machine the nerves will

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.810 
file on your machine the nerves will
probably<00:05:35.000> go<00:05:35.150> just<00:05:35.480> this<00:05:35.600> fast<00:05:35.870> as<00:05:36.200> well<00:05:36.820> one

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
probably go just this fast as well one

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.460 
probably go just this fast as well one
now<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.150> it's<00:05:38.270> finished<00:05:38.420> copying<00:05:39.050> all<00:05:39.260> these

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
now that it's finished copying all these

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.040 
now that it's finished copying all these
files<00:05:39.680> over<00:05:40.130> its<00:05:40.340> going<00:05:40.730> to<00:05:40.880> now<00:05:41.000> restart<00:05:41.870> the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
files over its going to now restart the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.690 
files over its going to now restart the
computer<00:05:42.170> with<00:05:42.740> all<00:05:42.890> of<00:05:43.010> those<00:05:43.160> things<00:05:43.220> in

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
computer with all of those things in

continue through with the normal
installation<00:06:07.370> now<00:06:08.240> we<00:06:08.300> get<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.540> windows<00:06:08.870> 2000

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
installation now we get a windows 2000

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.500 
installation now we get a windows 2000
splash<00:06:09.920> screen<00:06:10.310> it<00:06:10.580> says<00:06:10.610> that<00:06:11.390> we're

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510
