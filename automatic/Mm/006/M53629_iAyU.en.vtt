a<00:03:49.410> great<00:03:49.560> way<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.829> be<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.910> think<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.299> great

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
a great way to be and I think it's great

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.740 
a great way to be and I think it's great
for<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.750> state<00:03:52.019> but<00:03:52.880> that<00:03:53.880> game<00:03:54.150> brings<00:03:54.540> out

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
for the state but that game brings out

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.379 
for the state but that game brings out
brings<00:03:55.650> out<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.010> best<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.430> although<00:03:56.850> all<00:03:57.329> of

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
brings out the best in although all of

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.839 
brings out the best in although all of
us<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.620> are<00:03:58.799> associating<00:03:59.370> with<00:03:59.400> her<00:03:59.579> I<00:03:59.609> have

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
us that are associating with her I have

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.789 
us that are associating with her I have
been<00:04:00.000> associated<00:04:00.269> with<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.349> fans<00:04:01.590> as
