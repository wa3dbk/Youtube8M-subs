00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.940
 during the series we can see what purpose and 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.950
 jake make a great team these come together 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.110
 to form a single being and thus highlight 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.900
 with the great magical powers of jake 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.850
 and the end strength is why here 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.790
 we will see how these brothers forge a 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.949
 tie that neither evil can overcome in this 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.170
 top I only found 7 combinations that 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.550
 they are worth mentioning I will show them in 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.590
 the order from the weakest to the most 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.780
 powerful so let's see these mergers 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.820
 excellent define lake in the show 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.620
 Adventure time number 7 super males 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.720
 no doubt there is nothing more masculine than 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.170
 tear off your pajamas and defeat goblins 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.320
 with your brother weight although males 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.320
 hahaha XD 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.080
 no no 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.000
 more games no no no 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.860
 Well, no 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.479
 superpolicies if there is a crime without 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.220
 doubt this pair of detectives will 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.100
 would charge even the most cases 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.350
 difficult ones should even appear in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.729
 cieza series and Miami are sure to 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.729
 they lower the chamba to the cops 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.540
 wasting nobody cares 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.860
 returns 90 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 sweet 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.239
 good 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.030
 but 5 magical fist despite not counting 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.340
 with magic end and jake are mixed and 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.590
 They defeat magicians with their abilities without 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.310
 doubt we would like to see more magical fist 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.310
 in future episodes 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.220
 how 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.840
 time to have the ice king 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.440
 my body waiting for that to survive 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.440
 he was amazing 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.640
 and at this point I open every day 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.780
 no no 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.600
 I am said 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.970
 number 4 money she and a backpack to 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.829
 despite having little presence this union 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.629
 It is very powerful because it is not 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.480
 limited to attacking only by land 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.730
 you can also fly thanks jake besides 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.510
 by adding the weak gauntlet and its power 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.409
 it becomes more destructive 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.409
 and there it is 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.120
 he is recovering those powers that 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.120
 It is very good 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.220
 number 3 masters ninja skills 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.190
 I defined jake are increased due to 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.620
 become children to such a degree to use 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.170
 powers of judo equal to the ice king this 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.000
 despite not having a crown it deserves 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.950
 this post for having so powerful 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.220
 techniques that even Naruto would like 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.220
 to have 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.100
 the cold master and his end and never 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.950
 the cold master jake invokes the 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.130
 Nothing of the rain in brother 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.390
 get ready to hit you the three parts 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.390
 so that they elevate you and 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.570
 I 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.740
 once 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.740
 how it ends in nothing 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.600
 because before the wind 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:44.949
 so much for the low 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.949
 3 are too rich 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:54.069
 our cold 

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:54.069
 Jamie invokes the ice arrow 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.550
 or not 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:08.449
 number 2 king of thieves this union 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.610
 is in this position for being the most agile 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.650
 maybe it's not the most powerful but its 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.780
 Agility to escape is as good as 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.000
 the best thief in the world or sly 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.620
 cooper could look much less 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.620
 do something against this union 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.979
 and atoles of pistolitas 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.009
 Y 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.100
 number 1 the jake suit no doubt the weapon 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.050
 and the most powerful union is capable of 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.380
 combine end fight skills 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.870
 with the magic of jake thus forging the being 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.820
 more powerful in and that's why this 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.880
 union takes the first place for being 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.830
 the best and strongest of all that does not 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.630
 can see me do what I should not and 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.630
 conquests jump to my mouth 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:15.370
 being damn looking traitorous it's time to 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.370
 to fight is the naive warrior knot 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.100
 it can not be that nobody uses ears in a 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.960
 simple battle mentors 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.730
 and here comes this top of the 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.610
 mergers end and jay that I hope that they 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.830
