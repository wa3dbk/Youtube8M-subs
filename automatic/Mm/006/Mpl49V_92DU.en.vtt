welcome back side saber here and today
I'll<00:00:03.240> be<00:00:03.270> launching<00:00:03.780> myself<00:00:04.200> from<00:00:04.440> my<00:00:04.560> big

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
I'll be launching myself from my big

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.509 
I'll be launching myself from my big
berth<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.250> minecraft<00:00:05.790> cannon<00:00:07.220> I've<00:00:08.220> slightly

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
berth on minecraft cannon I've slightly

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.450 
berth on minecraft cannon I've slightly
modified<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.240> from<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.660> previous<00:00:10.139> video<00:00:10.460> I've

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
modified it from the previous video I've

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.259 
modified it from the previous video I've
introduced<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:13.460> full<00:00:14.460> block<00:00:14.730> instead<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.179> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
introduced a full block instead of a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.859 
introduced a full block instead of a
half<00:00:15.509> block<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.770> will<00:00:16.980> retract<00:00:17.690> via<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
half block this will retract via a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.590 
half block this will retract via a
piston<00:00:19.380> underneath<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.890> at<00:00:20.609> almost<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> last

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
piston underneath it at almost the last

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.980 
piston underneath it at almost the last
possible<00:00:22.230> second<00:00:23.390> allowing<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> full

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
possible second allowing for the full

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.349 
possible second allowing for the full
force<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> TNT<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.279> propel<00:00:26.760> me<00:00:26.910> forwards

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
force of the TNT to propel me forwards

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.820 
force of the TNT to propel me forwards
and<00:00:27.539> upwards<00:00:28.369> hopefully<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:29.550> space<00:00:30.830> here

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and upwards hopefully into space here

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:49.000 
and upwards hopefully into space here
goes<00:00:32.009> nothing

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.380 

so<00:00:50.010> powerful<00:00:50.460> it'll<00:00:50.670> blow<00:00:50.879> your<00:00:51.030> skin<00:00:51.269> off

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
so powerful it'll blow your skin off

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
so powerful it'll blow your skin off
apparently<00:00:54.620> unfortunately<00:00:55.620> didn't<00:00:56.010> reach

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
apparently unfortunately didn't reach

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.990 
apparently unfortunately didn't reach
the<00:00:59.059> 5014<00:01:00.890> height<00:01:01.890> limit<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:02.820> high

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the 5014 height limit will not high

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.870 
the 5014 height limit will not high
limit<00:01:03.359> height<00:01:03.839> that<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.080> reached<00:01:04.350> before<00:01:04.880> but

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
limit height that I reached before but

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880 
limit height that I reached before but
it's<00:01:06.000> still<00:01:06.149> close<00:01:06.420> enough<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.710> mileage

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it's still close enough so your mileage

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.770 
it's still close enough so your mileage
may<00:01:08.070> vary<00:01:09.560> due<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:11.180> malfunctioning<00:01:12.180> Rockets

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.899 

but<00:01:15.780> we're<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.200> space<00:01:16.430> space<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.970> space<00:01:18.710> as

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
but we're in space space I'm in space as

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.930 
but we're in space space I'm in space as
the<00:01:20.909> moon<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> Sun<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:23.610> very<00:01:23.850> long

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
the moon and the Sun and a very long

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.710 
the moon and the Sun and a very long
fall<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.929> the<00:01:25.020> bottom<00:01:29.390> with<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.690> of

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
fall to the bottom with a lot of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:41.740 
fall to the bottom with a lot of
jittering<00:01:32.030> let's<00:01:33.030> throw<00:01:33.209> some<00:01:33.360> blocks

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.810 

so<00:01:42.750> shot<00:01:43.200> me<00:01:43.350> approximately<00:01:43.979> 600<00:01:44.580> or<00:01:44.670> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so shot me approximately 600 or so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.240 
so shot me approximately 600 or so
blocks<00:01:45.119> forward<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:49.520> I<00:01:50.520> am<00:01:51.270> Iron<00:01:52.110> Man<00:01:52.140> uh<00:01:52.500> no

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
blocks forward and I am Iron Man uh no

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.050 
blocks forward and I am Iron Man uh no
no<00:01:53.430> no<00:01:53.549> no<00:01:53.729> no<00:01:53.880> no<00:01:54.030> no<00:01:54.090> no<00:01:54.360> no<00:01:54.659> no<00:01:58.399> am<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.850> gonna

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.870 
no no no no no no no no no am I gonna
break<00:02:00.659> my<00:02:00.930> knees<00:02:02.060> perilee<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:05.670> was

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
break my knees perilee not and that was

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.410 
break my knees perilee not and that was
the<00:02:06.119> Big<00:02:06.360> Bertha<00:02:06.600> spaceflight<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:09.179> finish

the Big Bertha spaceflight and to finish
things<00:02:09.600> off<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.259> simply<00:02:10.649> work<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.390> little

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
things off if we simply work a little

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.449 
things off if we simply work a little
bit<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.690> rail<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.200> slanted<00:02:13.739> rail<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.130> front<00:02:14.160> of

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.740 

very<00:02:26.010> quick<00:02:26.370> propulsion<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.180> words<00:02:27.390> though

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
very quick propulsion for words though

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
very quick propulsion for words though
you<00:02:27.810> are<00:02:28.140> almost<00:02:28.440> certainly<00:02:28.890> guaranteed<00:02:29.550> to

you are almost certainly guaranteed to

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.880 
you are almost certainly guaranteed to
die
