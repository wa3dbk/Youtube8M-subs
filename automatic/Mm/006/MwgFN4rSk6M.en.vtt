group I think that it is an interesting
offering<00:00:30.450> I've<00:00:30.600> already<00:00:31.050> tinkered<00:00:31.770> with<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.639 
offering I've already tinkered with the
Vigilant<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:32.789> is<00:00:32.969> their<00:00:33.149> axe<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.170> liked

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
Vigilant which is their axe and I liked

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.430

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it an awful awful lot so I think that it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.110 
it an awful awful lot so I think that it
was<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.590> serious<00:00:38.100> improvement<00:00:38.460> over<00:00:39.000> what

was a serious improvement over what

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400 
was a serious improvement over what
they've<00:00:39.300> been<00:00:39.420> doing<00:00:39.600> didn't<00:00:39.989> throw<00:00:40.170> very

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
a handguard we'll be the judge of that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.049 
a handguard we'll be the judge of that
in<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.989> textured<00:00:58.590> grip<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.790> pretty<00:00:59.969> much

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
in a textured grip so that's pretty much

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.150 
in a textured grip so that's pretty much
it<00:01:00.210> also<00:01:00.570> shows<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> vigilance<00:01:01.559> down<00:01:01.739> here

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it also shows the vigilance down here

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.520 
it also shows the vigilance down here
I'm<00:01:02.430> gonna<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.730> ahead<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.270> unbox<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:04.379> is

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
I'm gonna go ahead and unbox it which is

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.419 
I'm gonna go ahead and unbox it which is
very<00:01:04.589> very<00:01:04.979> simple<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.709> much<00:01:07.709> longer<00:01:08.159> than

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
very very simple and much longer than

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:11.629 
very very simple and much longer than
the<00:01:08.549> vigilance<00:01:08.969> this<00:01:09.179> is<00:01:09.359> one<00:01:09.810> hand<00:01:10.139> two<00:01:10.859> three

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:11.639 
the vigilance this is one hand two three

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:15.139 
the vigilance this is one hand two three
four<00:01:12.240> five<00:01:12.899> so<00:01:13.649> not<00:01:14.249> bad<00:01:14.520> could<00:01:14.939> definitely

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
four five so not bad could definitely

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.449 
four five so not bad could definitely
parry<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.859> feels<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:17.459 
parry with this really feels like a

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:20.330 
parry with this really feels like a
space<00:01:17.909> pirate<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.229> sword<00:01:19.529> does<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
space pirate kind of sword does have a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
space pirate kind of sword does have a
core<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:20.939> again<00:01:21.179> the<00:01:21.299> core<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.779> not<00:01:21.959> very

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
core but again the core is not very

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.099 
core but again the core is not very
thick<00:01:22.499> kind<00:01:23.069> of<00:01:23.189> floppy<00:01:23.459> will<00:01:24.090> probably<00:01:24.689> stop

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
thick kind of floppy will probably stop

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.620 
thick kind of floppy will probably stop
anything<00:01:25.799> from<00:01:26.039> this<00:01:26.520> direction<00:01:26.729> nothing<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
anything from this direction nothing to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.519 
anything from this direction nothing to
like<00:01:27.979> grip<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.219> slide<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.899> think<00:01:31.139> that

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:31.529 
like grip and slide with so I think that

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:33.410 
like grip and slide with so I think that
this<00:01:31.649> would<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.859> an<00:01:32.009> excellent<00:01:32.399> not<00:01:32.700> primary

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
this would be an excellent not primary

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.419 
this would be an excellent not primary
melee<00:01:33.869> weapon<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> nerf<00:01:34.590> war<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:34.979> actually

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
melee weapon for a nerf war but actually

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.789 
melee weapon for a nerf war but actually
a<00:01:35.459> secondary<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.779> your<00:01:36.899> offhand<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.590> seems

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
a secondary for your offhand it seems

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.169 
a secondary for your offhand it seems
like<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.069> be<00:01:38.130> very<00:01:38.219> fun<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:38.999> that

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
like it would be very fun for that

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.569 
like it would be very fun for that
full-on<00:01:39.990> Musketeers<00:01:40.709> style<00:01:41.039> I<00:01:41.249> think<00:01:41.279> that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
full-on Musketeers style I think that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.039 
full-on Musketeers style I think that
that<00:01:41.700> would<00:01:41.849> be<00:01:41.969> very<00:01:41.999> very<00:01:42.420> cool<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> like

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that would be very very cool but I like

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.529 
that would be very very cool but I like
the<00:01:43.200> design<00:01:43.499> of<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.979> am<00:01:44.369> slowly<00:01:44.849> warming<00:01:45.420> up

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
the design of it I am slowly warming up

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.059 
the design of it I am slowly warming up
to<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.779> the<00:01:45.959> phone<00:01:46.169> quality<00:01:46.469> is<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:47.039> I

to this the phone quality is as I
mentioned<00:01:47.700> before<00:01:47.899> very<00:01:48.899> similar<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
mentioned before very similar to the

coating<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.829> Warlock<00:01:56.520> axe<00:01:56.819> but<00:01:57.450> very

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
coating on the Warlock axe but very

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.979 
coating on the Warlock axe but very
comparable<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> blade<00:01:59.639> on<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.479> shadow

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
comparable to the blade on this shadow

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:02.719 
comparable to the blade on this shadow
fury<00:02:01.349> so<00:02:01.529> I<00:02:01.590> will<00:02:01.709> give<00:02:01.859> that<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
fury so I will give that to the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.359 
fury so I will give that to the
draculina<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.630> then<00:02:03.989> before<00:02:04.289> we<00:02:04.529> do<00:02:04.799> any<00:02:05.099> sort

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
draculina and then before we do any sort

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.159 
draculina and then before we do any sort
of<00:02:05.489> musketeer<00:02:06.060> action<00:02:06.389> we<00:02:06.509> will<00:02:06.599> just<00:02:06.840> test

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:07.169 
of musketeer action we will just test

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.650 
of musketeer action we will just test
how<00:02:07.709> well<00:02:07.739> it<00:02:08.190> Perry's<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.880> guess<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.509> we

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
how well it Perry's so I guess here we

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.620 
how well it Perry's so I guess here we
have<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.739> it

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
have this and it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.710 
have this and it
is<00:02:12.010> bending<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.220> guess<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.670> side<00:02:14.000> as<00:02:14.330> we<00:02:14.360> go

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
is bending I guess to the side as we go

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.240 
is bending I guess to the side as we go
through<00:02:14.990> which<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:15.530> expected<00:02:15.830> as<00:02:16.130> it

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
through which is to be expected as it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.610 
through which is to be expected as it
just<00:02:16.400> doesn't<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:16.940> large<00:02:17.450> core<00:02:18.290> tube

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
just doesn't have that large core tube

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.080 
just doesn't have that large core tube
that<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.040> does<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.460> can<00:02:19.610> see<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:19.940> this

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
that this does you can see that this

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.890 
that this does you can see that this
does<00:02:20.300> not<00:02:20.450> Bend

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
does not Bend

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.550 
does not Bend
whereas<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.470> goes<00:02:22.160> full<00:02:22.580> full<00:02:23.270> floopy<00:02:23.780> on<00:02:24.140> us

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
whereas this goes full full floopy on us

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.970 
whereas this goes full full floopy on us
like<00:02:25.190> like<00:02:25.670> American<00:02:26.270> cheese<00:02:26.770> which<00:02:27.770> isn't

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
at least a couple more times and now

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.500 
at least a couple more times and now

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
here just give me one good swing into

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.500

the handguard here Wow and that hurt um

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.660 
the handguard here Wow and that hurt um
actually<00:02:42.230> mostly<00:02:42.740> cuz<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.070> hit<00:02:43.190> my<00:02:43.310> ring<00:02:43.520> but

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
actually mostly cuz it hit my ring but

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.130 
actually mostly cuz it hit my ring but
this<00:02:43.760> handguard<00:02:44.210> is<00:02:44.300> not<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.480> real<00:02:44.720> handguard

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
this handguard is not a real handguard

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.230 
this handguard is not a real handguard
you<00:02:45.230> can<00:02:45.410> see<00:02:45.620> completely<00:02:46.430> crunchable<00:02:47.000> not

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
you can see completely crunchable not

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.910 
you can see completely crunchable not
doing<00:02:47.570> anything<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.050> core<00:02:48.290> does<00:02:48.410> not<00:02:48.590> extend

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
doing anything the core does not extend

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.490 
doing anything the core does not extend
through<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.340> now<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:50.060> feel<00:02:50.540> however<00:02:51.230> this

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
through it now I do feel however this

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.560 
through it now I do feel however this
isn't<00:02:51.950> safe<00:02:52.400> at<00:02:52.640> all<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.180> blowgun

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
isn't safe at all is this the blowgun

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.410 
isn't safe at all is this the blowgun
sword<00:02:53.960> I<00:02:54.230> guess<00:02:54.710> as<00:02:54.950> an<00:02:55.430> offhand<00:02:55.910> weapon<00:02:56.270> this

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
sword I guess as an offhand weapon this

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.500 
sword I guess as an offhand weapon this
would<00:02:56.570> be<00:02:56.720> very<00:02:57.410> effective<00:03:00.370> anyway<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.210> that's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
would be very effective anyway so that's

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.470 
would be very effective anyway so that's
our<00:03:02.780> review<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.550> nerf<00:03:04.550> swift<00:03:05.210> justice

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
our review of the nerf swift justice

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.830 
our review of the nerf swift justice
from<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.110> doom<00:03:06.410> lands<00:03:06.790> 2169<00:03:07.790> line<00:03:08.060> we<00:03:08.600> think

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
from the doom lands 2169 line we think

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.300 
from the doom lands 2169 line we think
that<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.080> an<00:03:09.170> interesting<00:03:09.470> offering<00:03:10.130> I'm

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
that it's an interesting offering I'm

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.270 
that it's an interesting offering I'm
actually<00:03:10.550> kind<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.770> amused<00:03:12.770> by<00:03:12.920> this<00:03:12.980> one<00:03:13.250> I

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
actually kind of amused by this one I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.860 
actually kind of amused by this one I
think<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.940> better<00:03:14.180> offering<00:03:14.750> and

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
think that it's the better offering and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.210 
think that it's the better offering and
since<00:03:15.050> they're<00:03:15.230> priced<00:03:15.500> similarly<00:03:15.740> I<00:03:16.130> think

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
since they're priced similarly I think

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.100 
since they're priced similarly I think
it's<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.670> one<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.120> should<00:03:17.150> pick<00:03:17.540> up<00:03:17.570> if

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
it's the one that you should pick up if

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.990 
it's the one that you should pick up if
you'd<00:03:18.260> like<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.590> pick<00:03:18.710> up<00:03:18.890> one<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.250> your<00:03:19.340> very

section<00:03:34.250> but<00:03:34.640> let's<00:03:35.570> see<00:03:35.750> how<00:03:35.960> well<00:03:36.170> this<00:03:36.350> guy

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
section but let's see how well this guy

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.830 
section but let's see how well this guy
tosses<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.460> instead<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.150> throwing<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.540> from<00:03:38.780> an

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
tosses so instead of throwing it from an

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.600 
tosses so instead of throwing it from an
actual<00:03:39.290> grip<00:03:39.620> I<00:03:39.830> think<00:03:39.860> that<00:03:40.130> I'm<00:03:40.220> gonna<00:03:40.370> try

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
actual grip I think that I'm gonna try

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.180 
actual grip I think that I'm gonna try
it<00:03:40.670> from<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:41.000> lower<00:03:41.209> grip<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.750> get<00:03:41.900> more

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
it from a lower grip to get more

perspective<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:54.950> can<00:03:55.130> throw<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.670> shadow<00:03:56.180> Fury

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
perspective you can throw a shadow Fury

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.960 
perspective you can throw a shadow Fury
much<00:03:57.260> more<00:03:57.500> effectively<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.550> get<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.730> much

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
much more effectively and get a much

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.580 
much more effectively and get a much
wider<00:03:59.240> spread<00:03:59.750> that<00:04:00.260> was<00:04:00.350> a<00:04:00.380> much<00:04:00.560> gentler

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
wider spread that was a much gentler

wider spread that was a much gentler
toss<00:04:01.430> as<00:04:01.820> well<00:04:02.450> but<00:04:02.840> as<00:04:03.080> always<00:04:03.410> guys<00:04:03.680> thanks

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
toss as well but as always guys thanks
