00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.930
 Hi there, before you wireless 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.080
 headphones, that is, radio headphones like this 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.420
 looks set of delivery 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:33.210
 cardboard box on which are displayed 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 main advantages and functions of data 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.980
 Headphones are very detailed instructions 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.980
 but unfortunately in English 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.489
 painted equipment all the chips and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.360
 when i have a similar scheme 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 like that, and where do they same headphones 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.670
 the receiver is made mostly of plastic 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:04.010
 black and very young skin 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 dermantina is so young that right 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.650
 feelings can be scratched on why 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.630
 must pierce through 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.799
 emitter with wire one audio cable with 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.060
 two ends of the three and a half connector and 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.409
 one such adapter 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.430
 I will start the adapter with headphones 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.280
 they look closer 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.080
 consideration 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.229
 on the right earpiece there are such here 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.329
 buttons reset button scan volume 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.970
 loudness minimum position 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.040
 off yes then on in 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.680
 poriskhodit click Scan scan frequency 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.780
 reset button resets means and I 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.070
 headphones with a marriage reset button is not at all 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.979
 works as well as the Chinese forgot to solder 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.090
 two wires therefore 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.729
 battery headsets did not work 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.420
 the battery is inserted here in the left 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.150
 headphone that is like a battery and so 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.560
 and 1 and 5 volts normal battery 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.899
 format 3a and then I mean mizinchikovye forgot 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.130
 solder well that a friend could help 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.900
 soldered in principle disassembled here are yours 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.450
 things were not so much in principle 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.550
 difficult as it seemed to me at assembly 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.270
 Little 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.190
 overlooked and so the left ear screwed 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.950
 there must be rights and here you see they 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.160
 both r right and left 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.230
 in principle, this does not affect 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.330
 ergonomics 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.569
 wearing headphones sit comfortably on your head 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.010
 pretty pretty also bottom 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.390
 right ear 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.299
 there is an exit to three and a half if 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.000
 it is worth using an audio cable 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.709
 This is what headphones work without 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.660
 batteries that is can be used as 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.230
 wired headphones connect computer 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.420
 player 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.480
 That is, in principle, the essence of this is not 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.950
 justify deliver you can use 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.090
 without and veteran alone headphones 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.220
 lovers of quality music I think 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.269
 These headphones are not suitable but for 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.880
 watching television computer think 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.989
 enough headphone size you can 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.900
 to regulate like this 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.450
 by themselves parties that is to lease even to 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.769
 the biggest head 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.459
 emitter also sprinkled on black 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:34.290
 plastic face at such a delivery in the bottom 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.540
 clouds part you podstavochku inserted 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.680
 also two batteries or batteries 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.680
 format 3a 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.180
 when 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.299
 emitter is turned on then in the middle here 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.390
 Here is a red light I hope you 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.269
 seen in the back of the emitter 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.290
 is located a switch in such 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.660
 position off 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.000
 here the various positions are extremely right 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.010
 did not use audio accounting on the last 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.389
 In my opinion itâ€™s unethical I'm here with us 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.400
 microphone hole is charging here 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.459
 four and a half volt complete 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.650
 she's not here I understand something like 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.200
 small speaker 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.090
 for microphone now in more detail 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.090
 talk about the work of this kit 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:27.110
 it means the system is very simple and the metro 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:30.889
 connecting a computer to either TV 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.750
 here through these connectors or through this 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.460
 adapter 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.680
 I'll say it right away on TV 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.229
 I connected but I could not start 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.380
 through these connectors only through this one 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.350
 adapter socket three and a half 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.970
 included then the system worked know in 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.280
 what's the matter maybe some small 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.970
 marriage or something I did not mean 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.510
 hooked up 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:58.220
 next we turn on the position 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:00.740
 we expose further we turn on the headset again 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.300
 same subject to anything emitter either 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.419
 powered by adapter 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.990
 either from batteries to headphones from batteries 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:14.169
 yes it means the key includes this 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:17.150
 position press scan here usually after 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.930
 first click already find our frequency 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.460
 In my 90000 something that is caught like 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.710
 I could catch the radio 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.870
 the frequency of this emitter today 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.500
 enjoy the sound radius principle 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.750
 big 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.710
 I measured my apartment forty meters 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.760
 square 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.740
 that is, took from one to another edge 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.970
 If you use headphones as wired 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.889
 then the batteries are not for us 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:45.740
 we don't need just insert this one 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:48.199
 cord up into the player or into the computer all and 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.090
 we listen to these buttons of the general anise in any way 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.599
 worked that is and does not interfere with sound well 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.639
 add 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:55.690
 that is, you add either player or 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:59.530
 computer conclusion I will say that 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:02.720
 headphones left some kind of neutral 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:06.199
 impression of myself can not advise not 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.180
 advise shopping in general, I did not regret 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.520
 of course I had to 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.860
 to tinker 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.090
 as it was necessary to solder these wires 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:20.180
 parse everything also discover this 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.550
 the problem here is in principle the headphones themselves 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.439
 pay off can be used as easy 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.789
 wired 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:28.550
 I would also like to focus your attention 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:30.680
 on the fact that this headphones though 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:35.509
 Wireless but still headphones that is 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.909
 do not expect miracles from them as a matter of fact it is usually 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.439
 headphones that plug into the socket 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:42.469
 I could not eat at the same time 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:45.400
 make the game allow headphones but in 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:48.729
 in terms of games and music and on a laptop that is 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.919
 requires a splitter and three and a half 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.710
 up fake speakers on up 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:57.259
 separately headphones and the same with 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.710
 I had a big TV set 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:03.979
 problems to move the TV behind 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.449
 there feed the limiter here 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.490
 respectively, the sound on the TV and 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:10.909
 I was turned off already listened to the headphones 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:14.090
 there is a procedure so they are unpleasant that is 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:16.430
 need to somehow think in advance think on 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:20.229
 this review is over thanks for all 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.229
 attention view all bye
