bigger splitter than we had on the old

FIA rules and are designed to give us

FIA rules and are designed to give us
more<00:00:38.940> downforce<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:40.140> certainly

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
more downforce and you can certainly

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.280 
more downforce and you can certainly
feel<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.800> under<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> hood<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:43.110> had<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
feel that under the hood here we had a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
feel that under the hood here we had a
v8<00:00:43.649> before<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> v6<00:00:45.059> twin-turbo

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
v8 before now we have a v6 twin-turbo

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
v8 before now we have a v6 twin-turbo
you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> twin<00:00:47.129> inlets<00:00:47.489> here

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you can see that the twin inlets here

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.810 
you can see that the twin inlets here
where<00:00:47.940> obviously<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.450> restricted<00:00:49.640> fat<00:00:50.640> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
where obviously we restricted fat you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.670 
where obviously we restricted fat you
know<00:00:50.940> fairly<00:00:51.270> heavily<00:00:51.420> restricted<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.410> this

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
know fairly heavily restricted in this

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
know fairly heavily restricted in this
class<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.640> you've<00:00:53.910> got<00:00:54.059> some<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.420> big

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
class because you've got some really big

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
class because you've got some really big
motors<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.230> run<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> against<00:00:55.800> some<00:00:55.949> cars

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
motors and you run it against some cars

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
motors and you run it against some cars
with<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.940> no<00:00:57.120> forced<00:00:57.480> induction<00:00:57.629> such<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
with with no forced induction such as a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.160 
with with no forced induction such as a
Ferraris<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.250> others<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> Porsche

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
Ferraris and others so and the Porsche

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
Ferraris and others so and the Porsche
so<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so we have to you know they have to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.640 
so we have to you know they have to
restrict<00:01:03.390> fairly<00:01:03.750> heavily<00:01:03.930> actually<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
restrict fairly heavily actually the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.380 
restrict fairly heavily actually the
presence<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> car<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.670> looks<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.150> very

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
presence of the car it looks very very

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.000 
presence of the car it looks very very
aggressive<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.020> quite<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.439> wider<00:01:07.740> than

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
aggressive it's quite a bit wider than

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.250 
aggressive it's quite a bit wider than
the<00:01:08.040> old<00:01:08.250> car<00:01:08.490> again<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.720> by<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.960> rules

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the old car again you know by the rules

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.010 
the old car again you know by the rules
we<00:01:10.470> were<00:01:10.590> allowed<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.020> also

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
we were allowed to do this and also

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 
we were allowed to do this and also
we've<00:01:13.530> got<00:01:13.560> bigger<00:01:13.890> tires<00:01:14.220> were<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> fact<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
we've got bigger tires were in fact the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
we've got bigger tires were in fact the
the<00:01:15.900> front<00:01:16.080> tire<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.680> car<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.159> old

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the front tire on this car is the old

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.789 
the front tire on this car is the old
rear<00:01:17.759> tire<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.540> we've<00:01:18.990> got<00:01:19.170> quite<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> bit<00:01:19.650> more

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
rear tire so we've got quite a bit more

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
rear tire so we've got quite a bit more
mechanical<00:01:20.340> grip<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.180> cause<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.689> little

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
mechanical grip so the cause a little

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.280 
mechanical grip so the cause a little
bit<00:01:22.560> lighter<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:23.460> more<00:01:23.640> downforce<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
bit lighter got more downforce so you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
bit lighter got more downforce so you
know<00:01:25.409> you've<00:01:25.920> definitely<00:01:26.100> come<00:01:26.610> feel<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
know you've definitely come feel it you

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.870 
know you've definitely come feel it you
feel<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.720> car<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.110> more<00:01:28.259> nimble<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.520> lot

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
feel the car to be more nimble and a lot

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.670 
feel the car to be more nimble and a lot
of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.090> time<00:01:30.299> actually<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> street<00:01:31.470> car

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
of the time actually on the street car

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
of the time actually on the street car
we've<00:01:31.860> we've<00:01:32.009> got<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.280> same<00:01:32.460> things<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:33.060> on

we've we've got the same things going on

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.929 
we've we've got the same things going on
the<00:01:33.960> Cadillac<00:01:34.170> Street<00:01:35.100> cars<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> lot

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the Cadillac Street cars have got a lot

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.789 
the Cadillac Street cars have got a lot
more<00:01:35.970> nimble<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> lot<00:01:36.750> more<00:01:36.900> performance<00:01:37.079> rated

fairly<00:02:12.390> similar<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> cockpit<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:13.440> do<00:02:13.590> have

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
fairly similar in the cockpit we do have

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.350 
fairly similar in the cockpit we do have
a<00:02:13.830> kind<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.550> cool<00:02:14.730> steering<00:02:15.090> wheel<00:02:15.210> this

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
a kind of a cool steering wheel this

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.080 
a kind of a cool steering wheel this
time<00:02:15.570> it's<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.990> jockey<00:02:16.320> wheel<00:02:17.090> we

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
time it's like the jockey wheel we

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.880 
time it's like the jockey wheel we
didn't<00:02:18.330> have<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.780> CTS<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:19.560> actually

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
didn't have that in the CTS but actually

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.370 
didn't have that in the CTS but actually
like<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.400> getting<00:02:20.640> used<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.380> the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
like it I'm getting used to it and the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.350 
like it I'm getting used to it and the
biggest<00:02:22.740> thing<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.220> paddle<00:02:23.490> shifters<00:02:23.820> we

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
biggest thing is the paddle shifters we

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.170 
biggest thing is the paddle shifters we
always<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.020> sequential<00:02:25.410> box<00:02:25.820> in<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.000> in

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
always have the sequential box in the in

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.750 
always have the sequential box in the in
the<00:02:27.330> these<00:02:27.600> years<00:02:27.900> since<00:02:28.350> 2011<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.340> CTSV

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the these years since 2011 and the CTSV

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.030 
the these years since 2011 and the CTSV
but<00:02:30.570> now<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:30.750> have<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.080> paddle<00:02:31.380> shifters<00:02:31.800> so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
but now we have the paddle shifters so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.310 
but now we have the paddle shifters so
I've<00:02:32.550> actually<00:02:32.790> had<00:02:33.210> never<00:02:33.540> driven<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.960> racecar

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
I've actually had never driven a racecar

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.350 
I've actually had never driven a racecar
with<00:02:34.440> paddle<00:02:34.710> shifters<00:02:34.740> before<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:36.030> luckily

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
with paddle shifters before but luckily

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.950 
with paddle shifters before but luckily
my<00:02:36.750> cts-v<00:02:37.560> sport<00:02:38.490> streetcar<00:02:38.970> has<00:02:39.000> paddles<00:02:39.750> and

my cts-v sport streetcar has paddles and

being<00:03:19.950> very<00:03:20.040> safe<00:03:20.430> vehicles<00:03:20.820> also<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.420> kind<00:03:21.930> of

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
being very safe vehicles also so kind of

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.790 
being very safe vehicles also so kind of
goes<00:03:22.110> along<00:03:22.290> with<00:03:22.470> it

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
goes along with it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.470 
goes along with it
I'm<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.280> fans<00:03:23.490> here<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> back<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.300> car

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
I'm the fans here in the back of the car

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.060 
I'm the fans here in the back of the car
basically<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.200> diff<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.890> gearbox

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
basically the diff and the gearbox

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.670 
basically the diff and the gearbox
coolers<00:03:26.700> are<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.000> here<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.260> this<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
coolers are in here and so this is a

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.200 
coolers are in here and so this is a
great<00:03:28.890> place<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.280> get<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.490> cooling<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.090> it

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
great place to get the cooling for it

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.280 
great place to get the cooling for it
that's<00:03:30.390> basically<00:03:30.750> what<00:03:30.960> it<00:03:31.020> is<00:03:31.140> people

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
that's basically what it is people

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.390 
that's basically what it is people
thought<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.740> was<00:03:31.770> sort<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.130> some

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
thought it was sort of some

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.610 
thought it was sort of some
sophisticated<00:03:33.270> fuel<00:03:33.630> loading<00:03:33.990> area<00:03:34.290> but<00:03:34.470> no

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
sophisticated fuel loading area but no

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.770 
sophisticated fuel loading area but no
it's<00:03:35.130> really<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.610> for<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.910> cooling<00:03:36.270> down

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
it's really just for the cooling down

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.780 
it's really just for the cooling down
here<00:03:37.020> we<00:03:37.170> did<00:03:37.320> not<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.740> this<00:03:38.010> on<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.370> old<00:03:38.520> car

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
here we did not have this on the old car

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.470 
here we did not have this on the old car
so<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.959> diffuser<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:41.370> know<00:03:41.490> again<00:03:41.970> an<00:03:42.150> FIA

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
so the diffuser is you know again an FIA

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.400 
so the diffuser is you know again an FIA
gt3<00:03:43.080> deal<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.250> that's<00:03:44.760> basically<00:03:45.230> helps<00:03:46.230> us

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
gt3 deal and that's basically helps us

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.910 
gt3 deal and that's basically helps us
with<00:03:46.590> downforce<00:03:47.100> so<00:03:47.730> we<00:03:48.600> again<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.740> a<00:03:49.800> high

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
with downforce so we again and a high

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.199 
with downforce so we again and a high
speed<00:03:50.220> stuff<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:50.580> really<00:03:50.820> notice<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
speed stuff we really notice the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.060 
speed stuff we really notice the
difference<00:03:51.240> in<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.660> high<00:03:51.780> speed<00:03:52.080> turns<00:03:52.740> with

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
difference in the high speed turns with

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.580 
difference in the high speed turns with
more<00:03:53.280> downforce<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:53.940> these<00:03:54.090> cars<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.720> we<00:03:55.440> were

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
more downforce in these cars and we were

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.990 
more downforce in these cars and we were
you<00:03:55.800> know<00:03:55.830> we<00:03:55.920> pushed<00:03:56.250> against<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:56.730> last

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
you know we pushed against that last

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.550 
you know we pushed against that last
year<00:03:57.209> with<00:03:57.390> with<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.720> old<00:03:57.900> car<00:03:58.110> where<00:03:58.380> we

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
year with with the old car where we

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.350 
year with with the old car where we
didn't<00:03:58.800> have<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.250> but<00:03:59.730> it's<00:03:59.880> really<00:04:00.150> nice<00:04:00.330> to

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
didn't have that but it's really nice to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.000 
didn't have that but it's really nice to
have<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:00.810> now<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.140> we<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.380> keep<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.740> in<00:04:01.920> the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
have that now so we can keep up in the

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.350 
have that now so we can keep up in the
fast<00:04:02.220> corners<00:04:02.400> which<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.940> great

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
fast corners which is great

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.630 
fast corners which is great
