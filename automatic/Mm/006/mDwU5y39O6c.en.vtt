 new video we that today I have 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.530
 caught in a small stream that I 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.129
 said so to do the roach for 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.139

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:18.010
 so we're going and we're going to see this 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.230
 that it will give me agony and I will 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.020
 load the car to the public so I 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.790
 have them for two hours of fishing 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.960
 three hours of fishing 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.230
 so we end up at the water's edge 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.230
 above 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.720
