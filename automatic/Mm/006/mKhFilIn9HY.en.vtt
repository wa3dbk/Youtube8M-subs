00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.020 

Skilling's<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.230> your<00:01:52.650> biggest<00:01:53.370> flaw<00:01:53.760> in<00:01:53.940> this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
Skilling's and your biggest flaw in this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.730 
Skilling's and your biggest flaw in this
game<00:01:54.270> anymore<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.840> were<00:01:54.900> in<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.170> first<00:01:55.470> one

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
game anymore they were in the first one

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.640 
game anymore they were in the first one
but<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.160> I<00:01:56.190> think<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:57.140> lizard<00:01:58.140> men<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.560> have

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
but now I think the lizard men that have

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.310 
but now I think the lizard men that have
thrown<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.210> I'll<00:02:00.210> grab<00:02:00.510> that<00:02:00.720> for<00:02:00.870> no<00:02:00.990> reason

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
thrown in I'll grab that for no reason

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.250 
thrown in I'll grab that for no reason
they<00:02:02.040> tend<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:03.300> be<00:02:03.450> better<00:02:03.720> than<00:02:03.870> skeletons

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
they tend to to be better than skeletons

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.860 
they tend to to be better than skeletons
