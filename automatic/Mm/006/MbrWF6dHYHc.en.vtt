saying it's 23 minutes past twelve and
this<00:02:22.000> watch<00:02:22.210> is<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:23.220> lot<00:02:24.220> easier<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.820> read<00:02:25.030> than

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
this watch is a lot easier to read than

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.980 
this watch is a lot easier to read than
some<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:26.530> other<00:02:26.650> Tokyo<00:02:27.540> flash<00:02:28.540> watches

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
some of the other Tokyo flash watches

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.150 
some of the other Tokyo flash watches
because<00:02:29.230> they've<00:02:30.330> still<00:02:31.330> got<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:33.070> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
because they've still got the on the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.090 
because they've still got the on the
outer<00:02:33.310> rim<00:02:33.580> you've<00:02:34.420> got<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.690> twelve<00:02:35.100> numbers

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
outer rim you've got the twelve numbers

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.430 
outer rim you've got the twelve numbers
which<00:02:36.460> represent<00:02:37.060> no<00:02:37.300> vowels<00:02:38.020> from<00:02:38.140> one<00:02:38.320> to

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
which represent no vowels from one to

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.550 
which represent no vowels from one to
twelve<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.120> quite<00:02:40.390> seriously<00:02:40.840> got<00:02:41.020> 12<00:02:41.290> 1

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
twelve so it is quite seriously got 12 1

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.740 
twelve so it is quite seriously got 12 1
