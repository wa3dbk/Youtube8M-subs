00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.530
 we also saw Keith around I got it the derailleur's chain 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.130
 taken over throwing out the biggest chain reaction 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.150
 this means 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.259
 here on the construction in Zug 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.449
 there is too much tension on it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.159
 to reduce the tension 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.159
 Percent need this intimidation or a drink 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.029
 and then we pick the notes thrower who is a little more 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.660
 claim differently 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.990
 they take away the tension as long as there is still a small gap 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.030
 of two millimeters as tilted between the right side 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.100
 but probably would not have noticed the derailleur itself 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.940
 Reason the whole country 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.260
 with Menachem 20 his piece 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 that still has to fit in between 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.550
 so we'll be around in ten years 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.030
 and the Shellong have found the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.750
 the Hungarian but also around 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.399
 m reliably switch 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.040
 and not to go too far 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 Not only will Bocholter look at the har stop 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.500
 both participate 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.530
 to 4 open resistance and you can do that MoMA to Iraq attention 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.240
 Turn so that the screw is just solid 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 around Walter Bremen 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.620
 and as in Cannes 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.620
 not continue even if I stop 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.180
 but not for that to continue 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.680
 just like you order now at the smallest chainring forums 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.499
 we switch to the back of a server of the larger Thom wheels 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.230
 best on the biggest 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.040
 pick percent switch now worthwhile down 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.660
 insured jump down 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.130
 and here we are not completely the gap is too big 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.819
 while there with 20 to 22 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:26.149
 around this active who second Antons satisfied thus of the modern vehicle 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:32.450
 You do not have to do anything more than turn the screw in 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.289
 but that is easier 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.939
 m the handling of an attack is pending therefore Verden is normal in the 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.939
 second gear duty 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.689
 Coach especially women 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.479
 and shut me down 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.479
 and also holds ministers 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.169
 that would be too much of the derailleur and will not fit my chain frame 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.479
 that's why the show has to bring something out again we can do that too 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:12.979
 while the front derailleur is at the stop because he is crying 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.059
 while just a few 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.309
 against the force 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:18.629
 to turn against 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.969
 Space spaces 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.269
 the chain and Lars 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.009
 and now here too 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.009
 Tom Felton does not resemble the culprit 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.049
 as long as here too 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.049
 have a gap of about 2 millimeters 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.199
 so that there can be 20 to his piece 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.420
 Not 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.420
 so the wars throw so many customers 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.779
 now look after and blood and the whole thing again looking at Schallstadt 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:08.159
 Stauffer find 1 percent Fritzl in the middle and keep us happy times 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.299
 demand 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.079
 all chainrings through 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.870
 and also look Ruppert 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.870
 do not get that far 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.539
 Pfullendorf the chain does not jump down anymore 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:32.119
 Everyone should know that from the smallest chainring to the middle one 

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:33.439
 do not skip anymore 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:37.029
 So far, the farmer looking for a wife has become easier 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:40.939
 Just replace the screw on the front of the shift lever a bit 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:41.729
 release
