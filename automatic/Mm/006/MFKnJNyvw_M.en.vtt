00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that's what they designed it for when

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.849 
that's what they designed it for when
you<00:00:59.280> roll<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.180> I've<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.859> really

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you roll it up and so I've got a really

and show you what it looks like now I'm
six<00:01:13.500> feet<00:01:13.619> tall<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:15.080> found<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
six feet tall I found that that's the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.109 
six feet tall I found that that's the
best<00:01:16.770> way<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:16.979> take<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.430> thing<00:01:17.670> off<00:01:17.850> because

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
best way to take this thing off because

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.920 
best way to take this thing off because
it<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.450> cut<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:20.040> your<00:01:20.220> body<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.930> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
it is cut just right to your body and it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
it is cut just right to your body and it
fits<00:01:22.350> perfectly<00:01:22.460> if<00:01:23.460> you're<00:01:23.610> trying<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.820> take

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
fits perfectly if you're trying to take

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.399 
fits perfectly if you're trying to take
one<00:01:24.270> arm<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.930> time

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
one arm out at a time

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.539 
one arm out at a time
you're<00:01:25.560> probably<00:01:25.710> gonna<00:01:26.040> rip<00:01:26.310> something

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you're probably gonna rip something

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
you're probably gonna rip something
that's<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.540> 40<00:01:27.900> denier<00:01:28.320> ripstop<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.250> it's

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that's like 40 denier ripstop so it's

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.060 
that's like 40 denier ripstop so it's
very<00:01:29.610> durable<00:01:29.970> snag<00:01:30.689> proof<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.740> roll<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
very durable snag proof you can roll the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.620 
very durable snag proof you can roll the
hood<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.729> thing<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
hood up with this thing right here and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.499 
hood up with this thing right here and
the<00:01:34.350> rain<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.680> definitely<00:01:34.829> picking<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.579> this

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the rain is definitely picking up this

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.710 
the rain is definitely picking up this
is<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> size<00:01:37.049> medium<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.090> times<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.479> mean<00:01:39.630> I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
is a size medium a lot of times I mean I

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.510 
is a size medium a lot of times I mean I
could<00:01:39.900> probably<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.439> down<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> small<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
could probably go down to a small the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160 
could probably go down to a small the
