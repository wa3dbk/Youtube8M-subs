00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.719
 hi my name is shark vitali i 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.519
 engaged in the production of three-dimensional 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.349
 content for game engines in this 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.059
 a series of lessons i will share with you my 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.070
 experience in applying very interesting 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.200
 technique then scan and more specifically 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.419
 photogrammetry series will consist of 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.970
 three lessons the first lesson will be devoted to 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.160
 preparing and shooting directly 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.930
 the second lesson we will look at the cloud build 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.820
 points of footage 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.040
 but in the third lesson I will show you how 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.399
 make a retopology of the resulting model and 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.719
 preparation and under the game engine and so 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.780
 for shooting we need any 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.300
 SLR camera soap dish or on 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.100
 extreme case smartphone as well as for 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.780
 shooting very high objects to you 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.340
 need a monopod and remote 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.650
 remote control 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.550
 best shot outside 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.230
 it's a nasty day 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.600
 either specially equipped 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.730
 photo studios are very desirable to 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.829
 the subject matter was as matt as possible and 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.840
 opaque otherwise you can 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.970
 make the item matte with talc 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.729
 but then we lose the texture of the object and 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.560
 we only get its shape object size 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.540
 should not be too small as well 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.979
 It is worth considering that small parts can 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.899
 create unwanted noise 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.689
 shooting needs to be made in the manual mode 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.460
 as the value of photosensitivity 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.350
 white balance and aperture should be 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.270
 fixed also worth noting that on 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.219
 frames must not be overexposed 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.439
 them or underexposed their plots 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.569
 You need to shoot the object in such a way that 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.539
 blocking it on adjacent frames was not 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.700
 less than 30 percent for this lesson in 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.859
 as a subject has been chosen here 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.219
 is dilapidated reinforced concrete 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.219
 porch 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.870
 best shot at wide angle 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.490
 lens 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.100
 because with him the easiest to get 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.770
 maximum depth of field that is very 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.260
 important for more than photogrammetry 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.700
 you remove the object, the better superfluous 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.460
 frames can always be deleted 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.830
 but to remove is much more difficult for 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.780
 This model was enough for me 24 frames 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.030
 well on this first lesson is over 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.250
 subscribe to my channel not to 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.229
 skip the following lessons not a series in 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.000
 which you learn how to collect high 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.580
 polygonal model from the footage 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.010
 material and also make a retopology and 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.490
 prepare this model for use in 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.490
 game engine
