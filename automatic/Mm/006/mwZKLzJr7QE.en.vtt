00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
bearing in the center of this that had

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.170 
bearing in the center of this that had
failed<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.630> this<00:01:00.920> while<00:01:01.920> back<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.970> gave

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
failed on this while back and it gave

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.150 
failed on this while back and it gave
this<00:01:03.360> pulley<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.870> much<00:01:04.050> wobble<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.860> actually

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
this pulley so much wobble that actually

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.240 
this pulley so much wobble that actually
ruined<00:01:05.550> a<00:01:05.640> magnetic<00:01:06.410> coil<00:01:07.410> behind<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
ruined a magnetic coil behind there that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.969 
ruined a magnetic coil behind there that
activates<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.330> clutch<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.200> turn<00:01:10.410> on<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:10.740> AC

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
activates the clutch to turn on your AC

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.590 
activates the clutch to turn on your AC
so<00:01:11.760> we're<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.360> pulling

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
so we're going to do is really pulling

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.260 
so we're going to do is really pulling
this<00:01:12.810> off<00:01:13.050> with<00:01:13.620> a<00:01:13.650> gear<00:01:13.860> puller<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
this off with a gear puller and of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.550 
this off with a gear puller and of
course<00:01:15.479> we'll<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> belt<00:01:15.960> off<00:01:16.080> first<00:01:16.350> butt

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
course we'll get the belt off first butt

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.890 
course we'll get the belt off first butt
plugs<00:01:17.010> off<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> gear<00:01:17.550> puller<00:01:17.780> replacing<00:01:18.780> the

plugs off a gear puller replacing the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.290 
plugs off a gear puller replacing the
magnetic<00:01:19.500> item<00:01:20.010> behind<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:21.090> put<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
magnetic item behind it and then put it

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.520 
magnetic item behind it and then put it
all<00:01:21.360> back<00:01:21.450> together<00:01:21.540> hopefully<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.050> AC<00:01:22.170> work

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
all back together hopefully the AC work

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
all back together hopefully the AC work
first<00:01:22.950> step<00:01:23.190> for<00:01:23.340> removing<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> belt<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
first step for removing the belt is to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.290 
first step for removing the belt is to
loosen<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.520> bolt<00:01:26.520> that's<00:01:26.729> inside<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.210> this

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
loosen the bolt that's inside of this

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.600 
loosen the bolt that's inside of this
pulley<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.229> behind<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:29.400> my

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
pulley it's right behind here are my

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.400 
pulley it's right behind here are my
fingers<00:01:29.940> touching<00:01:30.150> put<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.080> biscuit<00:01:31.320> right

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
fingers touching put the biscuit right

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:41.410 
fingers touching put the biscuit right
behind<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.800> that<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.610> 14<00:01:33.090> mil<00:01:33.330> not<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.410> that

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.600 

the<00:01:41.960> only<00:01:42.200> illusion<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.010> couple<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.340> turns

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
the only illusion in a couple of turns

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.180 
the only illusion in a couple of turns
is<00:01:44.330> you're<00:01:44.510> taking<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.900> tension<00:01:45.140> off<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
is you're taking the tension off the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.180 
is you're taking the tension off the
adjuster<00:01:47.170> then<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.350> next<00:01:48.560> step<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.890> need<00:01:49.010> to

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
adjuster then the next step you need to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.440 
adjuster then the next step you need to
do<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:50.150> there<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:50.869> maybe<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.770> focus<00:01:52.100> II<00:01:52.450> go

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
do is there is maybe the focus II go

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.899 
do is there is maybe the focus II go
straight<00:01:53.720> down<00:01:53.900> here<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:55.159> end<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.490> socket

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
straight down here the end of the socket

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.550 
straight down here the end of the socket
is<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.630> top<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.050> actual<00:01:57.350> tension

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
is the top of the actual tension

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.310 
is the top of the actual tension
adjuster<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:59.300> what<00:01:59.420> I've<00:01:59.509> got<00:01:59.690> here<00:01:59.900> I've<00:02:00.170> got

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
adjuster so what I've got here I've got

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.520 
adjuster so what I've got here I've got
a<00:02:00.350> u-joint<00:02:00.560> with<00:02:01.340> 14<00:02:01.729> middle<00:02:01.970> cello<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.540> had<00:02:03.410> to

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
a u-joint with 14 middle cello I had to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.969 
a u-joint with 14 middle cello I had to
use<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:03.710> shower<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.100> couldn't<00:02:04.369> get<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.520> deeper<00:02:04.790> fit

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
use a shower I couldn't get a deeper fit

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.639 
use a shower I couldn't get a deeper fit
I'll<00:02:06.979> put<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:07.130> on<00:02:07.280> over<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.470> better

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
I'll put that on over that is you better

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.070 
I'll put that on over that is you better
look<00:02:09.800> at<00:02:09.890> where<00:02:10.009> you're<00:02:10.100> working<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.750> then

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
look at where you're working and then

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.960 
look at where you're working and then
I'm<00:02:12.170> gonna<00:02:12.290> loosen<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.610> that's<00:02:13.730> going

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
I'm gonna loosen that and that's going

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.350 
I'm gonna loosen that and that's going
to<00:02:14.180> release<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.110> tension<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.709> belt<00:02:16.360> okay

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
to release the tension on the belt okay

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.900 
to release the tension on the belt okay
so<00:02:17.420> now<00:02:17.720> with<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.020> loosen<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:19.489> allowed<00:02:19.730> me

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
so now with that loosen that allowed me

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.600 
so now with that loosen that allowed me
to<00:02:19.940> slide<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.450> belt<00:02:20.720> off<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:20.989> pulley<00:02:21.610> try

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
to slide this belt off the pulley try

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.680 
to slide this belt off the pulley try
and<00:02:22.730> tuck<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.000> up<00:02:23.090> out<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.300> my<00:02:23.330> way<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.570> little

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
and tuck it up out of my way a little

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.050 
and tuck it up out of my way a little
bit<00:02:23.840> somehow<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.380> allow<00:02:24.830> me<00:02:25.040> nextly<00:02:25.820> have<00:02:25.970> to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
bit somehow to allow me nextly have to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.229 
bit somehow to allow me nextly have to
do<00:02:26.150> here<00:02:26.330> pull<00:02:27.050> out<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.320> center<00:02:27.620> bolt<00:02:28.239> it's

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
do here pull out this center bolt it's

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.240 
do here pull out this center bolt it's
may<00:02:29.360> seem<00:02:29.570> like<00:02:29.720> overkill<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.709> since<00:02:31.040> this

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
may seem like overkill but since this

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.850 
may seem like overkill but since this
pulley<00:02:31.489> spins<00:02:31.970> I'm<00:02:32.720> picking<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.560> out<00:02:33.709> with

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
pulley spins I'm picking this out with

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.370 
pulley spins I'm picking this out with
an<00:02:33.950> impact

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.820 

let's<00:02:41.380> slide<00:02:41.560> they're<00:02:41.770> not<00:02:41.920> force<00:02:43.830> there's

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
let's slide they're not force there's

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.910 
let's slide they're not force there's
also<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.160> snap<00:02:45.430> ring<00:02:45.670> here<00:02:45.940> okay<00:02:46.840> do<00:02:47.530> my<00:02:47.680> snap

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
also a snap ring here okay do my snap

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:03.300 
also a snap ring here okay do my snap
ring<00:02:48.130> pliers<00:02:48.510> pop<00:02:49.510> out<00:02:49.780> there

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.830 

in<00:03:03.790> order<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.030> have<00:03:04.120> good<00:03:04.270> access<00:03:04.450> for<00:03:04.780> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
in order to have good access for the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.240 
in order to have good access for the
gear<00:03:05.020> puller<00:03:05.290> had<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.590> remove<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.980> rest<00:03:06.160> of

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
gear puller had to remove the rest of

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.660 
gear puller had to remove the rest of
this<00:03:06.310> plastic<00:03:06.580> shroud<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:08.110> wheel<00:03:08.260> well

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
this plastic shroud in the wheel well

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.460 
this plastic shroud in the wheel well
I've<00:03:09.670> just<00:03:09.880> got<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.180> push<00:03:10.750> down<00:03:10.960> on<00:03:11.020> my<00:03:11.170> way

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
I've just got to push down on my way

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.930 
I've just got to push down on my way
right<00:03:11.650> now<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.250> polar<00:03:12.460> gets<00:03:12.610> attached

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
right now so the polar gets attached

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.720 
right now so the polar gets attached
around<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.390> pulley<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:14.070> this<00:03:15.070> long<00:03:15.310> bolt<00:03:15.580> in

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
around the pulley and this long bolt in

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.580 
around the pulley and this long bolt in
the<00:03:15.790> center<00:03:16.150> actually<00:03:16.750> pushes<00:03:17.230> against<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
the center actually pushes against the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.710 
the center actually pushes against the
center<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.100> shaft<00:03:18.340> there<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.820> allows<00:03:19.690> us

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
center of that shaft there and allows us

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.180 
center of that shaft there and allows us
to<00:03:20.250> firmly<00:03:21.250> but<00:03:22.650> completely<00:03:23.650> pull<00:03:24.040> that

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
to firmly but completely pull that

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.950 
to firmly but completely pull that
pulley<00:03:24.490> straight<00:03:24.880> off<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.360> has<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.810> come

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
pulley straight off it has to come

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.460 
pulley straight off it has to come
straight<00:03:26.170> up

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
straight up

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.780 
straight up
trust<00:03:26.710> me<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:26.860> try<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.130> with<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.400> hammer<00:03:27.550> and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
trust me I try this with a hammer and

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.460 
trust me I try this with a hammer and
pry<00:03:27.940> bars<00:03:28.210> and<00:03:28.810> there's<00:03:28.960> no<00:03:29.080> way<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.290> get

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
pry bars and there's no way to get

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.620 
pry bars and there's no way to get
completely<00:03:29.950> straight<00:03:30.310> off<00:03:30.520> other<00:03:31.270> than<00:03:31.390> using

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
completely straight off other than using

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.420 
completely straight off other than using
your<00:03:31.750> pulley<00:03:31.990> like<00:03:32.050> this<00:03:32.320> so<00:03:32.890> what<00:03:33.040> happens<00:03:33.310> is

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
your pulley like this so what happens is

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.480 
your pulley like this so what happens is
I'm<00:03:33.550> gonna<00:03:33.700> touch<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.940> socket<00:03:34.270> to<00:03:35.170> here<00:03:35.490> turn

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
I'm gonna touch a socket to here turn

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.310 
I'm gonna touch a socket to here turn
clockwise<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:37.180> going<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.390> slowly<00:03:37.660> pull<00:03:38.170> it

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
clockwise it's going to slowly pull it

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:57.510 
clockwise it's going to slowly pull it
fully<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.260> Folies<00:03:56.560> off<00:03:56.770> and<00:03:57.040> now<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.370> can

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
fully so the Folies off and now you can

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.090 
fully so the Folies off and now you can
see<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:58.360> secondary<00:03:58.780> damage<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.770> that<00:03:59.800> bad

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
see the secondary damage that that bad

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.280 
see the secondary damage that that bad
bearing<00:04:00.400> caused<00:04:00.700> previously<00:04:01.390> that<00:04:02.080> bad

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
bearing caused previously that bad

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.920 
bearing caused previously that bad
bearing<00:04:02.560> did<00:04:02.830> is<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.550> actually<00:04:04.000> maybe<00:04:04.630> pulley

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
bearing did is it actually maybe pulley

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.080 
bearing did is it actually maybe pulley
wobble<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.290> much<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.550> chewed<00:04:06.820> up<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
wobble so much that it chewed up the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.070 
wobble so much that it chewed up the
outside<00:04:07.239> coating<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:07.959> this<00:04:08.800> outer<00:04:09.070> ring<00:04:09.400> of

this magnetic coil this magnetic coil is

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.840 
this magnetic coil this magnetic coil is
what<00:04:14.590> activates<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:16.510> AC<00:04:16.989> clutch<00:04:17.380> for<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.850> so

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
what activates the AC clutch for you so

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.490 
what activates the AC clutch for you so
I'm<00:04:18.910> replacing<00:04:19.090> this<00:04:19.450> today<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.229> I'll<00:04:20.470> be

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
I'm replacing this today and I'll be

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.740 
I'm replacing this today and I'll be
reinstalling<00:04:21.040> at<00:04:21.250> play<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.519> just<00:04:21.549> took<00:04:21.790> off<00:04:21.970> so

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
reinstalling at play I just took off so

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.909 
reinstalling at play I just took off so
here's<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:22.960> look<00:04:23.080> with<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.350> magnetic<00:04:23.710> coil

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
here's a look with the magnetic coil

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.570 
here's a look with the magnetic coil
remove<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.180> wire<00:04:26.250> they<00:04:27.250> used<00:04:27.490> to

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
remove and this is the wire they used to

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.690 
remove and this is the wire they used to
go<00:04:27.700> into<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.000> back<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.240> every<00:04:28.390> net<00:04:28.540> coil

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
go into the back of every net coil

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.969 
go into the back of every net coil
melted<00:04:30.700> right<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.660> plastic<00:04:32.620> part<00:04:32.770> smooth

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
melted right the plastic part smooth

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.210 
melted right the plastic part smooth
right<00:04:33.220> now

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
right now

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.070 
right now
here's<00:04:36.220> a<00:04:36.280> look<00:04:36.400> at<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.610> front

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.170 

look<00:04:40.680> at<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.890> front<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:43.260> back<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:43.530> this

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
look at the front and back of this

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.100 
look at the front and back of this
basically<00:04:45.180> what<00:04:45.330> happened<00:04:45.570> like<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.690> says<00:04:45.900> the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
basically what happened like I says the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.670 
basically what happened like I says the
bearing<00:04:46.500> in<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.680> middle<00:04:46.890> of<00:04:46.950> this<00:04:47.100> pulley<00:04:48.680> and

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
bearing in the middle of this pulley and

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.370 
bearing in the middle of this pulley and
failed<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.370> wobbled<00:04:51.240> enough<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:52.050> actually

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
failed and wobbled enough and actually

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.430 
failed and wobbled enough and actually
scrape<00:04:52.680> this<00:04:52.920> surface<00:04:53.280> bare<00:04:54.350> shorted<00:04:55.350> out

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
scrape this surface bare shorted out

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.490 
scrape this surface bare shorted out
this<00:04:55.700> coil<00:04:56.700> and<00:04:56.970> melted<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.900> wire<00:04:58.050> behind<00:04:58.230> it

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
this coil and melted the wire behind it

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.540 
this coil and melted the wire behind it
of<00:04:58.590> course<00:04:58.650> there's<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> lot<00:04:59.070> of<00:04:59.160> intense<00:04:59.400> heat

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
of course there's a lot of intense heat

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.010 
of course there's a lot of intense heat
that<00:04:59.700> happened<00:04:59.940> with<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.060> they<00:05:00.630> destroyed

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
that happened with that they destroyed

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.230 
that happened with that they destroyed
the<00:05:01.170> serpent<00:05:01.440> development<00:05:01.800> process<00:05:02.220> so<00:05:03.090> what

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
the serpent development process so what

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.420 
the serpent development process so what
I<00:05:03.270> did<00:05:03.420> originally<00:05:03.980> initially<00:05:04.980> before<00:05:05.100> this

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
I did originally initially before this

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.180 
I did originally initially before this
is<00:05:05.640> I<00:05:06.030> replace<00:05:06.360> just<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.900> bearing<00:05:07.260> in<00:05:07.410> the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
is I replace just the bearing in the

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.760 
is I replace just the bearing in the
center<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.490> this<00:05:08.580> pulley<00:05:10.400> B<00:05:11.400> one<00:05:11.700> zero<00:05:12.710> one<00:05:13.710> one

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
center of this pulley B one zero one one

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.650 
center of this pulley B one zero one one
zero<00:05:13.980> seven<00:05:16.400> for<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.490> bearing<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:18.110> is<00:05:19.110> by

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
zero seven for the bearing that is by

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.530 
zero seven for the bearing that is by
santech<00:05:21.660> si<00:05:22.110> n<00:05:22.290> te<00:05:22.590> CH<00:05:23.060> so<00:05:24.060> basically<00:05:24.330> by

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
santech si n te CH so basically by

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.200 
santech si n te CH so basically by
getting<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:24.840> bearings<00:05:25.140> right<00:05:25.230> originally

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
getting the bearings right originally

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.700 
getting the bearings right originally
then<00:05:27.210> I<00:05:27.330> let<00:05:27.450> me<00:05:27.510> get<00:05:27.630> back<00:05:27.720> on<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:27.990> road<00:05:28.140> but

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
then I let me get back on the road but

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.980 
then I let me get back on the road but
with<00:05:28.860> no<00:05:29.010> AC<00:05:29.180> because<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:30.360> coil<00:05:30.600> was<00:05:30.780> room

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
with no AC because that coil was room

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.980 
with no AC because that coil was room
this<00:05:31.950> is<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.250> new<00:05:32.370> coil<00:05:32.670> that<00:05:33.510> we<00:05:33.630> get<00:05:33.750> this<00:05:33.870> on

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
this is the new coil that we get this on

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.290 
this is the new coil that we get this on
eBay<00:05:34.290> pretty<00:05:34.560> pretty<00:05:35.220> reasonably<00:05:35.550> that's

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
eBay pretty pretty reasonably that's

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.960 
eBay pretty pretty reasonably that's
what<00:05:36.450> supposed<00:05:36.660> to<00:05:36.720> look<00:05:36.780> like<00:05:37.760> pulls<00:05:38.760> right

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
what supposed to look like pulls right

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.970 
what supposed to look like pulls right
in<00:05:39.180> I'm<00:05:40.140> gonna<00:05:40.290> have<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.560> use<00:05:40.650> some<00:05:40.800> type<00:05:40.950> of

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
in I'm gonna have to use some type of

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.160 
in I'm gonna have to use some type of
crimp<00:05:41.250> connector<00:05:41.580> for<00:05:41.790> this<00:05:41.880> wire<00:05:42.120> and<00:05:42.330> to<00:05:43.050> the

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
crimp connector for this wire and to the

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.990 
crimp connector for this wire and to the
old<00:05:43.320> wire<00:05:43.500> that's<00:05:43.740> melted<00:05:44.070> turn<00:05:44.700> that<00:05:44.820> back

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
old wire that's melted turn that back

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.350 
old wire that's melted turn that back
some<00:05:45.270> attach<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:45.990> in<00:05:46.140> and<00:05:47.030> once<00:05:48.030> every<00:05:48.270> is

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
some attach it in and once every is

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.070 
some attach it in and once every is
something<00:05:48.630> we<00:05:48.690> should<00:05:48.840> have<00:05:48.870> air

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
something we should have air

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.170 
something we should have air
conditioning<00:05:49.410> again<00:05:49.590> okay<00:05:50.010> so<00:05:50.220> with<00:05:51.000> the

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
conditioning again okay so with the

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.990 
conditioning again okay so with the
magnet<00:05:51.570> installed<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:53.000> connected

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
magnet installed and connected

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.020 
magnet installed and connected
electrically<00:05:54.630> up<00:05:54.810> here<00:05:55.340> what<00:05:56.340> I<00:05:56.400> did<00:05:56.550> here<00:05:56.820> is

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
electrically up here what I did here is

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.020 
electrically up here what I did here is
to<00:05:57.330> make<00:05:57.450> sure<00:05:57.570> this<00:05:57.750> wire<00:05:57.990> doesn't<00:05:58.290> get<00:05:58.650> off

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
to make sure this wire doesn't get off

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.330 
to make sure this wire doesn't get off
damaged<00:06:00.030> it'll<00:06:00.440> actually<00:06:01.440> zip-tied<00:06:02.070> it<00:06:02.190> out

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
damaged it'll actually zip-tied it out

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.680 
damaged it'll actually zip-tied it out
of<00:06:02.460> the<00:06:02.520> way<00:06:02.640> you<00:06:02.700> can<00:06:02.940> kind<00:06:03.240> of<00:06:03.330> make<00:06:03.450> it<00:06:03.510> out

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
of the way you can kind of make it out

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.519 
of the way you can kind of make it out
there

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:11.409 

I<00:06:08.529> started<00:06:09.529> by<00:06:09.649> pressing<00:06:09.949> this<00:06:10.759> on<00:06:10.939> by<00:06:11.119> hand

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
I started by pressing this on by hand

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.839 
I started by pressing this on by hand
nice<00:06:11.779> and<00:06:11.809> straight<00:06:12.229> then<00:06:13.159> I<00:06:13.189> use<00:06:13.369> a<00:06:13.399> small

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
nice and straight then I use a small

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:15.819 
nice and straight then I use a small
dead<00:06:14.119> blow<00:06:14.269> hammer<00:06:14.359> in<00:06:15.319> a<00:06:15.439> circular<00:06:15.649> fashion

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:15.829 
dead blow hammer in a circular fashion

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:17.739 
dead blow hammer in a circular fashion
at<00:06:16.159> that<00:06:16.309> taptaptaptaptaptap<00:06:16.729> all<00:06:17.629> the<00:06:17.689> way

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:17.749 
at that taptaptaptaptaptap all the way

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:19.809 
at that taptaptaptaptaptap all the way
around<00:06:17.989> until<00:06:18.919> I<00:06:19.099> had<00:06:19.219> this<00:06:19.339> lip<00:06:19.549> out<00:06:19.669> here

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:19.819 
around until I had this lip out here

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.169 
around until I had this lip out here
again<00:06:19.909> where<00:06:20.719> I<00:06:20.749> can<00:06:20.899> reinstall<00:06:21.139> my<00:06:21.409> snap<00:06:21.679> ring

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:22.179 
again where I can reinstall my snap ring

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:25.149 
again where I can reinstall my snap ring
okay<00:06:23.179> so<00:06:23.239> upon<00:06:23.599> first<00:06:23.899> start<00:06:24.229> up<00:06:24.379> the<00:06:24.889> clutch

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
okay so upon first start up the clutch

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.549 
okay so upon first start up the clutch
still<00:06:25.519> was<00:06:25.729> not<00:06:25.879> activated<00:06:26.349> okay

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:27.559 
still was not activated okay

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:28.989 
still was not activated okay
so<00:06:27.859> basically<00:06:28.099> what<00:06:28.249> happens<00:06:28.549> is<00:06:28.609> this<00:06:28.789> pulley

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:28.999 
so basically what happens is this pulley

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.639 
so basically what happens is this pulley
back<00:06:29.209> here<00:06:29.419> just<00:06:29.599> spins<00:06:29.929> all<00:06:30.109> the<00:06:30.199> time<00:06:30.439> and

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:30.649 
back here just spins all the time and

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:32.589 
back here just spins all the time and
then<00:06:31.159> when<00:06:31.369> that<00:06:31.489> magnetic<00:06:32.059> coil<00:06:32.269> behind

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
then when that magnetic coil behind

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:37.209 
then when that magnetic coil behind
activates<00:06:33.079> it<00:06:33.679> locks<00:06:34.459> this<00:06:35.149> tight<00:06:35.889> to<00:06:36.889> spin

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 
activates it locks this tight to spin

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:39.609 
activates it locks this tight to spin
the<00:06:37.939> compressor<00:06:38.419> to<00:06:38.449> create<00:06:38.839> pressure<00:06:39.079> for

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:39.619 
the compressor to create pressure for

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:40.329 
the compressor to create pressure for
the<00:06:39.679> air<00:06:39.739> conditioning

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:40.339 
the air conditioning

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:41.919 
the air conditioning
well<00:06:40.789> that<00:06:40.879> wasn't<00:06:40.999> happening<00:06:41.329> upon<00:06:41.599> first

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:41.929 
well that wasn't happening upon first

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:43.539 
well that wasn't happening upon first
start<00:06:42.109> of<00:06:42.199> effort<00:06:42.439> doing<00:06:42.589> this<00:06:42.649> repair<00:06:42.949> so<00:06:43.519> I

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:43.549 
start of effort doing this repair so I

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:45.369 
start of effort doing this repair so I
decided<00:06:43.969> it<00:06:44.089> because<00:06:44.539> of<00:06:44.689> the<00:06:44.779> way<00:06:44.899> this<00:06:45.169> got

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:45.379 
decided it because of the way this got

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:48.789 
decided it because of the way this got
destroyed<00:06:46.269> and<00:06:47.269> because<00:06:47.509> this<00:06:47.629> was<00:06:47.809> hot<00:06:48.019> this

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:48.799 
destroyed and because this was hot this

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:50.739 
destroyed and because this was hot this
was<00:06:49.069> up<00:06:49.279> electrified<00:06:50.179> when<00:06:50.299> I<00:06:50.329> got<00:06:50.449> destroyed

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:50.749 
was up electrified when I got destroyed

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:54.219 
was up electrified when I got destroyed
I<00:06:50.989> started<00:06:51.979> checking<00:06:52.099> fuses<00:06:52.779> so<00:06:53.779> what<00:06:53.929> I<00:06:53.959> found

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
I started checking fuses so what I found

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:59.469 
I started checking fuses so what I found
is<00:06:54.589> in<00:06:55.579> this<00:06:55.699> fuse<00:06:55.969> box<00:06:58.119> under<00:06:59.119> the<00:06:59.209> hood<00:06:59.359> yeah

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
is in this fuse box under the hood yeah

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:00.699 
is in this fuse box under the hood yeah
I<00:06:59.509> thought<00:06:59.689> was<00:06:59.839> power<00:07:00.049> off

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:00.709 
I thought was power off

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:03.369 
I thought was power off
tucked<00:07:01.339> in<00:07:01.489> there<00:07:01.639> and<00:07:02.389> this<00:07:02.599> slides<00:07:02.899> out<00:07:03.139> I

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:03.379 
tucked in there and this slides out I

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:08.109 
tucked in there and this slides out I
found<00:07:04.359> this<00:07:05.359> red<00:07:05.779> here<00:07:06.229> was<00:07:06.829> a<00:07:06.859> 10<00:07:07.099> 10<00:07:07.699> amp

00:07:08.109 --> 00:07:08.119
