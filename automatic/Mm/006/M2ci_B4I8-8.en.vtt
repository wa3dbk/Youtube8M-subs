something about how hydrangea flowers
change<00:00:33.629> color<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> has<00:00:34.800> something<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> do

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
change color and it has something to do

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.479

with<00:00:35.460> aluminum<00:00:36.329> aluminum<00:00:36.780> foil<00:00:37.350> well<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
with aluminum aluminum foil well it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
with aluminum aluminum foil well it
doesn't<00:00:38.640> mean<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.270> bury<00:00:39.539> aluminum

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
doesn't mean that you can bury aluminum

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
foil around your hydrangeas it will

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.520 
foil around your hydrangeas it will
change<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> color<00:00:42.150> not<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.510> all<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.320> does

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
change the color not at all but it does

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
change the color not at all but it does
have<00:00:43.770> something<00:00:44.130> to<00:00:44.220> do<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.489> pH<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.780> know

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840

what<00:00:45.960> pH<00:00:46.230> s<00:00:46.410> pH<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.040> measurement<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.790> how

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
what pH s pH is a measurement of how

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.540 
what pH s pH is a measurement of how
acid<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:48.690> maybe<00:00:48.899> how<00:00:49.079> alkaline<00:00:49.680> soil<00:00:50.040> is<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
acid or maybe how alkaline soil is and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.060 
acid or maybe how alkaline soil is and
pH<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.300> measured<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.810> a<00:00:52.170> number<00:00:52.500> line<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.920> in

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
pH is measured on a number line so in

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.910 
pH is measured on a number line so in
the<00:00:53.190> middle<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.880> 7<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.540> neutral<00:00:54.989> anything

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the middle is 7 that's neutral anything

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.270 
the middle is 7 that's neutral anything
from<00:00:56.100> 7<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.700> to<00:00:56.910> zero<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.540> acid<00:00:58.530> anything

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
from 7 down to zero is acid anything

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.780 
from 7 down to zero is acid anything
from<00:00:59.460> 7<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.450> 14<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.230> alkaline<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.700> you

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
from 7 on up to 14 is alkaline so if you

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.060 
from 7 on up to 14 is alkaline so if you
have<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> pH<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> let's<00:01:03.960> say<00:01:04.140> 6<00:01:04.589> that's<00:01:04.829> just

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
have a pH of let's say 6 that's just

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030 
have a pH of let's say 6 that's just
below<00:01:05.309> 7<00:01:05.700> makes<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.030> slightly<00:01:06.270> acid<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.990> pH<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.530> 8

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
below 7 makes it slightly acid a pH of 8

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.249 
below 7 makes it slightly acid a pH of 8
is<00:01:08.430> slightly<00:01:08.850> alkaline<00:01:09.420> figure<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.140> out

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
is slightly alkaline figure that out

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.450 
is slightly alkaline figure that out
okay<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.619> far<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.130> good

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
okay so far so good

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.209 
okay so far so good
well<00:01:12.119> hydrangeas<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.499> are<00:01:13.649> sensitive<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
well hydrangeas really are sensitive to

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.129 
well hydrangeas really are sensitive to
the<00:01:14.429> amount<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.789> aluminum<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.719> they<00:01:15.959> can

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.139 
the amount of aluminum that they can

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:18.289 
the amount of aluminum that they can
suck<00:01:16.469> up<00:01:16.499> out<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.039> soil<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.909> amount

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
suck up out of the soil and the amount

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.389 
suck up out of the soil and the amount
of<00:01:18.450> aluminum<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.350> suck<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.590> depends<00:01:20.249> on

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
of aluminum they can suck up depends on

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.349 
of aluminum they can suck up depends on
soil<00:01:21.149> pH<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.649> order<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.920> make<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.369> pink

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359

the amount of aluminum the plant can
suck<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.359> and<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.749> just<00:01:30.929> add<00:01:31.109> some<00:01:31.409> aluminum

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
suck up and we just add some aluminum

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.010 
suck up and we just add some aluminum
sulfate<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.209> aluminum<00:01:33.420> sulfate

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.880 
a hydrangea not able to absorb aluminum
and<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.570> by<00:02:39.690> adding<00:02:39.900> lime<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> soil<00:02:40.770> and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
right for a hydrangea plant again put a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.820 
right for a hydrangea plant again put a

during the year and that teller red or

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.510 
during the year and that teller red or
that<00:03:24.600> Cardinal<00:03:24.960> red<00:03:25.230> will<00:03:25.410> go<00:03:25.440> from<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:25.920> red<00:03:26.190> all
