00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.800
 Welcome to prison 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.000
 Welcome to Princess Prison 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.140
 My name is Aisha. 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.420
 I lost control six months ago, and then I sealed my own home, the Allendale Kingdom. 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.320
 And now, I am here. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.420
 Smile! 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.440
 and many more! I am not ready for my crown yet! 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.380
 Take care of her! 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.400
 No one takes a photo like Gaston 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.120
 So... what does the prison look like? 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.100
 Ohh...just like in the castle, every time you dream.. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.520
 Terrible and damn place 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.660
 This 'is not a fairy tale 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.060
 Who is with her? And she refuses to let me eat. 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.480
 No one can compare what she did to her mother. 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.560
 I want it all! 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.800
 I want to find a bear that is smarter than other bears! 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.540
 Then absorb the power of that bear! 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.520
 That won't change... 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.380
 Ok.... 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.740
 I think I already have a prison wife. 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.360
 what!? 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.100
 So, do we have a snowman together? 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.980
 not quite... 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.180
 Who is waiting outside? 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.840
 My Prince Charming gave me a great gift, the best high-end wedding! 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.220
 In fact... I don't believe there is a set of Prince Charming... 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.320
 I don't believe either 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.140
 After 'Happiness from here' 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.400
 Oh! I know that I am not reading my books, scorpion! 

00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:08.593
 Ok! 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.860
 Since I came here, I have been bullied all the time. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.800
 Then Iâ€™ve been called Adele Dazeem 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.680
 So can you please let me relax? 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.840
 Oops 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.980
 Every princess must pay her tax 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.880
 Aisha! Hey, unlike the princesses, he is the queen! 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.120
 I am no different from other people here. 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.100
 I have sinned 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.200
 I will not be wrong with anyone here, but because of myself. 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.820
 [Frozen] Women's Prison 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.500
 Let it... 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.840
 To shut up
