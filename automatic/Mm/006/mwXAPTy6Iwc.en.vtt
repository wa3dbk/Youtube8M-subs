00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.770
 hello all greetings from the offices 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.750
 of lg in madrid I'm here because as 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.760
 you know all three of the video games already 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.170
 are a reality every day are more 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.690
 titles that are announced in addition to the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.250
 experience and especially the immersion has 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.380
 greatly improved in recent years 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.119
 that's why we know that to get the 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.579
 maximum performance we need a good 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.919
 tele so I'm going to present the range of 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.939
 LG TVs for this season 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.939
 applied to gaming 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.600
 here I have the fixed glasses are like 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.130
 of the movies are light they are comfortable and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.240
 besides, there is no need to recharge 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.070
 imagine that you are there in the shooting 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.990
 against final boss and you run out of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.060
 batteries but let's also like they are not 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.210
 like the conventional ones you save the 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.680
 flicker and dizziness and good and what 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.820
 it's more spectacular is that you can 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.050
 play from any angle not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.660
 you just have to face no 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.670
 for playing from the side even 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.200
 lying on the magic you on the couch when 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.530
 there are some games to call of duty online 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.720
 and in 3-d with your colleagues 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.820
 and what happens if your favorite game does not have 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.310
 3-d mode do not worry because with 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.780
 the 3d cinema is king and lg you can 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.520
 customize it you can convert what 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.900
 you can three-dimensional hoist it thanks to 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.229
 its converter that is the past all the 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.520
 market and that allows up to 95% of the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.470
 capacity 3-d 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.690
 imagine playing super mario bros 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.850
 classic in three dimensions and does not pass 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.530
 nothing because thanks to your regulator 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.610
 intensity you can adjust it so that the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.650
 experience be as you like it 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.240
 and I do not want to forget about the dual play a 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.860
 of the most advanced features of 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.630
 the 3d signature is king and lg 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.720
 what do you like to play in a local cooperative? 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.670
 of course who does not but with this 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.560
 forget about the split screen forget about the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.270
 split screen and welcome to 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.490
 the full screen and how is it possible 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.410
 very easy because for each pair of 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.210
 glasses has a different polarization 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.800
 so each screen only 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.960
 we see the part of the images that we 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.850
 corresponds to take full advantage of 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.460
 your videogames with this saying that is the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.440
 that calls 3d is martÃ­n and the axis is not 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.440
 a television is the television
