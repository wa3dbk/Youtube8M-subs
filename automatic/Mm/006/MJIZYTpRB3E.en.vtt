this isn't the thing that's going to

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.090 
this isn't the thing that's going to
break<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.810> game<00:05:37.990> so<00:05:38.530> if<00:05:38.590> you<00:05:38.680> see<00:05:38.830> that<00:05:38.950> guy

it's<00:06:23.939> also<00:06:24.180> a<00:06:24.300> new<00:06:24.389> concept<00:06:24.719> that<00:06:25.020> you<00:06:25.229> choose

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
it's also a new concept that you choose

per<00:06:25.740> class<00:06:26.059> copy<00:06:27.059> cat<00:06:27.300> is<00:06:27.449> a<00:06:27.539> good<00:06:27.659> example<00:06:27.719> so

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:28.649 
per class copy cat is a good example so

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:31.040 
per class copy cat is a good example so
basically<00:06:28.949> once<00:06:29.639> you've<00:06:29.819> died<00:06:30.059> four<00:06:30.749> times<00:06:30.930> in

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
unlikely so that's that's a little bit

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.399 
unlikely so that's that's a little bit
of<00:06:51.919> creative<00:06:52.919> class<00:06:53.749> and<00:06:54.749> you<00:06:54.839> can<00:06:54.990> name<00:06:55.169> them
