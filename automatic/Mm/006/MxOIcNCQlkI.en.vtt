many I take in order for him to win he

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.649 
many I take in order for him to win he
will<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:32.689> to<00:01:33.689> knock<00:01:33.840> him<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:38.659> absolutely

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
he does have to keep Billy I just think

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
he does have to keep Billy I just think
it's<00:01:41.189> Manny's<00:01:41.490> turn<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.570> reason<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.900> think

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it's Manny's turn and the reason I think

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.320 
it's Manny's turn and the reason I think
that<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.850> times<00:01:45.119> before

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
that is because of all the times before

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.070 
that is because of all the times before
the<00:01:46.790> difficulties<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> Mayweather<00:01:48.780> made

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080

for many about fighting even five years
ago<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.890> think<00:01:53.280> many<00:01:53.450> wants<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> prove<00:01:54.750> once

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that he would have done it five years

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.390
