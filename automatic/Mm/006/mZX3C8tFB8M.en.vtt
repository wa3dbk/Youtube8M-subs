00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.480
 journey is the highlight of the moment 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.250
 in the playstation 3 online store a 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.840
 game very different from everything you have 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.330
 seen so far loaded with 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.070
 sensitivity and know-how echad a 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.480
 look because we do not have the luck of 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.480
 see games like this one very often 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.540
 nothing is said about the story 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.280
 of this game the only possibility that 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.710
 we have in the main menu is the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.540
 start a trip and once inside no 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.970
 we will read or listen to one 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.710
 word will control a personjillo 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.780
 dressed in a red tunic and a 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.489
 scarf and just following your 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.980
 instinct you will be able to reach the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.220
 end of that trip 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.220
 and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.090
 There is a reason why that character 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 face that journey but start 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 and it ends up as a mystery so your 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.280
 interpretation of everything you see will be 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.280
 how much do you have 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.070
 the character controls are very 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.650
 basic 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.120
 you can move and jump there is a third 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.830
 button that serves to activate the 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.650
 elements that recharge your scarf 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.500
 have the shape of a letter carpet or 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.540
 kite and there's nothing else the jump 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.010
 maintained becomes a flight that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.200
 it stays until the scarf is 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.050
 is without powers and that is the basis of 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.460
 all the puzzles that you are going to find 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.810
 your only mission in this game is 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.390
 get to the point that opens the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.460
 doors to the next area usually 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.170
 those points are very high or there is 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.570
 some gap in the bridge that leads up 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.940
 them the jump and that activation of 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.390
 elements is all you need to 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.390
 finish the trip 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.659
 you have already noticed that the section 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.489
 artistic of this game is delicious of 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.280
 the most attractive thing that playstation3 has 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.140
 in its catalog is impressive as 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.540
 just showing mountains dunes and 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.269
 ruinous constructions journey 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.129
 catch as very few have done 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.769
 playing with amazing textures and the 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.290
 best lighting of the moment the band 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.060
 sound on the other hand is a marvel 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.040
 main theme is the most beautiful thing that 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.079
 I 've never heard in a video game and 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.280
 any effect or supporting melody is 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.280
 simply unbeatable 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.739
 unfortunately we have to say that they are 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.110
 only two hours of travel what leaves 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.390
 want more, although in the same way 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.220
 notice of its duration I tell you that they are the 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.829
 euros better spent for me in a lot 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.200
 time to play it from start to finish 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.000
 he left as stupefied as not being at all 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.340
 aware of everything he had seen in 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.140
 those two hours and that feeling does not 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.140
 I remember having never had it before 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.800
 from time to time your trip will 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.140
 will cross with that of a partner who 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.640
 is playing with internet connection not 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.650
 there is some communication between both 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.540
 more than the little sound that the button emits 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.220
 of activation but it's always 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.620
 interesting to know that you are not alone in 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.000
 the way to the end of the game you will see the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.510
 list of users who have 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.510
 accompanied 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.030
 without more I will tell you that journey is a work 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.640
 of art the concept of design the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.390
 technical section the music all in this 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.390
 game is unforgettable
