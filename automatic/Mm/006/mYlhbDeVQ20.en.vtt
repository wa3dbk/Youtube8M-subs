I'm cutting the length of my longer L

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.259 
I'm cutting the length of my longer L
the<00:00:25.320> full<00:00:25.560> L<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.039> going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.430> about<00:00:26.609> 13<00:00:27.060> feet

lower<00:00:35.399> leg<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:36.210> top<00:00:36.660> making<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.380> marks<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.010> I'm

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
lower leg on top making my marks and I'm

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:54.380 
lower leg on top making my marks and I'm
going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> 45<00:00:38.879> degree<00:00:39.210> angle<00:00:39.660> cut

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.690 

I'm<00:00:55.390> cutting<00:00:55.870> through<00:00:56.140> both<00:00:56.440> cheats<00:00:56.860> so<00:00:57.340> I<00:00:57.370> can

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
I'm cutting through both cheats so I can

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.460 
I'm cutting through both cheats so I can
guarantee<00:00:57.970> that<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.690> angle<00:00:58.990> is<00:00:59.020> going<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.320> fit

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
guarantee that the angle is going to fit

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.090 
guarantee that the angle is going to fit
together<00:00:59.590> really<00:01:00.190> nice<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.580> tight<00:01:01.920> sweep<00:01:02.920> all

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
together really nice and tight sweep all

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.490 
together really nice and tight sweep all
my<00:01:03.250> sawdust<00:01:03.670> off<00:01:03.880> and<00:01:04.210> now<00:01:04.960> I'm<00:01:05.080> going<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.320> pull

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
my sawdust off and now I'm going to pull

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.740 
my sawdust off and now I'm going to pull
out<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.740> biscuit<00:01:06.100> joiner<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:06.640> usually<00:01:07.570> put

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
out the biscuit joiner I usually put

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.230 
out the biscuit joiner I usually put
about<00:01:07.780> four<00:01:08.440> large<00:01:09.040> size<00:01:09.370> biscuit<00:01:09.850> joints

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
about four large size biscuit joints

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.550 
about four large size biscuit joints
through<00:01:10.840> any<00:01:11.110> kind<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.620> 45<00:01:12.190> degree<00:01:12.460> angle<00:01:12.760> cut

through any kind of 45 degree angle cut

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.200 
through any kind of 45 degree angle cut
the<00:01:14.560> only<00:01:14.830> goal<00:01:15.010> is<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.220> make<00:01:15.490> sure<00:01:15.520> this<00:01:15.850> joint

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
the only goal is to make sure this joint

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.270 
the only goal is to make sure this joint
is<00:01:16.360> strong<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.650> doesn't<00:01:17.680> break<00:01:17.950> during

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
is strong so it doesn't break during

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.830 
is strong so it doesn't break during
transportation<00:01:19.180> or<00:01:19.360> while<00:01:19.510> you're<00:01:19.690> moving

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
transportation or while you're moving

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.170 
transportation or while you're moving
and<00:01:20.080> fabricating<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.770> piece

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:38.670 

you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.590 

right<00:01:39.680> here<00:01:39.980> I'm<00:01:40.130> checking<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:41.000> size<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.450> my

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
right here I'm checking the size of my

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.080 
right here I'm checking the size of my
template<00:01:42.080> comparing<00:01:43.010> it<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.490> sink<00:01:43.730> itself

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
template comparing it to the sink itself

template comparing it to the sink itself
even<00:01:45.020> though<00:01:45.110> they<00:01:45.230> came<00:01:45.410> together<00:01:45.620> they

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
even though they came together they

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.130 
even though they came together they
often<00:01:46.580> don't<00:01:46.730> fit<00:01:47.060> just<00:01:47.300> as<00:01:47.480> perfectly

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
often don't fit just as perfectly

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.350 
often don't fit just as perfectly
without<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.650> little<00:01:48.860> bit<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.160> trimming<00:01:49.370> this<00:01:50.210> is

one pass now double check that what you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.490 
one pass now double check that what you
cut<00:02:23.010> off<00:02:23.160> still<00:02:23.550> looks<00:02:23.760> good<00:02:24.020> make<00:02:25.020> your<00:02:25.200> marks

picture and make a very smooth cut it's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.320 
picture and make a very smooth cut it's
a<00:02:37.380> lot<00:02:37.560> better<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:38.070> spend<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.700> little<00:02:38.850> longer

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
a lot better to spend a little longer

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.270 
a lot better to spend a little longer
cutting<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.900> less<00:02:40.260> time<00:02:40.590> trying<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.890> fix<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
cutting and less time trying to fix the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.980 
cutting and less time trying to fix the
hole<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.550> cut<00:02:41.760> off<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.210> take<00:02:42.420> your<00:02:42.540> time<00:02:42.720> here

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
hole you cut off so take your time here

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.680 
hole you cut off so take your time here
and<00:02:43.170> don't<00:02:43.770> rush<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.220> process<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:48.450> should

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
and don't rush this process you should

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.630 
and don't rush this process you should
spend<00:02:48.960> most<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.560> your<00:02:49.620> time<00:02:49.740> on<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.190> corners

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
spend most of your time on the corners

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.030 
spend most of your time on the corners
generally<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.780> corners<00:02:52.200> take<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.590> longest

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
generally the corners take the longest

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.890 
generally the corners take the longest
time<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:54.030> over<00:02:54.540> turn<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
time so that you don't over turn the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.540 
time so that you don't over turn the
corner<00:02:55.260> which<00:02:55.590> makes<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.040> corner<00:02:56.370> actually

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
corner which makes the corner actually

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.670 
corner which makes the corner actually
bow<00:02:56.970> out<00:02:57.210> and<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.600> looks<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:58.200> bad<00:02:58.350> on<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
bow out and it looks really bad on the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.330 
bow out and it looks really bad on the
finished<00:02:59.040> under<00:02:59.280> metal<00:02:59.520> sink<00:02:59.730> I<00:03:01.310> set<00:03:02.310> a

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
finished under metal sink I set a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.610 
finished under metal sink I set a
support<00:03:02.850> underneath<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.720> cutout<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.440> that

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
support underneath the cutout so that

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.410 
support underneath the cutout so that
when<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:04.860> get<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.370> very<00:03:05.400> end<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.090> doesn't

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
when I get to the very end it doesn't

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.270 
when I get to the very end it doesn't
rip<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.870> break<00:03:07.080> off<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.500> last<00:03:07.710> quarter<00:03:08.040> inch

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
rip and break off the last quarter inch

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.640 
rip and break off the last quarter inch
so<00:03:08.550> it's<00:03:08.730> supported<00:03:09.240> underneath<00:03:12.410> now<00:03:13.410> we'll

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
so it's supported underneath now we'll

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.290 
so it's supported underneath now we'll
be<00:03:13.770> adding<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.160> piece<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.520> trim<00:03:14.730> that's<00:03:15.000> an<00:03:15.150> inch

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
be adding a piece of trim that's an inch

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.820 
be adding a piece of trim that's an inch

three-quarter inch MDF to make a taller
false<00:03:19.980> edge<00:03:20.340> it's<00:03:21.210> just<00:03:21.570> square<00:03:21.870> trim<00:03:22.110> it's

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
false edge it's just square trim it's

dollar a linear foot and it really adds
a<00:03:28.260> nice<00:03:28.410> look<00:03:28.770> makes<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.160> countertop<00:03:29.580> look

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
a nice look makes a countertop look

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.210 
a nice look makes a countertop look
thicker<00:03:30.120> when<00:03:30.420> it's<00:03:30.600> finished<00:03:30.990> very<00:03:31.680> easy<00:03:32.010> to

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
thicker when it's finished very easy to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.130 
thicker when it's finished very easy to
do<00:03:32.400> right<00:03:32.580> here<00:03:32.940> I'm<00:03:33.030> shooting<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.660> with<00:03:34.020> an

18 gauge nailer

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.180 
18 gauge nailer
now<00:03:37.600> as<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:37.930> finish<00:03:38.230> up<00:03:38.470> I'm<00:03:38.740> going<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:38.980> take<00:03:39.130> a

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
now as I finish up I'm going to take a

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.460 
now as I finish up I'm going to take a
sander<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.000> I'm<00:03:40.180> going<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.360> sand<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.930> top<00:03:40.960> and

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
sander and I'm going to sand the top and

sander and I'm going to sand the top and
all<00:03:41.740> along<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.220> edge<00:03:42.460> so<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:42.880> doesn't<00:03:43.180> leave

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
all along that edge so it doesn't leave

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.610 
all along that edge so it doesn't leave
a<00:03:43.330> lip<00:03:43.690> sticking<00:03:44.110> up

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
a lip sticking up

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.100 
a lip sticking up
I<00:03:44.650> want<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.340> very<00:03:45.760> smooth<00:03:46.150> transition<00:03:46.390> so

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
I want a very smooth transition so

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.170 
I want a very smooth transition so
usually<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.560> fill<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:48.010> with<00:03:48.160> either<00:03:48.310> spackling

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
usually I fill it with either spackling

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.270 
usually I fill it with either spackling
or<00:03:49.450> body<00:03:49.690> filler<00:03:50.020> just<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.740> make<00:03:50.920> sure<00:03:50.950> that

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
or body filler just to make sure that

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.190

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
the finish counter top edge now use a

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.400 
the finish counter top edge now use a
brush<00:03:57.490> to<00:03:58.090> apply<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.450> liquid<00:03:58.750> base<00:03:59.110> color

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
countertop is going to be copper so

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.120 
countertop is going to be copper so
we're<00:04:04.090> using<00:04:04.270> a<00:04:04.510> copper<00:04:04.900> base<00:04:05.080> coat<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.800> paint

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.350 
we're using a copper base coat to paint
our<00:04:06.490> front<00:04:06.880> edge

our front edge
we're<00:04:07.959> not<00:04:08.080> mixing<00:04:08.500> this<00:04:08.620> with<00:04:08.680> epoxy<00:04:09.100> we're

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
we're not mixing this with epoxy we're

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.880 
we're not mixing this with epoxy we're
just<00:04:10.120> using<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.540> right<00:04:10.720> out<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.080> can<00:04:11.320> it

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890
