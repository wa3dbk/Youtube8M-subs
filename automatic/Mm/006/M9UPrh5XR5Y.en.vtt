00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
lot then what I will do when I do it I

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.420 
lot then what I will do when I do it I
um<00:02:35.269> I<00:02:35.629> mean<00:02:35.900> when<00:02:36.079> it<00:02:36.200> starts<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:36.980> do<00:02:37.159> that<00:02:37.400> I

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
um I mean when it starts to do that I

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.300 
um I mean when it starts to do that I
will<00:02:37.879> condition<00:02:38.870> co<00:02:39.560> wash<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.890> hair<00:02:40.069> wherever

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
so once I pull watch it is fine it's

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.839 
so once I pull watch it is fine it's
just<00:02:43.760> fine<00:02:44.060> after<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.540> um<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:46.340> that's<00:02:46.489> one<00:02:46.760> of
