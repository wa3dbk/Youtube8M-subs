00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.800
 Maybe it was coincidence to meet with 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.290
 what is a reuse method a 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.210
 water reuse method is the 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.550
 action that is used to achieve 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.470
 use the water that is wasted from 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.890
 various media such as rain or 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.890
 the washing-machine 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.030
 one by decanting point east 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.550
 method is given when the union of two 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.650
 mixtures are homogeneous for example water 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.050
 and chlorine that when mixed you can not see the 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.330
 difference and by an apparatus 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.400
 decanting we will separate the water from 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.320
 chlorine for use in various media 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.030
 two 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.129
 by distillation point this method 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.350
 It is used when the mixture is 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.050
 heterogeneous for example water and land 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.360
 that when mixing is the difference 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.370
 you will need a distillation apparatus 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.829
 to separate the mixture from another's 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.869
 filtration to clean the water for 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.869
 can be used in various activities 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.380
 and 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.520
 and 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.500
 and reusing water serves or helps us 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.930
 Do not waste the water of various 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.970
 means no longer use clean water 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.040
 to perform activities that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.300
 can do with water that has already 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.300
 been used 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 if it benefits us a lot because in a 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.940
 future we will not suffer from water shortage 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.280
 and we also contribute to protect not 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.820
 deteriorate the environment 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.820
 Y 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.760
 the most common substances for 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.460
 reusing water are chlorine and bromine 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.890
 yobo and later there are devices 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.140
 of singers that allow you to mix the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.640
 water with these substances to be able 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.640
 use them on a daily basis 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.590
 Water can be obtained from a washing machine 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.190
 from the bathroom rain point dot 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.190
 etc 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.090
 we use this water to water the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.580
 garden wash the patio bathe a 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.440
 mop pet and maybe to wash 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.670
 a car depending also 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.670
 purify the water 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.080
 the whole team we conclude that 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.270
 reuse water helps improve 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.310
 environment and that only 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.860
 he needs intelligence to be able 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.210
 build our own apparatus for the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.210
 water reuse 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.050
 the one that we 10 teacher who complains
