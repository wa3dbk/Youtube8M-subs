 shed 7 of salzburg 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.320
 the machine is driven by a madman there's no 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.619
 of prime merville words that he is crazy he 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.500
 is helicopter pilot pib this is a 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.629
 acrobatic presentation of helicopters

 105 helicopters with a 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.920
 of helicopters of a rigid- headed rotor 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.589
 now articulated that allows precisely 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.080
 the flight back or from which allows 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.210
 acrobatic maneuvers that no other 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.549
 helicopters can only perform here 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.010
 so with the compliments of the flashballs 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:01.119
 here is renner city ​​she and her p ô 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:06.010
 without grocery bag this kiss-in teepee 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:07.990
 artistic one titillates the daily this 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.020
 guy is an autodidact 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:17.200
 I gun you five or six tables 26 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:22.450
 which has grown very special 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.909
 progressive via flash balls one holds 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.770
 too much has been selected the maneuvers of 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.710
 amsterdam worries may not be fun to be 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.020
 active said normal to 29.9 look the game 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.100
 freak run have thibout is our 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.140
 pebble sheet ping pong relationships in 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.060
 the 60s so the helicopters 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.979
 were flying in a certain way and then 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.780
 paul kof has arrived walk of fame 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.289
 German which actually results from the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.979
 merger of three companies volkov serves 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:57.580
 also paul these blues is also 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.979
 very serious please and so the engineers 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.130
 Germans have imagined to create a rotor 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.319
 rotor that is rigid and inviting in 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.330
 the balls do not articulate because the 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.130
 articulate the hoists totally 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.650
 impossible to perform this kind of 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.180
 maneuvers while a rigid rotor and 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.489
 is going to finally make fun of knowing 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.410
 if he is flying up or down 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.570
 it may be a bit technical but in 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.060
 anyway it's a solution that has been 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.829
 restraint is used by following a 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.010

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.410
 changed so much a few months ago to 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.690
 be called airbus helicopters so 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.769
 this machine that comes from the past 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.459
 since the bagless bo is a craft of which 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.459

 a total of nearly 1500 these machines 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.200
 were built and in the 1500 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.000
