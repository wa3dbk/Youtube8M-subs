you've<00:02:32.440> been<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.770> these<00:02:32.890> get<00:02:33.760> it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
you've been one of these get it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.430 
you've been one of these get it
call<00:02:34.390> them<00:02:34.480> up<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:34.690> ask<00:02:34.930> them<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.170> make<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
call them up and ask them to make you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.930 
call them up and ask them to make you
one<00:02:35.650> because<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:36.070> think<00:02:36.490> it's<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.670> great

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
one because I think it's a great

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.500 
one because I think it's a great
solution<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:38.670> being<00:02:39.670> able<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:39.970> play<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
solution to being able to play the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.060 
solution to being able to play the
tongue<00:02:40.750> drum<00:02:40.989> with<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.350> foods<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.890> other

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
tongue drum with the foods and other

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.610 
tongue drum with the foods and other
instruments<00:02:42.700> because<00:02:42.970> they<00:02:43.840> made<00:02:44.080> all<00:02:44.350> sorts

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
instruments because they made all sorts

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.110 
instruments because they made all sorts
of<00:02:44.800> different<00:02:45.040> configurations<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:46.030> they're

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
of different configurations and they're

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.760 
of different configurations and they're
all<00:02:46.270> wonderful<00:02:46.750> sounding<00:02:47.200> but<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.350> lot<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.590> them

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
all wonderful sounding but a lot of them

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.699 
all wonderful sounding but a lot of them
you<00:02:47.860> can't<00:02:48.130> really<00:02:48.430> quite<00:02:49.030> play<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.470> know<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
you can't really quite play you know the

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.160 
you can't really quite play you know the
instruments<00:02:51.280> together<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:52.270> just<00:02:52.300> there's

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
instruments together you just there's

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.560 
instruments together you just there's
one<00:02:53.590> note<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.040> just<00:02:54.160> really<00:02:54.489> sounds<00:02:55.090> kind<00:02:55.540> of

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
one note that just really sounds kind of

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.600 
one note that just really sounds kind of
strange<00:02:55.750> not<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.950> might<00:02:57.130> not<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.430> bad

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
strange not that that might not be a bad

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.130 
strange not that that might not be a bad
thing<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.270> can<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:58.600> an<00:02:58.780> exotic

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
thing and you can have an exotic

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.830 
thing and you can have an exotic
sounding<00:02:59.980> scale<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:01.330> if<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.510> want<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.720> make

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
sounding scale but if you want to make

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.160 
sounding scale but if you want to make
it<00:03:01.959> really<00:03:02.470> easy<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:03.300> that's<00:03:04.300> safety<00:03:04.630> you

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
it really easy and that's safety you

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.320 
it really easy and that's safety you
know<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.440> safety<00:03:05.709> net<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.280> like<00:03:06.520> clearing<00:03:07.209> out

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
know the safety net of like clearing out

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.949 
know the safety net of like clearing out
all<00:03:07.480> those<00:03:07.600> notes<00:03:08.320> that<00:03:08.530> may<00:03:08.770> not<00:03:08.950> work<00:03:09.959> then

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
all those notes that may not work then

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.979 
all those notes that may not work then
then<00:03:11.380> this<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.680> way<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.890> go<00:03:12.070> so<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.840> not

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
then this is a way to go so it's not

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.550 
then this is a way to go so it's not
gonna<00:03:14.170> sound<00:03:14.380> as<00:03:14.620> as<00:03:14.830> exotic<00:03:15.340> as<00:03:15.700> some<00:03:15.970> other

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
gonna sound as as exotic as some other

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.170 
gonna sound as as exotic as some other
configurations<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:18.040> it'll<00:03:18.610> it's<00:03:18.940> going<00:03:19.120> to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
configurations but it'll it's going to

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.479 
configurations but it'll it's going to
be<00:03:19.360> able<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.660> be<00:03:19.900> integrated<00:03:20.560> easier<00:03:20.890> more

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
be able to be integrated easier more

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:30.030 
be able to be integrated easier more
easily<00:03:27.510> yeah<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.780> minor<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.470> heavier<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:29.950> a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
easily yeah a minor the heavier is a
