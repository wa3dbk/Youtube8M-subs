established earlier while that's wet you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.620 
established earlier while that's wet you
can<00:01:16.289> play<00:01:16.500> around<00:01:16.649> with<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.160> but<00:01:17.670> bearing<00:01:18.509> in

mind it's not our focus that's not our
big<00:01:22.830> star<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.150> could<00:01:24.810> add<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.049> more

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
big star but I could add a little more

big star but I could add a little more
texture<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.189> wall<00:01:26.430> while<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.880> still

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
texture to that wall while it's still

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.859 
texture to that wall while it's still
wet<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.939> I'll<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.360> i<00:01:30.570> can

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
wet and to do so I'll just i can

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.190 
wet and to do so I'll just i can
splatter<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.500> some<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:32.689> this<00:01:33.689> beautiful
