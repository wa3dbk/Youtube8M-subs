here and in this tutorial series I'll be

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.320 
here and in this tutorial series I'll be
showing<00:00:04.710> you<00:00:05.009> how<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.670> can<00:00:05.940> design<00:00:06.299> a

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
showing you how you can design a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.240 
showing you how you can design a
screwdriver<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.170> CATIA<00:00:07.560> v5<00:00:09.590> in<00:00:10.590> my<00:00:10.800> hands<00:00:11.010> I

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
screwdriver and CATIA v5 in my hands I

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.640 
screwdriver and CATIA v5 in my hands I
have<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.429> screwdriver<00:00:11.849> right<00:00:12.450> now<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.929> I'm

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
have a screwdriver right now and I'm

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.129 
have a screwdriver right now and I'm
going<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.889> design<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.480> so<00:00:15.480> basically<00:00:15.870> this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
going to design that so basically this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.730 
going to design that so basically this
design<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.890> not<00:00:17.369> based<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.740> already

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
design is not based on the already

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.670 
design is not based on the already
existing<00:00:19.920> constraints<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.210> like

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
existing constraints it's just like

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.730 
existing constraints it's just like
whatever<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.980> see<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.279> design<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.500> so<00:00:25.500> let's

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
whatever you see you design it so let's

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.349 
whatever you see you design it so let's
see<00:00:26.810> firstly<00:00:27.810> go<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.300> create<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
see firstly go for you and create a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.430 
see firstly go for you and create a
product<00:00:34.309> and<00:00:35.899> once<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.020> end<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> product

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
product and once you end the product

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.130 
product and once you end the product
just<00:00:38.010> make<00:00:38.219> sure<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.730> rename<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.510> file

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
just make sure that you rename the file

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.599 
just make sure that you rename the file
to<00:00:42.649> screwdriver<00:00:43.649> study

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:57.899 

okay<00:00:51.609> and<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:53.649> go<00:00:53.980> for<00:00:54.909> insert<00:00:55.510> new<00:00:55.929> part<00:00:56.909> and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
okay and then go for insert new part and

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.360 
okay and then go for insert new part and
once<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:58.420> have<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.780> new<00:00:58.899> part<00:00:59.229> just<00:00:59.649> rename

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
once you have the new part just rename

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:10.969 
once you have the new part just rename
the<00:01:00.579> new<00:01:00.609> part<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:05.850> rename<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:06.880> as<00:01:09.299> holder

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the new part and rename it as holder

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.969 
the new part and rename it as holder
first<00:01:11.979> we'll<00:01:12.130> create<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.460> bottom<00:01:12.880> part<00:01:13.149> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.040 

now<00:01:19.890> let's<00:01:20.890> analyze<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.520> screwdriver<00:01:22.030> so<00:01:22.899> as

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
now let's analyze the screwdriver so as

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.550 
now let's analyze the screwdriver so as
I<00:01:23.200> look<00:01:23.380> into<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.770> screwdriver<00:01:24.280> you<00:01:24.700> could

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I look into the screwdriver you could

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.149 
I look into the screwdriver you could
see<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.860> product<00:01:27.399> over<00:01:27.640> here<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.590> as<00:01:32.710> we<00:01:32.890> see

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
see the product over here so as we see

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.859 
see the product over here so as we see
it<00:01:33.340> from<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.970> side<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:36.490> can<00:01:36.700> see<00:01:36.970> from<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.659> top

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
it from the side we can see from the top

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.289 
it from the side we can see from the top
from<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.649> side<00:01:38.860> we<00:01:39.039> can<00:01:39.069> see<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.399> cut<00:01:39.789> like<00:01:40.030> this

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
from the side we can see a cut like this

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.490 
from the side we can see a cut like this
and<00:01:40.830> from<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.009> top<00:01:42.220> if<00:01:42.490> you<00:01:42.640> see<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:44.110> can<00:01:44.319> see

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
and from the top if you see we can see

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.630 
and from the top if you see we can see
there<00:01:44.709> are<00:01:44.830> various<00:01:45.580> cuts<00:01:45.850> in<00:01:46.119> this<00:01:46.810> fashion<00:01:47.640> 1

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
there are various cuts in this fashion 1

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.859 
there are various cuts in this fashion 1
2<00:01:48.940> 3<00:01:49.209> 4<00:01:49.659> 5<00:01:49.869> 6<00:01:50.110> ok<00:01:51.390> 1<00:01:52.390> 2<00:01:52.420> 3<00:01:52.690> 4<00:01:53.619> 5<00:01:54.219> 6<00:01:54.490> right<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.750> then

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
2 3 4 5 6 ok 1 2 3 4 5 6 right and then

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.459 
2 3 4 5 6 ok 1 2 3 4 5 6 right and then
so<00:01:58.869> that's<00:01:59.020> it

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
so that's it

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.899 
so that's it
and<00:01:59.859> we<00:02:00.280> have<00:02:00.520> h<00:02:00.969> fill<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.390> here<00:02:01.780> in<00:02:02.109> here<00:02:02.500> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and we have h fill it here in here and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.410 
and we have h fill it here in here and
this<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.119> pad<00:02:04.679> so<00:02:05.679> let's<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.149> whole

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
this is a pad so let's do this whole

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:16.790 
this is a pad so let's do this whole
design<00:02:07.840> in<00:02:08.789> maybe<00:02:10.680> centimeters

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.960 

so<00:02:17.690> XY<00:02:18.690> plane<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:20.120> maybe<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:22.140> bottom<00:02:22.970> circle

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
so XY plane and maybe the bottom circle

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.300 
so XY plane and maybe the bottom circle
will<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:27.830> almost<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.670> diameter

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
will be of almost like a diameter

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.950 
will be of almost like a diameter
maybe<00:02:32.310> one<00:02:32.820> point<00:02:33.090> five<00:02:33.330> centimeter<00:02:35.960> maybe

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
maybe one point five centimeter maybe

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.980 
maybe one point five centimeter maybe
one<00:02:37.230> point<00:02:37.470> seven<00:02:37.830> centimeter<00:02:40.370> come<00:02:41.370> out<00:02:41.990> just

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
one point seven centimeter come out just

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.720 
one point seven centimeter come out just
make<00:02:43.170> sure<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.380> you're<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.740> centimeters

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.020 

units<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.880> centimeter<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.610> like<00:02:50.850> that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
units a centimeter and just like that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.970 
units a centimeter and just like that
sketch<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.630> go<00:02:51.780> for<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.020> pad<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.910> this<00:02:53.910> must<00:02:54.540> be

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.730 

two<00:02:58.980> inches<00:02:59.430> two<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.790> half<00:02:59.970> inch<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:01.680> two

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
two inches two and a half inch so two

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.900 
two inches two and a half inch so two
and<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:02.070> half<00:03:02.250> into<00:03:02.610> two<00:03:03.270> point<00:03:03.570> five<00:03:04.490> so<00:03:05.490> maybe

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
and a half into two point five so maybe

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:16.860 
and a half into two point five so maybe
around<00:03:08.480> maybe<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.660> seven<00:03:10.230> centimeters

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:28.570 

okay<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:17.739> we<00:03:18.099> got<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.450> cylinder<00:03:19.450> over<00:03:19.599> here

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.310 

the<00:03:29.090> next<00:03:29.360> thing<00:03:29.510> what<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:29.930> do<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:32.320> select

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
the next thing what you can do is select

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.570 
the next thing what you can do is select
the<00:03:33.620> sketch<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.600> then<00:03:35.600> you<00:03:36.050> could<00:03:36.400> take<00:03:37.400> the

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
the sketch and then you could take the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:46.420 
the sketch and then you could take the
three-point<00:03:38.090> arc<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:40.570> create<00:03:44.740> an<00:03:45.740> arc<00:03:46.250> in

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
three-point arc and create an arc in

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.680 
three-point arc and create an arc in
this<00:03:46.550> fashion<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.950> just<00:03:49.370> close<00:03:49.910> that<00:03:49.940> arc<00:03:52.690> so

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
this fashion and just close that arc so

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.420
