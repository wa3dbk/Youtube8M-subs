00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.699
 nerve cum quiet 6 this is not 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.230
 automatic blaster which 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.010
 charging through each cartridge 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.219
 but very good for him comes 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:39.320
 such a shop six rounds and strap 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:42.870
 to be comfortable to carry it right away 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.410
 catches the eye that you can't see it 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.850
 voiceovers all for everything else 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:55.579
 what gets interesting at the top of it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.710
 there is a button on if you click on it 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.920
 blaster will open 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.309
 let's see it more far to 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.240
 also he is going by clicking on 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.590
 this button and pull forward a little 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:18.140
 pen and raising up 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.850
 lanterns provided here so far with 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.340
 very simple and understandable was the son of it 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.000
 does not break also he has such 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.880
 lamp 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.880
 red color which is not visible here 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.479
 but you can see the outline of red 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.680
 colors also need batteries 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.030
 buy which because bundled 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.030
 they are not attached 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.050
 farther 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:57.660
 to charge a weapon you need to pull this 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:01.530
 pen back I charged it as always up 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.530
 it has a tighter spring and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.520
 so the trigger has to be pressed 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.820
 more knocking over Stu's all round 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.530
 happens well don't worry if you have 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:22.290
 something just nana wiki 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:26.540
 salvation and so let's not need everything 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:33.540
 just press a finger but here it is 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.350
 he has such a plate especially for 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.230
 rear 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:41.570
 no front also wear it 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.360
 is regulated 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:53.519
 to leave more so that 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:57.870
 it was less just make war to 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:04.040
 charge the weapons you need for more 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:10.290
 high-quality charging inserting axis under 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:13.410
 your cartridges put here in this from 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.650
 version as it were specifically for the store and 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:23.450
 way back and she is charging up to click 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:27.019
 now we and so now we will shoot 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.019
 out into the corner 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.689
 wait please so we continue 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:46.180
 you had to digress a little so 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:51.250
 we shoot also in the corner sometimes chuck 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.950
 do not hang very accurately and so our store 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.980
 ran out can also leave him not 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.109
 only one for six rounds but 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.439
 other 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:06.700
 from your other weapons if it's yours 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:10.569
 first he stayed 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.739
 but I left him literally because 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.680
 it is also made to fit 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.109
 one spare chuck so on occasion 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.810
 if you have a spare weapon 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.910
 maiden could be stored or just 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.449
 insert here also to charge 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.900
 weapons without a store just insert 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:38.050
 him in the barrel 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:42.250
 charge the rest is bad this bunch is not 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:46.930
 do so here with you was maxim 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:51.570
