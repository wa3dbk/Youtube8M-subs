00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.980
 good there all his friends stop rahman qu 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.510
 we feel today points de lyon a 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.380
 little special I put in accelerated because 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.210
 now the fight has been a bit long 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.160
 I rather based on the number of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.240
 turns I'm duration so this is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.949
 applications for registration or 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.240
 terminator for people who me 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.189
 have been following for a relatively long time or 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 who knew me dofus since 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.199
 a long time also you know that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.019
 recently 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.019
 and then he came out heliotrope I played in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.949
 does that on on the beta so I have 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.720
 more played on the official 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.170
 I'm on the know the dic roll 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.690
 however and ben ali me more or less 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.840
 advised by he advised me wrong he 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.840
 pushed me back to play on the beta 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.430
 on the official for to do the job 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.289
 you have me then I do not tell you that after 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.660
 I stayed on the official and play 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.399
 on there I'm mostly for the wild a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.289
 exactly 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.610
 so that is to say that I played you the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.440
 so based on the official but still 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.370
 list of my idiot I sold his 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.770
 stops I changed class 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.080
 here I have a stuff about 1700 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.110
 twenty and 750 intel just for you 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.760
 take a turn not too badly gould plot 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.530
 to sepa sepa mega although I must admit I 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 do 12 rounds I do not want to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.159
 take the lead to do a lot 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.030
 better 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.439
 so doustour me that's enough and especially 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.060
 I will explain the reasons therefore 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.979
 tomorrow goultard inscriptions then ya 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 a lot of people I love to play 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.670
 the heliotrope already one I know I do not 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.430
 am not the best player of the people of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.380
 times they tell me I do not even have 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.950
 like how I play in the fights I 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.829
 do not know exactly 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.659
 short anyway me if I play here 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.159
 it's all about pleasure because 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.979
 I love to play heliotrope in parcel 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.890
 especially so in multi pvp I love 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.540
 play this the setting of the four lords 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.549
 interesting with good players has 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.140
 priori you did not have that good 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.140
 players for sure 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.120
 with I hope a rather nice atmosphere 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.260
 it's because I had it's not 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.190
 all I got back in the year 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.320
 passed but it was a bit special because 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.640
 that I could not play short I hope 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.289
 in any case that this time I'm going 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.020
 get away with a lot back 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.920
 better this year there as long as you 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.720
 vote for me for breaks from 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.620
 passing popularity I do not believe they 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.480
 have a lot of heliotrope on the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.560
 know li crounch seeker i'm sure 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.739
 that in the layers I remind you 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.239
 besides, so if he worked with flavors 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.800
 do not hesitate to vote for me 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.310
 would be happy 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:33.610
 and what was I doing 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.120
 to say I know so I did not play there 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.230
 Longer 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.070
 some people will tell me it's 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.360
 a little bit like this 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.370
 in this case for the tam flight is good for 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.920
 me the gilt to it is not fully 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.510
 by server how to say it's rather 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.360
 an event pvp a tournament pdt global to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.550
 an opportunity to improve yourself 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.440
 better master the class do as 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.160
 that such a fun tournament is not like 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.989
 if it was a competition 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.000
 international with them thousands of 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.860
 defraud thousands of law win or I 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.380
 do not know what for me it's 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.019
 especially open to move from pvp to high 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.670
 level with I hope deschamps it's going 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.350
 I do not really want to be brief 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.760
 to improve myself in dofus that's what I 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.730
 always looking for pvp me 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.829
 it's improving myself has enjoined others 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.480
 offers weighed during classes that 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.450
 I have not badly improved it elliott the gas 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.680
 while frankly I'm not bad 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.940
 improved since I started to 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.260
 play now I'm coming pretty well 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.660
 played placed synchros and all 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.480
 ensure separates their god as I 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.040

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.420
 to maintain there it is also for you 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.640
