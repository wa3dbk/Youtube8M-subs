 with a little butter like 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.510
 you can see and now we're going to start 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.550
 prepare the dough blow misses everything 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.550
 look at the flour 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.210
 the eggs 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.469
 strictly 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.940
 the sugar the lemon zest 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.540
 and the yeast 

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.530
 and the oil 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.380
 and now the túrmix is ​​taken 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.380
 and crush everything well shredded 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.040
 and this is also crushed and now 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.990
 let's start filling the molds 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.300
 take a spoon and carefully you go 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.869
 throwing it do not take it at all because 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.869
 this goes up 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.060
 if you have a little left out after 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.960
 he cleans it jce 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.130
 that's how it is with this measure 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.130
 it's great 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.200
 because when climbing 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.189
 day is used outside this measure me 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.189
 it seems perfect 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.690
 I already know it, you see more or less 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.880
 all to the same extent the droplets that 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.730
 they have fallen I have cleaned it with paper 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.760
 cooks because when baked 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.010
 these droplets are then burned a little 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.080
 hygienic now we're going to put it 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.160
 180 degree oven and we're going to leave it at 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.450
 beginning 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.470
 20 minutes 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.450
 we will not puncture with a toothpick and if it does 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.519
 lack we will leave it more this with 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.849
 fan those without fan 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.849
 five more minutes and the same click 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.780
 now the 20 minutes are over and we are going to 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.330
 check how it has been 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.870
 I think you perfect very well 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:21.570
 It comes out clean look that is we already have 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.570
 a batch made we're going to take it out 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.040
 now let's cool them down a 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.050
 little and unmold we have look at the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.170
 second run as the oven is very 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:44.709
 hot instead of 20 minutes we're going 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.709
 to leave 12 minutes and we'll check 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.730
 and it's been 12 minutes and we're going to 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.730
 check how they are 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.360
 and see if it changes 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.980
 perfect look I pricked it and it comes out clean 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.780
 have to take into account one thing that 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.030
 as the oven this is one thing that 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.300
 makes the oven live is very hot 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.960
 then the action is not needed as much 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.940
 time to look have been perfect now 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.269
 you have to let it cool 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.360
 blas and put an end to what the 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.000
 filling and as you go filling and 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.250
 you leave it - we left it 12 minutes 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.590
 perfect to those who do not have aired 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.840
 the same decrease the time now 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.330
 you leave what sense you go back to fill it 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.280
 and we leave it again for 12 minutes 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.740
 good to see we have finished them 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.780
 make look that they go on appointment that goes more 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.150
 pretty that this serves well for 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.039
 lunch lunches to take a 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.090
 cortadito and here you have the presentation 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.520
