00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:14.230
 hello today we're going to see this model is a 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:16.299
 model that is like mosaic style and what 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.170
 I have placed on the strips that are going to 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.230
 form the portfolio 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.350
 but in what way are we going to do it? 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.740
 pretty pretty simple first that 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.270
 nothing we are going to make the strips the strips 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.579
 As I have already said in other courses in 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.120
 another in other videos like 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.120
 prepare the strips 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.850
 normally the strips are 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.620
 plasticized beforehand but in this 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 case as we are going to assemble a figure 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.460
 we need it not to be still or not be 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.129
 still classified if the measures 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.550
 they have to be the right ones to give 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.710
 a perfect finish and the pictures are 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.320
 completely perfect 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.840
 so I give you a review of what 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.930
 we had seen in other videos 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.090
 previous how to make the pictures and 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.090
 let's proceed then to see how 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.850
 let's assemble the figure I at least 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.940
 I chose this which is that of dads 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.390
 example but you can choose any 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.240
 figure and the logical thing is if the most 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.570
 let's say it would be better to do 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.210
 always this on paper 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.350
 unicolor so that the figure that 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.750
 choose then you can highlight then 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.750
 we had this we had not done this 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.900
 we fold it like this 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.530
 and it happens that when it comes to that they are 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.140
 commissions and there are many then you have to 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.380
 learn to bend this much more 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.070
 fast but at least I'm sure 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.500
 giving with calm remember that it was taken 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.380
 around here on this side not this one where 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.520
 there's more where you see more papers and what 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:23.140
 same here here then look here like this 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.080
 it is stretched and pressed well so that 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.960
 are perfect and then we look for the same 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.710
 let it be a single that is the most 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.760
 simple in the same thing here and what 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.230
 we take down 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.900
 okay 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.030
 always looking for the least part 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.799
 more simple pieces of paper because the other 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.030
 It has a lot of sheets and then more 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.000
 difficult to string 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.560
 ok then something like that more or less like 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.090
 this should be ok 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.420
 and 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.140
 here are facts 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.300
 there are 33 depending on the size of the 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.400
 portfolio remember you too that I 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.230
 he had told them to always do 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.640
 the wallets have to be spikes 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.500
 the pairs to be able then down 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.840
 can close well then always the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.819
 strips have to be pairs in this 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.560
 case they are three peaks nothing else because what 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.220
 I'm going to show you how to assemble 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.650
 figure as they mount the figure of which 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.709
 you chose in this case me 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.040
 I chose that of the pope then once 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.230
 let's have that 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.719
 here is for example this is the 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.590
 original what I did was that of serve 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:40.810
 a copy a copy of black for 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.930
 I can mount it on paper then 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.049
 once I have this that I have my 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.930
 three or four depends on the size of 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.750
 the figure my strips made true 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.299
 then I super put them placed 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.889
 if united, that's why it's 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.409
 important that the pictures be 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.109
 exactly the same size and for that 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:05.049
 the measures must always be respected 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.790
 measures that I have given them then a 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:11.480
 Once we have that, we are going to 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:15.560
 place the figure on top 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.290
 that we chose and what we are going to put 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.709
 rubber gum plastic rubber of this type of 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:27.370
 rubber for example this rubber we put it 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.370
 all around everything around him 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:36.070
 well exactly everything around the 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.810
 figure and we put it to carlos ok all 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.230
 that is well stuck and you have to 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.620
 make sure that three o'clock three o'clock 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.720
 lines the three strips are fine 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.530
 united ok 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.130
 once we have this we let it dry 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:56.470
 for a time about five or ten minutes 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.780
 and after we have the figure made 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.130
 that we already have this stuck 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.450
 let's use a cutter that discusses and 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.750
 very carefully we are going to start 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.740
 tear through all the squares 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.350
 I do not know if they see what I'm doing well 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.720
 for all the squares we are going to go 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.690
 cutting in such a way to go 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.000
 detaching each of the strips 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.390
 then a strip follows 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.440
 here and here 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:36.710
 so another one comes off and so after that 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:41.050
 let's have this mosaic let's say it 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:46.220
 so then it's time to undo 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:49.220
 the strip to laminate after it is 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.790
 plasticized we go back to do 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.410
 the las the strips and it is something like 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.600
 this ok 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.950
 it's going to look like this is already 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:06.380
 plasticized is already completely 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:08.030
 exalted and logically you have to do the 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.030
 continuation of each of these strips 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.350
 so we can make the portfolio true 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.660
 because this is so small, it's not 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.100
 we can fold then as 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.950
 we had said before we had spoken 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.260
 at least for this portfolio size 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.210
 it would have to be another one has a 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.120
 continuation of strips of one two three 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.960
 four of four peaks or each of 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.950
 these strips have to be eight peaks 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.460
 then it 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.800
 closes as we have already seen it and 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.530
 we proceed to sew 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.960
 I have omitted all that because there are so many 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.760
 people have seen it already know how it is already what 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.440
 we've done in other videos but what 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.550
 I was interested was to see how 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.520
 can we place a figure 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.990
 within the 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.210
 of the strips and this can be something very 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:03.449
 customized can be from one of your 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:08.530
 children of the husband of the wife of some 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:11.319
 some famous that you are admire 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.930
 for example my case I did a lot of 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:16.090
 marilyn monroe that of elvis presley the one 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.009
 michael jackson are the ones that 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.789
 they have asked me the most 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:25.270
 well and that depends or is what color 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:28.810
 we can do or in black and white but 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.659
 I always recommend that the paper be a and 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.970
 color so that the figure can stay 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:36.370
 well it is well printed and can be 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.830
 visualize better ok 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.620
 good with attempts or I say goodbye and until 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:44.280
 the next one and I hope you enjoy it 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.280
 bye
