00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.580
 hi girls how are you hoping this quest 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.160
 summer continues very well for you today 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.290
 we will make a mobile phone holder while in 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.780
 charge what we will need to have 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.089
 simply the empty box of a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.789
 bubble bath then we are going to remove 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.690
 the label and after that we start the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.750
 our 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.970
 let's start our work using one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.880
 scissor tip with the tip because I don't have the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.529
 cutter with the cutter surely 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.840
 you will be much more precise 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.550
 however I use this tip e 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.620
 I'm going to make this first central line 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.590
 and then I get rid of the upper part 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.050
 so you don't have to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.300
 be precise with regards to above 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.250
 we are going to join the two points which 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.329
 we cut it doing some sort of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.680
 rounded design in the tip up to 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.899
 get this result 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.390
 at this point I suggest you give one 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 rinsed because surely there will be 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.719
 residues of bubble bath or anyway of 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.309
 liquid soap 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.829
 after which opening ours 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.769
 charger and I'm going to track with 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.530
 a pencil a square so that 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.990
 our charger can be 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.680
 positioned in one outlet is this 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.600
 either horizontally or vertically with 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.909
 the scissors always with the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.520
 baard cutter owe to remove this 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.270
 space then to get this square 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.600
 and once we get it we go to decorate 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.329
 could not this point not to use i 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.820
 acrylic colors so I take ours 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.189
 usual nail art brush and the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.750
 black color and I'm going to draw a heart 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.340
 of course if you don't have the colors 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.310
 acrylics you can also use it 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.229
 black enamel and then with those the interior 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.030
 with black temperatures 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.070
 naturally the design then at will 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 therefore being able to teach a heart one 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.680
 star a flower whatever you like 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.750
 and then colored with the colors that best fit 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.420
 like them anyway with the colors that most 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.640
 befits your room then I go 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.380
 to use these beautiful and summery 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.490
 that came out in the magazine of 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.450
 barbarous and go learns 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.020
 the yellow mouth and the position in the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.020
 center 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.220
 and then I also take another beautiful one 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.410
 kiss that is red and positions it a 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.660
 little higher always with colors 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.780
 acrylics I'm going to outline the zebra stripes 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.959
 which have been thwarted by this 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.270
 adhesive and then take another one 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.940
 I'm going to position the upper part 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.810
 this is a little cash budget heart 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.760
 really beautiful just cute they are and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.709
 after that we go to decorate 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.080
 further or I take these 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.700
 rhinestones that I purchased from the Chinese there 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.600
 I paid you one euro you will find them 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.930
 definitely and they are adhesive rhinestones 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.390
 which are both silver struts and rhinestones a 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.580
 pearl shape and I'm going to trace everything 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.650
 the contour 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.110
 first I make them with pearls and then there 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.310
 I do with silver strass throughout 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.459
 then the outline also decorates all the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.940
 nooks or decorated like any more 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.640
 like it 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.459
 and at your leisure you can also do 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.860
 the whole part is full of rhinestones 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.630
 finally I apply the top coat to give 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.190
 the glossy effect just because before 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.410
 we applied acrylic colors 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.049
 then the polishing paint that 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.030
 generally used for the do-it-yourself 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.799
 that's not good because otherwise it is going to fade 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.060
 all acrylic color 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.850
 finally this is the final result 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.720
 I really hope you like it and send you 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.720
 a big kiss
