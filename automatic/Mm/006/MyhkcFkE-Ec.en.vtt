00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 today I want to share a bit of 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.740
 information that I found on the net 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.779
 a long time ago the first thing is 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.179
 a document that describes the vision of 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.700
 civil engineering for the year 2025 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.190
 It turns out that in 2006 a group of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.350
 civil engineers teaching architects 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.380
 and executives of associations and companies 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.779
 as well as other fulanitos met in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.910
 virginia usa at this summit there was talk of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.680
 issues such as the poor state of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.210
 infrastructure at a global level the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.429
 corruption in engineering sectors and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.380
 construction and the low participation of 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.329
 civil engineers in processes 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.760
 politicians there commented that in the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.290
 future the world will face more changes 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.629
 demographics and accelerated growth 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.600
 of the population most demand for energy 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.370
 sustainable clean water clean air and the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.350
 safe disposal of waste 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.570
 which will drive the need to prioritize 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 energy resources and use 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.230
 obviously alternative fuels 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 causing the projects of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 engineering incorporate the recycling already 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.300
 be using recycled materials or 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.100
 that the components of the projects 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.960
 be recyclable at the end of your life 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.149
 useful virtually everything is going to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.159
 reuse and refused the 2025 the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.210
 robotics will not be left behind emulating 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.580
 the facts 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.710
 in non-human intervention in areas of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 high risk infrastructure me 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.240
 It seems good to have robots instead of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.010
 bricklayers besides that a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.210
 itinerary to be able to meet the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.680
 objectives for that year 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.750
 if you were interested in this we did the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.460
 attention can see can lower the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.909
 document gel leave the link here 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.440
 down in the description meanwhile 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.170
 in china a group of scientists 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.909
 developed a carbon airgel to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.960
 that they called the lightest material 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.090
 of the world 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.670
 to date this material is so 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.130
 light that its density is only 16 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.380
 milligrams per cubic centimeter of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.360
 experts hope that the airgel of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.979
 carbon plays an important role in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.470
 pollution control the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.840
 oil spill control 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.759
 water purification and purification 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.560
 uniform of the air we travel in time 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.229
 and let's see how it could be built in the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.270
 future with the help of robots this project 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.460
 it's called flight architecture mounted 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.039
 and its creators the fabio architects 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.320
 recording mattia scanner and the expert in 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.120
 robotic rafael or andreas assure 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.080
 that in the future the constructions of 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.420
 buildings 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.270
 and it can be done with the help of robots 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.130
 programmed flights and thus replace the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.980
 use of construction cranes every time 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.050
 bigger 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.610
 and finally I recommend a video of 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.890
 the construction of this bridge in the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.450
 oakland san francisco bay like 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.450
 always thanks for watching and subscribing
