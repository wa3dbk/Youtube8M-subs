00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 We have seen many new TVs at CES. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 From the most sublime to the weirdest TVs. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Curved, flexible, angled and huge TVs. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 This is our list of the 5 best TVs: 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Flexible TVs may be a gimmick, but still great to watch. Both LG and Samsung have shown OLED TVs that .. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
 can change from a standard screen to a curved screen. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 The idea is that you have more options for your viewing experience, but it is still a mystery if the consumer wants a curved screen, let alone a flexible one. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 With an open mouth you watch LG's curved oled TV with 4k ultra HD resolution, which combines the ultra sharp image of ultra HD with the characteristic of an oled image. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 This together provides a stunning experience. A 55-inch OLED HD TV from LG last year cost £ 7000 (€ 8400). 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Just think how much this model will cost. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 With the new 2014 TV design, Sony has got everything out of the closet, with a triluminos display. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.400
 And its smart TVs are easier to control than ever before. 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.000
 We think the Sony W950 could be the HD TV of this year. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 The W950 will get a lot of competition, certainly on the high-end market of HD TVs, from the hugely popular 8-series from Samsung. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.800
 The H8000 stands out for its curved design, but also its powerful quad-core processor. 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.000
 That should make browsing through your smart TV super fast. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Finally, the CES 2014 has been the year of separate and unique TVs. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.800
 And the most ridiculous is a curved 105-inch 4K ultra-HD TV. 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.000
 Samsung and LG both have their own gigantic models. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And although these TVs will probably never be in your living room, they will show you what is possible.
