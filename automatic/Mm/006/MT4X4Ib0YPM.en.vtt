it's<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> pretty<00:02:17.900> basic<00:02:18.290> kimball<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.010> said<00:02:19.310> it's

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
it's a pretty basic kimball I said it's

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.699 
it's a pretty basic kimball I said it's
a<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.180> cheapest<00:02:20.690> tier<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:21.680> you

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
a like the cheapest tier of it so you

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.470 
a like the cheapest tier of it so you
know<00:02:21.950> they<00:02:22.100> can't<00:02:22.310> all<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.580> crazy<00:02:22.820> particle

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
know they can't all have crazy particle

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.030 
know they can't all have crazy particle
effects<00:02:23.750> going<00:02:24.050> off<00:02:24.140> all<00:02:24.320> over<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.650> place<00:02:24.800> I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
effects going off all over the place I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.699 
effects going off all over the place I
give<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.550> price<00:02:25.760> point<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.150> think<00:02:26.330> it's

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
give it a price point I think it's

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.740 
give it a price point I think it's
