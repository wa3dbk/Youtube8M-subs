00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.440 
Lord Jesus is Lord so we'll make an
image<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:50.190> represent<00:01:50.690> Jesus<00:01:52.070> easy<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.450> get

into<00:01:54.690> that<00:01:54.810> kind<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.229> thinking<00:01:55.500> especially

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
into that kind of thinking especially

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.149 
into that kind of thinking especially
where<00:01:56.400> you're<00:01:56.610> never<00:01:56.880> trained<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.860> that

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
where you're never trained to know that

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
you cannot make an image of God so as we

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.020 
you cannot make an image of God so as we

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
think about the Covenant of the first

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.359

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
covenant that was broken and compare it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.240 
covenant that was broken and compare it
with<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.670> new<00:02:09.049> economy<00:02:10.049> of<00:02:10.409> images<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.099> was

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
for him if they are saying that God is

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.520 
for him if they are saying that God is
not<00:04:20.729> jealous<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.269> those<00:04:21.390> images<00:04:21.900> he<00:04:22.080> wants<00:04:22.410> us

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
not jealous of those images he wants us

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.610 
not jealous of those images he wants us
to<00:04:22.560> use<00:04:23.010> them<00:04:23.430> because<00:04:23.760> they<00:04:24.270> say<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.720> images

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
to use them because they say the images

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.570 
to use them because they say the images
truly<00:04:25.950> represent<00:04:26.460> him<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:29.160> church<00:04:29.400> is

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
truly represent him and the church is

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.210 
truly represent him and the church is
saying<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.930> images<00:04:31.350> are<00:04:31.530> not<00:04:31.560> iniquity

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
saying that the images are not iniquity

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.840 
saying that the images are not iniquity
but<00:04:32.760> now<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.360> calls<00:04:33.900> them<00:04:34.169> holy<00:04:34.470> images<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:35.820> we

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
but now it calls them holy images so we

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.969 
but now it calls them holy images so we
can<00:04:36.060> see<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:36.390> there's<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.660> complete<00:04:37.169> reversal

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
can see that there's a complete reversal

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.070 
can see that there's a complete reversal
of<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:40.410> covenants<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:41.430> God<00:04:41.550> with<00:04:42.539> his<00:04:42.810> people

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
of the covenants of God with his people

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.110 
of the covenants of God with his people
and<00:04:43.410> with<00:04:43.800> what<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.160> Roman<00:04:44.430> Catholic<00:04:44.880> Church

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
and with what the Roman Catholic Church

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.830 
and with what the Roman Catholic Church
imposes

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
imposes

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.830 
imposes
