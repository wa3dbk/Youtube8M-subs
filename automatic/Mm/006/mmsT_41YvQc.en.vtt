hi<00:00:00.750> I<00:00:00.780> wanted<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.230> talk<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.560> you<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.680> little<00:00:01.800> bit

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hi I wanted to talk to you a little bit

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.180 
hi I wanted to talk to you a little bit
today<00:00:02.190> about<00:00:02.340> building<00:00:03.270> chords<00:00:04.200> if<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:05.100> are

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
today about building chords if you are

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.350 
today about building chords if you are
in<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.430> key<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.819> C<00:00:07.460> that<00:00:08.460> mean<00:00:08.940> you're<00:00:09.150> using

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
in the key of C that mean you're using

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.870 
in the key of C that mean you're using
all<00:00:09.780> these<00:00:10.139> seven<00:00:10.679> different<00:00:10.920> white<00:00:11.370> notes<00:00:11.639> on

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
all these seven different white notes on

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.189 
all these seven different white notes on
the<00:00:12.179> piano<00:00:12.360> when<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.080> get<00:00:13.230> back<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> next

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
the piano when you get back to the next

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.320 
the piano when you get back to the next
C<00:00:16.199> you're<00:00:16.710> starting<00:00:17.279> those<00:00:17.400> same<00:00:17.670> seven<00:00:18.119> notes

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
C you're starting those same seven notes

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.779 
C you're starting those same seven notes
over<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.990> when<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.619> are<00:00:19.800> playing<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.279> song<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
over so when you are playing a song in a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.220 
over so when you are playing a song in a
key<00:00:21.439> in<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.619> example<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.580> key<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> C

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
key in this example it's the key of C

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.570 
key in this example it's the key of C
you're<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.680> playing<00:00:26.010> seven

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you're really just playing seven

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.820 
you're really just playing seven
different<00:00:27.029> notes<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.630> your<00:00:28.230> melody<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
different notes and your melody of a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.669 
different notes and your melody of a
song<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.369> built<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.119> those<00:00:30.720> seven<00:00:31.199> notes<00:00:31.410> so

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
song is built on those seven notes so

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.310 
song is built on those seven notes so
for<00:00:31.859> example<00:00:37.760> star<00:00:38.760> wars<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.270> most<00:00:39.870> any<00:00:40.050> song

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
for example star wars or most any song

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.470 
for example star wars or most any song
you<00:00:40.469> would<00:00:40.590> play<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.670> using<00:00:42.180> those

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
you would play is really using those

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
you would play is really using those
seven<00:00:43.110> notes<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.340> helps<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
seven notes so it really helps to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.380 
seven notes so it really helps to
understand<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.789> melody<00:00:47.789> notes<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.149> made

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
understand that melody notes are made

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.900 
understand that melody notes are made
out<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:49.079> usually<00:00:49.710> seven<00:00:50.370> notes<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
out of just usually seven notes of a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790 
out of just usually seven notes of a
scale<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:51.690> are<00:00:51.809> always<00:00:51.989> exceptions<00:00:52.260> but

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
scale there are always exceptions but

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
scale there are always exceptions but
fundamentally<00:00:53.579> that's<00:00:53.789> what's<00:00:54.300> happening

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
fundamentally that's what's happening

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750 
fundamentally that's what's happening
when<00:00:54.899> you're<00:00:55.020> creating<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.559> song<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.100> here's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
when you're creating a song and here's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.139 
when you're creating a song and here's
the<00:00:56.910> next<00:00:57.180> step<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:59.120> harmonies<00:01:00.120> in

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the next step is that the harmonies in

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.060 
the next step is that the harmonies in
this<00:01:00.420> song<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.079> called<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> chords

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
this song or what it called the chords

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
this song or what it called the chords
are<00:01:02.280> also<00:01:02.609> built<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> seven<00:01:03.960> notes<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
are also built out of the seven notes of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.039 
are also built out of the seven notes of
that<00:01:04.439> scale<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> take<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.390> first<00:01:06.720> note

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that scale so if you take the first note

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.899 
that scale so if you take the first note
of<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> scale<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> key<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.250> C<00:01:08.490> which<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
of the scale in the key of C which is a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.020 
of the scale in the key of C which is a
C<00:01:09.270> note<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.770> skim<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> note<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> skip<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
C note and you skim a note and skip a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.570 
C note and you skim a note and skip a
note<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:13.409> using<00:01:13.619> bad<00:01:13.860> fingering<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
note and I'm using bad fingering so you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.789 
note and I'm using bad fingering so you
can<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> keys<00:01:15.180> better<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.590> would

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
can see the keys better here that would

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.460 
can see the keys better here that would
be<00:01:16.830> called<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.189> C<00:01:17.369> chord<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.990> chord

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
be called a C chord that's the one chord

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.490 
be called a C chord that's the one chord
in<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.100> key<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.390> whatever<00:01:21.810> key<00:01:22.229> you're<00:01:22.470> in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
in that key so whatever key you're in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770 
in that key so whatever key you're in
this<00:01:23.009> same<00:01:23.280> principle<00:01:23.490> applies<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.600> build

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
this same principle applies if you build

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.149 
this same principle applies if you build
a<00:01:24.869> chord<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> first<00:01:25.650> note<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> scale

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
a chord on the first note of the scale

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
a chord on the first note of the scale
that's<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> one<00:01:26.970> chord<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.630> key<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that's the one chord in that key so in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
that's the one chord in that key so in
the<00:01:28.619> key<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.860> C<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.579> chord<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.119> called<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the key of C the one chord is called the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.899 
the key of C the one chord is called the
C<00:01:30.780> chord<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.950> go<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> second<00:01:32.700> note<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
C chord if you go to the second note of

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.640 
C chord if you go to the second note of
the<00:01:33.030> scale<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.750> skip

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the scale and skip

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.370 
the scale and skip
skip<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.980> note<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.510> two<00:01:36.720> chord<00:01:37.050> in<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
skip a note that is the two chord in the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.680 
skip a note that is the two chord in the
key<00:01:37.410> of<00:01:37.590> C<00:01:37.920> e<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.760> go<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> third<00:01:39.450> note

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
key of C e if you go to the third note

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.340 
key of C e if you go to the third note
of<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> scale<00:01:41.030> if<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.360> skip<00:01:42.690> one<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
of the scale if one skip one that's the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.890 
of the scale if one skip one that's the
three<00:01:43.800> chord<00:01:44.190> in<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.550> key<00:01:44.850> because<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
three chord in that key because the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.470 
three chord in that key because the
fourth<00:01:46.260> note<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.800> C<00:01:46.980> scale<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.580> build<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
fourth note of the C scale and build a

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.410 
fourth note of the C scale and build a
chord<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.870> that<00:01:49.110> that's<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.770> F<00:01:49.920> chord<00:01:50.420> fifth

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
chord on that that's the F chord fifth

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.070 
chord on that that's the F chord fifth
note<00:01:51.690> of<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.900> scale<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.980> the<00:01:53.430> five<00:01:53.970> chord<00:01:54.510> also

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
note of the scale is the five chord also

is<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.730> B<00:02:02.880> diminished<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.830> then<00:02:04.830> we're<00:02:05.250> back

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
is it B diminished and then we're back

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.240 
is it B diminished and then we're back
to<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:05.880> chord<00:02:05.910> again<00:02:06.330> in<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.890> next

to the one chord again in the next

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.220 
to the one chord again in the next
octave<00:02:08.520> higher<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.510> names<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> notes

octave higher so the names of the notes

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.140 
octave higher so the names of the notes
would<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.679> same<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.700> numbers<00:02:12.000> would

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
dealing with seven notes most of the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.490 
dealing with seven notes most of the
time<00:02:26.910> when<00:02:27.180> you're<00:02:27.270> making<00:02:27.510> melodies<00:02:28.110> and

time when you're making melodies and
also<00:02:29.220> when<00:02:29.340> you're<00:02:29.460> making<00:02:29.640> chords<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.350> here's

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
also when you're making chords so here's

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.820 
also when you're making chords so here's
the<00:02:32.220> cool<00:02:32.490> thing<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.510> note<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the cool thing is that note of the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.190 
the cool thing is that note of the
melody<00:02:35.010> are<00:02:35.430> made<00:02:35.700> out<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.450> seven<00:02:36.930> notes

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
melody are made out of the seven notes

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.410 
melody are made out of the seven notes
of<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:38.160> C<00:02:38.460> scale<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.860> chord

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.990 

well<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:45.540> we<00:02:45.600> go<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:47.570> notes<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.170> melody

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
well there we go and notes of the melody

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.580 
well there we go and notes of the melody
most<00:02:51.000> often<00:02:51.600> land<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.850> notes<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.450> chord<00:02:54.959> so

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
most often land on notes of the chord so

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.350 
most often land on notes of the chord so
for<00:02:55.800> example<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:59.060> you<00:03:00.060> look<00:03:00.239> at

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
for example if you have you look at

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.760 
for example if you have you look at
those<00:03:00.510> three<00:03:00.750> notes<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.170> were<00:03:01.410> used<00:03:01.590> in

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
those three notes that were used in

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.740 
those three notes that were used in
there<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.489> can<00:03:02.670> take<00:03:02.820> away<00:03:03.120> anything<00:03:03.600> it's

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
there you can take away anything it's

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.780 
there you can take away anything it's
not<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> skip

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
not a skip

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.720 
not a skip
and<00:03:06.060> find<00:03:06.720> two<00:03:07.650> notes<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.189> chord<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.670> then

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
and find two notes of the chord and then

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.179 
and find two notes of the chord and then
skip<00:03:09.120> up<00:03:09.299> one<00:03:09.540> more<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:10.079> find<00:03:10.349> what<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.709> chord

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
skip up one more to find what that chord

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.190 
skip up one more to find what that chord
most<00:03:11.400> likely<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.269> could<00:03:12.420> also<00:03:12.569> skip<00:03:12.959> down

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
most likely is you could also skip down

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.369 
most likely is you could also skip down
in<00:03:14.129> that<00:03:14.340> sounds<00:03:14.790> right<00:03:14.970> but<00:03:15.299> most<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
in that sounds right but most of the

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.589 
in that sounds right but most of the
time<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.650> way<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.799> can<00:03:16.950> find<00:03:17.370> what<00:03:17.909> key

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
time that way you can find what key

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.380 
time that way you can find what key
something<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.189> by<00:03:20.489> looking<00:03:21.060> at<00:03:21.269> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
something is in is by looking at the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.149 
something is in is by looking at the
melody<00:03:21.569> notes<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:25.470> see<00:03:25.709> where<00:03:25.860> your<00:03:25.980> main

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
melody notes and see where your main

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.339 
melody notes and see where your main
landing<00:03:26.670> spots<00:03:27.030> are<00:03:27.269> take<00:03:27.720> away<00:03:28.019> anything

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
landing spots are take away anything

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.039 
landing spots are take away anything
that's<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.920> neighborhood<00:03:29.519> note<00:03:29.760> look<00:03:30.750> for<00:03:31.019> a

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
that's a neighborhood note look for a

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.430 
that's a neighborhood note look for a
skip<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.980> I've<00:03:32.099> got<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> skip<00:03:32.730> here<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.440> then

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
skip so I've got a skip here and then

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440 
skip so I've got a skip here and then
keep<00:03:34.859> up<00:03:35.010> again<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.609> tells<00:03:35.879> you<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> chord

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
keep up again and that tells you a chord

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.720 
keep up again and that tells you a chord
that<00:03:36.599> is<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:36.989> that's<00:03:37.170> C<00:03:37.470> for<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.040> one<00:03:38.280> chord<00:03:38.640> in

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
that is so that's C for the one chord in

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.789 
that is so that's C for the one chord in
this<00:03:38.879> key<00:03:39.120> works<00:03:39.420> with<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.989> melody<00:03:40.379> there

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
this key works with that melody there

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.190 
this key works with that melody there
because<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.670> melody<00:03:41.849> lands<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.690> those<00:03:42.870> notes

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
because the melody lands on those notes

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.259 
because the melody lands on those notes
quite<00:03:43.920> often<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:45.690> when<00:03:46.139> you<00:03:46.260> give<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.409> song<00:03:46.709> like

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
quite often so when you give a song like

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.979 
quite often so when you give a song like
Amazing<00:03:48.269> Grace<00:03:48.299> i'm<00:03:49.049> leds<00:03:49.470> pressed<00:03:49.889> down<00:03:50.099> and

see what happens if I move this G note

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.970 
see what happens if I move this G note
up<00:03:58.859> an<00:03:59.129> octave<00:03:59.569> it's<00:04:00.569> mo<00:04:01.260> what<00:04:01.680> do<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:01.829> know
