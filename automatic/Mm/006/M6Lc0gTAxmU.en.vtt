00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.370
 another player review and today it works 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.870
 to castro team of the season and me 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.460
 I decided to go with him 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.710
 to do a review because he is one 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.480
 of only four players at all 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.670
 score so shoot speed 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 dribbling the pending and physicists 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 There are more than 80 of them everywhere 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.990
 only four players in total of your castro 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.330
 vidal man of the match danilo second in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.500
 form and awnings team of the season 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
 that and how many players have this 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.119
 values ​​do not exist otherwise 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.619
 others heard in this gang and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.369
 that's why I really wanted to join him 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.630
 make a review 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.579
 yes, we'll take a look at his first 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.170
 ingame values ​​if that's more accurate 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.430
 then want to look at paused s.besten 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.469
 just the video you can do that 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.059
 right I read bet relative 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.090
 Going through quickly does not have a single one 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.610
 worth the red is 67 elfmeter is one 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.469
 bad value on the whole map and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.680
 otherwise quite a lot of green things 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.079
 96 Jumping force for example 96 out of 92 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.760
 vision 90 also with positioning thus the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.370
 are really crass values ​​above all 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.530
 95 in short passes 90 long passes so 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.820
 You can really get very good passes 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.320
 the midfield forward in the top 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.580
 play the game and so on 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.270
 So that's what it's really for 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.369
 right man 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.840
 And since he is such a good all-rounder 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.820
 you can still in really different 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 positions originally play az dm 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.900
 but you have both in zdf and in the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.119
 zm and also in z-construction so in the offensive 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.159
 Mittelfeld tried and must say 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.750
 that I see him in central midfield at 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.400
 best found here he comes both 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.110
 offensively as well as defensively very well 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.610
 validity came his dribbling as well 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.619
 his defense values ​​are perfect 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.150
 and you can see them right now 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.320
 You see, you are actually busy 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.030
 even with his dribbling and that 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 in my opinion is by far 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.689
 his strongest weapon on the offensive 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.299
 forties worth on the card is feels 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.470
 but in the game more like 95 of my 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.450
 opinion after so the ball sticks 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.860
 formally unbelievable at his foot 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.960
 Ball control really feels 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.340
 like there is messi and it is 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.630
 really madness so you can do that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.640
 Good with him past opponents 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 go and then yes several people always 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.829
 pull on and then pass good passes 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.710
 play in the front 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.659
 a pass worth 90 on the map 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.350
 really allow and that's very 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.390
 very cool 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.729
 That's why the passports are his 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.829
 second strongest weapon on the offensive 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.280
 I like to say it again 95 in short 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.509
 pass 90 long passes 92 vision so it 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.110
 Hardly a passport then not 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.459
 arrives 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.450
 Overall, it has been adjusted by 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.030
 average 6 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.379
 I had with him and really it was 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.550
 also some very difficult passes 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.319
 I have a couple of them right now 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.910
 scenes where you can see the then still on 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.200
 coming so yes he can his 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.610
 just very cool in 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.180
 scene sets that was right bock with him 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.739
 to play 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.090
 I do not have any skills at the beginning 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.130
 he said three stars and four 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.709
 star weak foot what really 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.750
 good working medium medium, I think 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.030
 is actually a zm best hai 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.950
 also good so high but medium 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.480
 Medium is yes I say actually 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.519
 even the perfect resourceful for one 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.810
 central midfielder and im 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.489
 moment sounds may be like this for you 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.410
 as if castro really was the perfect one 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.430
 offensive player but that's right 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.989
 Of course, not quite as he has 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.459
 also a few weaknesses for example is 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.590
 yes, not a good freestyle shooter i have 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.660
 tried several free kicks with him and 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.739
 there was almost nothing on the gate are 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.220
 all either over it or off 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.079
 went 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.370
 and when I compare with others 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.900
 player with one of the trees or something 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.190
 then try that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.840
 probability very high that the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.790
 Ball at least goes to the gate when I go 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.680
 even go in and all his 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.180
 biggest weakness that really makes him 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.400
 it almost makes them almost 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.959
 not as great as i find it and 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.420
 Although that is finishing or 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.829
 be he makes statements so little clean it 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.750
 has such a bad chance utilization 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.609
 it's almost it he really 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.799
 He often shoots bad things in front of the goal 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.269
 The goalkeeper every time directly and that 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.220
 is very very annoying and very 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.959
 frustrating because you have so many 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.459
 solo runs through his blatant dribbling 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.510
 but if it is then free from the gate 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.680
 difference only the goalkeeper and 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.569
 shoot him , it's easy 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.430
 damn annoying so much so too 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.959
 castros offensive services the whole 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.359
 strong again 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.819
 dribbling strong passes worse 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.079
 conclusion no standard shooter and 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.639
 that's what comes next 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.900
 bring defensive and there you can 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.630
 really do not complain to him at all 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.850
 only 172 tall and is still 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.109
 really strong so physically strong 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.549
 We have a scene like for example 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.470
 those at homovics from behind the ball 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.750
 hardly anyone else takes away 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.430
 that is just so small and actually where 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.040
 you expect it from nebra easy 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.660
 no castro is there and 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.670
 really takes the ball away defensively 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.200
 really strong wins almost everyone 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.750
 the tackle and also in terms of head balls 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.459
 I mean he's 172 large because wins 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.769
 while the large part of the header duels 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.880
 because 97 jump power is there 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.349
 there's this opponent more than 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.849
 a head bigger than the one who wins 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.470
 the headball duel anyway because he almost 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.250
 on the jump over it so you feel 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.229
 that at least 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.340
 I was a bit surprised, too 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.479
 I did not think the defensive 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.710
 Mittelfeld you can not bring that 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.630
 to play such a small player 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.160
 but by just jumping like that 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.360
 is that really okay and more 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.410
 you can be too defensive then actually 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.880
 not to say that anymore 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.710
 Just look at us for a moment 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.940
 castro in numbers expresses he is not 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.680
 the cheapest in that his team of 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.860
 the season player is 80 to 100 km up 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.030
 the xbox vazquez 250 to 400 posters on 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.120
 the playstation what then already 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.949
 significantly more gates per game had 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.319
 063 made an incident 032 incident 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.970
 So exactly one gate resp 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.280
 Gate template per game so always accurate 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.080
 one scorer point per game was adjusted 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.000
 86 percent I have already said pro 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.620
 game 21 which is less than maxime 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.090
 last time for example but for that 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.470
 arrive more and more of his passports and yes 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.669
 that 's it for this review 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.970
 I hope you turn on next time 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.970
 Clear again
