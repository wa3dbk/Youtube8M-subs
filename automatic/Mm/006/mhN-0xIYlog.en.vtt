 it is already golden brown so then when 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.640

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.000

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.360
 they improve thyme if they like some herb 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.420
 garlic will do very well 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.300
 the milk that is very important because it is 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.580
 which is going to give that flavor 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.350
 creaminess is very well important that 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.580

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.190

 It's already milk and it's good 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.980
 can put a little more salt if 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.010

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.070
 let it be reduced and consumed all the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.459
