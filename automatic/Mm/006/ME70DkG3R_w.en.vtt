really coming good look how fast this is
compared<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.640> might

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
compared to that one so you know I might

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
compared to that one so you know I might
have<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.450> separate<00:01:06.900> these<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.470> put

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
have to really separate these and put

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.020 
have to really separate these and put
them<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.070> your<00:01:08.460> own<00:01:08.840> containers<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.650> um<00:01:11.030> yeah

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030

see the leaves are really good the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.780 
see the leaves are really good the
leaves<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:39.960> green<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.400> tell<00:01:41.700> this

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
leaves are green and you can tell this

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.690 
leaves are green and you can tell this
is<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.970> fresh<00:01:42.390> leaf<00:01:43.100> because<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> color

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is a fresh leaf because of the color

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.510 
is a fresh leaf because of the color
it's<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> little<00:01:45.479> transient<00:01:46.250> not<00:01:47.250> really

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
it's like a little transient not really

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's like a little transient not really
transparent<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.390> light<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.869> color

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
transparent but it's very light in color

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.730 
transparent but it's very light in color
that's<00:01:49.860> how<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.310> tell<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.939> know<00:01:51.090> like

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
that's how you can tell you know like

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.840 
that's how you can tell you know like
there<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.700> tell

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
there you go so that's how you can tell

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.270 
there you go so that's how you can tell
if<00:01:54.000> your<00:01:54.210> tree<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.570> doing<00:01:54.899> good<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.070> see

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
if your tree is doing good if you see

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.450 
if your tree is doing good if you see
light<00:01:56.700> coloring<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.020> top<00:01:58.409> leaves<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.399> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
light coloring on the top leaves so you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.440 
light coloring on the top leaves so you
know<00:01:59.610> those<00:01:59.820> are<00:02:00.290> fresh<00:02:01.290> leaves<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:03.180> one

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
know those are fresh leaves so this one

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.830 
know those are fresh leaves so this one
right<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:04.520> my

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
right here are my

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.040 
right here are my
a<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:06.609> believe<00:02:07.609> oranges<00:02:08.239> I'm<00:02:08.629> not<00:02:08.840> quite<00:02:09.019> sure

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
a I believe oranges I'm not quite sure

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.419 
a I believe oranges I'm not quite sure
about<00:02:09.170> these<00:02:09.379> oranges<00:02:09.769> because<00:02:09.920> as<00:02:10.190> you<00:02:10.310> can

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
about these oranges because as you can

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.820 
about these oranges because as you can
see<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.269> seed<00:02:11.510> coating<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.080> it's<00:02:12.739> a

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
see this is the seed coating and it's a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.280 
see this is the seed coating and it's a
pretty<00:02:13.099> big<00:02:13.400> seed<00:02:13.640> coating<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.720> think<00:02:14.870> these

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
pretty big seed coating so I think these

one this is my grapefruit I have two

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.449 
one this is my grapefruit I have two
more<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.840> these<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.769> other<00:03:30.920> two<00:03:31.160> are<00:03:31.400> not

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
more of these and the other two are not

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.000 
more of these and the other two are not
really<00:03:31.940> doing<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.239> well<00:03:32.569> either<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.200> this

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
leaves and I think it's more than a

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.150 
leaves and I think it's more than a
couple<00:03:37.400> months<00:03:37.669> old<00:03:38.000> already<00:03:38.419> and<00:03:38.859> I'm<00:03:39.859> just
