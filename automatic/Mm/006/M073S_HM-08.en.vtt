we're going to end up with another
section<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.530> netting<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:20.340> two<00:02:20.730> three<00:02:21.180> you

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
section of the netting one two three you

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330 
section of the netting one two three you
can<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.690> how<00:02:21.810> I'm<00:02:21.959> holding<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.500> thin<00:02:22.830> needle

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
can see how I'm holding this thin needle

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.910 
can see how I'm holding this thin needle
so<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.360> direct<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.140> through<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.650> holes

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
so I can direct it in through the holes

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.000 
so I can direct it in through the holes
of<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.160> bead<00:02:26.340> there's<00:02:26.819> six<00:02:27.180> gold<00:02:27.620> one<00:02:28.620> black

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
of the bead there's six gold one black

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.250 
of the bead there's six gold one black
and<00:02:29.420> six<00:02:30.420> gold<00:02:32.209> it's<00:02:33.209> really<00:02:33.690> important<00:02:34.170> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and six gold it's really important to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.530 
and six gold it's really important to
have<00:02:34.410> these<00:02:34.700> cylinder<00:02:35.700> beads<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> nice

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
have these cylinder beads with the nice

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.230 
have these cylinder beads with the nice
even<00:02:37.050> holes<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.610> get<00:02:38.760> my<00:02:38.910> needle

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
even holes so that I can get my needle

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.980 
even holes so that I can get my needle
and<00:02:39.330> thread<00:02:39.660> through

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
and thread through

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.590 
and thread through
there<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:41.130> uniformity<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.060> cylinder

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
there the uniformity of the cylinder

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.680 
there the uniformity of the cylinder
beads<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:43.020> really<00:02:43.380> fantastic<00:02:43.790> now<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.480> looks

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
beads is really fantastic now it looks

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
like I strung two black beads on there

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.460 
like I strung two black beads on there
by<00:02:47.790> mistake<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.720> now<00:02:48.840> I'm<00:02:49.050> gonna<00:02:49.260> leave

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
by mistake but for now I'm gonna leave

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.410 
by mistake but for now I'm gonna leave
it<00:02:49.620> there

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
we started here with this shape and we

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.610 
we started here with this shape and we
came<00:03:21.240> down<00:03:21.420> through<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.900> little<00:03:22.110> point<00:03:22.380> and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
came down through the little point and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.900 
came down through the little point and
up<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.840> first<00:03:25.200> shape<00:03:25.530> we<00:03:25.560> did<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.700> we

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
up that was the first shape we did so we

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.460 
up that was the first shape we did so we
had<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.330> done<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.780> we<00:03:30.930> came<00:03:31.140> up<00:03:31.320> and

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
had that done and we came up and

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.430 
had that done and we came up and
remember<00:03:31.800> we<00:03:31.950> added<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:33.120> six<00:03:33.360> gold<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.890 
remember we added the six gold and the
little<00:03:34.650> gold<00:03:34.890> tip<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.400> came<00:03:35.730> down<00:03:36.060> here's

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
little gold tip and came down here's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.350 
little gold tip and came down here's
where<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:37.320> are<00:03:37.350> now<00:03:37.790> we're<00:03:38.790> creating<00:03:39.240> that

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
where we are now we're creating that

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.900 
where we are now we're creating that
second<00:03:39.900> half<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.500> diamond<00:03:40.710> going<00:03:41.370> through

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
second half of the diamond going through

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.600 
second half of the diamond going through
the<00:03:42.180> black<00:03:42.420> bead<00:03:42.920> down<00:03:43.920> through<00:03:44.310> your<00:03:44.430> back

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
the black bead down through your back

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.120 
the black bead down through your back
bead<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.330> around<00:03:46.230> through<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.710> little<00:03:46.920> gold

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
bead and around through the little gold

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.280 
bead and around through the little gold
tip<00:03:47.460> and<00:03:47.760> we're<00:03:48.150> going<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.300> continue<00:03:48.570> just

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
tip and we're going to continue just

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.980 
tip and we're going to continue just
that<00:03:49.500> way<00:03:49.740> so<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.520> can<00:03:50.790> see<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.420> you're

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
that way so you can see that you're

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.330 
that way so you can see that you're
forming<00:03:52.500> these<00:03:52.680> diamond<00:03:53.310> shapes<00:03:53.340> just<00:03:55.340> like

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
forming these diamond shapes just like

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.750 
forming these diamond shapes just like
that<00:03:56.900> around<00:03:57.900> through<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.560> tip<00:03:58.800> the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
that around through the tip the

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.700 
that around through the tip the
variations<00:04:00.420> are<00:04:00.600> endless<00:04:01.080> when<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.500> do

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
variations are endless when you do

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.950 
variations are endless when you do
netting<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.370> want<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.240> come<00:04:03.390> over<00:04:03.540> here<00:04:03.840> and

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
netting I want to come over here and

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.260 
netting I want to come over here and
show<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.200> some<00:04:04.500> examples<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.840> netting<00:04:07.260> the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
show you some examples the netting the

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.800 
show you some examples the netting the
netting<00:04:09.270> here<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.960> can<00:04:10.140> see<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:11.630> uses<00:04:12.630> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
netting here you can see is uses the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.440 
netting here you can see is uses the
gold<00:04:13.050> beads<00:04:13.380> as<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.950> big<00:04:14.130> beads<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.790> the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
gold beads as the big beads and the

gold beads as the big beads and the
black<00:04:15.660> beads<00:04:15.960> as<00:04:16.170> little<00:04:16.470> beads<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.920> I've

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
black beads as little beads and I've

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.220 
black beads as little beads and I've
made<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.460> lot<00:04:17.640> wider<00:04:18.000> so<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.840> can<00:04:19.020> keep

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
made it a lot wider so you can keep

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.650 
made it a lot wider so you can keep
doing<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:20.040> had<00:04:20.400> short<00:04:20.670> beads<00:04:21.000> in<00:04:21.210> my<00:04:21.359> demo

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
doing that I had short beads in my demo

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.170 
doing that I had short beads in my demo
on<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.740> mat<00:04:22.950> here<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.460> can<00:04:23.640> see<00:04:23.820> some<00:04:24.060> other

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
on the mat here you can see some other

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.090 
on the mat here you can see some other
variations<00:04:25.050> where<00:04:25.560> I've<00:04:25.710> used<00:04:25.740> different

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
variations where I've used different

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.940 
variations where I've used different
colors<00:04:26.790> different<00:04:27.510> colors<00:04:28.080> in<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.380> tips<00:04:28.680> and
