00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
know at first we heard that if you just

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.630 
know at first we heard that if you just
go<00:00:34.750> into<00:00:34.929> a<00:00:35.079> chunk<00:00:35.469> that<00:00:35.769> had<00:00:36.010> never<00:00:36.190> loaded

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.160 
want it to have all the 1.8 features
there<00:01:06.100> are<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.250> few<00:01:06.490> fairly<00:01:07.300> easy<00:01:07.510> things<00:01:07.900> that

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
there are a few fairly easy things that

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.950 
there are a few fairly easy things that
you<00:01:08.260> can<00:01:08.410> do<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:09.640> what<00:01:10.120> we<00:01:10.270> need<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.540> do<00:01:10.660> is

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
you can do one what we need to do is

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.090 
you can do one what we need to do is
figure<00:01:11.230> out<00:01:11.410> what<00:01:12.130> your<00:01:12.190> world<00:01:12.640> seed<00:01:13.060> is<00:01:14.100> now

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
figure out what your world seed is now

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.020 
figure out what your world seed is now
1.8<00:01:15.910> I<00:01:16.300> believe<00:01:16.870> if<00:01:17.290> you<00:01:17.560> push<00:01:17.770> f3<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.460> 1.8

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
1.8 I believe if you push f3 and 1.8

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.090 
1.8 I believe if you push f3 and 1.8
over<00:01:19.810> on<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.050> left<00:01:20.290> it<00:01:20.500> will<00:01:20.620> actually<00:01:20.770> tell

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
over on the left it will actually tell

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.970 
over on the left it will actually tell
you<00:01:21.160> what<00:01:21.610> your<00:01:21.850> minecraft<00:01:22.420> seed<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:22.960> so<00:01:23.620> if

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
you what your minecraft seed is so if

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.890 
you what your minecraft seed is so if
that's<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.460> case<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:25.030> will<00:01:25.090> be<00:01:25.150> very<00:01:25.480> easy<00:01:25.720> to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
that's the case it will be very easy to

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.800 
that's the case it will be very easy to
figure<00:01:26.140> out<00:01:26.260> what<00:01:26.470> your<00:01:26.590> seed<00:01:26.800> is<00:01:27.120> if<00:01:28.120> not<00:01:28.510> I

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
figure out what your seed is if not I

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.280 
figure out what your seed is if not I
will<00:01:28.990> put<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.560> link<00:01:29.800> in<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.070> description<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:31.290> to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
will put a link in the description to to

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.690 
will put a link in the description to to
a<00:01:32.320> tool<00:01:32.620> that<00:01:32.920> you<00:01:32.980> can<00:01:33.190> basically<00:01:33.400> download

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
a tool that you can basically download

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.400 
a tool that you can basically download
it's<00:01:34.210> it's<00:01:34.450> not<00:01:34.690> anything<00:01:35.080> you<00:01:35.170> have<00:01:35.320> to

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
it's it's not anything you have to

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.050 
it's it's not anything you have to
install<00:01:35.770> but<00:01:36.220> it's<00:01:36.370> really<00:01:36.520> easy<00:01:36.670> it'll

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
install but it's really easy it'll

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.880 
install but it's really easy it'll
basically<00:01:37.210> just<00:01:37.660> tell<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:37.990> what<00:01:38.230> the<00:01:38.260> seed<00:01:38.620> is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
basically just tell you what the seed is

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.890 
basically just tell you what the seed is
for<00:01:39.430> all<00:01:39.580> of<00:01:39.820> your<00:01:40.030> different<00:01:40.540> worlds<00:01:40.840> that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
for all of your different worlds that

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.350 
for all of your different worlds that
you<00:01:41.020> have<00:01:41.230> all<00:01:41.440> your<00:01:41.590> different<00:01:42.010> Maps<00:01:42.360> then

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
you have all your different Maps then

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.440 
you have all your different Maps then
secondly<00:01:44.140> once<00:01:44.620> we<00:01:44.860> create<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> fresh<00:01:46.150> map

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
secondly once we create a fresh map

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.840 
secondly once we create a fresh map
using<00:01:47.110> your<00:01:47.260> world<00:01:47.500> seed<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.490> basically

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
using your world seed so basically

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.120 
using your world seed so basically
everything<00:01:49.420> all<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.960> mountains<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.770> and

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
everything all the mountains and and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.120 
everything all the mountains and and
everything<00:01:51.610> will<00:01:51.730> show<00:01:51.970> up<00:01:52.180> with<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.320> new<00:01:53.470> 1.8

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
everything will show up with the new 1.8

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.640 
everything will show up with the new 1.8
terrain<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:55.960> we'll<00:01:56.080> do<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.410> basically

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
terrain then what we'll do is basically

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.880 
terrain then what we'll do is basically
show<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.070> how<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.460> use<00:01:58.030> mcedit<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:59.200> copy<00:01:59.590> in

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
show you how to use mcedit to copy in

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.370 
show you how to use mcedit to copy in
either<00:02:00.310> your<00:02:00.490> buildings<00:02:01.150> or<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.510> large<00:02:02.110> chunk

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
either your buildings or a large chunk

the left there is a name of your of your

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.400 
the left there is a name of your of your
saves<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.610> mine's<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.660> called<00:02:36.840> new<00:02:37.020> world<00:02:37.230> I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
saves so mine's just called new world I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.740 
saves so mine's just called new world I
never<00:02:37.470> changed<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.370> there's<00:02:39.330> new<00:02:39.540> world

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
never changed it so there's new world

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.060 
never changed it so there's new world
and<00:02:39.990> then<00:02:40.140> there's<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.440> world<00:02:40.590> seed<00:02:40.890> number

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
and then there's the world seed number

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.130 
and then there's the world seed number
so<00:02:41.610> basically<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.330> need<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.570> copy<00:02:42.810> that

so basically you just need to copy that
world<00:02:43.380> seed<00:02:43.710> number<00:02:44.240> over<00:02:45.980> then<00:02:46.980> what<00:02:47.160> you

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
world seed number over then what you

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.250 
world seed number over then what you
need<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.520> do<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.880> go<00:02:48.060> back<00:02:48.090> into<00:02:48.450> minecraft<00:02:49.020> and

rename<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:52.010> blank<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:55.010> then<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.310> create

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
rename this blank and then you create

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.320 
rename this blank and then you create
the<00:02:56.880> new<00:02:56.910> world<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.630> your<00:02:58.200> old<00:02:58.410> world<00:02:58.710> will<00:02:59.430> be

the new world and your old world will be
created<00:03:00.750> fresh<00:03:01.050> in<00:03:01.350> 1.8<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:03.660> only<00:03:03.930> difference

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
created fresh in 1.8 the only difference

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.170 
created fresh in 1.8 the only difference
obviously<00:03:04.410> will<00:03:04.830> be<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.460> don't<00:03:05.940> have

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180

large<00:04:00.960> as<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.230> want<00:04:01.260> oh<00:04:01.770> you<00:04:02.550> know<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.760> can

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
large as you want oh you know you can

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.660 
large as you want oh you know you can
copy<00:04:03.270> an<00:04:03.660> entire<00:04:03.900> area<00:04:04.500> if<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.680> want<00:04:04.860> but<00:04:05.580> it

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
copy an entire area if you want but it

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.400 
copy an entire area if you want but it
does<00:04:05.820> take<00:04:06.060> some<00:04:06.090> computing<00:04:06.780> power<00:04:06.990> so<00:04:07.350> you

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
does take some computing power so you

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.320 
does take some computing power so you
want<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.740> make<00:04:07.860> sure<00:04:07.890> your<00:04:08.760> computer<00:04:08.970> can

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
want to make sure your computer can

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.420 
want to make sure your computer can
handle<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.810> because<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.830> does<00:04:11.040> take<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.310> while

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
handle it because it does take a while

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.680 
handle it because it does take a while
to<00:04:11.820> process<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:14.820> controls<00:04:15.360> are<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.540> little

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
to process so the controls are a little

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.570 
to process so the controls are a little
quirky<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.380> move<00:04:16.620> around<00:04:16.739> using<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.310> same

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
quirky you move around using the same

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.289 
quirky you move around using the same
controls<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.150> do<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.330> Minecraft<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.930> W

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
controls that you do in Minecraft the W

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.100 
controls that you do in Minecraft the W
ASD<00:04:20.069> Keys<00:04:21.069> and<00:04:21.459> then<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:22.419> if<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:22.900> right-click

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
ASD Keys and then you if you right-click

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.350 
ASD Keys and then you if you right-click
it'll<00:04:23.740> stop<00:04:23.979> wiggling<00:04:24.400> around<00:04:24.699> and<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.210> can

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
it'll stop wiggling around and you can

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.420 
it'll stop wiggling around and you can
just<00:04:25.569> have<00:04:25.930> a<00:04:25.960> cursor<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:26.979> can<00:04:27.159> select

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
just have a cursor and you can select

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.730 
just have a cursor and you can select
things<00:04:27.849> so<00:04:28.000> I'm<00:04:28.210> going<00:04:28.479> to<00:04:28.599> just<00:04:29.050> select<00:04:29.259> kind

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
things so I'm going to just select kind

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.760 
things so I'm going to just select kind
of<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:30.009> big<00:04:30.460> chunk<00:04:30.810> here<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:31.990> then<00:04:32.470> what<00:04:32.650> you

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
of a big chunk here and then what you

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.719 
of a big chunk here and then what you
can<00:04:32.889> do<00:04:33.099> is<00:04:33.340> adjust<00:04:34.180> your<00:04:34.810> selection<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.889> you

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
can do is adjust your selection so you

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.260 
can do is adjust your selection so you
just<00:04:36.940> basically<00:04:37.120> drag<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:38.020> box<00:04:38.229> around<00:04:38.440> and

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
just basically drag the box around and

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.570 
just basically drag the box around and
then<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.509> can<00:04:40.690> move<00:04:41.349> it<00:04:41.470> around<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:42.069> select

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
then you can move it around and select

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.070 
then you can move it around and select
whatever<00:04:42.819> it<00:04:43.090> is<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.389> you<00:04:43.479> want<00:04:43.629> to<00:04:43.690> select

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
whatever it is that you want to select

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.330 
whatever it is that you want to select
now<00:04:44.560> I'm<00:04:44.680> not<00:04:44.860> going<00:04:44.949> to<00:04:45.009> worry<00:04:45.220> about

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
now I'm not going to worry about

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.300 
now I'm not going to worry about
selecting<00:04:46.090> everything<00:04:46.690> here<00:04:47.159> because<00:04:48.159> this

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
selecting everything here because this

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.879 
selecting everything here because this
is<00:04:48.460> just<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.729> demo<00:04:49.060> but<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.780> know<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:49.930> I<00:04:50.349> could<00:04:50.680> go

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
is just a demo but you know I I could go

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.510 
is just a demo but you know I I could go
down<00:04:51.069> under<00:04:51.460> here<00:04:51.669> and<00:04:51.940> select<00:04:52.210> my<00:04:52.389> mind<00:04:52.719> and

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
down under here and select my mind and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.149 
down under here and select my mind and
let's<00:04:54.520> see<00:04:54.819> all<00:04:56.039> that<00:04:58.169> okay<00:04:59.169> so<00:04:59.229> it<00:04:59.770> takes<00:04:59.979> a

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
let's see all that okay so it takes a

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.730 
let's see all that okay so it takes a
little<00:05:00.690> working<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.870> get<00:05:02.169> where<00:05:02.349> you<00:05:02.469> want<00:05:02.650> to

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
little working to get where you want to

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.629 
little working to get where you want to
to<00:05:03.280> be<00:05:03.490> but<00:05:03.849> let's<00:05:04.360> say<00:05:04.569> this<00:05:04.870> were<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:06.400> entire

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
to be but let's say this were the entire

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.369 
to be but let's say this were the entire
thing<00:05:06.969> that<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.210> wanted<00:05:07.509> to<00:05:07.719> copy<00:05:10.139> you<00:05:11.139> can

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
thing that I wanted to copy you can

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.409 
thing that I wanted to copy you can
click<00:05:11.620> export<00:05:12.310> schematic<00:05:12.969> over<00:05:13.389> here<00:05:13.629> and

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
click export schematic over here and

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.010 
click export schematic over here and
this<00:05:16.419> window

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
this window

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.320 
this window
I<00:05:17.050> don't<00:05:17.349> think<00:05:17.440> pops<00:05:17.770> up<00:05:18.009> in<00:05:18.129> fraps<00:05:18.430> but<00:05:18.819> I'm

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
I don't think pops up in fraps but I'm

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.129 
I don't think pops up in fraps but I'm
going<00:05:19.569> to<00:05:19.629> save<00:05:20.639> save<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:22.180> selection<00:05:22.690> and

give it a name okay now now I need to
close<00:05:28.779> this<00:05:28.840> world<00:05:29.409> and<00:05:29.770> open<00:05:30.310> up<00:05:30.430> my<00:05:31.000> new

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
close this world and open up my new

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.589 
close this world and open up my new
world<00:05:31.599> which<00:05:32.050> is<00:05:32.229> blank<00:05:32.949> I<00:05:33.340> named<00:05:33.940> it<00:05:34.060> blank<00:05:34.360> so

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
world which is blank I named it blank so

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.300 
world which is blank I named it blank so
this<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:34.870> that<00:05:35.020> world<00:05:35.289> without<00:05:35.590> anything<00:05:36.190> in

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
this is that world without anything in

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.939 
this is that world without anything in
it<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.669> now<00:05:37.569> I<00:05:37.599> need<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.110> import<00:05:38.620> that

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
it and now I need to import that

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.189 
it and now I need to import that
schematic<00:05:39.279> and<00:05:39.789> paste<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.449> into<00:05:40.659> this<00:05:40.960> world

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
schematic and paste it into this world

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.999 
schematic and paste it into this world
so<00:05:41.680> you<00:05:41.740> go<00:05:41.919> down<00:05:42.099> here<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:42.520> click<00:05:42.960> import<00:05:44.009> I'm

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
so you go down here and click import I'm

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.010 
so you go down here and click import I'm
going<00:05:45.699> to<00:05:45.849> select<00:05:46.060> I<00:05:46.569> named<00:05:46.900> it<00:05:47.110> first<00:05:48.099> home

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
going to select I named it first home

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.320 
going to select I named it first home
okay<00:05:50.020> so<00:05:50.080> here's<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.560> schematic<00:05:50.889> now<00:05:51.639> this<00:05:52.029> it

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
okay so here's the schematic now this it

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.019 
okay so here's the schematic now this it
may<00:05:52.719> seem<00:05:52.990> really<00:05:53.379> difficult<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:53.889> use<00:05:54.000> what<00:05:55.000> I

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
may seem really difficult to use what I

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.050 
may seem really difficult to use what I
recommend<00:05:55.569> is<00:05:55.719> just<00:05:55.960> placing<00:05:56.919> you<00:05:57.279> left-click

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
recommend is just placing you left-click

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.600 
recommend is just placing you left-click
it<00:05:58.479> basically<00:05:59.409> anywhere<00:05:59.919> just<00:06:00.129> make<00:06:00.340> sure<00:06:00.460> you

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
it basically anywhere just make sure you

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.390 
it basically anywhere just make sure you
can<00:06:00.759> see<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.300> selection<00:06:01.659> ok<00:06:02.169> so<00:06:02.409> right<00:06:03.250> now

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
can see the selection ok so right now

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.089 
can see the selection ok so right now
mcedit<00:06:03.909> is<00:06:04.090> basically<00:06:04.409> going<00:06:05.409> to<00:06:05.500> paste<00:06:05.800> this

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
mcedit is basically going to paste this

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.920 
mcedit is basically going to paste this
in<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:06.400> middle<00:06:06.550> of<00:06:06.669> the<00:06:06.789> air<00:06:06.969> so<00:06:07.509> we<00:06:07.750> don't

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
in the middle of the air so we don't

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.730 
in the middle of the air so we don't
want<00:06:08.229> that<00:06:08.520> what<00:06:09.520> we<00:06:09.639> need<00:06:09.819> to<00:06:09.969> do<00:06:10.150> is<00:06:10.440> use<00:06:11.440> the

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
want that what we need to do is use the

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.249 
want that what we need to do is use the
nudge<00:06:12.219> tool<00:06:12.550> over<00:06:12.849> here<00:06:12.969> so<00:06:13.539> you<00:06:13.599> hold<00:06:13.990> down

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
nudge tool over here so you hold down

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.820 
nudge tool over here so you hold down
your<00:06:14.289> left<00:06:14.710> click<00:06:15.310> button<00:06:15.460> and<00:06:15.819> then<00:06:16.240> use<00:06:16.509> your

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
your left click button and then use your

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.140 
your left click button and then use your
WASD<00:06:18.029> keys<00:06:19.029> to<00:06:19.569> adjust<00:06:19.990> the

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
WASD keys to adjust the

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.780 
WASD keys to adjust the
the<00:06:21.210> area<00:06:21.930> you<00:06:22.320> know<00:06:22.440> adjust<00:06:23.130> where<00:06:23.400> this<00:06:23.580> is

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
the area you know adjust where this is

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.900 
the area you know adjust where this is
and<00:06:24.090> then<00:06:24.210> to<00:06:24.360> go<00:06:24.480> up<00:06:24.690> or<00:06:24.870> down<00:06:24.900> you<00:06:25.350> use<00:06:25.500> Q<00:06:25.890> or<00:06:26.220> Z

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
and then to go up or down you use Q or Z

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.940 
and then to go up or down you use Q or Z
so<00:06:27.450> I'm<00:06:27.690> pushing<00:06:27.900> Z<00:06:28.260> right<00:06:28.440> now<00:06:28.620> and<00:06:28.830> it's

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
so I'm pushing Z right now and it's

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.220 
so I'm pushing Z right now and it's
lowering<00:06:29.370> okay<00:06:30.270> so<00:06:30.870> basically<00:06:31.490> I<00:06:32.490> know<00:06:32.880> I<00:06:33.600> know

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
lowering okay so basically I know I know

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.250 
lowering okay so basically I know I know
