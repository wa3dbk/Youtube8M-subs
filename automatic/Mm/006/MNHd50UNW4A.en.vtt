and try to paint these like dark edges

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.470 
and try to paint these like dark edges
but<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.310> kind<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.700> like<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.060> way<00:01:58.150> that<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.450> looks

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
but I kind of like the way that it looks

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.600 
but I kind of like the way that it looks
with<00:01:59.020> like<00:01:59.230> the<00:01:59.380> paint<00:01:59.620> kind<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.130> splattered

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
with like the paint kind of splattered

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.980 
with like the paint kind of splattered
on<00:02:00.900> because<00:02:01.900> they<00:02:02.020> finish<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.560> edges<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:04.240> I

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
on because they finish the edges but I

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.170 
on because they finish the edges but I
just<00:02:05.200> kind<00:02:05.410> of<00:02:05.440> like<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.770> rough<00:02:05.980> look<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:06.940> it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
just kind of like the rough look that it

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.749 
just kind of like the rough look that it
has<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.289> think<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.069> going<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.280> be<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
has so I think this is going to be the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.870 
has so I think this is going to be the
last<00:02:10.179> paint<00:02:11.140> layer<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.160> put<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.430> for<00:02:12.760> right
