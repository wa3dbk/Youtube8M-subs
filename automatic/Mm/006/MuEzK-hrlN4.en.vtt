00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.030 
can actually do this honestly there's no
really<00:02:07.500> wrong<00:02:07.770> way<00:02:08.070> I<00:02:09.500> tried<00:02:10.500> them<00:02:10.710> all<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
really wrong way I tried them all and

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.750 
really wrong way I tried them all and
this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.970> best<00:02:12.180> one<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.480> works<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.990> me

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
this is the best one that works for me

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.890 
this is the best one that works for me
so<00:02:14.760> I'm<00:02:14.850> just<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.210> put<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> char<00:02:15.750> cloth

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
so I'm just going to put the char cloth

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.210 
so I'm just going to put the char cloth
on<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.290> leg<00:02:17.660> cut<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.930> striker<00:02:19.500> there<00:02:19.860> now<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
on the leg cut the striker there now the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
on the leg cut the striker there now the
idea<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:22.170> chip<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.250> piece<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.700> metal<00:02:24.090> off

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
idea is to chip a piece of the metal off

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.449 
idea is to chip a piece of the metal off
with<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.230> flint<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.650> that's<00:02:25.890> what<00:02:26.070> makes<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
with the flint and that's what makes the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.600 
with the flint and that's what makes the
spark<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.660> we<00:02:28.050> use<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:29.160> little<00:02:29.340> work

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
spark so I think we use this little work

00:02:29.610 --> 00:04:14.180 
spark so I think we use this little work
what's<00:02:30.090> good<00:02:30.330> let's<00:02:31.230> try<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.680> person

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.740 

well<00:04:15.190> there<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.400> go<00:04:15.520> friends<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.239> do<00:04:16.300> believe

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
well there you go friends I do believe

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.979 
well there you go friends I do believe
we<00:04:16.989> have<00:04:17.230> a<00:04:17.760> self-sustaining<00:04:18.760> fire<00:04:19.030> but<00:04:19.810> going

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
we have a self-sustaining fire but going

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.650 
we have a self-sustaining fire but going
to<00:04:20.050> lie<00:04:20.170> to<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.530> took<00:04:20.709> me<00:04:20.920> a<00:04:20.950> little<00:04:21.100> while

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
to lie to you it took me a little while

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.410 
to lie to you it took me a little while
but<00:04:22.660> eventually<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.440> got<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.830> started<00:04:24.420> but

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
but eventually I got it started but

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.980 
but eventually I got it started but
