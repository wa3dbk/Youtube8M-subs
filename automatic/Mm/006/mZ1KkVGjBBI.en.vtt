 in Europe 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.169
 due to ecuador 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.890
 tree is always used for 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.289
 manufacturing holiday jubilee and garden 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.259
 utensils 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.849
 the key to a long successful service was and 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.210
 timely care left 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.480
 impregnation of wooden products under pressure 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.820
 reliably protects their associations 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.539
 but over time they flourish get dirty 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.440
 their surface cracks under 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.119
 exposure to seasonal fluctuations 

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.980
 temperatures 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.170
 of its importance

 apply on old surface 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.160
 hypochloride is not the composition of homin on st and you 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.830
 hold for 15 minutes 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.730
 for items that serve us 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.010
 year-round outdoors 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.010
 care should be taken especially carefully 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.890
 then remove the dirt with a brush with 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.210
 stiff bristle and rinse with water 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.000
 more effective exercise under

 compresses 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.159
 in this example we see that the surface 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.350
 after processing the course of the search looks 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.480
 almost like new 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.970
 prior to processing give dyed 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.780
 dry thoroughly 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.700
 if as a result of washing the fibers 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.780
 the woods rose and the surface became 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.170
 rough to the touch 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.860
 it is recommended to polish it 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.160
 sandpaper 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.590
 and remove dust 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.640
 further wooden surface can 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.870
 process sacred puppy antiseptic

 with such 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.530
 the very name of the composition suggests that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.650
 antiseptic after application attached
