00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
the door hinges had sagged which meant

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.080 
the door hinges had sagged which meant
the<00:02:19.440> door<00:02:19.680> would<00:02:19.920> drop<00:02:20.159> down<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.489> little<00:02:20.700> bit

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the door would drop down a little bit

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.009 
the door would drop down a little bit
back<00:02:22.019> at<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> back<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.220> notice

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
back at the back here and if you notice

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.410 
back at the back here and if you notice
there's<00:02:25.019> some<00:02:25.170> wear<00:02:25.379> marks<00:02:25.830> on<00:02:26.010> there<00:02:26.420> which

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
there's some wear marks on there which

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.149 
there's some wear marks on there which
is<00:02:27.599> normal<00:02:28.019> for<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.230> latch<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.409> come<00:02:28.799> in<00:02:28.950> and

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
is normal for the latch to come in and

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.569 
is normal for the latch to come in and
contact<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.940> pin<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:31.530> right<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.829> here<00:02:32.220> you

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
contact this pin but right in here you

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.940 
contact this pin but right in here you
notice<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.909> little<00:02:33.120> shiny<00:02:33.360> place<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.110> that's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
notice a little shiny place and that's

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.009 
notice a little shiny place and that's
where<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.220> door<00:02:35.430> hinges<00:02:35.909> sag<00:02:36.269> down<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.930> it

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
where the door hinges sag down and it

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.080 
where the door hinges sag down and it
causes<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.530> door<00:02:37.769> latch<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.220> kind<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.489> drag<00:02:38.819> on

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
causes the door latch to kind of drag on

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.539 
causes the door latch to kind of drag on
that<00:02:39.150> surface<00:02:39.569> there<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.950> really<00:02:41.190> sucks

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
that surface there and it really sucks

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.360 
that surface there and it really sucks
because<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.909> makes<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.269> seem<00:02:42.659> like<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.900> cheap

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
because it makes it seem like a cheap

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.119 
because it makes it seem like a cheap
truck<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.579> know<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.769> look<00:02:46.920> over<00:02:47.099> here

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
truck you know and so you look over here

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.910 
truck you know and so you look over here
at<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> latch

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
at the latch

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.289 
at the latch
the<00:02:49.920> latch<00:02:50.099> is<00:02:50.129> in<00:02:50.400> pretty<00:02:50.549> good<00:02:50.640> condition

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
the latch is in pretty good condition

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.500 
the latch is in pretty good condition
but<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.109> know<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.799> pin<00:02:53.700> will<00:02:53.940> actually<00:02:54.239> drag

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
but you know that pin will actually drag

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.229 
but you know that pin will actually drag
right<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.049> here<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:56.370> when<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.879> open<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
right up in here and when you open and

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.670 
right up in here and when you open and
close<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.420> door<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.840> makes<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.140> hard<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.379> open

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
close the door it makes it hard to open

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.289 
close the door it makes it hard to open
and<00:02:58.799> close<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.310> kind<00:02:59.489> of<00:02:59.579> scratches<00:03:00.120> and

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
and close and it kind of scratches and

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.300 
and close and it kind of scratches and
makes<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.540> crappy<00:03:00.780> noise<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.530> doesn't<00:03:01.680> close

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
makes a crappy noise and doesn't close

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.479 
makes a crappy noise and doesn't close
really<00:03:02.640> right<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.959> my<00:03:04.680> mother<00:03:04.920> actually<00:03:05.129> had

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
really right so my mother actually had

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.839 
really right so my mother actually had
the<00:03:05.790> same<00:03:06.030> vehicle<00:03:06.540> as<00:03:06.659> this<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.640> she<00:03:08.640> went<00:03:08.790> to

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
the same vehicle as this and she went to

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:09.890 
the same vehicle as this and she went to
the<00:03:08.970> trouble<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.299> taking<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the trouble of taking it to the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.410 
the trouble of taking it to the
dealership<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.730> they<00:03:11.730> actually<00:03:11.909> took<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
dealership and they actually took the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.410 
dealership and they actually took the
door<00:03:12.599> off<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:13.109> replaced<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.799> hinges<00:03:14.420> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
door off and replaced the hinges the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.539 
door off and replaced the hinges the
hinges<00:03:15.840> are<00:03:15.989> welded<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.709> body<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.340> don't

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
hinges are welded to the body so I don't

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.089 
hinges are welded to the body so I don't
know<00:03:17.700> how<00:03:17.910> how<00:03:18.569> much<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.019> job<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.290> was<00:03:19.769> but

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
know how how much of a job that was but

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.039 
know how how much of a job that was but
anyway<00:03:20.280> she<00:03:20.790> went<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.090> trouble<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.599> cost

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
anyway she went to the trouble and cost

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.470 
anyway she went to the trouble and cost
of<00:03:22.319> getting<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.880> getting<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:23.970> repaired

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
of getting that getting that repaired

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.069 
of getting that getting that repaired
but<00:03:25.470> what<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.650> did<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.940> actually<00:03:27.480> placed<00:03:27.900> some

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
but what I did I actually placed some

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.890 
but what I did I actually placed some
washers<00:03:28.700> underneath<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.879> bottom<00:03:30.239> hinge<00:03:30.540> and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
washers underneath the bottom hinge and

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.780 
washers underneath the bottom hinge and
it<00:03:31.319> seemed<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.620> work<00:03:31.680> really<00:03:32.129> great<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.700> if

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
it seemed to work really great and if

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.099 
it seemed to work really great and if
they've<00:03:33.120> been<00:03:33.239> in<00:03:33.299> there<00:03:33.510> forever

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
they've been in there forever

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.839 
they've been in there forever
and<00:03:34.650> I've<00:03:34.769> never<00:03:34.919> experienced<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.609> door

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
and I've never experienced the door

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.780 
and I've never experienced the door
sagging<00:03:36.450> or<00:03:36.569> scratching<00:03:37.139> or<00:03:37.639> sagging<00:03:38.639> down

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
sagging or scratching or sagging down

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.420 
sagging or scratching or sagging down
anymore<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:40.500> got<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> light<00:03:40.889> here<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.340> I'll

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
anymore and I got a light here and I'll

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.210 
anymore and I got a light here and I'll
show<00:03:41.639> you<00:03:41.700> what<00:03:41.940> I'm<00:03:42.030> talking<00:03:42.359> about<00:03:42.419> right

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.240 
show you what I'm talking about right
here<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.310> this<00:03:44.430> bottom<00:03:44.849> hinge<00:03:45.889> you'll<00:03:46.889> notice

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
here on this bottom hinge you'll notice

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.619 
here on this bottom hinge you'll notice
that<00:03:47.430> there's<00:03:47.639> a<00:03:47.699> hinge<00:03:47.940> pin<00:03:48.030> there<00:03:50.419> this<00:03:51.419> is

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
that there's a hinge pin there this is

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.050 
that there's a hinge pin there this is
the<00:03:51.750> top<00:03:52.010> top<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.280> hinge<00:03:53.459> pin<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.879> just

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
the top top of the hinge pin it just

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.920 
the top top of the hinge pin it just
kind<00:03:54.299> of<00:03:54.419> goes<00:03:55.260> into<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.669> neural<00:03:56.669> and<00:03:57.030> they

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
kind of goes into a neural and they

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.439 
kind of goes into a neural and they
hammer<00:03:58.199> down<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.709> there<00:03:59.030> goes<00:04:00.030> through<00:04:00.329> this

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
hammer down in there goes through this

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.569 
hammer down in there goes through this
this<00:04:01.019> part<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:01.440> hinge<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.829> connected<00:04:02.549> to

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
this part of the hinge is connected to

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.619 
this part of the hinge is connected to
the<00:04:02.790> body<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.359> then<00:04:04.109> that<00:04:04.260> goes<00:04:04.440> down<00:04:04.680> here<00:04:05.220> in

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
the body and then that goes down here in

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.650 
the body and then that goes down here in
the<00:04:06.629> actual<00:04:06.959> hinge<00:04:07.349> on<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> door<00:04:08.389> this<00:04:09.389> piece

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
the actual hinge on the door this piece

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.439 
the actual hinge on the door this piece
and<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:09.959> piece<00:04:10.079> goes<00:04:10.560> through<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:12.060> pin<00:04:12.239> goes

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
and this piece goes through the pin goes

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:13.970 
and this piece goes through the pin goes
through<00:04:12.690> all<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.260> then<00:04:13.590> comes<00:04:13.829> out

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
through all of that and then comes out

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.580 
through all of that and then comes out
here<00:04:14.129> on<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.310> bottom<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.989> that's<00:04:15.989> basically

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
here on the bottom and that's basically

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.469 
here on the bottom and that's basically
all<00:04:16.709> that<00:04:17.010> holds<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.310> door<00:04:17.489> onto<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.940> hinge

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
all that holds the door onto the hinge

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.550 
all that holds the door onto the hinge
it's<00:04:18.720> just<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.019> small<00:04:20.630> neural<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.140> on<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
it's just a small neural on the on the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.070 
it's just a small neural on the on the
actual<00:04:23.010> pin<00:04:23.490> itself<00:04:23.969> and<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.510> nails<00:04:24.750> down

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
actual pin itself and it nails down

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.820 
actual pin itself and it nails down
inside<00:04:25.590> this<00:04:25.919> part<00:04:26.430> here

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
inside this part here

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.420 
inside this part here
and<00:04:26.979> just<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.310> friction<00:04:27.520> of<00:04:27.789> that<00:04:29.430> neural

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
and just the friction of that neural

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.909 
and just the friction of that neural
there<00:04:30.610> holds<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:31.060> in<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.479> same<00:04:32.169> situation<00:04:32.830> at

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
there holds that in a same situation at

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.790 
there holds that in a same situation at
the<00:04:33.009> top<00:04:33.840> think<00:04:34.840> of<00:04:34.960> my<00:04:35.050> light<00:04:35.289> here<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:35.650> you

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
the top think of my light here so you

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.080 
the top think of my light here so you
can<00:04:35.919> see<00:04:36.099> but<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.729> see<00:04:36.879> it's<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.060> same

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
can see but you can see it's the same

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.080 
can see but you can see it's the same
situation<00:04:37.870> at<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:37.990> top<00:04:38.199> is<00:04:38.379> the<00:04:38.470> same<00:04:39.090> pen

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
situation at the top is the same pen

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.670 
situation at the top is the same pen
although<00:04:40.960> it's<00:04:41.259> nailed<00:04:41.979> in<00:04:42.220> from<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.610> bottom

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
although it's nailed in from the bottom

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.830 
although it's nailed in from the bottom
so<00:04:44.680> one<00:04:45.520> of<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.669> things<00:04:45.909> I<00:04:46.060> found<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.509> helps

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
so one of the things I found that helps

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.450 
so one of the things I found that helps
this<00:04:46.990> situation<00:04:47.680> when<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.860> door<00:04:48.039> starts<00:04:48.400> to

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
this situation when the door starts to

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.270 
this situation when the door starts to
drag<00:04:48.759> if<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.090> take<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.330> pen<00:04:49.720> or<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:50.680> punch<00:04:50.979> rather

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
drag if you take a pen or a punch rather

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.409 
drag if you take a pen or a punch rather
and<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:52.150> hammer<00:04:52.419> and<00:04:52.690> just<00:04:53.560> knock<00:04:53.770> those<00:04:54.419> pins

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
and a hammer and just knock those pins

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.159 
and a hammer and just knock those pins
back<00:04:55.720> up

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
back up

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.020 
back up
mine<00:04:56.470> has<00:04:57.009> a<00:04:57.039> tendency<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.639> want<00:04:57.849> to<00:04:57.909> work

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
mine has a tendency to want to work

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.480 
mine has a tendency to want to work
loose<00:04:58.389> and<00:04:58.720> sometimes<00:04:59.620> what<00:04:59.979> you'll<00:05:00.159> do<00:05:00.310> is

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
loose and sometimes what you'll do is

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.550 
loose and sometimes what you'll do is
you'll<00:05:00.669> come<00:05:00.819> in<00:05:00.969> here<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:03.580> doral<00:05:04.150> will<00:05:04.870> kind

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
you'll come in here the doral will kind

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.320 
you'll come in here the doral will kind
of<00:05:05.650> drag<00:05:05.919> or<00:05:06.099> something<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:06.610> if<00:05:06.699> you<00:05:06.819> take<00:05:07.030> and

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
of drag or something and if you take and

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.689 
of drag or something and if you take and
you<00:05:07.360> look<00:05:07.900> right<00:05:08.080> in<00:05:08.259> here<00:05:08.680> you'll<00:05:09.520> notice

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
you look right in here you'll notice

you look right in here you'll notice
that<00:05:09.819> that<00:05:09.969> pin<00:05:10.389> is<00:05:10.569> not<00:05:10.750> all<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.199> way<00:05:11.349> down<00:05:11.650> if

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
that that pin is not all the way down if

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.950 
that that pin is not all the way down if
you<00:05:12.370> take<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:12.580> punch<00:05:12.879> and<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> hammer<00:05:13.180> just<00:05:13.750> knock

you take a punch and a hammer just knock

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.290 
you take a punch and a hammer just knock
that<00:05:13.990> thing<00:05:14.259> down<00:05:14.740> on<00:05:15.009> the<00:05:15.669> top<00:05:15.909> and<00:05:16.150> the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
that thing down on the top and the

that thing down on the top and the
bottom<00:05:16.449> a<00:05:16.840> lot<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.650> times<00:05:17.830> that<00:05:18.099> will<00:05:18.250> correct

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
bottom a lot of times that will correct

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.570 
bottom a lot of times that will correct
the<00:05:18.669> problem<00:05:19.120> or<00:05:19.990> at<00:05:20.139> least<00:05:20.319> temporarily<00:05:21.159> stop

it from from from the door from sagging

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:27.089 
it from from from the door from sagging
down<00:05:24.370> scratching<00:05:25.120> on<00:05:25.210> that<00:05:25.389> pin<00:05:25.949> but<00:05:26.949> what<00:05:27.069> I

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
down scratching on that pin but what I

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.800 
down scratching on that pin but what I
ended<00:05:27.460> up<00:05:27.550> doing<00:05:27.729> and<00:05:28.090> you're<00:05:28.539> not<00:05:28.569> going<00:05:28.750> to

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
ended up doing and you're not going to

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.029 
ended up doing and you're not going to
be<00:05:28.870> able<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.020> see<00:05:29.169> it<00:05:29.229> in<00:05:29.319> the<00:05:29.379> video<00:05:29.620> because

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
be able to see it in the video because

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.399 
be able to see it in the video because
the<00:05:30.190> washers<00:05:30.580> are<00:05:30.729> fairly<00:05:30.940> small<00:05:31.360> but<00:05:32.199> there's

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
the washers are fairly small but there's

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.260 
the washers are fairly small but there's
enough<00:05:32.620> slop<00:05:32.919> in<00:05:33.159> these<00:05:33.310> hinges<00:05:33.580> that<00:05:33.819> you<00:05:34.120> can

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
enough slop in these hinges that you can

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.809 
enough slop in these hinges that you can
actually<00:05:34.449> remove<00:05:34.990> this<00:05:35.229> bottom<00:05:35.469> pin<00:05:35.949> you

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
actually remove this bottom pin you

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:37.769 
actually remove this bottom pin you
don't<00:05:37.000> have<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.180> take<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:37.449> all<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:37.569> way<00:05:37.750> out

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:37.779 
don't have to take it all the way out

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.110 
don't have to take it all the way out
you<00:05:38.110> can<00:05:38.229> just<00:05:38.259> bring<00:05:38.529> it<00:05:38.650> up<00:05:38.740> to<00:05:38.800> about<00:05:39.120> about

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
you can just bring it up to about about

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.480 
you can just bring it up to about about
this<00:05:40.840> height<00:05:41.139> you<00:05:41.380> just<00:05:41.620> knock<00:05:41.860> it<00:05:41.889> out<00:05:42.219> from

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
this height you just knock it out from

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.730 
this height you just knock it out from
from<00:05:42.849> the<00:05:42.969> bottom<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.539> allow<00:05:44.229> it<00:05:44.409> to<00:05:44.500> come<00:05:44.680> up

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
from the bottom and allow it to come up

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.600 
from the bottom and allow it to come up
to<00:05:45.400> about<00:05:45.580> here<00:05:45.969> and<00:05:46.120> then<00:05:47.020> have<00:05:47.979> someone<00:05:48.250> help

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
to about here and then have someone help

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.269 
to about here and then have someone help
you<00:05:48.669> work<00:05:48.969> the<00:05:49.120> door<00:05:49.529> back<00:05:50.529> and<00:05:50.740> forth<00:05:50.979> and

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
you work the door back and forth and

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.040 
you work the door back and forth and
then<00:05:51.550> while<00:05:51.880> they're<00:05:52.060> pushing<00:05:52.419> up<00:05:52.569> on<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.900> and

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
then while they're pushing up on it and

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.230 
then while they're pushing up on it and
the<00:05:53.620> door<00:05:53.830> will<00:05:54.009> actually<00:05:54.340> ride<00:05:54.580> up<00:05:54.849> on<00:05:55.000> that

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
the door will actually ride up on that

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.719 
the door will actually ride up on that
pin<00:05:55.539> all<00:05:56.169> the<00:05:56.379> way<00:05:56.500> up<00:05:56.650> against<00:05:57.069> this<00:05:57.190> this

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
pin all the way up against this this

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.089 
pin all the way up against this this
surface<00:05:58.150> here<00:05:58.419> so<00:05:59.139> what<00:05:59.379> it<00:05:59.469> does<00:05:59.620> it<00:05:59.860> ends<00:06:00.009> up

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
surface here so what it does it ends up

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.649 
surface here so what it does it ends up
giving<00:06:00.310> you<00:06:00.460> a<00:06:00.520> little<00:06:00.639> space<00:06:01.000> down<00:06:01.330> here<00:06:01.569> at

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
giving you a little space down here at

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.469 
giving you a little space down here at
the<00:06:01.750> bottom<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:02.430> what<00:06:03.430> I<00:06:03.460> did<00:06:03.759> is<00:06:03.940> I<00:06:04.029> just<00:06:04.240> slid

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
the bottom and what I did is I just slid

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.809 
the bottom and what I did is I just slid
a<00:06:04.509> couple<00:06:04.810> of<00:06:04.870> washers<00:06:05.289> in<00:06:05.469> there<00:06:05.680> and<00:06:05.889> then

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
a couple of washers in there and then

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.899 
a couple of washers in there and then
ran<00:06:07.479> or<00:06:08.110> actually<00:06:08.800> nailed<00:06:09.039> this<00:06:09.279> pin<00:06:09.610> back

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
ran or actually nailed this pin back

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.469 
ran or actually nailed this pin back
down<00:06:10.180> and<00:06:10.479> that<00:06:10.539> corrects<00:06:11.529> that<00:06:11.590> problem<00:06:12.190> so<00:06:13.120> I

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
down and that corrects that problem so I

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.260 
down and that corrects that problem so I
have<00:06:14.289> had<00:06:14.620> two<00:06:14.889> on<00:06:15.190> the<00:06:15.580> other<00:06:15.699> side<00:06:15.969> like<00:06:16.150> I

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
have had two on the other side like I

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.369 
have had two on the other side like I
said<00:06:16.449> these<00:06:16.599> washers<00:06:16.960> have<00:06:17.080> been<00:06:17.169> in<00:06:17.259> there

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
said these washers have been in there

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.519 
said these washers have been in there
forever<00:06:17.529> I<00:06:17.800> did<00:06:18.069> have<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.490> driver<00:06:19.150> side<00:06:19.529> start

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:20.529 
forever I did have the driver side start

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.110 
forever I did have the driver side start
to<00:06:20.650> scratch<00:06:20.949> just<00:06:21.219> a<00:06:21.310> little<00:06:21.550> bit<00:06:21.699> one<00:06:21.909> time

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
to scratch just a little bit one time

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.450 
to scratch just a little bit one time
after<00:06:22.449> I<00:06:22.509> put<00:06:22.659> the<00:06:22.750> washers<00:06:23.199> and<00:06:23.650> all<00:06:24.310> I<00:06:24.340> did

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
after I put the washers and all I did

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.629 
after I put the washers and all I did
was<00:06:24.819> was<00:06:25.680> remove<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.800> pin<00:06:27.009> again<00:06:27.129> added

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
was was remove the pin again added

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.010 
was was remove the pin again added
another<00:06:27.909> washer<00:06:28.389> and<00:06:28.479> make<00:06:28.569> it<00:06:28.690> a<00:06:28.719> little<00:06:28.870> bit

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
another washer and make it a little bit

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.080 
another washer and make it a little bit
thicker<00:06:29.229> and<00:06:29.620> it<00:06:30.219> just<00:06:30.370> picks<00:06:30.610> up<00:06:30.729> the<00:06:30.879> door

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
thicker and it just picks up the door

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.589 
thicker and it just picks up the door
just<00:06:31.449> enough<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:32.650> offset<00:06:32.830> the<00:06:33.400> wear<00:06:34.270> in<00:06:34.479> the

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
just enough to offset the wear in the

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.269 
just enough to offset the wear in the
hinge<00:06:34.839> or<00:06:35.050> whatever<00:06:35.349> it<00:06:35.500> is<00:06:35.529> it<00:06:35.710> causes<00:06:36.099> that

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:36.279 
hinge or whatever it is it causes that

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.610 
hinge or whatever it is it causes that
sag<00:06:36.580> and<00:06:36.909> it<00:06:37.449> prevents<00:06:37.810> that<00:06:37.870> pin<00:06:38.229> from<00:06:38.500> from

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
sag and it prevents that pin from from

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.720 
sag and it prevents that pin from from
interfering<00:06:40.620> with<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.830> door-latch<00:06:41.070> and<00:06:41.550> you

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
interfering with the door-latch and you

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.680 
interfering with the door-latch and you
get<00:06:41.850> that<00:06:42.000> scratchy<00:06:44.150> crappy<00:06:45.150> noise<00:06:45.360> when<00:06:45.600> you

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
get that scratchy crappy noise when you

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.180 
get that scratchy crappy noise when you
open<00:06:45.960> and<00:06:46.080> close<00:06:46.110> the<00:06:46.260> doors<00:06:46.560> I'm<00:06:46.800> sure<00:06:46.980> other

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
open and close the doors I'm sure other

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.710 
open and close the doors I'm sure other
people<00:06:47.250> had<00:06:47.700> the<00:06:47.820> same<00:06:48.000> problem

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
people had the same problem

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.840 
people had the same problem
that's<00:06:49.410> how<00:06:49.560> I<00:06:49.590> fixed<00:06:49.950> mine<00:06:50.130> and<00:06:50.400> it<00:06:50.520> has

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:50.850 
that's how I fixed mine and it has

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.940 
that's how I fixed mine and it has
worked<00:06:51.120> for<00:06:51.300> a<00:06:51.450> long<00:06:51.750> long<00:06:52.110> time<00:06:52.440> I've<00:06:52.770> had<00:06:52.890> to

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
worked for a long long time I've had to

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.980 
worked for a long long time I've had to
replace<00:06:53.370> no<00:06:53.640> hinges<00:06:54.150> or<00:06:54.510> anything<00:06:54.690> like<00:06:54.930> that

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
replace no hinges or anything like that

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.110 
replace no hinges or anything like that
I<00:06:55.200> just<00:06:55.320> basically<00:06:55.920> put<00:06:56.340> those<00:06:56.460> washers<00:06:56.970> in

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
I just basically put those washers in

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.570 
I just basically put those washers in
there<00:06:57.330> and<00:06:58.020> that<00:06:58.170> was<00:06:58.350> it<00:06:58.560> I'm<00:06:59.160> going<00:06:59.310> to<00:06:59.340> go<00:06:59.460> to

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
there and that was it I'm going to go to

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.740 
there and that was it I'm going to go to
the<00:06:59.670> other<00:06:59.760> side<00:07:00.000> and<00:07:00.150> see<00:07:00.240> if<00:07:00.300> I<00:07:00.360> can<00:07:00.510> show<00:07:00.660> you

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
the other side and see if I can show you

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.420 
the other side and see if I can show you
the<00:07:00.870> pin<00:07:01.140> on<00:07:01.440> the<00:07:01.590> driver's<00:07:01.980> side<00:07:02.010> because<00:07:02.370> it

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
the pin on the driver's side because it

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.860 
the pin on the driver's side because it
was<00:07:02.550> much<00:07:02.760> worse<00:07:02.790> squish<00:07:03.420> you<00:07:03.540> use<00:07:03.690> the

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
was much worse squish you use the

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.420 
was much worse squish you use the
driver's<00:07:04.260> side<00:07:04.410> door<00:07:04.710> a<00:07:04.770> lot<00:07:04.980> more<00:07:05.220> than<00:07:05.370> you

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
driver's side door a lot more than you

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.480 
driver's side door a lot more than you
use<00:07:05.580> the<00:07:05.760> passenger<00:07:06.600> side<00:07:06.780> one<00:07:07.050> and<00:07:07.620> I've

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
use the passenger side one and I've

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.070 
use the passenger side one and I've
never<00:07:08.700> known<00:07:08.910> the<00:07:09.060> rear<00:07:09.270> ones<00:07:09.540> to<00:07:09.690> do<00:07:09.810> it<00:07:09.960> at

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
never known the rear ones to do it at

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.710 
never known the rear ones to do it at
all<00:07:10.200> because<00:07:11.690> they<00:07:13.850> much<00:07:14.850> lighter<00:07:15.180> doors<00:07:15.480> and

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
all because they much lighter doors and

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.620 
all because they much lighter doors and
you<00:07:15.780> don't<00:07:15.960> use<00:07:16.140> them<00:07:16.290> that<00:07:16.410> much<00:07:17.390> so<00:07:18.390> you<00:07:18.450> can

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
you don't use them that much so you can

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.140 
you don't use them that much so you can
see<00:07:18.870> the<00:07:19.020> top<00:07:19.230> of<00:07:19.260> that<00:07:19.440> pin<00:07:19.860> how<00:07:20.670> it's<00:07:20.850> worn

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
see the top of that pin how it's worn

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.210 
see the top of that pin how it's worn
and<00:07:23.060> it<00:07:24.060> no<00:07:24.300> longer<00:07:24.710> scratches<00:07:25.710> at<00:07:25.830> all<00:07:25.950> here

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 
and it no longer scratches at all here

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.950 
and it no longer scratches at all here
we'll<00:07:26.400> close<00:07:26.580> the<00:07:26.730> door<00:07:26.880> and<00:07:27.030> I'll<00:07:27.120> show<00:07:27.360> you

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.080 

see<00:07:31.130> when<00:07:32.130> you<00:07:32.220> open<00:07:32.250> it<00:07:32.640> when<00:07:32.850> you<00:07:32.940> usually

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090 
see when you open it when you usually

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.910 
see when you open it when you usually
hear<00:07:33.420> it<00:07:34.400> so<00:07:35.400> you<00:07:35.490> don't<00:07:35.670> hear<00:07:35.850> that<00:07:35.880> scratch

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:36.920 
hear it so you don't hear that scratch

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.990 
hear it so you don't hear that scratch
when<00:07:37.920> you<00:07:38.010> close<00:07:38.220> you<00:07:38.430> have<00:07:38.550> a<00:07:38.580> nice<00:07:38.790> positive

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 
when you close you have a nice positive

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.210 
when you close you have a nice positive
see<00:07:42.000> how<00:07:42.120> that<00:07:42.300> works<00:07:42.950> anyway<00:07:43.950> I'd<00:07:44.100> be

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 
see how that works anyway I'd be

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.070
