so that I open that cut and then I start

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.010 
so that I open that cut and then I start
to<00:02:43.950> run<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.510> liquid<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.470> here<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.450> for

to run this liquid in here and and for

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.670 
to run this liquid in here and and for
that<00:02:49.320> when<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.430> add<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.910> liquid<00:02:51.390> we<00:02:51.990> go<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.320> log

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
that when I add this liquid we go to log

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.430 
that when I add this liquid we go to log
in<00:02:53.010> tab<00:02:53.280> direction<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.930> check<00:02:55.200> that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
in tab direction that I can check that

in tab direction that I can check that
what<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.980> right<00:02:56.160> amount<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:57.060> big<00:02:57.270> bit

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
what is the right amount of this big bit

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.360 
what is the right amount of this big bit
okay

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
okay

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.660 
okay
and<00:02:59.490> we<00:02:59.670> continue<00:03:03.560> okay<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.709> then<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:04.950> saw<00:03:05.430> that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and we continue okay and then I saw that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.140 
and we continue okay and then I saw that
how<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:06.120> add<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.660> liquid<00:03:07.170> there<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.130> idea<00:03:08.700> that

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
how I add this liquid there is idea that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.729 
how I add this liquid there is idea that
there<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.510> tank<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:11.670> will<00:03:12.470> start<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
there is this tank and I will start the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.820 
there is this tank and I will start the
drying<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.280> there<00:03:14.580> this<00:03:14.790> liquid<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:16.470> need

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
drying in there this liquid and I need

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.790 
drying in there this liquid and I need
to<00:03:17.070> try<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.430> liquid<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.450> long<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.560> this

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
to try this liquid so long that this

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.020 
to try this liquid so long that this
liquid<00:03:20.220> level<00:03:20.790> becomes<00:03:21.270> increase<00:03:21.750> marks<00:03:22.290> line

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
liquid level becomes increase marks line

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.770 
liquid level becomes increase marks line
there's<00:03:24.030> always<00:03:24.360> good<00:03:25.020> to<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.820> more<00:03:26.820> oil<00:03:27.480> than

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
there's always good to be more oil than

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.720 
there's always good to be more oil than
less<00:03:28.610> then<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.330> okay<00:03:30.950> now<00:03:31.950> it's<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.430> max

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
less then is it okay now it's in max

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.170 
less then is it okay now it's in max
level<00:03:32.970> okay<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:34.080> was<00:03:34.260> enough<00:03:34.880> there's<00:03:35.880> not

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
level okay this was enough there's not

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.300 
level okay this was enough there's not
not<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:36.989> much<00:03:37.260> this<00:03:38.060> oil<00:03:39.060> okay<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.530> then<00:03:41.070> we

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
not so much this oil okay and then we

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.400 
not so much this oil okay and then we
continue<00:03:41.880> we<00:03:42.239> lock<00:03:42.989> this<00:03:43.170> gap<00:03:44.720> okay<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.230> why

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
continue we lock this gap okay and why

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.699 
continue we lock this gap okay and why
not<00:03:46.680> step<00:03:47.040> in<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.489> power-steering<00:03:48.450> check<00:03:49.410> is

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
not step in this power-steering check is

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.039 
not step in this power-steering check is
that<00:03:49.980> we<00:03:50.160> need<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.430> insert<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.239> cap<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.780> pack

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
that we need to insert that cap in pack

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.229 
that we need to insert that cap in pack
and<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.920> happens<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.820> take<00:03:54.239> your<00:03:54.920> fingers

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
and it happens so you take your fingers

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.640 
and it happens so you take your fingers
in<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:59.370> kind<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.850> grip<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.630> then<00:04:01.500> you

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
in this kind of grip and then you

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.550 
in this kind of grip and then you
carefully<00:04:02.010> sand<00:04:02.430> first<00:04:02.910> this<00:04:03.180> Pike<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.350> this

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
carefully sand first this Pike in this

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.250 
carefully sand first this Pike in this
hole<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.130> then<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.549> carefully<00:04:06.540> in<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:06.959> way

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
hole and then you carefully in that way

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.550 
hole and then you carefully in that way
and<00:04:07.560> then<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.190> start<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.820> rotate<00:04:09.600> there<00:04:10.440> is

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
and then you start to rotate there is

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.460 
and then you start to rotate there is
nicely<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.459> text<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:12.000> here<00:04:12.209> close<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.380> the

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
nicely in text in here close and the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.320 
nicely in text in here close and the
vent<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:14.030> suddenly<00:04:15.650> actually<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.799> need<00:04:17.040> to

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
vent is suddenly actually I need to

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.060 
vent is suddenly actually I need to
insert<00:04:18.330> that<00:04:18.570> in<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.019> hole<00:04:19.290> yeah<00:04:19.620> this<00:04:19.919> was

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
insert that in that hole yeah this was

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.390 
insert that in that hole yeah this was
important<00:04:20.669> there<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.660> kind<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.320> hold<00:04:22.680> up

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
important there is that kind of hold up

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.210 
important there is that kind of hold up
if<00:04:23.729> there's<00:04:24.030> hole<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.600> this<00:04:25.169> part<00:04:25.530> must<00:04:25.830> go

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
if there's hole and this part must go

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.120 
if there's hole and this part must go
first<00:04:26.580> in<00:04:26.850> here<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.350> deep<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.830> then

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
first in here and it is so deep and then

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.850 
first in here and it is so deep and then
you<00:04:29.760> rotate<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:30.720> long<00:04:30.990> that<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.680> is

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
you rotate that so long that it is

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.310 
you rotate that so long that it is
enclosed<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.669> then<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.120> try<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.720> pull<00:04:34.140> out

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
enclosed and then you try to pull out

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.089 
enclosed and then you try to pull out
that<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:35.340> when<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.700> don't<00:04:35.970> move<00:04:36.330> your<00:04:36.990> cap<00:04:37.890> is

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
that and when it don't move your cap is

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.110 
that and when it don't move your cap is
