00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
yourself and if you're by yourself then

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.200 
yourself and if you're by yourself then
you<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.600> want<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.870> run<00:01:58.050> a<00:01:58.290> B<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.800> C<00:01:59.210> because

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
you just want to run a B and C because

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.540 
you just want to run a B and C because
normally<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.320> extraction<00:02:02.160> point<00:02:02.370> is

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
normally see the extraction point is

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.780 
normally see the extraction point is
around<00:02:02.940> now<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.160> want<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.400> do<00:02:05.490> also

around now so what you want to do also

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.980 
around now so what you want to do also
before<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> forget<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.190> want<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:09.390> run<00:02:09.690> like

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
before I forget you do want to run like

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
before I forget you do want to run like
one<00:02:10.320> weapon<00:02:11.009> with<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.880> also<00:02:12.180> run

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
one weapon with this you can also run

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.430 
one weapon with this you can also run
two<00:02:14.010> or<00:02:14.520> three<00:02:14.880> or<00:02:15.360> however<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.080> do<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.230> this

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
two or three or however you do it this

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.280 
two or three or however you do it this
mission<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.070> really<00:02:17.610> good<00:02:17.880> for<00:02:18.330> leveling<00:02:19.110> of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
mission is really good for leveling of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.250 
mission is really good for leveling of
your<00:02:19.530> weapons<00:02:20.330> besides<00:02:21.330> leveling<00:02:22.110> up

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
your weapons besides leveling up

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.600 
your weapons besides leveling up
warframes<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:25.530> reason<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.070> say<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.310> is

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
warframes and the reason I say that is

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.670 
warframes and the reason I say that is
because<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.090> get<00:02:27.420> more<00:02:27.750> experience<00:02:28.320> on<00:02:28.650> your

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
because you get more experience on your

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.130 
because you get more experience on your
weapons<00:02:29.190> then<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.970> rather<00:02:30.180> would<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.900> your

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
weapons then you rather would on your

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.220 
weapons then you rather would on your
warframes<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.100> if<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.840> want<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.110> do

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
warframes and if you want to do

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.860 
warframes and if you want to do
warframes<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.980> advise<00:02:35.459> doing<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:36.060> dark<00:02:36.660> sector

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
warframes I advise doing a dark sector

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.370 
warframes I advise doing a dark sector
defense<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:38.030> it's<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.450> lot<00:02:39.630> quicker<00:02:39.900> than

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
defense and it's just a lot quicker than

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.940 
defense and it's just a lot quicker than
it<00:02:40.560> actually<00:02:40.740> would<00:02:41.160> be<00:02:41.900> doing<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.050> cine<00:02:43.800> way

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
it actually would be doing this cine way

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.260 
it actually would be doing this cine way
guys<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.400> want<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.730> use<00:02:44.910> your<00:02:45.030> last

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
guys you just want to use your last

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.110 
guys you just want to use your last
ability<00:02:45.840> here<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.440> then<00:02:47.370> make<00:02:47.670> sure<00:02:47.910> you're

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
ability here and then make sure you're

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.360 
ability here and then make sure you're
in<00:02:48.269> with<00:02:48.510> rift<00:02:48.959> walk<00:02:49.230> before<00:02:49.530> running<00:02:50.040> through

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
in with rift walk before running through

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.790 
in with rift walk before running through
the<00:02:50.459> lasers<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.239> if<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.600> try<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.350> run<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
the lasers because if you try to run to

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.170 
the lasers because if you try to run to
the<00:02:52.830> lasers<00:02:53.310> you're<00:02:53.489> probably<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:53.970> set

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the lasers you're probably going to set

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.540 
the lasers you're probably going to set
off<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.330> alarm<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.190> kind<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.280> fail<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
off the alarm and kind of fail the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.690 
off the alarm and kind of fail the
mission<00:02:56.700> ooh<00:02:59.930> sorry<00:03:00.930> guys<00:03:01.530> i'm<00:03:01.890> kinda<00:03:02.489> down

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
mission ooh sorry guys i'm kinda down

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.790 
mission ooh sorry guys i'm kinda down
under<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.840> weather<00:03:04.019> today<00:03:04.170> i'm<00:03:04.590> not<00:03:04.620> feeling

24,000 experience and if you do it three

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.660 
24,000 experience and if you do it three
times<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.660> can<00:03:15.900> get<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.110> weapon<00:03:16.380> up<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:17.370> rheank

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
times you can get a weapon up to rheank

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.820 
times you can get a weapon up to rheank
10<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.420> then<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.660> with<00:03:18.930> your<00:03:19.110> bonus<00:03:19.500> you'll<00:03:19.680> get

10 and then I with your bonus you'll get

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.880 
10 and then I with your bonus you'll get
it<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.040> 14<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.050> you'll<00:03:22.050> have<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.470> play<00:03:22.680> these

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
it to 14 and you'll have to play these

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.270 
it to 14 and you'll have to play these
missions<00:03:23.370> over<00:03:24.150> x<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:25.290> completely<00:03:25.860> match<00:03:26.070> the

missions over x to completely match the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.729 
missions over x to completely match the
weapon<00:03:26.580> 2<00:03:26.700> 30<00:03:26.970> now<00:03:27.420> that's<00:03:27.690> only<00:03:27.959> one<00:03:28.470> one

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
weapon 2 30 now that's only one one

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.130 
weapon 2 30 now that's only one one
thing<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.790> have<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.090> play<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.780> mission

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
thing that you have to play the mission

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.340 
thing that you have to play the mission
four<00:03:31.739> times

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
four times

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.000 
four times
start<00:03:33.650> destroying<00:03:34.040> data<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.260> it's<00:03:36.260> it's<00:03:36.710> kind

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
start destroying data so it's it's kind

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.520 
start destroying data so it's it's kind
of<00:03:37.130> different<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.900> depends<00:03:38.900> on<00:03:39.050> how<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.290> want

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
of different and depends on how you want

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.020 
of different and depends on how you want
to<00:03:39.770> do<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:40.010> if<00:03:40.100> you<00:03:40.190> want<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.400> rank<00:03:40.520> out<00:03:40.700> three

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
to do it if you want to rank out three

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.550 
to do it if you want to rank out three
weapons<00:03:41.270> that's<00:03:41.630> going<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.840> take<00:03:41.990> longer<00:03:42.290> but

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
weapons that's going to take longer but

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.190 
weapons that's going to take longer but
you<00:03:43.100> know<00:03:43.250> all<00:03:43.490> in<00:03:43.940> all<00:03:44.090> it's<00:03:44.420> kind<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:45.020> say

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
you know all in all it's kind of a say

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.300 
you know all in all it's kind of a say
so<00:03:46.480> they're<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:47.840> one<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.410> kind<00:03:48.770> of<00:03:48.890> use<00:03:49.100> my

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
so they're in this one I kind of use my

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.900 
so they're in this one I kind of use my
first<00:03:49.610> ability<00:03:49.880> while<00:03:50.390> in<00:03:50.630> risk<00:03:51.500> walk<00:03:51.910> just

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
first ability while in risk walk just

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.470 
first ability while in risk walk just
because<00:03:53.390> i<00:03:53.960> did<00:03:54.620> use<00:03:54.890> my<00:03:55.160> life<00:03:55.730> stability<00:03:56.300> one

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
because i did use my life stability one

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.100 
because i did use my life stability one
time<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:58.010> somehow<00:03:58.730> set<00:03:59.210> off<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.540> alarms<00:03:59.960> i

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
time and it somehow set off the alarms i

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.150 
time and it somehow set off the alarms i
don't<00:04:00.290> see<00:04:00.440> how<00:04:00.650> but<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.880> did<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.980> reason

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
don't see how but you did so the reason

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.980 
don't see how but you did so the reason
I<00:04:04.430> turned<00:04:04.670> around<00:04:04.820> back<00:04:05.210> there<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.570> because<00:04:05.720> if

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
I turned around back there is because if

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.980 
I turned around back there is because if
you<00:04:06.080> don't<00:04:06.350> know<00:04:06.650> those<00:04:07.400> guys<00:04:07.730> bubbles<00:04:08.330> will

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
you don't know those guys bubbles will

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.060 
you don't know those guys bubbles will
take<00:04:09.320> any<00:04:09.650> active<00:04:11.200> ability<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:12.590> have<00:04:12.800> on

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
take any active ability that you have on

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.810 
take any active ability that you have on
and<00:04:13.370> they<00:04:14.240> will<00:04:14.420> take<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:14.960> off<00:04:15.110> now<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:16.040> can't

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and they will take it off now you can't

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.729 
and they will take it off now you can't
cast<00:04:17.150> any<00:04:17.570> abilities<00:04:18.110> and<00:04:18.290> their<00:04:18.350> bubbles

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
cast any abilities and their bubbles

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.860 
cast any abilities and their bubbles
either<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.430> they're<00:04:20.000> not<00:04:20.180> just<00:04:20.450> they're<00:04:20.840> not

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.920 
fun to play with so like right here
you'll<00:04:24.830> see<00:04:24.890> it<00:04:25.310> took<00:04:25.940> my<00:04:26.090> limbo<00:04:26.420> completely

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
you'll see it took my limbo completely

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.650 
you'll see it took my limbo completely
off<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.500> had<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.680> put<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.040> back<00:04:28.190> on<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:29.360> anyway

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
off so I had to put it back on so anyway

off so I had to put it back on so anyway
guys<00:04:30.040> we're<00:04:31.040> going<00:04:31.130> to<00:04:31.190> go<00:04:31.340> ahead<00:04:31.490> and

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
guys we're going to go ahead and

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.120 
guys we're going to go ahead and
transistor<00:04:32.600> over<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.870> see<00:04:33.110> here<00:04:33.380> I'm<00:04:33.590> cutting

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
transistor over to see here I'm cutting

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.030 
transistor over to see here I'm cutting
a<00:04:34.190> little<00:04:34.220> bit<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:34.970> this<00:04:35.150> out<00:04:35.680> just<00:04:36.680> because

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
a little bit of this out just because

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.830 
a little bit of this out just because
it'll<00:04:37.280> make<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.550> video<00:04:37.790> just<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.240> little<00:04:38.690> bit

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
it'll make the video just a little bit

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.700 
it'll make the video just a little bit
shorter

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.910 

so<00:04:43.710> now<00:04:43.920> that<00:04:43.950> we're<00:04:44.310> at<00:04:44.460> sea<00:04:45.710> we're<00:04:46.710> going<00:04:46.860> to

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
so now that we're at sea we're going to

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.770 
so now that we're at sea we're going to
go<00:04:46.980> hack<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.550> one<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:47.910> now<00:04:48.270> if<00:04:48.450> you<00:04:48.600> had

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
go hack you this one and now if you had

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.660 
go hack you this one and now if you had
low<00:04:49.050> key<00:04:49.290> with<00:04:49.530> this<00:04:49.740> one<00:04:50.010> you<00:04:50.040> would<00:04:50.370> have<00:04:50.550> to

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
low key with this one you would have to

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.450 
low key with this one you would have to
hack<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:51.210> one<00:04:51.450> that<00:04:52.140> green<00:04:52.470> one<00:04:52.710> this<00:04:53.130> one

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
hack that one that green one this one

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.580 
hack that one that green one this one
the<00:04:53.850> next<00:04:54.060> one<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:54.390> then<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.900> main<00:04:55.110> one<00:04:55.410> and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
the next one and then the main one and

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.090 
the next one and then the main one and
that<00:04:56.280> just<00:04:56.550> for<00:04:56.820> me<00:04:56.970> that<00:04:57.210> took<00:04:57.450> way<00:04:57.480> too<00:04:57.690> long

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
that just for me that took way too long

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.760 
that just for me that took way too long
so<00:04:59.100> limbo<00:05:00.060> linksys<00:05:00.600> a<00:05:00.630> lot<00:05:00.930> easier<00:05:01.140> even

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
so limbo linksys a lot easier even

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.260 
so limbo linksys a lot easier even
though<00:05:01.920> he<00:05:01.950> gets<00:05:02.250> caught<00:05:02.550> by<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.820> cameras<00:05:03.240> a

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
though he gets caught by the cameras a

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.090 
though he gets caught by the cameras a
lot<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.930> got<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.140> be<00:05:04.200> careful<00:05:04.650> on<00:05:05.070> that

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
lot so you got to be careful on that

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.930 
lot so you got to be careful on that
point<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.700> view<00:05:07.280> so<00:05:08.280> once<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.610> get<00:05:08.730> around

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940
