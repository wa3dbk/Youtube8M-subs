00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:13.019
 hello all here so we end up 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.509
 to put his server in ultra caen 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.870
 brest and my polka dot server I have everything 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.580
 removed 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.060
 you can put back so already the most 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.680
 important 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.830
 so he will have regeneration thanks to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.230
 eggs or how to say about it all 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.940
 move it does not work and that fears that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.140
 thanks to apples to potions and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.379
 beacon that we can regenerate 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.239
 so we do the years the capital letters are 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.010
 important when you do for example 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.309
 you wrote you do table like that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.329
 it's really much faster that go up so 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.270
 it's going to put you all the words that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.760
 start with the trick a little trick 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.680
 natural generation the measurements are 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.980
 important if you write everything is 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.109
 so there I activate you see me Ã©coeure 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.309
 there it does not come back so the active age there 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.080
 it was starting to regenerate so that's it 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.290
 start to generate so you do that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.710
 you do falls so there I re generating 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.170
 more so that's it already it's more 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.750
 important and so it's simple 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.850
 now to have life in the tab 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.350
 7 am 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.170
 ward now is that arrows 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.450
 as an objective box 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.820
 so we will add class so you 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.119
 so here I saw your life goal 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.250
 now we will put it in the box 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.250
 in the list so 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:52.100
 a little 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.539
 a cep display list means ok so there 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.840
 so I have zero because it's a 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:03.829
 bug so here I showed you for his 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.750
 so mark the heart g3 so be 6 by 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.140
 example as a way like christ 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.200
 patrick seror half of the hearts 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.750
 count for 1 so the mcs his wines his 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.579
 wines now we'll put some stuff 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:24.170
 goals so does it so still 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:25.310
 this rate for everything rewrite you put 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.680
 to speak you click on the arrow 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.220
 from the top and that to do what you have 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.299
 wrote one last what you said 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.920
 last year because if you want 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:39.769
 create his board and so had he been 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.180
 con on add the leave theirs and 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:50.329
 counter speech remains pretty good 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:56.650
 all objectives of the goal score 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.650
 always the bar is funny 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.450
 I try to burke it 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:29.140
 this goal 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:37.140
 ten stadiums and 9.7 display I believe I 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:37.140
 tense I'm not sure seibel down that he 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.540
 and so here it should be good 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.120
 I have not forgotten anything 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.519
 you will put any interception so its 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.330
 607 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:09.580
 yes I'm stupid I really do not 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.060
 kill but basically it works when you 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.230
 die it works 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.780
 I really do not want to die in 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.459
 do you understand why finally here is 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.680
 that is to say, the heck of horde with 26 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.699
 level so it works 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.040
 so when you die you will die 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.110
 so that's the end 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.479
 if you have other tutorial ideas 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.229
 ask your questions i answer them i'm 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.729
 100% worried it depends if I am abc 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.590
 how old are you learning to shoot 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.639
 put a gem to deny it well or that makes 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.639
 pleasure more
