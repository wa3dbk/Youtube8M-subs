hello everyone and vendor seven one nine
here<00:00:06.979> and<00:00:07.160> today<00:00:07.849> I<00:00:07.880> have<00:00:08.180> a<00:00:08.269> very<00:00:08.510> special

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
here and today I have a very special

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.110 
here and today I have a very special
video<00:00:09.080> of<00:00:09.440> a<00:00:09.559> science<00:00:10.010> experiment<00:00:10.370> to<00:00:10.940> show

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
video of a science experiment to show

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.230 
video of a science experiment to show
you<00:00:11.179> this<00:00:12.080> experiment<00:00:12.860> is<00:00:13.610> one<00:00:13.820> that<00:00:13.969> you<00:00:14.089> can

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
you this experiment is one that you can

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.810 
you this experiment is one that you can
do<00:00:14.330> at<00:00:14.450> home<00:00:14.480> which<00:00:15.349> is<00:00:15.379> safe<00:00:15.860> and<00:00:16.190> easy<00:00:16.460> and

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
do at home which is safe and easy and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.500 
do at home which is safe and easy and
you<00:00:16.850> can<00:00:17.600> make<00:00:17.750> your<00:00:17.900> own<00:00:17.990> hydrogen<00:00:18.619> gas<00:00:19.360> to<00:00:20.360> do

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
you can make your own hydrogen gas to do

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.900 
you can make your own hydrogen gas to do
this<00:00:20.750> you<00:00:21.110> need<00:00:21.680> these<00:00:21.830> few<00:00:22.250> household

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
this you need these few household

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.420 
this you need these few household
supplies<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:24.160> because<00:00:25.160> you're<00:00:25.340> not

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
supplies and because you're not

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.990 
supplies and because you're not
producing<00:00:25.670> too<00:00:26.210> much<00:00:26.240> hydrogen<00:00:26.840> it<00:00:27.140> is<00:00:27.170> a<00:00:28.040> very

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
producing too much hydrogen it is a very

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.900 
producing too much hydrogen it is a very
safe<00:00:29.330> experiment<00:00:30.250> so<00:00:31.250> first<00:00:31.550> I'll<00:00:31.670> give<00:00:31.820> you

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
safe experiment so first I'll give you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.500 
safe experiment so first I'll give you
an<00:00:31.970> introduction<00:00:32.500> which<00:00:33.500> is<00:00:33.739> simply<00:00:34.160> that<00:00:34.510> h2o

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
an introduction which is simply that h2o

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.770 
an introduction which is simply that h2o
or<00:00:35.870> water<00:00:36.010> is<00:00:37.010> made<00:00:37.730> up<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:37.940> hydrogen<00:00:38.600> and

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
or water is made up of hydrogen and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.959 
or water is made up of hydrogen and
oxygen<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:39.559> using<00:00:40.399> a<00:00:40.460> process<00:00:40.699> called

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
oxygen and using a process called

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.989 
oxygen and using a process called
electrolysis<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.980> can<00:00:43.190> remove<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.730> hydrogen

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999 
electrolysis you can remove the hydrogen

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.770 
electrolysis you can remove the hydrogen
and<00:00:44.539> the<00:00:45.469> oxygen<00:00:45.499> into<00:00:46.280> two<00:00:47.149> separate<00:00:47.510> ions

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
and the oxygen into two separate ions

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.419 
and the oxygen into two separate ions
and<00:00:48.519> then<00:00:49.719> when<00:00:50.719> lighting<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.140> on<00:00:51.199> fire<00:00:51.429> it'll

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
and then when lighting it on fire it'll

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:53.919 
and then when lighting it on fire it'll
make<00:00:52.579> a<00:00:52.609> popping<00:00:53.120> sound<00:00:53.149> to<00:00:53.510> indicate<00:00:53.629> that

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
make a popping sound to indicate that

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.889 
make a popping sound to indicate that
it's<00:00:54.170> hydrogen<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.819> process<00:00:56.569> to<00:00:56.690> do<00:00:56.780> this

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
it's hydrogen so the process to do this

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.719 
it's hydrogen so the process to do this
is<00:00:57.079> very<00:00:57.289> simple<00:00:57.769> which<00:00:57.920> is<00:00:58.100> what<00:00:58.309> I<00:00:58.339> will<00:00:58.550> show

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
is very simple which is what I will show

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.950 
is very simple which is what I will show
you<00:00:58.789> today<00:00:59.949> by<00:01:00.949> mixing<00:01:01.190> water<00:01:01.550> with<00:01:02.179> salt<00:01:02.569> to

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
you today by mixing water with salt to

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.110 
you today by mixing water with salt to
make<00:01:03.469> it<00:01:03.589> easier<00:01:03.979> for<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.400> aisles<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.820> split

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
make it easier for the aisles to split

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.889 
make it easier for the aisles to split
apart<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:07.909> bit<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.180> soap<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.630> there<00:01:08.780> I'll

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
apart and a bit of soap in there I'll

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.380 
apart and a bit of soap in there I'll
tell<00:01:09.049> you<00:01:09.110> why<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.439> sec<00:01:09.680> we<00:01:10.520> can<00:01:10.700> then<00:01:10.850> send<00:01:11.180> a

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
tell you why in a sec we can then send a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.330 
tell you why in a sec we can then send a
stream<00:01:11.869> of<00:01:11.930> electrons<00:01:13.060> using<00:01:14.060> our<00:01:14.920> power<00:01:15.920> plug

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
stream of electrons using our power plug

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.209 
stream of electrons using our power plug
on<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.759> side<00:01:16.969> there<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:17.570> tin<00:01:18.409> foil<00:01:18.680> took<00:01:18.920> to

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
on the side there and tin foil took to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.899 
on the side there and tin foil took to
conduct<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:21.020> positive<00:01:21.289> will<00:01:21.920> point<00:01:22.789> out

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
conduct it the positive will point out

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.029 
conduct it the positive will point out
either<00:01:23.090> oxygen<00:01:23.329> or<00:01:23.719> hydrogen<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.530> the

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
either oxygen or hydrogen and the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.889 
either oxygen or hydrogen and the
negative<00:01:25.399> terminal<00:01:25.610> will<00:01:26.060> put<00:01:26.240> out<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.539> other

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
negative terminal will put out the other

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.889 
negative terminal will put out the other
gas<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:28.039> then<00:01:28.700> by<00:01:28.969> using<00:01:29.000> our<00:01:29.390> lighter<00:01:29.659> and

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
gas and then by using our lighter and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.980 
gas and then by using our lighter and
our<00:01:30.049> toothpicks<00:01:31.299> alright<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.420> make<00:01:32.539> a<00:01:32.600> flame

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
our toothpicks alright to make a flame

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.219 
our toothpicks alright to make a flame
will<00:01:33.649> be<00:01:33.799> able<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.159> pop<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.359> hydrogen<00:01:35.840> bubbles

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
will be able to pop the hydrogen bubbles

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.789 
will be able to pop the hydrogen bubbles
which<00:01:36.829> is<00:01:37.009> pretty<00:01:37.250> fun<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.270> first<00:01:38.630> I<00:01:38.899> will<00:01:39.469> get

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
which is pretty fun so first I will get

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.069 
which is pretty fun so first I will get
started<00:01:40.009> on<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.399> procedure<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.810> first

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
started on the procedure so the first

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.020 
started on the procedure so the first
step<00:01:42.289> is<00:01:42.439> to<00:01:42.560> get<00:01:42.710> yourself<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.219> non<00:01:43.399> conductive

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
step is to get yourself a non conductive

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.450 
step is to get yourself a non conductive
container<00:01:44.479> I<00:01:44.780> have<00:01:45.320> simply<00:01:45.680> chosen<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:46.130> glass

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
container I have simply chosen a glass

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.910 
container I have simply chosen a glass
jar<00:01:46.969> and<00:01:47.240> you're<00:01:48.079> going<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.259> want<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.530> fill<00:01:48.770> it

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
jar and you're going to want to fill it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.810 
jar and you're going to want to fill it
about<00:01:49.100> up<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.939> there<00:01:51.490> three-quarters<00:01:52.490> or<00:01:52.609> more

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
about up to there three-quarters or more

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.300 
about up to there three-quarters or more
of<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.030> way<00:01:53.179> full<00:01:53.450> with<00:01:54.049> water<00:01:54.310> doesn't

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
of the way full with water doesn't

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.859 
of the way full with water doesn't
matter<00:01:55.609> what<00:01:55.820> temperature<00:01:56.270> in<00:01:56.359> all<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.689> use

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
matter what temperature in all this use

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.880 
matter what temperature in all this use
cold<00:01:57.170> water

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.320 

so<00:02:02.890> now<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.100> we<00:02:03.280> have<00:02:03.430> our<00:02:03.460> water<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.120> there

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
so now that we have our water in there

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.590 
so now that we have our water in there
what<00:02:05.320> you're<00:02:05.500> going<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.680> want<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:05.890> do<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:06.600> get

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
what you're going to want to do is get

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.910 
what you're going to want to do is get
some<00:02:07.840> salt<00:02:08.670> sea<00:02:09.670> salt<00:02:10.410> doesn't<00:02:11.410> matter<00:02:11.680> what

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
some salt sea salt doesn't matter what

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.680 
some salt sea salt doesn't matter what
type<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.190> this<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:12.820> what<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.390> and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
type I this is just what I have and

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.080 
type I this is just what I have and
you're<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.800> want<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.100> add<00:02:15.280> quite<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.030> bit

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
you're going to want to add quite a bit

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.480 
you're going to want to add quite a bit
of<00:02:16.270> salt<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.720> water<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.890> make<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.130> easier

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
of salt to the water to make it easier

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.830 
of salt to the water to make it easier
for<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:20.670> ions<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.940> separate<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.580> now<00:02:25.300> stir<00:02:25.690> it

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
for the ions to separate and now stir it

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.800 
for the ions to separate and now stir it
in<00:02:28.230> until<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.500> reach<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.010> maximum<00:02:30.690> amount<00:02:31.690> of

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
in until you reach the maximum amount of

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.880 
in until you reach the maximum amount of
salt<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.230> can<00:02:32.530> dissolve<00:02:34.020> thus<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.260> highest

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
salt that can dissolve thus the highest

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:47.300 
salt that can dissolve thus the highest
concentration<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.790> salt<00:02:37.030> water<00:02:37.239> possible

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.710 

okay<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.370> as<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.880> can<00:02:49.030> see<00:02:49.090> most<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.600> that's

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
okay so as you can see most of that's

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.620 
okay so as you can see most of that's
already<00:02:50.050> dissolved<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.770> then<00:02:51.600> using<00:02:52.600> some

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
already dissolved and then using some

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.170 
already dissolved and then using some
dish<00:02:53.530> soap<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.519> just<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.880> glass

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
dish soap this is just in a glass

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.600 
dish soap this is just in a glass
container<00:02:55.420> here<00:02:55.989> again<00:02:56.920> does<00:02:57.160> not<00:02:57.190> matter

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
container here again does not matter

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.520 
container here again does not matter
what<00:02:57.880> type<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.390> will<00:02:58.600> just<00:02:58.750> help<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.050> form

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
what type this will just help to form

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.280 
what type this will just help to form
the<00:02:59.800> bubbles<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.910> can<00:03:01.150> trap<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.660> hydrogen

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the bubbles that can trap the hydrogen

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.590 
the bubbles that can trap the hydrogen
in<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.590> oxygen<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:04.030> what<00:03:04.239> you're<00:03:04.390> going<00:03:04.540> to

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
in the oxygen so what you're going to

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.449 
in the oxygen so what you're going to
want<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.810> do<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.290> pour<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.890> little<00:03:06.130> bit<00:03:06.340> in

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
want to do is just pour a little bit in

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.759 
want to do is just pour a little bit in
just<00:03:06.640> like<00:03:06.730> that

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
just like that

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.710 
just like that
make<00:03:08.769> sure<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:08.950> pour<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.430> after<00:03:10.120> adding

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
make sure to pour it and after adding

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.630 
make sure to pour it and after adding
the<00:03:10.810> water<00:03:11.019> or<00:03:11.320> else<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.709> will<00:03:11.860> form<00:03:12.160> bubbles

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
the water or else it will form bubbles

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.300 
the water or else it will form bubbles
that<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.450> don't<00:03:13.810> want<00:03:14.049> don't<00:03:14.739> add<00:03:14.920> too<00:03:15.190> much

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
that you don't want don't add too much

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.560 
that you don't want don't add too much
of<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.579> or<00:03:15.820> else<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.120> will<00:03:16.180> be<00:03:16.299> too

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
of that or else it will be too

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.780 
of that or else it will be too
concentrated<00:03:17.940> okay<00:03:18.940> now<00:03:19.360> for<00:03:19.420> step<00:03:19.930> two<00:03:20.790> step

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
concentrated okay now for step two step

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.060 
concentrated okay now for step two step
two<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.329> get<00:03:22.630> your<00:03:22.780> device<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.500> be<00:03:23.620> used<00:03:23.890> for

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
two is to get your device to be used for

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.870 
two is to get your device to be used for
the<00:03:24.160> electrolysis<00:03:25.200> step<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:26.890> what<00:03:27.310> I've<00:03:27.519> done

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the electrolysis step so what I've done

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.960 
the electrolysis step so what I've done
is<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.480> get<00:03:28.570> 120<00:03:29.500> volt<00:03:29.769> power<00:03:30.070> adapter<00:03:30.760> any

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
is to get 120 volt power adapter any

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.000 
is to get 120 volt power adapter any
type<00:03:31.299> will<00:03:31.510> work<00:03:31.780> then<00:03:32.700> strip<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.850> wire<00:03:34.090> and

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
type will work then strip the wire and

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
type will work then strip the wire and
separate<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.130> positive<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:36.940> negative

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
separate the positive and the negative

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.590 
separate the positive and the negative
terminals<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.140> add<00:03:38.799> some<00:03:39.489> alligator<00:03:40.090> clips

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
terminals and add some alligator clips

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.050 
terminals and add some alligator clips
to<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.900> end<00:03:41.110> not<00:03:41.739> necessary<00:03:42.430> but<00:03:42.640> makes<00:03:42.910> it

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
to the end not necessary but makes it

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.120 
to the end not necessary but makes it
probably<00:03:43.660> ten<00:03:43.900> times<00:03:44.170> easier<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:45.390> then

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
probably ten times easier and then

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.500 
probably ten times easier and then
simply<00:03:48.130> get<00:03:48.820> some<00:03:49.060> aluminum<00:03:49.870> foil<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:51.510> fold

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
simply get some aluminum foil and fold

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.009 
simply get some aluminum foil and fold
it<00:03:52.750> up<00:03:52.840> into<00:03:53.049> two<00:03:53.500> strips<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:55.360> this

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
it up into two strips of this

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.229 
it up into two strips of this
approximate<00:03:56.769> length<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.579> will<00:03:57.760> fit<00:03:58.000> into

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
approximate length that will fit into

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.270 
approximate length that will fit into
your<00:03:58.390> cup<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:58.750> submerged<00:03:59.380> under<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.829> liquid

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
your cup and submerged under the liquid

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.910 
your cup and submerged under the liquid
so<00:04:01.000> now<00:04:01.150> what<00:04:01.360> we're<00:04:01.510> going<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.660> do<00:04:01.840> is<00:04:02.200> we're

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
so now what we're going to do is we're

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.070 
so now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.269> attach<00:04:06.090> one<00:04:07.090> of<00:04:07.150> these<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:08.739> this<00:04:08.889> end

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
going to attach one of these to this end

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.710 
going to attach one of these to this end
and<00:04:10.170> one<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.340> this<00:04:11.460> end<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:13.190> then<00:04:14.720> the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
and one to this end and then the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.430 
and one to this end and then the
solution<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.380> prepared<00:04:16.709> earlier

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
solution you prepared earlier

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.320 
solution you prepared earlier
right<00:04:19.440> there<00:04:20.180> simply<00:04:21.180> clip<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.750> onto<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.410> side

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
right there simply clip it onto the side

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.050 
right there simply clip it onto the side
make<00:04:24.330> sure<00:04:24.510> they're<00:04:24.660> long<00:04:24.900> enough<00:04:24.930> by<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.410> way

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
make sure they're long enough by the way

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.270 
make sure they're long enough by the way
clip<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.180> on<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.540> side<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.140> make<00:04:28.980> sure<00:04:29.040> it

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
clip it on to the side and make sure it

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.800 
clip it on to the side and make sure it
does<00:04:29.430> not<00:04:29.580> touch<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:29.970> bottom<00:04:32.390> let<00:04:33.390> me<00:04:33.480> see<00:04:33.720> if

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
does not touch the bottom let me see if

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.020 
does not touch the bottom let me see if
I<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:34.020> show<00:04:34.230> you<00:04:34.290> here<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.830> then<00:04:35.490> using<00:04:35.970> the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
I can show you here and then using the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.740 
I can show you here and then using the
alligator<00:04:36.480> clips<00:04:38.210> simply<00:04:39.210> clip<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
alligator clips simply clip it to the

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.800 
alligator clips simply clip it to the
side<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.200> your<00:04:40.320> container<00:04:40.770> like<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.810> there's

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
side of your container like that there's

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.910 
side of your container like that there's
the<00:04:43.080> first<00:04:43.260> one<00:04:43.500> done<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:46.200> second<00:04:46.560> one<00:04:46.680> on

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
the first one done and the second one on

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.910 
the first one done and the second one on
the<00:04:47.790> other<00:04:48.000> side<00:04:48.330> as<00:04:48.570> far<00:04:48.810> away<00:04:49.080> as<00:04:49.320> possible

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
the other side as far away as possible

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.380 
the other side as far away as possible
and<00:04:50.640> it<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.510> vital<00:04:51.950> that<00:04:52.950> these<00:04:53.250> do<00:04:53.610> not<00:04:53.640> touch

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
and it is vital that these do not touch

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.840 
and it is vital that these do not touch
or<00:04:54.840> I'll<00:04:55.440> simply<00:04:56.010> you'll<00:04:56.220> be<00:04:56.340> completing<00:04:56.820> a

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
or I'll simply you'll be completing a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.040 
or I'll simply you'll be completing a
circuit<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.510> no<00:04:58.380> bubbles<00:04:58.890> will<00:04:59.010> form<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.750> let

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
circuit and no bubbles will form so let

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.770 
circuit and no bubbles will form so let
me<00:05:01.110> just<00:05:01.260> attach<00:05:01.560> these<00:05:01.830> two<00:05:02.270> as<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.390> can<00:05:03.540> see

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
me just attach these two as you can see

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.850 
me just attach these two as you can see
it<00:05:03.900> can<00:05:04.020> be<00:05:04.080> quite<00:05:04.440> finicky<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:06.620> then<00:05:07.620> by

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
it can be quite finicky and then by

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.400 
it can be quite finicky and then by
looking<00:05:07.890> into<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.610> solution<00:05:09.120> let<00:05:10.110> me<00:05:10.230> show

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
looking into the solution let me show

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.900 
looking into the solution let me show
you<00:05:10.500> this<00:05:12.230> they<00:05:13.230> are<00:05:13.290> not<00:05:13.440> touching<00:05:13.860> they<00:05:14.850> are

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
you this they are not touching they are

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.100 
you this they are not touching they are
separated<00:05:16.220> that's<00:05:17.220> kind<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.490> hard<00:05:17.669> to<00:05:17.760> see

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
separated that's kind of hard to see

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.630 
separated that's kind of hard to see
okay<00:05:19.110> now<00:05:19.320> I<00:05:19.620> will<00:05:19.860> plug<00:05:20.250> it<00:05:20.370> into<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.610> wall

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
okay now I will plug it into the wall

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.510 
okay now I will plug it into the wall
and<00:05:21.120> show<00:05:21.330> you<00:05:21.419> what<00:05:21.570> starts<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:21.990> happen

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
and show you what starts to happen

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.860 
and show you what starts to happen
alright<00:05:23.520> everyone<00:05:23.760> I've<00:05:24.120> just<00:05:24.390> plugged<00:05:24.720> it

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
alright everyone I've just plugged it

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.350 
alright everyone I've just plugged it
into<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.080> wall<00:05:25.169> and<00:05:25.710> I'll<00:05:26.669> zoom<00:05:26.940> in<00:05:27.090> here<00:05:27.300> so

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
into the wall and I'll zoom in here so

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.580 
into the wall and I'll zoom in here so
you<00:05:27.540> can<00:05:27.870> tell<00:05:29.900> don't<00:05:30.900> know<00:05:31.020> if<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.200> can<00:05:31.350> see

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
you can tell don't know if you can see

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.570 
you can tell don't know if you can see
it<00:05:31.740> or<00:05:31.890> not<00:05:33.080> but<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.200> is<00:05:34.230> slightly<00:05:34.830> bubbling<00:05:35.490> at

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
it or not but it is slightly bubbling at

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.300 
it or not but it is slightly bubbling at
the<00:05:35.669> surface

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.550 

I<00:05:40.660> don't<00:05:41.660> know<00:05:41.750> if<00:05:41.840> you<00:05:41.900> can<00:05:42.050> tell<00:05:42.230> but<00:05:42.290> right
