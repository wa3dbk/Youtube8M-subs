screen<00:00:07.479> and<00:00:07.720> removing<00:00:08.230> the<00:00:08.380> main<00:00:08.559> bearing<00:00:09.009> top

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
screen and removing the main bearing top

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.280 
screen and removing the main bearing top
caps<00:00:09.519> this<00:00:10.150> will<00:00:10.299> allow<00:00:10.540> me<00:00:10.570> to<00:00:10.690> remove<00:00:11.049> the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
caps this will allow me to remove the

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.839 
caps this will allow me to remove the
bearing<00:00:11.650> journals<00:00:11.860> and<00:00:12.280> remove<00:00:12.700> the

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:12.849 
bearing journals and remove the

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.299 
bearing journals and remove the
crankshaft<00:00:13.150> eventually<00:00:13.919> one<00:00:14.919> thing<00:00:15.160> that

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
crankshaft eventually one thing that

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.280 
crankshaft eventually one thing that
becomes<00:00:15.610> immediately<00:00:15.879> evident<00:00:16.360> is<00:00:16.840> that<00:00:16.900> the

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
becomes immediately evident is that the

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.290 
becomes immediately evident is that the
cylinder<00:00:17.800> cover<00:00:18.010> bolts<00:00:18.520> and<00:00:18.700> entirely

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
cylinder cover bolts and entirely

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.970 
cylinder cover bolts and entirely
different<00:00:19.450> to<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.170> bolts<00:00:20.500> that<00:00:20.590> hold<00:00:20.770> the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
different to the bolts that hold the

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.130 
different to the bolts that hold the
main<00:00:21.190> bearing<00:00:21.610> caps<00:00:21.640> in<00:00:22.030> place<00:00:22.270> so<00:00:23.080> I'm

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
main bearing caps in place so I'm

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.720 
main bearing caps in place so I'm
putting<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.620> bolts<00:00:23.920> that<00:00:24.010> are<00:00:24.190> removed<00:00:24.520> in

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
putting the bolts that are removed in

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.940 
putting the bolts that are removed in
separate<00:00:25.270> plastic<00:00:25.450> bags<00:00:25.870> and<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.590> bags<00:00:26.620> are

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
separate plastic bags and the bags are

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.680 
separate plastic bags and the bags are
labeled<00:00:27.310> up<00:00:27.490> so<00:00:27.880> when<00:00:28.030> I<00:00:28.060> put<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.390> engine<00:00:28.660> back

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
labeled up so when I put the engine back

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.330 
labeled up so when I put the engine back
together<00:00:29.020> it<00:00:29.440> will<00:00:29.560> make<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:29.980> whole<00:00:30.130> process

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
together it will make the whole process

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.150 
together it will make the whole process
a<00:00:30.640> lot<00:00:30.880> quicker<00:00:31.259> however<00:00:32.259> I<00:00:32.500> do<00:00:32.590> not<00:00:32.920> need<00:00:33.100> a

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
a lot quicker however I do not need a

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.130 
a lot quicker however I do not need a
plastic<00:00:33.610> bag<00:00:33.820> for<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.390> bolts<00:00:34.720> that<00:00:34.840> hold<00:00:34.990> the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
plastic bag for the bolts that hold the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.990 
plastic bag for the bolts that hold the
big<00:00:35.380> end<00:00:35.530> brushes<00:00:35.950> in<00:00:36.070> place<00:00:36.310> because

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
big end brushes in place because

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.640 
big end brushes in place because
immediately<00:00:37.270> this<00:00:37.720> I'll<00:00:37.870> remove<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.320> big<00:00:38.470> end

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
immediately this I'll remove the big end

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.960 
immediately this I'll remove the big end

back<00:00:45.940> in<00:00:46.120> place<00:00:46.360> I<00:00:46.690> can<00:00:47.020> swing<00:00:47.320> up<00:00:47.470> the

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
back in place I can swing up the

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.500 
back in place I can swing up the
connecting<00:00:48.040> rods<00:00:48.220> out<00:00:48.400> of<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.640> way<00:00:48.910> and<00:00:49.180> what

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
connecting rods out of the way and what

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.650 
connecting rods out of the way and what
to<00:00:49.660> stay<00:00:49.930> there<00:00:50.260> in<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.820> steel<00:00:52.120> work<00:00:52.329> on<00:00:52.540> this

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
to stay there in the steel work on this

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.840 
to stay there in the steel work on this
engine<00:00:53.050> is<00:00:53.200> very<00:00:53.260> rusty<00:00:53.920> indeed<00:00:54.280> this<00:00:54.790> is

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
engine is very rusty indeed this is

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.550 
engine is very rusty indeed this is
really<00:00:55.300> going<00:00:55.450> to<00:00:55.510> take<00:00:55.630> some<00:00:56.020> cleaning<00:00:56.440> up

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
really going to take some cleaning up

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.590 
really going to take some cleaning up
but<00:00:57.220> never<00:00:57.370> mind<00:00:57.670> I<00:00:57.940> always<00:00:58.210> did<00:00:58.390> like<00:00:58.570> a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
but never mind I always did like a

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.300 
but never mind I always did like a
challenge

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.430 

to<00:01:01.640> take<00:01:01.850> off<00:01:02.090> our<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.510> eccentric<00:01:03.080> sand<00:01:03.350> the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
to take off our the eccentric sand the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.060 
to take off our the eccentric sand the
rods<00:01:03.650> this<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.520> last<00:01:04.700> one<00:01:04.880> coming<00:01:05.120> off<00:01:05.300> now

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.649 

you<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.700> put<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> balls<00:01:09.360> back<00:01:09.600> in

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you can see and put in the balls back in

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.740 
you can see and put in the balls back in
the<00:01:09.930> Fox<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.800> I<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:11.070> lose<00:01:11.250> them<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.750> now

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the Fox so I don't lose them and now

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.149 
the Fox so I don't lose them and now
there<00:01:12.960> should<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> drumroll<00:01:13.530> really

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
there should be a drumroll really

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.530 
there should be a drumroll really
because<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.760> remove<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.240> crankshaft

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
because I can remove the crankshaft

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.420 
because I can remove the crankshaft
complete<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.800> eccentrics<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.610> rods

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.310 

the<00:01:20.910> next<00:01:21.180> thing<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.690> to<00:01:21.840> remove<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the next thing to do is to remove the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.960 
the next thing to do is to remove the
eccentric<00:01:22.890> cheese<00:01:23.190> from<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> crankshaft

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
eccentric cheese from the crankshaft

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.480 
eccentric cheese from the crankshaft
entirely<00:01:24.630> along<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> outer<00:01:25.890> bearings

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
entirely along with the outer bearings

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.360 
entirely along with the outer bearings
and<00:01:26.700> then<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> crankshaft<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.160> all

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
and then I can see the crankshaft in all

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.000 
and then I can see the crankshaft in all
its<00:01:29.580> beauty<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.750> very<00:01:31.020> well<00:01:31.230> made<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:31.830> a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
its beauty it's very well made that's a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.100 
its beauty it's very well made that's a
good<00:01:32.190> sign<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.820> very<00:01:33.090> rusty<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.930> bad

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
good sign it's very rusty that's a bad

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.620 
good sign it's very rusty that's a bad
sign

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
sign

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.109 
sign
so<00:01:36.320> I'm<00:01:36.380> starting<00:01:36.650> off<00:01:37.010> on<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.310> piece<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.820> course

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
so I'm starting off on a piece of course

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.420 
so I'm starting off on a piece of course
sweater<00:01:38.420> dry<00:01:38.720> sandpaper<00:01:39.080> with<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.100> drop<00:01:40.310> of

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
oil to stop it from binding and it's

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.050

just<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.740> case<00:01:42.950> of<00:01:42.979> doing<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.610> for<00:01:43.670> quite<00:01:43.940> a

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
just the case of doing this for quite a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
before I carry on I must say that this

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.249 
before I carry on I must say that this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
took a lot longer than this even running

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.149 
took a lot longer than this even running
in<00:01:54.600> real<00:01:54.810> time<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.619> crankshaft

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
in real time to get this crankshaft

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.780 
in real time to get this crankshaft
clean<00:01:56.400> it<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.000> real<00:01:57.299> mess

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.670 

to<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.300> perfectly<00:02:00.750> honest<00:02:01.080> I<00:02:01.230> did<00:02:01.470> put<00:02:01.650> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
to be perfectly honest I did put the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.100 
to be perfectly honest I did put the
crankshaft<00:02:02.190> in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> lathe<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.940> spin<00:02:03.510> it<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
crankshaft in the lathe to spin it to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.160 
crankshaft in the lathe to spin it to
clean<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.650> shaft<00:02:04.890> sections<00:02:05.780> but<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:06.960> not

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
clean up the shaft sections but I'm not

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.660 
clean up the shaft sections but I'm not
showing<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.830> video<00:02:08.100> because<00:02:08.399> it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
showing this in the video because it's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.660 
showing this in the video because it's
far<00:02:08.880> too<00:02:08.910> dangerous<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.920> did<00:02:10.920> actually<00:02:11.310> video

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
far too dangerous I did actually video

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.820 
far too dangerous I did actually video
the<00:02:11.910> process<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.630> lathe<00:02:12.810> but<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.620> looked

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the process in the lathe but it looked

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.460 
the process in the lathe but it looked
really<00:02:14.280> bad<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.670> health<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.300> safety<00:02:15.360> nightmare

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
really bad a health and safety nightmare

it<00:03:25.220> really<00:03:25.520> did<00:03:25.670> take<00:03:25.940> me<00:03:26.060> quite<00:03:26.300> a<00:03:26.330> long<00:03:26.600> time

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840

it really did take me quite a long time
to<00:03:27.020> get<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.290> crankshaft<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.890> look<00:03:28.100> like<00:03:28.310> the

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
to get the crankshaft to look like the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.490 
to get the crankshaft to look like the
picture<00:03:28.819> you've<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:29.209> seen<00:03:29.480> because<00:03:30.350> it

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
picture you've just seen because it

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.460 
picture you've just seen because it
originally<00:03:31.190> looked<00:03:31.430> like<00:03:31.670> this
