00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and it's a great marketing aspect

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.139 
and it's a great marketing aspect
because<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.360> play<00:01:51.659> halo<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.610> Cortana<00:01:53.610> was<00:01:53.940> in

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
halo until she died in halo 4 so that's

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.789 
halo until she died in halo 4 so that's

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
over certain areas it can just do it

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.789

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
detected it and got everything I needed

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.860

without having to struggle through all

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.530 
without having to struggle through all
that<00:06:47.050> so<00:06:47.470> in<00:06:47.770> this<00:06:48.010> build<00:06:48.420> hopefully<00:06:49.420> they

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
that so in this build hopefully they

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.750 
that so in this build hopefully they
will<00:06:49.660> make<00:06:49.810> more<00:06:50.110> fine-tuned<00:06:50.770> adjustments<00:06:51.580> to

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
will make more fine-tuned adjustments to

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.790 
will make more fine-tuned adjustments to
it<00:06:51.940> there<00:06:52.450> are<00:06:52.540> some<00:06:52.690> bugs<00:06:52.960> here<00:06:53.380> and<00:06:53.560> there

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
it there are some bugs here and there

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.040 
it there are some bugs here and there
but<00:06:54.010> they're<00:06:54.790> getting<00:06:55.030> closer<00:06:55.270> to<00:06:55.450> making<00:06:55.930> you

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
but they're getting closer to making you

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.770 
but they're getting closer to making you
finish<00:06:56.410> so<00:06:56.890> from<00:06:57.160> my<00:06:57.190> opinion<00:06:57.610> she<00:06:58.060> can<00:06:58.630> get

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
finish so from my opinion she can get

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.750 
finish so from my opinion she can get
