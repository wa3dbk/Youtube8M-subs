00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.310 
dirt put on this tire and you're gonna
see<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.030> difference<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.600> how<00:01:51.810> matte<00:01:52.049> tire

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
see the difference in how matte tire

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
see the difference in how matte tire
because<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.220> dries<00:01:53.460> quickly<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.000> dries

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
because it dries quickly and dries

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.109 
because it dries quickly and dries
thoroughly<00:01:54.860> will<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:56.070> accumulate<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.790> dusty

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
thoroughly will not accumulate the dusty

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.959 
thoroughly will not accumulate the dusty
dirt<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> way<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:58.259> our<00:01:58.560> Murrells<00:01:58.969> extreme

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
dirt the way that our Murrells extreme

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:12.000 
dirt the way that our Murrells extreme
tire<00:02:00.180> shine<00:02:00.450> product<00:02:00.780> will

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.759 

we<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.129> met<00:02:13.310> tire<00:02:13.549> finish<00:02:13.909> on<00:02:14.379> the<00:02:15.379> left-hand

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
we have met tire finish on the left-hand

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.979 
we have met tire finish on the left-hand
side<00:02:15.859> and<00:02:16.609> we<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:16.760> armor-all<00:02:17.150> extreme<00:02:17.689> tire

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
side and we have armor-all extreme tire

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.470 
side and we have armor-all extreme tire
shine<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.709> right-hand<00:02:19.069> side<00:02:19.239> look<00:02:20.239> at<00:02:20.359> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
shine on the right-hand side look at the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.300 
shine on the right-hand side look at the
difference<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:20.989> how<00:02:21.109> much<00:02:21.319> dust<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.890> dirt<00:02:21.950> is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
difference in how much dust and dirt is

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.149 
difference in how much dust and dirt is
accumulated<00:02:22.969> on<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.420> side<00:02:23.890> versus<00:02:24.890> the

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
accumulated on this side versus the

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.759 
accumulated on this side versus the
titanium<00:02:25.760> matte<00:02:25.939> tire<00:02:26.180> finish<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:27.439> reason

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
titanium matte tire finish the reason

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.920 
titanium matte tire finish the reason
why<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:27.980> because<00:02:28.189> matte<00:02:28.849> tire<00:02:29.090> finishes<00:02:29.599> dry

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
why is because matte tire finishes dry

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.050 
why is because matte tire finishes dry
it's<00:02:30.230> dry<00:02:30.469> to<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.680> touch<00:02:30.769> it<00:02:31.549> doesn't<00:02:31.879> have

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
it's dry to the touch it doesn't have

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.360 
it's dry to the touch it doesn't have
that<00:02:32.329> formula<00:02:32.750> that's<00:02:33.409> going<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:34.040> dust

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
that formula that's going to have dust

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.520 
that formula that's going to have dust
and<00:02:34.579> dirt<00:02:34.670> adhere<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:35.359> so<00:02:35.870> your<00:02:36.019> tire<00:02:36.290> is

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
and dirt adhere to it so your tire is

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.280 
and dirt adhere to it so your tire is
gonna<00:02:36.739> stay<00:02:37.010> looking<00:02:37.430> fresher<00:02:37.939> cleaner<00:02:38.510> new

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
gonna stay looking fresher cleaner new

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.949 
gonna stay looking fresher cleaner new
or<00:02:39.469> longer<00:02:39.889> another<00:02:40.790> reason<00:02:41.180> why<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.389> fast

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
or longer another reason why the fast

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.690 
or longer another reason why the fast
and<00:02:42.230> even<00:02:42.470> drying<00:02:42.769> time<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.099> matte<00:02:43.430> tire

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
and even drying time of matte tire

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.789 
and even drying time of matte tire
finish<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.329> important<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.319> because<00:02:45.379> when

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
finish is so important is because when

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.500 
finish is so important is because when
you<00:02:45.889> put<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.220> on<00:02:46.340> your<00:02:46.519> tires

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.740 

it<00:02:50.510> stays<00:02:50.959> behind<00:02:51.859> your<00:02:52.189> tires<00:02:52.480> now<00:02:53.480> if<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:53.629> go

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
it stays behind your tires now if we go

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.119 
it stays behind your tires now if we go
ahead<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:53.900> put<00:02:54.079> that<00:02:54.169> on<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.439> tire<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.980> we

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
ahead and put that on the tire and we

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.129 
ahead and put that on the tire and we
spin<00:02:55.459> this<00:02:55.639> tire<00:02:55.909> to<00:02:56.569> simulate<00:02:56.750> driving

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
spin this tire to simulate driving

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.819 
spin this tire to simulate driving
conditions<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.989> can<00:03:00.139> see<00:03:00.349> after<00:03:00.469> spinning

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
conditions you can see after spinning

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.509 
conditions you can see after spinning
this<00:03:01.010> tire<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:02.480> there's<00:03:02.689> no<00:03:02.900> sling<00:03:03.260> on<00:03:03.590> this

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
this tire that there's no sling on this

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
guaranteed not to sling but can you say

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.059
