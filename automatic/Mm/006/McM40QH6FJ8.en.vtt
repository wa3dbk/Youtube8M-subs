00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
effect my hands off the handlebars which

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.170 
effect my hands off the handlebars which
you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.820> goes<00:01:53.939> nice<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you can see there but it goes nice and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.370 
you can see there but it goes nice and
straight<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:56.280> horn<00:01:57.170> there<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.259> go

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
straight and the horn there we go

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.200 
straight and the horn there we go
there's<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.520> last<00:01:59.700> thing<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.939> it's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
there's one last thing that it's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.539 
there's one last thing that it's
flashing<00:02:00.479> because<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:00.990> um<00:02:01.229> still<00:02:02.220> warming

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
flashing because it's um still warming

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.560 
flashing because it's um still warming
up<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:04.710> goes<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:06.000> got<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.299> running

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
up so that goes out we got the running

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.590 
up so that goes out we got the running
temperature<00:02:06.840> there<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.470> go
