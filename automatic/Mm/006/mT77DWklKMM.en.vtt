00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.589 
device which is the e I and I don't
think<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.709> mentioned<00:03:25.919> it<00:03:26.220> but<00:03:26.879> this<00:03:27.060> device<00:03:27.419> is

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
think I mentioned it but this device is

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.860 
think I mentioned it but this device is

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.559 
it is heavily skin so the Buddha time
was<00:03:34.769> pretty<00:03:34.889> decent<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.609> took<00:03:35.790> about<00:03:35.970> 20

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
was pretty decent it took about 20

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.289 
was pretty decent it took about 20
seconds<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.169> completely<00:03:37.709> boot<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.970> now<00:03:39.120> let's

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
seconds to completely boot so now let's

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.509 
seconds to completely boot so now let's
take<00:03:39.449> a<00:03:39.599> first<00:03:39.840> look<00:03:39.930> at<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.470> device<00:03:40.829> so<00:03:41.400> it's

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
take a first look at the device so it's

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.920 
take a first look at the device so it's
my<00:03:41.609> first<00:03:41.879> impressions<00:03:42.359> this<00:03:42.599> one<00:03:42.810> is

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
my first impressions this one is

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.080 
my first impressions this one is
actually<00:03:43.139> quite<00:03:43.979> fast<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.669> can<00:03:44.760> see<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.030> is

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
actually quite fast as you can see it is

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.449 
actually quite fast as you can see it is
also<00:03:45.299> pretty<00:03:45.780> smooth<00:03:46.229> and<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.979> runs<00:03:47.159> on<00:03:47.340> an

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
also pretty smooth and it runs on an

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.610 
also pretty smooth and it runs on an
octa-core<00:03:47.819> processor<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.989> as<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.560> said

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
octa-core processor and as I said

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.530 
octa-core processor and as I said
previously<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:50.400> runs<00:03:50.639> on<00:03:50.790> Android<00:03:51.269> 5.0

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
previously it runs on Android 5.0

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.080 
previously it runs on Android 5.0
lollipop<00:03:52.079> so<00:03:52.979> this<00:03:53.190> one<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.459> pretty<00:03:53.609> much<00:03:53.849> up

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
lollipop so this one is pretty much up

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.390 
lollipop so this one is pretty much up
