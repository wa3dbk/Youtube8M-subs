of the boat run it through the cleat and
that<00:03:28.349> will<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:29.250> will<00:03:29.400> stop<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.790> from<00:03:29.819> moving

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
that will that will stop it from moving

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.640 
that will that will stop it from moving
I<00:03:30.870> also<00:03:31.229> put<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.919> another<00:03:32.669> cleat<00:03:33.180> here<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.409> that

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
I also put a another cleat here so that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.920 
I also put a another cleat here so that
when<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.250> anchor<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.669> deployed<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.720> want

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
when the anchor is deployed and I want

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.619 
when the anchor is deployed and I want
to<00:03:36.989> tie<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.349> off<00:03:37.530> makes<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.669> real<00:03:38.790> easy<00:03:38.819> just

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
to tie that off makes it real easy just

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.140 
to tie that off makes it real easy just
run<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.019> rope<00:03:40.199> through<00:03:40.500> there<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
run the rope through there and the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.679 
run the rope through there and the
anchor<00:03:42.479> is<00:03:42.540> tied<00:03:42.720> off<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.639> I<00:03:44.639> actually<00:03:45.150> bought

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
anchor is tied off so I actually bought

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.140 
anchor is tied off so I actually bought
some<00:03:46.069> paddle<00:03:47.069> clips<00:03:47.310> which<00:03:47.549> I'm<00:03:47.699> not<00:03:47.849> using

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
some paddle clips which I'm not using

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.719 
some paddle clips which I'm not using
because<00:03:48.629> I<00:03:48.720> found<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.370> paddle

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
because I found that the the paddle

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.429 
because I found that the the paddle
holder<00:03:50.939> that<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.419> boat<00:03:51.629> comes<00:03:51.870> with<00:03:52.079> they<00:03:52.379> do

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
holder that this boat comes with they do

holder that this boat comes with they do
a<00:03:52.560> great<00:03:52.829> job<00:03:53.069> so<00:03:53.540> all<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.169> mounted

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
a great job so all of this is mounted

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.960 
a great job so all of this is mounted
out<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.859> way<00:03:55.979> so<00:03:56.040> I'll<00:03:56.280> still<00:03:56.519> have<00:03:56.699> full

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
out of the way so I'll still have full

I'm<00:04:24.420> going<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.720> be<00:04:24.840> building<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.350> card<00:04:25.890> so<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.340> can

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
I'm going to be building a card so I can

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.960 
I'm going to be building a card so I can
will<00:04:26.840> will<00:04:27.840> this<00:04:27.990> boat<00:04:28.260> down<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.490> harbor

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
will will this boat down to the harbor

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.730 
will will this boat down to the harbor
and<00:04:30.900> fish<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.940> by<00:04:33.420> mounting<00:04:33.900> this<00:04:34.080> instead

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
and fish and so by mounting this instead

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.790 
and fish and so by mounting this instead
of<00:04:35.240> modifying<00:04:36.240> this<00:04:36.390> crate<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.780> fit<00:04:36.960> down<00:04:37.140> into

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800

the down into that that area that
depressed<00:04:41.880> area<00:04:42.270> I<00:04:42.510> mounted<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.140> up<00:04:43.890> above<00:04:44.310> so

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
depressed area I mounted it up above so

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.660 
depressed area I mounted it up above so
that<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.240> can<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:46.200> know<00:04:46.320> regardless<00:04:47.130> if<00:04:47.520> it's
