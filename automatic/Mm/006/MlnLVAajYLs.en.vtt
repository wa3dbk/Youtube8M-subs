UNIVAC<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.360> some<00:00:48.840> hard<00:00:49.200> wood<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.649> chose<00:00:50.399> some

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
UNIVAC is some hard wood I chose some

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.369 
UNIVAC is some hard wood I chose some
red<00:00:50.940> oak<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> best<00:00:52.110> wood<00:00:52.350> I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
red oak because that was the best wood I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.189 
red oak because that was the best wood I
could<00:00:52.739> find<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.190> bolt<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.510> small<00:00:54.870> wooden

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
could find a bolt and a small wooden

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
could find a bolt and a small wooden

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
dimensions on the plans I used Google

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
dimensions on the plans I used Google
Sketchup<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.559> there's<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.799> Sketchup<00:01:05.280> file

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
Sketchup because there's a Sketchup file

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940

at<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> download<00:01:06.360> link<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> used<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
at the download link and then I used a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
at the download link and then I used a
little<00:01:07.979> tape<00:01:08.400> measure<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.180> come<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.600> all

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
little tape measure to come up with all

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410 
little tape measure to come up with all
of<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.470> dimensions<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> univac<00:01:11.790> we'll

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
of the dimensions for the univac we'll

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.450 
of the dimensions for the univac we'll
start<00:01:12.720> by<00:01:12.840> measuring<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.860> our<00:01:13.979> pieces

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
start by measuring out all of our pieces

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.190 
start by measuring out all of our pieces
and<00:01:14.760> then<00:01:15.090> cutting<00:01:15.450> them<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.750> don't<00:01:16.020> forget

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and then cutting them out don't forget

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.560 
and then cutting them out don't forget
to<00:01:16.470> use<00:01:16.500> safety<00:01:17.220> glasses<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.970> gloves<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
to use safety glasses and gloves if you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
to use safety glasses and gloves if you
like<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.990> used<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.680> bandsaw<00:01:20.280> because<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.759> was

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
like I used a bandsaw because that was

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.850 
like I used a bandsaw because that was
the<00:01:20.970> easiest<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> best<00:01:21.630> way<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.409> make<00:01:22.680> these

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the easiest and best way to make these

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
the easiest and best way to make these
small<00:01:23.100> cuts<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.939> hard<00:01:24.210> wood<00:01:24.390> once<00:01:24.659> all

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
small cuts in this hard wood once all

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.420 
small cuts in this hard wood once all
the<00:01:24.900> pieces<00:01:25.020> are<00:01:25.320> cut<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.130> time<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the pieces are cut out and it's time to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.700 
the pieces are cut out and it's time to
make<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.420> notches<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.259> those<00:01:28.409> are<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> little

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
make the notches and those are a little

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
make the notches and those are a little
bit<00:01:28.920> more<00:01:28.950> difficult<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
bit more difficult so you have to be a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.200 
bit more difficult so you have to be a
little<00:01:31.229> creative<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.009> bandsaw<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
little creative with your bandsaw or you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.420 
little creative with your bandsaw or you
could<00:01:33.390> probably<00:01:33.600> use<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> very<00:01:34.530> sharp<00:01:34.590> handsaw

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
could probably use a very sharp handsaw

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.249 
could probably use a very sharp handsaw
but<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.700> didn't<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.210> those<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.930> all

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
but I didn't have one of those so all

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
but I didn't have one of those so all
the<00:01:37.409> notches<00:01:37.650> are<00:01:38.070> cut<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> wood<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the notches are cut out in the wood and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420 
the notches are cut out in the wood and
now<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.780> time<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.079> drill<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.680> hole<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
now it's time to drill one hole for the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280 
now it's time to drill one hole for the
bolt<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:41.939> will<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.270> through<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.720> top<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
bolt which will go through the top and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.690 
bolt which will go through the top and
then<00:01:43.619> we'll<00:01:43.770> piece<00:01:44.009> everything<00:01:44.399> together

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
then we'll piece everything together

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.969 
then we'll piece everything together
just<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.450> how<00:01:45.689> everything<00:01:46.049> fits<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.860> may

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
just to see how everything fits you may

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.039 
just to see how everything fits you may
have<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> make<00:01:47.280> some<00:01:47.340> minor<00:01:47.820> cuts<00:01:48.240> or<00:01:48.479> some

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
have to make some minor cuts or some

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.679 
have to make some minor cuts or some
minor<00:01:49.470> sanding<00:01:50.189> or<00:01:50.399> grinding<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.149> some<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
minor sanding or grinding on some of the

fit nice and tight if you're happy the
way<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> pieces<00:01:55.619> fit<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.070> time<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.579> glue<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
way the pieces fit it's time to glue the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.149 
way the pieces fit it's time to glue the
four<00:01:57.090> sides<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.020> bottom<00:01:58.290> using<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.950> some

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
wood glue well all the pieces were cut

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.340 
wood glue well all the pieces were cut
out<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.460> amazingly<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.240> fit<00:02:03.479> together<00:02:03.630> now

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
out and amazingly they fit together now

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.289 
out and amazingly they fit together now
I'm<00:02:04.649> not<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> master<00:02:05.189> woodworker<00:02:05.579> that's<00:02:06.119> why<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
I'm not a master woodworker that's why I

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.690 
I'm not a master woodworker that's why I
said<00:02:06.869> amazingly<00:02:07.530> because<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.069> wasn't<00:02:08.550> sure<00:02:08.670> how

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
said amazingly because I wasn't sure how

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.900 
said amazingly because I wasn't sure how
all<00:02:09.239> these<00:02:09.509> small<00:02:10.349> cuts<00:02:10.860> would<00:02:11.160> all<00:02:11.489> fit

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
all these small cuts would all fit

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.700 
all these small cuts would all fit
together<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.450> how<00:02:12.510> well<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> would<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.290> and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
together and how well I would do and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.400 
together and how well I would do and
there<00:02:13.890> are<00:02:14.100> some<00:02:14.490> gaps<00:02:14.910> not<00:02:15.840> sure<00:02:16.020> if<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.230> can

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
there are some gaps not sure if you can

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.780 
there are some gaps not sure if you can
see<00:02:16.650> them<00:02:16.770> or<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.100> there<00:02:17.220> are<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> few<00:02:17.640> gaps

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
see them or not but there are a few gaps

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.280 
see them or not but there are a few gaps
that<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.120> really<00:02:18.360> don't<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.050> what<00:02:19.200> I'm

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
that I really don't like so what I'm

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.840 
that I really don't like so what I'm
going<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.610> fill<00:02:20.820> this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
going to do is I'm going to fill this

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.120 
going to do is I'm going to fill this
with<00:02:21.030> some<00:02:21.360> plastic<00:02:21.600> would<00:02:22.110> do<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.740> little<00:02:22.920> bit

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
with some plastic would do a little bit

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.520 
with some plastic would do a little bit
more<00:02:23.160> sanding<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.110> last<00:02:25.140> few

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
more sanding to it and then the last few

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.760 
more sanding to it and then the last few
steps<00:02:25.770> are<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.750> assemble<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.870> top<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.500> bolt

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
steps are to assemble the top the bolt

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.100 
steps are to assemble the top the bolt
and<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.340> little<00:02:29.580> pin<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.150> see<00:02:30.630> how<00:02:30.810> our

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
and the little pin and see how our

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.560 
and the little pin and see how our
universe<00:02:31.530> works

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
universe works

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.970 
universe works
after<00:02:33.570> taking<00:02:33.750> another<00:02:34.110> look<00:02:34.320> at<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.560> bolt<00:02:34.800> I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
after taking another look at the bolt I

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.310 
after taking another look at the bolt I
got<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.370> decided<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:36.120> wooden<00:02:36.480> dowel<00:02:36.780> would<00:02:37.170> be

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
got I decided a wooden dowel would be

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.630 
got I decided a wooden dowel would be
much<00:02:37.530> better<00:02:37.710> because<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.190> could<00:02:38.340> run<00:02:38.490> it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
much better because I could run it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.400 
much better because I could run it
straight<00:02:38.880> down<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.510> then<00:02:39.720> flush<00:02:40.050> with<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
straight down and then flush with the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.470 
straight down and then flush with the
top<00:02:40.440> three<00:02:41.250> small<00:02:41.520> blocks<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.090> were<00:02:42.240> cut<00:02:42.450> out

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
top three small blocks that were cut out

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.570 
top three small blocks that were cut out
or<00:02:42.720> glued<00:02:42.990> together<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.620> put<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.250> corner

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
or glued together and put in the corner

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.700 
or glued together and put in the corner
and<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.510> dowel<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:46.020> tapped<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.500> place

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
and then the dowel is tapped in place

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.250 
and then the dowel is tapped in place
and<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> slot<00:02:48.120> needs<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.600> be<00:02:48.690> cut<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.080> one

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
and then a slot needs to be cut in one

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.840 
and then a slot needs to be cut in one
of<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.410> pieces<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.130> do<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.670> just

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
of the pieces so to do that I just

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.210 
of the pieces so to do that I just
drilled<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.360> bunch<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.690> holes<00:02:51.870> used<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.920> rough

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
drilled a bunch of holes used a rough

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.550 
drilled a bunch of holes used a rough
hand<00:02:53.460> saw<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.970> had<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.540> then<00:02:54.870> filed<00:02:55.230> down

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
hand saw that I had and then filed down

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.650 
hand saw that I had and then filed down
the<00:02:55.710> edges<00:02:55.860> okay<00:02:56.670> we're<00:02:56.820> almost<00:02:56.940> done<00:02:57.180> one

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the edges okay we're almost done one

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.050 
the edges okay we're almost done one
more<00:02:57.690> small<00:02:58.440> hole<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.490> for<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.760> very

the box and after some more sanding it

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.180 
the box and after some more sanding it
was<00:03:06.840> pretty<00:03:07.020> happy<00:03:07.350> with<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> way<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.890> box

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
was pretty happy with the way this box

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.460 
was pretty happy with the way this box
turned<00:03:08.640> out<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.480> it's<00:03:09.840> time<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.320> add<00:03:10.440> some

and<00:03:13.560> here's<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.730> secret<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.180> opening<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
and here's the secret to opening up the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.650 
and here's the secret to opening up the
u-dub<00:03:16.320> ox<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:17.190> small<00:03:17.460> dowel<00:03:17.790> must<00:03:18.210> be<00:03:18.330> removed

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
u-dub ox the small dowel must be removed

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.300 
u-dub ox the small dowel must be removed
and<00:03:18.960> if<00:03:19.080> you'd<00:03:19.200> leave<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.920> little<00:03:20.190> bit

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
and if you'd leave it just a little bit

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.950 
and if you'd leave it just a little bit
up<00:03:20.430> your<00:03:20.610> fingernail<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.300> grab<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.600> and

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
up your fingernail can grab it and

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.620 
up your fingernail can grab it and
remove<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.620> then<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.460> top<00:03:23.670> piece<00:03:23.970> will<00:03:24.270> pivot

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
remove it then the top piece will pivot
