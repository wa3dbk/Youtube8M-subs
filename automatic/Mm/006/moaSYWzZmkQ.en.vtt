00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.110 
ahead and build this fire up a little
bit<00:04:42.770> so<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.039> can<00:04:43.070> see<00:04:43.250> what<00:04:43.640> it<00:04:43.729> would<00:04:43.820> be<00:04:43.880> like

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
bit so you can see what it would be like

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.050 
bit so you can see what it would be like
