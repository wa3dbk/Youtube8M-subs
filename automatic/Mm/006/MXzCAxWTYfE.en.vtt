00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
think we can go all the way and we

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.980 
think we can go all the way and we
proved<00:01:18.470> against<00:01:18.830> Stanford<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:20.690> we<00:01:20.810> can

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
proved against Stanford that that we can

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.359 
proved against Stanford that that we can
be<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.440> top<00:01:21.770> 10<00:01:22.009> school<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:22.810> it's<00:01:23.810> just<00:01:23.990> been

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
be a top 10 school and it's just been

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.540 
be a top 10 school and it's just been
yeah<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:25.399> mean

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
yeah I mean

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.790 
yeah I mean
it's<00:01:27.270> been<00:01:27.480> years<00:01:27.660> since<00:01:27.810> since<00:01:28.290> cows<00:01:28.500> being

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
it's been years since since cows being

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.150 
it's been years since since cows being
tucked<00:01:29.160> in<00:01:29.340> school<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.740> saw<00:01:31.740> how<00:01:31.950> much

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
tucked in school and I saw how much

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.010 
tucked in school and I saw how much
meant<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.240> juniors<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:33.840> team

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
meant to all the juniors on this team

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.680 
meant to all the juniors on this team
that<00:01:34.050> they<00:01:34.740> haven't<00:01:35.130> beat<00:01:35.400> Stanford<00:01:35.880> yet<00:01:36.090> in

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
that they haven't beat Stanford yet in

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.930 
that they haven't beat Stanford yet in
their<00:01:36.870> time<00:01:37.080> here<00:01:37.260> so<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:38.190> it<00:01:38.490> might<00:01:38.910> be

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
their time here so I think it might be

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.430 
their time here so I think it might be
even<00:01:39.150> bigger<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.600> them<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.050> is<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.320> me

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
even bigger for them that it is for me

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.180 
even bigger for them that it is for me
coming<00:01:40.800> in<00:01:40.980> as<00:01:41.070> freshmen<00:01:42.020> but<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.950> seemed

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
coming in as freshmen but but it seemed

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.980 
coming in as freshmen but but it seemed
this<00:01:44.400> I<00:01:44.580> think<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:44.940> can<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.330> mean<00:01:45.690> there's<00:01:45.870> no

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
this I think we can I mean there's no

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.850 
this I think we can I mean there's no
teams<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.560> can't<00:01:46.770> beat<00:01:48.860> obviously

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
teams that we can't beat obviously

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.050 
teams that we can't beat obviously
there's<00:01:50.040> we're<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.400> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.580> be<00:01:50.640> favorites

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
there's we're not going to be favorites

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.350 
there's we're not going to be favorites
against<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.660> really<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.560> good<00:01:52.710> teams<00:01:52.950> but

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
against it really really good teams but

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.240 
against it really really good teams but
but<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.480> proved<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.050> we<00:01:55.410> can<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.100> beat

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
but we proved that we can we can beat

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.970 
but we proved that we can we can beat
the<00:01:56.460> best<00:01:56.910> teams<00:01:57.150> in<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.330> country<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.980> so

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
the best teams in the country and so

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.910 
the best teams in the country and so
that's<00:01:59.580> that's<00:01:59.940> what<00:02:00.150> we<00:02:00.330> decide<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.990> go

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
that's that's what we decide to do a go

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.220 
that's that's what we decide to do a go
