00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
Hey so today I got my methods for

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.150 
Hey so today I got my methods for
Burford<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.400> methods<00:00:05.730> faster<00:00:06.350> and<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.799> thought

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
Burford and methods faster and I thought

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.810 
Burford and methods faster and I thought
I'll<00:00:08.460> make<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.210> review<00:00:09.920> so<00:00:10.920> first<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.460> all<00:00:11.580> I

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
I'll make a review so first of all I

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.810 
I'll make a review so first of all I
bought<00:00:12.150> them<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.420> master<00:00:13.049> Chun<00:00:13.490> I'll<00:00:14.490> put<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
bought them on master Chun I'll put the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.590 
bought them on master Chun I'll put the
link<00:00:15.000> for<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:16.350> puzzles<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> description

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
link for the puzzles in the description

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.450 
link for the puzzles in the description
so<00:00:18.600> yeah<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.230> Cobra<00:00:19.590> score<00:00:19.859> was<00:00:20.070> eighteen

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
so yeah the Cobra score was eighteen

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.939 
so yeah the Cobra score was eighteen
dollars<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:20.970> five<00:00:21.810> by<00:00:21.990> five<00:00:22.199> verses<00:00:22.529> twenty

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
dollars and five by five verses twenty

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.480 
dollars and five by five verses twenty
eight<00:00:23.039> dollars<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:25.590> that's<00:00:25.800> forty<00:00:26.279> six

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
eight dollars so that's forty six

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
eight dollars so that's forty six
dollars<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.939> total<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.810> there's<00:00:28.199> no

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
dollars in total because there's no

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.120 
dollars in total because there's no
shipping<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.830> that's<00:00:29.760> pretty<00:00:29.939> cool<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:31.130> they

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
shipping and that's pretty cool now they

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.850 
shipping and that's pretty cool now they
both<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> standard<00:00:33.300> color<00:00:33.600> scheme<00:00:34.520> and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
both have a standard color scheme and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.030 
both have a standard color scheme and
what<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.040> may<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.610> already<00:00:38.820> noticed<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
what you may be already noticed that the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.639 
what you may be already noticed that the
keep<00:00:41.250> doesn't<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.790> any<00:00:41.969> stickers<00:00:42.530> they<00:00:43.530> have

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
keep doesn't have any stickers they have

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.299 
keep doesn't have any stickers they have
like<00:00:43.890> plastic<00:00:44.430> style<00:00:45.079> plastic<00:00:46.079> towels<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.160 

so<00:00:50.309> that's<00:00:50.670> pretty<00:00:50.969> cool<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.629> don't<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.989> any

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
so that's pretty cool you don't have any

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.330 
so that's pretty cool you don't have any
to<00:00:52.260> take<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> problem<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:56.329> now<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
to take a problem so I like that now and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.799 
to take a problem so I like that now and
the<00:00:59.340> corners<00:00:59.699> off<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.030> forward<00:01:00.359> forward<00:01:00.600> as

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the corners off for forward forward as

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.039 
the corners off for forward forward as
the<00:01:01.050> logo<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.859> methods<00:01:02.570> says<00:01:03.570> message

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the logo of methods says message

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
the logo of methods says message
challenge<00:01:04.680> making<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.729> see<00:01:06.860> ring<00:01:08.210> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
challenge making you can see ring so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.050 
challenge making you can see ring so
here<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.890> have<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.979> challenge<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.820> I'm

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
here I have a challenge and I'm

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.539 
here I have a challenge and I'm
classified<00:01:12.950> below<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.130> ease<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.299> center<00:01:18.170> okay

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
classified below go ease and center okay

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:26.390 
classified below go ease and center okay
so<00:01:20.549> let's<00:01:21.210> comparison<00:01:21.990> side<00:01:24.560> now<00:01:25.560> reaching

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
so let's comparison side now reaching

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.800 
so let's comparison side now reaching
for<00:01:26.580> fun<00:01:26.900> 5x5<00:01:27.900> are<00:01:28.500> much<00:01:28.799> smaller<00:01:29.450> than<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
for fun 5x5 are much smaller than one of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
for fun 5x5 are much smaller than one of
these<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.630> they're<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.829> big<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:36.000> FOB

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
these so they're really big the FOB

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.690 
these so they're really big the FOB
refers<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.930> big<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.979> they'd<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.729> cheap<00:01:39.200> eg6

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
refers like big as they'd be cheap eg6

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.440 
refers like big as they'd be cheap eg6
so<00:01:41.700> they're<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> cute

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.920 

okay<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:46.750> first<00:01:47.159> performances<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.689> cover

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
okay so first performances the cover

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.730 
okay so first performances the cover
four<00:01:50.200> times<00:01:50.439> very<00:01:50.860> wrong<00:01:51.159> we<00:01:51.729> think<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:53.710> has

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
four times very wrong we think it has

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.760 
four times very wrong we think it has
even<00:01:54.399> better<00:01:54.729> turning<00:01:55.180> down<00:01:55.330> each<00:01:56.170> gene<00:01:56.500> for<00:01:56.740> a

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
even better turning down each gene for a

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.410 
even better turning down each gene for a
fit<00:01:59.340> and<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:01.509> also<00:02:01.930> cuts<00:02:02.530> coma<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.420> little

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
fit and it also cuts coma a little

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
fit and it also cuts coma a little
better<00:02:05.009> because<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.250> one<00:02:06.869> actually<00:02:07.869> doesn't

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
better because this one actually doesn't

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.009 
better because this one actually doesn't
have<00:02:08.860> any<00:02:09.160> common<00:02:09.759> coding<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:12.519> figured<00:02:13.090> so

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
have any common coding so I figured so

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.990 
have any common coding so I figured so
I'd<00:02:14.230> say<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.099> focal<00:02:15.459> for<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.760> better

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
I'd say that the focal for is better

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.960 
I'd say that the focal for is better
than<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.360> Eastern<00:02:16.690> cheap<00:02:16.930> scared<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.310> get

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
than the Eastern cheap scared of the get

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.500 
than the Eastern cheap scared of the get
churning<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.450> coma<00:02:20.019> coding<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:21.510> perform

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
churning and coma coding you can perform

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.910 
churning and coma coding you can perform
cool<00:02:22.870> finger<00:02:23.170> traits<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.560> stuff<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:26.110> I'd

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
cool finger traits and stuff so that I'd

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.690 
cool finger traits and stuff so that I'd
say<00:02:27.220> two<00:02:27.280> pretty<00:02:27.790> good<00:02:27.970> ichi<00:02:29.010> now<00:02:30.150> classified

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
say two pretty good ichi now classified

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.509 
say two pretty good ichi now classified
doesn't<00:02:33.700> turn<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:35.489> advert<00:02:36.489> over<00:02:36.819> here<00:02:39.420> so

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
doesn't turn that advert over here so

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.400 
doesn't turn that advert over here so
it's<00:02:42.519> very<00:02:42.640> hard<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.150> handle<00:02:43.390> listen<00:02:43.900> it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
it's very hard to handle listen it

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.490 
it's very hard to handle listen it
doesn't<00:02:44.709> have<00:02:45.370> any<00:02:45.760> corner<00:02:46.150> cutting<00:02:46.500> by

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
doesn't have any corner cutting by

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.349 
doesn't have any corner cutting by
guillotine<00:02:48.000> sacrifice<00:02:51.000> that's<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:52.209> not

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
guillotine sacrifice that's just not

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.770 
guillotine sacrifice that's just not
good<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:54.609> very<00:02:54.730> hard<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.150> do<00:02:55.420> finger

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
good so it's very hard to do finger

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.610 
good so it's very hard to do finger
tricks<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:56.290> stuff<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:58.049> another<00:02:59.049> problem<00:02:59.320> is

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
tricks and stuff and another problem is

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.680 
tricks and stuff and another problem is
that<00:02:59.829> he<00:03:00.489> was<00:03:00.670> really<00:03:01.090> big

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
that he was really big

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.710 
that he was really big
yeah<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.920> have<00:03:03.400> actually<00:03:03.549> quite<00:03:03.940> big<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.390> but<00:03:04.690> I

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
yeah I have actually quite big and but I

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.199 
yeah I have actually quite big and but I
think<00:03:05.049> it's<00:03:05.290> very<00:03:05.470> hard<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.760> keep<00:03:06.880> seeing

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
think it's very hard to keep seeing

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.110 
think it's very hard to keep seeing
tricks<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.690> stuff<00:03:07.870> with<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.410> key<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.730> I

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
tricks and stuff with this key so I

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.099 
tricks and stuff with this key so I
still<00:03:10.420> use<00:03:10.630> this<00:03:11.130> each<00:03:12.130> gene<00:03:12.459> five<00:03:12.670> by<00:03:12.850> five

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
still use this each gene five by five

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.319 
still use this each gene five by five
for<00:03:14.109> speed<00:03:14.350> solving<00:03:14.950> because<00:03:15.280> it's<00:03:15.850> much<00:03:16.060> easy

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
for speed solving because it's much easy

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:23.309 
for speed solving because it's much easy
time<00:03:18.420> okay<00:03:19.420> now<00:03:20.160> what<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.280> pretty<00:03:21.940> cool<00:03:22.319> is

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
time okay now what is pretty cool is

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.620 
time okay now what is pretty cool is
that<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:24.670> can<00:03:24.850> actually<00:03:25.030> turn<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:27.630> layers

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
that you can actually turn the layers

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.879 
that you can actually turn the layers
without<00:03:29.530> holding<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.160> top<00:03:30.430> layer<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:31.889> that's

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
without holding the top layer so that's

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.809 
without holding the top layer so that's
great<00:03:33.040> cool<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:35.500> notice<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.190> noticed<00:03:37.180> it

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
great cool I just notice it noticed it

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.619 
great cool I just notice it noticed it
okay

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
okay

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.610 
okay
so<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.969> said<00:03:42.969> before<00:03:43.689> word<00:03:43.989> for<00:03:44.170> word<00:03:44.319> really

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
so I said before word for word really

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.520 
so I said before word for word really
work<00:03:44.829> for<00:03:45.010> mommy

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
work for mommy

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.349 
work for mommy
because<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.859> think<00:03:48.159> a<00:03:48.519> lot<00:03:48.549> better<00:03:48.700> than<00:03:49.030> the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
because I think a lot better than the

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.520 
because I think a lot better than the
eastern<00:03:50.200> folder<00:03:50.530> for<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:52.480> yeah<00:03:52.689> my<00:03:52.989> wife<00:03:53.349> after

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
five is really not that good and I

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.030 
five is really not that good and I
wouldn't<00:03:58.359> recommend<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.349> buy<00:03:59.379> it<00:03:59.560> if<00:03:59.829> you

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
wouldn't recommend you to buy it if you

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.119 
wouldn't recommend you to buy it if you
wanted<00:04:00.370> burn<00:04:01.239> your<00:04:01.480> speedcube<00:04:02.019> it's<00:04:02.920> more

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
wanted burn your speedcube it's more

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.300 
wanted burn your speedcube it's more
like<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.459> collector's<00:04:04.209> item<00:04:04.569> for<00:04:04.780> me<00:04:05.620> because

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
like a collector's item for me because

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
it looks really cool with the plastic

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.140 
it looks really cool with the plastic
tiles<00:04:09.879> I<00:04:10.150> really<00:04:10.359> like<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:12.280> yeah<00:04:12.519> I<00:04:12.700> feel

tiles I really like that so yeah I feel

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.520 
tiles I really like that so yeah I feel
like<00:04:13.329> it<00:04:13.540> but<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:14.079> won't<00:04:14.889> do<00:04:15.040> any<00:04:15.219> stalls<00:04:15.519> of<00:04:15.849> it

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
like it but I won't do any stalls of it

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.189 
like it but I won't do any stalls of it
okay<00:04:17.530> so<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:18.039> will<00:04:18.940> command<00:04:19.479> you<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.720> box<00:04:19.930> one

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
okay so I will command you to box one

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.620 
okay so I will command you to box one
because<00:04:20.859> it's<00:04:21.009> just<00:04:21.220> awful<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:24.090> maybe<00:04:25.090> I'm

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
because it's just awful and maybe I'm

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.469 
because it's just awful and maybe I'm
going<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.930> practice<00:04:26.199> for<00:04:26.620> bathroom<00:04:26.949> and<00:04:27.479> I

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
going to practice for bathroom and I

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.749 
going to practice for bathroom and I
will<00:04:28.720> do<00:04:28.870> some<00:04:29.080> videos<00:04:29.380> although<00:04:30.280> I'm<00:04:30.460> not

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
will do some videos although I'm not

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.140 
will do some videos although I'm not
that<00:04:30.820> dude<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:32.110> best<00:04:32.289> time<00:04:32.500> is<00:04:32.620> like<00:04:32.940> one<00:04:33.940> and

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
that dude the best time is like one and

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.040 
that dude the best time is like one and
a<00:04:34.210> half<00:04:34.360> minutes<00:04:35.310> 1:30<00:04:36.310> so<00:04:36.669> that's<00:04:37.570> not<00:04:37.840> really

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
a half minutes 1:30 so that's not really

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.320 
a half minutes 1:30 so that's not really
good

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
good

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.860 
good
okay<00:04:40.330> so<00:04:40.860> that's<00:04:41.860> it<00:04:42.039> I<00:04:42.190> guess<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.669> I'll<00:04:43.539> see

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
okay so that's it I guess and I'll see

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.289 
okay so that's it I guess and I'll see
you<00:04:43.960> next<00:04:43.990> time
