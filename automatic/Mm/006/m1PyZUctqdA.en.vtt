00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.950
 so hello again and I want you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.000
 show your video report and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.780
 making master keys 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.130
 that for us we take the usual 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.070
 hacksaw blade and downloaded patterns 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.700
 or saved sites that will be 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.930
 shown below the video 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:32.970
 take a hacksaw came to on his 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.030
 sanded to the metallic luster 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:40.320
 There is to remove his helmet cover to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.690
 worn better template what we do with 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.630
 a template, i.e., a printed template 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.700
 its site first of all to us 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.810
 need to cut 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.010
 but before you print it 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.829
 look read the site carefully 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.079
 it needs to be increased to the desired scale 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.180
 when printing out then it is on the leaves of moisture 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:08.130
 it will be right what is better in the future 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.450
 will affect your pressure . 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:21.170
 so we need to cut first 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:21.170
 you need a master key here cut it 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.450
 no matter how neatly there neatly 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:38.620
 the difference is desirable to just do it all 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:46.340
 more or less look like everything is right 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:53.000
 cut out and and and and and you this thing now 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:56.630
 we will put our canvas that from this 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 do we can cut our pattern in 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.330
 Water is applied to his side where 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.640
 paint where the handsaw printed 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.690
 ground to ground side 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.060
 metals and we press but before that we 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.400
 need to warm up 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.230
 Iron at home at each of youtube so I 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.550
 I do not think that it will be some complexity 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:27.920
 Will we come looking for a template? 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.720
 and we roll it with a hot iron 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.150
 iron to paint 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:38.060
 as carefully as possible transferred to 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:40.780
 metal that's basically all the magic and 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.209
 magic to be transferred pattern 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.130
 print out a piece of metal that we 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.120
 do further just leg so tear 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.810
 no need we can again have our 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.850
 board with a template glued on by other 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.030
 subject and erase it 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.930
 we see that in principle the paper itself 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.340
 moves away 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:14.660
 as it should be and paint our template 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:19.990
 it remains to be seen 3 here we finished it 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:23.260
 it's about 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.660
 it turns out we erase the paper and the red 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.670
 which led the state leaves good 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.470
 trail on which you can already 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.530
 directly produce here in 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.640
 principle what i wanted to say by 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:45.390
 pattern application on paper 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:47.850
 regulation it further what we do 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.790
 go directly to making 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.310
 already vanity did not pass it to making 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.250
 so I showed you protection 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.660
 protection so that the eyes do not fly 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.430
 on anyway you have to wait 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.590
 need a glass of water to cool and 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.820
 principle all hands preferably from there 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:13.570
 growing from where it is necessary and possible to work 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:16.000
 we start something that heats up but we 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.670
 its cool glass of water grandfather 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.760
 especially firstly for convenience 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.770
 arugula second to metal not 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:29.320
 turned and the spring is worth such a steel 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.150
 breaking very break overheat metal 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.430
 Here and heaped Plato precisely 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.080
 breaks down and to that 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:41.300
 this is how to prevent and wet it 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.900
 there is cooling the heated metal 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.770
 which will further increase the term 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.860
 our actions . like this 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.860
 show every time you browse 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.069
 to prevent unnecessary downloads 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.110
 to make approximately perfect 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:02.659
 it would be clear not a robot with a bosch crossing 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:06.379
 it will turn out there as it should but by sight 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:09.409
 approximately so carefully beautiful 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.979
 it turned out then you will be good with 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.719
 the master key that you will work 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.610
 will bring great pleasure and 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:20.919
 too lazy here just so here 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:24.289
 do and then success is guaranteed to you 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.060
 but most importantly do not forget you can 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.719
 of course and without protection but it is on your fear 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.060
 and risk 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:31.099
 protection is this muzzle helmet 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.370
 who puts on her head to be 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.110
 didn't see anything but it's like coming from 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.830
 my experience can tell it happens 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.960
 sadly 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.530
 not that straight from my very 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.460
 deplorable experience but flying godless in general 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:51.139
 these pebbles and polishing something that flies away from 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:54.529
 confused that's what we got ready 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.620
 master keys now we need but it is by 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.279
 of course you need them for the pain of the night 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.310
 the club 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:03.050
 bring to a state more or less 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:08.409
 it is advisable that such a reasonable 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:13.639
 It was iron that we got I 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:15.529
 I think very well, in principle, and I 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.629
 I think you will not worse therefore 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:23.319
 dare all your hands add more 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:27.229
 try as nothing 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.849
 wouldn't hurt anyone else if you 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.879
 like this video subscribe to
