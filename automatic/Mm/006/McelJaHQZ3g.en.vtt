00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.940
 code master guys here and now tÃ¡ 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.920
 giving you one more gameplay 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.440
 commented on the channel and organized is not 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.790
 starting a new series on the dedicated channel 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.320
 class in black ops 2 and the 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.500
 first gun I'll give tip for 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.480
 you are an assault the best assault of the 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.420
 game in my humble opinion to n94 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.820
 So let's go to our room. 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.370
 class tip reminding the guys that I 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.089
 class will give advice based on the tpm 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.739
 and if I and mastered xuxa that hence the changes 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.659
 something at least the way the 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.449
 games your game I gave you my game of one 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.210
 way and the minister of another then let's 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.129
 although here for the tip is to start here 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.379
 putting seven of advantage 2 to stay 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.389
 with two here and we're leaving 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.750
 I left edge and I like to use the 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:08.420
 hard line to get the strikes 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.329
 more easily here in the series of 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.070
 advantages 2 obstinacy with certainty this 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.909
 here is pec is essential for your 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.280
 classes 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.439
 what I do here if you do not know it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.969
 here when you take a shot the 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.039
 families goes up there and with it here 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:25.039
 very little actually going up or 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.899
 It goes up almost here and here in the 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.390
 Second, I know you put it on. 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.829
 opportunist because balloon 2 ends up 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.539
 fast then you will need to get the 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.990
 punishment of the ground and opportunistic you 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.640
 can do it here in advantage 3 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.070
 Dude, I like to use the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.630
 when you run you can pull 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.299
 Look faster after running. 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.180
 and now we are going to pass next good taste 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.970
 to use three pronged attachments and which are 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.460
 the 3 balconies that will make your stay 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.159
 aim suck faster managed to pull 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.869
 my fastest ammunition door I 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.520
 I really like to use it too. 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.590
 loads fast but I like the door 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.960
 ammunition to have a greater ability 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.569
 I can pull more and carry more 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.300
 Quick thus managed to kill more and 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.720
 here in the third an essential annex for 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.760
 the salt stock making stock 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.170
 the stock becomes more mobile for 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.739
 move sideways while 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.709
 You're reminding me of organized beauty. 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.769
 then this is the class hint that gives the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.950
 and 94 the only thing I change when I 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.730
 I'm playing when playing mastered 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.700
 chan is that shot the three attachments here I 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.579
 I use only the ammunition carrier in stock and 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.140
 I like to play domination with the vest 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.200
 ballistic because the crew uses a lot 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.650
 c4 tdm do not have much need to use 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.480
 ballistic vest then use the first 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.269
 way there without the ballistic vest that goes 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.090
 look good beauty oriented I'll try 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.859
 bring a gameplay late today with this 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.290
 Here I then hope you have helped 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.450
 If you like, leave the lay the favorite. 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.340
 for the video of the channel me 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.410
 leave a comment you did not give from this video 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.810
 and the next you want me to 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.569
 bring here the tip of class beauty a 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.519
 here remembered then galera who 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.109
 after you leave there and that appears 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.150
 sharing sum underneath 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.459
 sharing on facebook will help 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.500
 too much does not cost anything a second to your 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.209
 life and you will lose sharing and 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.389
 will help the canal a lot 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:30.049
 So let's ask for it here. 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:30.049
 Thanks, you said and until the next video was
