00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello everyone viewers are creative with you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.870
 today we will play a cool winner 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.120
 a game called sonic &amp; 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.099
 all-stars racing transformed 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.110
 I think you guys all know who that is 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.020
 sonic it can even be said 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.100
 memories of childhood and the very beginning 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.100
 cool ok let's start honestly for 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.740
 the game i will play the first time i play on 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.140
 gamepad as you see so then not 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.750
 there were too many questions and so we choose 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 ox tour so let's start brutal labor 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.070
 I think it will be the best 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:40.969
 okay so the kettle wasp till bye 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.899
 nothing more open 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:48.870
 so we will play well I do not even 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.579
 I know what it means to play first but we 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.120
 love hardcore so we will play on 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.520
 hard 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.640
 and so as you see we have accessibility and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.980
 all sorts of characters and we can say that 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.129
 here are all the stars from all games from all 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.439
 cartoons or something like that here 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.540
 have my favorite team fortress and which 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.080
 in general, I will choose but here there is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 a few others I think it is necessary to 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.659
 must open most likely this 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.670
 strategy 1 is so interesting 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.100
 okay team fortress and yes guys like you 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.340
 understood it will be about racing about 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.310
 funny u funny and remember or them in 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.970
 Generally races and I think everything in childhood 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.909
 played sonic business run and all that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.140
 but I will tell everyone had 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.810
 childhood everyone had saga 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.600
 ok so we started to play and we in general 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.630
 we start the first from behind we go 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.000
 some green-eyed dude but it's not 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.850
 important as we have to get ahead 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.450
 and guys honestly say this is very strong 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.560
 hardcore 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.270
 huppa okay overtake some damn thing 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.850
 what is this 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.420
 bad and how do I insert 1 tracy 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 flirt I realized vile so there 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.160
 in front we have a sonic and something 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.880
 I remember well that we are so fucking 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.620
 imagine that and so nitrate as he is fine 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.030
 we overtake Sonic and we are back again 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.810
 excellent we set the eye trap 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.310
 okay hello so come on 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.730
 try valleys so these are rockets i am so 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.710
 understand 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.450
 will stand stan walker stalker so take 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.670
 take take take eat and what we have 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.350
 comes across a boost let's go on 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.850
 springboard still give empty and fine I 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.650
 I think now we will get out during the firework period 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.290
 damn I thought she was suggestive but she 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.050
 also randomly flies so mugs 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.780
 mugs do not panic perfectly drove around it 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.970
 do not panic 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.100
 we have some monkey and then we 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.800
 is sonic with some 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.140
 with some dude they're a dormouse and what 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.510
 wrong boost I think we are now 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.100
 try to overtake them no no and we 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.080
 seem lost 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:25.300
 But there are no files that you look like 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.220
 here is cool invented on boats know 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.690
 that reminds me of some roofs i 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.519
 I will all remember this game 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:36.130
 crash bandicoot oh there were also races that 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.150
 such also on airplanes 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.329
 the class 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.849
 you you you you you you you 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.220
 a song with team fortress-a and the game is real 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.459
 funny guys I advise everyone to play and we 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.420
 again on the boat with us hummer 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:56.090
 he breaks so we have nothing and I 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.400
 I think everyone remember the game of theft and what it is 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.239
 still was awesome and how i remember 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.920
 played playstation and second and 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.829
 friends came to me and we were four on 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.099
 One TV played and finish and this 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.620
 it was by the way a lot of fun i'm 6 but first 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:18.169
 damn always so lumpy we go on 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.870
 see what we had so well yes let's 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.900
 maybe better try on the medium but 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.460
 we have here or small, I earn 400 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.389
 experience so what are you worlds yes I 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.090
 I think retro and 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.740
 and let's try on the medium because 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:41.860
 on hard still need me it seems 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:44.150
 practice okay i'm ready 21 forward and 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:49.400
 so this time we don't have to screw it up 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:53.240
 need to focus okay come 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.159
 We arrive a turn neatly so necessary 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.330
 jump on all boost and then we 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:02.240
 we will generally overtake faster and 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.520
 idea we should sort of win up if 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.270
 we step on boost and 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.070
 and great but you blocked my way 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.560
 brother 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.100
 so it did not hit me that wow 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.310
 here the question is the red guys really 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.120
 how boost let's say goodbye brother ok we 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.180
 go ahead 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.180
 him in fifth place yes i'm sort of 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:34.620
 want by the way like all sorts 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.510
 how can you call these things 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.730
 empty everything 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.190
 the very crumbling so much that you 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.300
 a little bit of course but I have a lot of 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.510
 similar games 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.200
 but in general, the very first thing I played 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.570
 this kind of it was of course no crash 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.810
 I remember something called a tour there 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.390
 some or not there was somehow called 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.650
 like 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.310
 racing earlier bring out like something i don't 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.470
 I remember who knows the guys write and honestly 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.900
 let's here I would still be still be 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.260
 You played the game in the roof because 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.470
 these are real memories and at that moment 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.620
 I had a few favorite games 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.020
 and if it comes to that conversation but I 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.610
 were the most favorite games is I crash 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.350
 bandicoot was then his race and more 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.420
 I was one game I do not remember how she 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.070
 was called but there ran such 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.820
 little green man and there it was necessary 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.830
 think a lot and a lot of waves 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.710
 turned in his hand in sixth place 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.800
 and there was such a green little man 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.530
 who ran and had to guess 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.230
 many interesting things i remember i 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.680
 played with your dad and you always played 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.490
 and 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.100
 it was just like that fun well short there is 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.730
 remember and honestly say it very 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.380
 positive memories in general and 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:03.400
 so I like to play this kind of game 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.689
 so it's all right and taste great even 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.029
 boost times 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:10.409
 now we have to drive all that was 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:12.659
 clearly ok and everything is correct if we 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:17.079
 Christmas trees, sticks saw how the rocket flew 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:21.929

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:32.379
