00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.210
 today we are going to explain how to defend ourselves 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 a possibility of injury on the street in 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.290
 three steps if we go down the street and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.390
 someone approaches us with an attitude 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.029
 suspicious then let's learn how 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.560
 prevent it and how to act to avoid a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.119
 possible problem first step distance 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 today if someone comes up the street 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.170
 the first thing is to gain distance for it 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.750
 in a hidden way we must take a step 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.000
 back and try to talk or see what 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.309
 intentions or what they want with their hands 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.470
 up for this way if then I 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.470
 will try to attack to protect it 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.660
 second step defense position 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.600
 if we see that the person is followed 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.610
 approaching or that already your intentions no longer 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.379
 they are good we will put ourselves in position 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.270
 defense that is to put a physical barrier 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.100
 between him and me to defend ourselves that they are 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.650
 the stretched hands showing the palm 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.140
 It's simultaneous hand screaming and screaming 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.610
 we warn our environment and maybe the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.080
 aggressor would go would not do not want 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.830
 problems do not come near I told you that 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.840
 do not hear 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.420
 look sorry I do not know here I do not know where 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.400
 it's but I think it's out there that I told you 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.280
 that I do not know that you do not approach 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.880
 come near 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.680
 third step hit and escape when 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.659
 we are in defense position saying 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.850
 Do not approach, I do not want 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 problems if he approaches me or 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.140
 start hitting me I will use my arms 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 to protect me by raising and lowering 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.009
 arms according to the height that comes the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.170
 hit until you find the time to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.840
 hit him with my palm in his 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.270
 body or on your face the ideal is to hit 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.270
 and push it to be able to measure 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.070
 the best defense is prevention by 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.140
 that when you go down the street you will have 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.080
 to be on alert and wait for 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.550
 unexpected and trying to anticipate 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.230
 the problems and the situations 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.230
 hostile that we can find 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.989
 after starting
