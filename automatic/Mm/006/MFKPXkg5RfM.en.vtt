00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.889
 that's it it's no one believed it 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.839
 but we are world champion 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.950
 finally not yet but it's good we have 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.869
 already the ticket to go to brazil 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.009
 but well the rest we won is a 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:11.570
 formality we already did it we know 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.159
 how does it work in the meantime? 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.480
 is Wednesday, November 20, 2013 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.820
 this is the news flash two days and that 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.990
 we know how to do it is the 550th time 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.990
 we make 1 it's gone 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.759
 you must have noticed it since 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.649
 last update of facebook 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.449
 messenger it was no longer possible to 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.340
 see if your friends were connected on 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.780
 mobile or computer it was enough 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.039
 disturbing because when the man engaged 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.809
 a conversation with one of his friends 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.550
 the fact that it is on mobile or on 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.199
 computer must change the course 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.640
 of the conversation if your friend and by 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.960
 example three minutes to answer a 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.340
 simple question you will start to 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.449
 ask yourself lots of questions then 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.559
 that in fact it is just maybe 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.969
 playing sports with his 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.739
 smartphone in the pocket and well 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.969
 facebook has decided to add as well 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.010
 on the mobile version only on the version 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.510
 web a clear mention that indicates if 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.530
 your correspondent to on your tickets or 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.250
 on the web version of the messaging 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.570
 instant 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.100
 if you do not see this yet 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.140
 mention in front of your friends name on 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.220
 facebook messenger do not worry the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.810
 feature is being 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.560
 deployment 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.060
 remember you talked about it ago 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.260
 few weeks twitter had added 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.120
 the ability to send messages 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.920
 private to everyone including the 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 people who do not follow you in 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.740
 all logic and especially in any 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.960
 discretion twitter just removed 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.250
 this feature a check box 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.080
 appeared in the options of your 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.610
 account for accepting receiving 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.200
 private messages from anyone 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.820
 now the person to whom you 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.230
 want to send a dm will have to again 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.950
 follow you so that you can him 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.570
 send this message 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.130
 it always happened like that 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.690
 previously from elsewhere and so imagine 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.650
 that twitter has backtracked because it 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.210
 must be abuses 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.190
 and also because we evoke with 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.960
 insistence the next arrival an app 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.550
 it's the same for twitter 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.530
 the engineers may be in the process 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.990
 to test its features for a 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 app to come this is the most confusing 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.650
 total around the samsung galaxy gear 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.240
 a fortnight ago we learned that the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.490
 rate of return of the watch connect from 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.870
 Samsung was 30% in stores 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.440
 best buy in the united states it's rather 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.690
 bad sign 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.460
 yesterday the business site correa again and 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.990
 drive the nail a bit forward 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.570
 low figure of 50 thousand copies 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.430
 sold in two 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.479
 but without, however, specifying 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.610
 sales were global or only in 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.660
 Korea samsung did not comment on the info 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.490
 but still broke a 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.380
 release in which the speech is 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.000
 all the other South Korean announces in 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.350
 effect having sold 800 thousand copies 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.910
 of war in the world and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.470
 congratulates on being responsible for the bigger 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.540
 world connected success in the world 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.140
 then flop or success he is still too much 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.640
 early to say it 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.840
 we'll probably talk about it again after 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.130
 end-of-year celebrations and when 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.690
 will have a greater number of 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.800
 compatible smartphones case for 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.270
 the moment the war is limited to 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.890
 some high-end samsung models 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.330
 in any case it did not prevent 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.400
 developers to present a first 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.440
 alternative rom for the war that 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.350
 incorporates the well- known Nova nova launcher 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.670
 android users and the question of 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.020

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.530
 on android advises you to try 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.120
 the movie studio video maker application 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.590

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.220
 edit with simple effects 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.720
 but effective 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.800
 on the other hand, it requires a little 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.810
 power to see if she 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.360
