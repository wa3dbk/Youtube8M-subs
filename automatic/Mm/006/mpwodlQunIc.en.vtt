okay<00:00:37.360> let's<00:00:37.570> take<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.720> look<00:00:37.960> at<00:00:38.020> what<00:00:38.170> makes<00:00:38.350> the

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
okay let's take a look at what makes the

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.010 
okay let's take a look at what makes the
FX<00:00:38.950> Vettel<00:00:39.399> edition<00:00:39.880> a<00:00:40.180> little<00:00:40.780> bit<00:00:40.870> more

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
FX Vettel edition a little bit more

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.540 
FX Vettel edition a little bit more
special<00:00:41.440> than<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.649> normal<00:00:41.920> version<00:00:42.250> they

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
special than the normal version they

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.830 
special than the normal version they
haven't<00:00:42.760> really<00:00:42.940> tweaked<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.329> output<00:00:43.720> of<00:00:43.750> it

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
haven't really tweaked the output of it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.110 
haven't really tweaked the output of it
so<00:00:44.079> it's<00:00:44.230> 414<00:00:45.040> brake<00:00:45.250> horsepower<00:00:45.879> but<00:00:46.030> the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
so it's 414 brake horsepower but the

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.910 
so it's 414 brake horsepower but the
exhaust<00:00:46.449> has<00:00:46.660> helped<00:00:46.960> give<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:47.500> little<00:00:47.770> bit

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
exhaust has helped give it a little bit

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.979 
exhaust has helped give it a little bit
more<00:00:48.100> power<00:00:48.340> does<00:00:48.790> not<00:00:48.820> sixty<00:00:49.329> five<00:00:49.570> point<00:00:49.809> six

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
more power does not sixty five point six

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.750 
more power does not sixty five point six
seconds<00:00:50.530> but<00:00:50.829> they've<00:00:50.949> also<00:00:51.100> tweaked<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.550> top

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
seconds but they've also tweaked the top

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.070 
seconds but they've also tweaked the top
speed<00:00:52.059> that's<00:00:52.420> one<00:00:52.570> of<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.720> things<00:00:52.930> that

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
speed that's one of the things that

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.200 
speed that's one of the things that
Vettel<00:00:53.379> would<00:00:53.500> insisted<00:00:54.040> upon<00:00:54.160> he<00:00:54.850> wanted<00:00:55.120> it

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
Vettel would insisted upon he wanted it

Vettel would insisted upon he wanted it
to<00:00:55.269> be<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.390> little<00:00:55.570> bit<00:00:55.720> faster<00:00:56.079> on<00:00:56.110> the

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
to be a little bit faster on the

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.110 
to be a little bit faster on the
autobahns<00:00:56.680> first<00:00:57.460> thing<00:00:57.670> we'll<00:00:57.760> do<00:00:57.879> about<00:00:58.000> a

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
autobahns first thing we'll do about a

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.319 
autobahns first thing we'll do about a
hundred<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.690> eighty<00:00:58.780> mile<00:00:59.050> now<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.820> get<00:01:01.059> lots

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
hundred and eighty mile now you get lots

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.630 
hundred and eighty mile now you get lots
of<00:01:01.449> extra<00:01:01.809> stuff<00:01:02.140> inside<00:01:02.739> as<00:01:03.100> well<00:01:03.339> as<00:01:03.460> on<00:01:03.550> the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
of extra stuff inside as well as on the

of extra stuff inside as well as on the
outside<00:01:04.000> most<00:01:04.390> of<00:01:04.540> its<00:01:04.690> carbon<00:01:04.960> fiber<00:01:05.430> they

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
outside most of its carbon fiber they

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.310 
outside most of its carbon fiber they
made<00:01:06.640> this<00:01:06.820> with<00:01:07.000> red<00:01:07.180> bull<00:01:07.330> racing<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:08.080> it's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
made this with red bull racing so it's

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.109 
made this with red bull racing so it's
proper<00:01:08.710> genuine<00:01:09.190> carbon<00:01:09.520> fiber<00:01:09.729> it's<00:01:09.910> no

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
proper genuine carbon fiber it's no

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.150 
proper genuine carbon fiber it's no

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
