00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.660
 if I didn't do anything to him at matthijs 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.439
 more important to but mostly admits that I 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.429
 cut out some parts 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.289
 both when the club seemed a little shorter 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.640
 during this piece further indicates that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.449
 mathias lytse 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.900
 it can choose which list it chooses 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.619
 years you have to think about it 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.579
 he will always choose first because that is just what people do the hague yes 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.220
 such days at her workplace where needed 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.240
 yes veenendaal cozy and 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.750
 weird actually that you just want to participate in the against you we give know 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.730
 not each other you are in the gronings that hell you are caught the same in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.150
 so there is nothing wrong with it 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.240
 yes I am ready then I have I have been there again for two years just after the hour 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.830
 You did want to go and the heind had to stop there 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.500
 30 minutes looking for Maria and a pair of scissors and there you can choose 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 make out 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.370
 all editors have fallen on that strip 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.160
 but seriously in the all different cases 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.880
 on and in her with scissors along and you just have to stop 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 Natalie says caressing steps 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.990
 you can still judge if you want 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.170
 at one for you i got it both times that has what a year 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.530
 come a few more years 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.560
 and then you can watch, then there is still shown 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.820
 I have cut what Zeist are for 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.380
 osn 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.729
 thirty or so 26-year-old Kempenaar Christmas denounced Nikita entitled to right and 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.270
 as a good and safe working and has more than welcome 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.630
 a pity that I am number 26 this week at number 26 in the eggs per share 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.770
 of sexual violence 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.960
 already gone and yes another list was also that he is in a different place 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.180
 We stood still far from being a sponsor in the number of plans that evoke 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.270
 come out mr a and cousins ​​i want to invite you to go to my facebook 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.259
 only a small boat gained one day during the break and the listener is allowed 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.250
 also look at home on victor provided on facebook i turned cnn that dsvp vs or 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.140
 europe and then you see that the victorian lock protects me from my very last east 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.490
 there comes a small ratzinger youtube linkedin has been around for more than thirty years 35 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.490
 places where the church month and well 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:21.229
 but 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:28.179
 somewhat lower than a year earlier the company belea dea 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.359
 what I can 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.269
 another nice trick 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.879
 what you should pay attention to is how he 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.879
 here is stuck what nags the top and bottom 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.439
 stuck to the second round 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.339
 and there is a reason i also have the computer trying to move forward 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.299
 then as you show it now 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.089
 what you see is in the ad 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.289
 picture I had cut 26 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.529
 and that is sometimes different on the top and bottom holds 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.739
 because she has cut european 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.209
 All you have to do is say 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.449
 neatly in a horizontal line below the number is correct on say geerken say 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.379
 real mini know how to proceed 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.079
 for the spectator it also seems to be looking for a random one 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.489
 moving on top segment 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.609
 and gets lost with a sequel on the ground 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.059
 and because he didn't say yet 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.059
 the work offer looks like this 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.479
 Mathieu bikes think he is 26 out 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.499
 say that 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.499
 and a bit of a faint start comes long ago 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.039
 other motives do not say 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.869
 they choose 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:47.299
 the first list 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.109
 the most visible are list 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.019
 because that is what people usually choose 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.589
 there is a bit of speed in bed this season 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:55.429
 remain the program
