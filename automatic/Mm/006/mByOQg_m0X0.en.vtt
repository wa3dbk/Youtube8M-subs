matter<00:04:54.650> of<00:04:54.740> fact<00:04:54.830> they<00:04:55.190> bolt<00:04:55.430> right<00:04:55.669> through

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
matter of fact they bolt right through

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.010 
matter of fact they bolt right through
the<00:04:56.120> old<00:04:56.150> motor<00:04:56.570> mount<00:04:56.900> holes<00:04:58.510> for<00:04:59.510> that<00:04:59.690> and

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
the old motor mount holes for that and

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.490 
the old motor mount holes for that and
use<00:05:00.289> the<00:05:00.620> original<00:05:00.860> motor<00:05:01.340> mounting<00:05:01.820> holes

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
use the original motor mounting holes

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.659 
use the original motor mounting holes
for<00:05:03.500> our<00:05:03.530> motor<00:05:03.889> mounts<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:07.250> our<00:05:07.400> motor

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
for our motor mounts and so our motor

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.150 
for our motor mounts and so our motor
mounts<00:05:08.060> any<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.539> them<00:05:08.720> will<00:05:09.020> work<00:05:09.199> on<00:05:09.440> any<00:05:09.710> key

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
mounts any of them will work on any key

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.110 
mounts any of them will work on any key
