to<00:01:30.549> five<00:01:30.729> blocks<00:01:31.630> above<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.470> top<00:01:32.710> layer<00:01:32.979> of

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
to five blocks above the top layer of

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.800 
to five blocks above the top layer of
bedrock<00:01:33.310> you're<00:01:33.820> gonna<00:01:33.909> find<00:01:34.180> really<00:01:34.509> good

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
bedrock you're gonna find really good

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.719 
bedrock you're gonna find really good
caves<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:35.829> that's<00:01:36.040> where<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.250> really<00:01:36.430> search

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
caves so that's where I really search

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.969 
caves so that's where I really search
for<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.990> see<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.170> get<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.530> bottom<00:01:38.680> soon

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
for and you see I get to the bottom soon

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.100 
for and you see I get to the bottom soon
and<00:01:39.220> then<00:01:39.310> I'll<00:01:39.670> speed<00:01:40.420> go<00:01:40.630> through<00:01:40.869> going

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
and then I'll speed go through going

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.410 
and then I'll speed go through going
left<00:01:41.320> right<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.710> center<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.240> guys<00:01:43.360> don't

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
left right and center so you guys don't

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.050 
left right and center so you guys don't
have<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.659> watch<00:01:43.780> at<00:01:43.960> all<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:45.430> you're<00:01:45.970> gonna

have to watch at all but you're gonna
get<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.270> ton<00:01:46.509> of<00:01:46.540> iron<00:01:46.860> when<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:47.920> did<00:01:48.220> this<00:01:48.400> when<00:01:48.610> I

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
get a ton of iron when I did this when I

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.429 
get a ton of iron when I did this when I
this<00:01:49.180> on<00:01:49.329> this<00:01:49.420> one<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.720> hit<00:01:49.869> bedrock<00:01:49.990> just<00:01:50.320> now

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
this on this one I hit bedrock just now

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.929

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
I'm three blocks ahead I'll light it up

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.740 
I'm three blocks ahead I'll light it up
for<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:54.220> guys<00:01:54.280> in<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.579> second<00:01:54.939> grabbing<00:01:55.630> some

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
found a good cave system on I decided to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.890 
found a good cave system on I decided to
move<00:02:37.130> up<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.459> little<00:02:37.670> bit<00:02:37.820> here<00:02:38.000> I'm<00:02:38.180> like<00:02:38.360> you

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
move up a little bit here I'm like you

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.180 
move up a little bit here I'm like you
know<00:02:38.990> what<00:02:39.200> I'm<00:02:39.290> not<00:02:39.410> finding<00:02:39.650> on<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.950> really

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
know what I'm not finding on the really

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.680 
know what I'm not finding on the really
low<00:02:40.340> layers<00:02:40.610> let's<00:02:41.000> move<00:02:41.150> up<00:02:41.270> an<00:02:41.450> inch<00:02:41.570> because

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
low layers let's move up an inch because

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.930 
low layers let's move up an inch because
usually<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.140> look<00:02:42.320> for<00:02:42.560> lava<00:02:43.250> when<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.760> find

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
usually you look for lava when you find

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.850 
usually you look for lava when you find
lava<00:02:44.180> you've<00:02:44.570> hit<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> good<00:02:44.900> spot<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:45.620> got

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
lava you've hit a good spot you just got

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.290 
lava you've hit a good spot you just got
to<00:02:45.950> go<00:02:46.040> up<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.340> you're<00:02:46.430> gonna<00:02:46.520> find<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.910> sick

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
to go up and you're gonna find a sick

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.420 
to go up and you're gonna find a sick
cave<00:02:47.540> lava<00:02:48.170> always<00:02:48.620> leads<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.010> good<00:02:49.160> caves

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
cave lava always leads to good caves

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.960 
cave lava always leads to good caves
it's<00:02:49.640> guaranteed<00:02:49.940> honestly<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.880> I'm<00:02:52.880> just

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
it's guaranteed honestly and so I'm just

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.130 
it's guaranteed honestly and so I'm just
moving<00:02:53.239> forward<00:02:53.540> now

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
moving forward now

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.040 
moving forward now
and<00:02:54.400> I'm<00:02:55.400> starting<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.150> move<00:02:56.570> up<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.840> cave

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
and I'm starting to move up on the cave

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.930 
and I'm starting to move up on the cave
now<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.890> that's<00:02:58.280> why<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:58.519> slowed<00:02:58.760> down<00:02:58.910> a

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
now and that's why it's slowed down a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.509 
now and that's why it's slowed down a
little<00:02:59.090> bit<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.680> when<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.010> get<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.310> cave

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
little bit and when you get to the cave

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.430 
little bit and when you get to the cave
there's<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.390> lot<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.600> really<00:03:02.720> cool<00:03:02.959> tricks<00:03:03.290> when

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
there's a lot of really cool tricks when

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.380 
there's a lot of really cool tricks when
you're<00:03:03.560> in<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.709> cave<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.010> find<00:03:04.130> more<00:03:04.459> caves<00:03:04.730> and

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
you're in a cave to find more caves and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.420 
you're in a cave to find more caves and
I'll<00:03:05.540> try<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:05.959> show<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.410> guys<00:03:06.500> those<00:03:06.830> and

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
I'll try and show you guys those and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.620 
I'll try and show you guys those and
maybe<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.760> can<00:03:07.880> try<00:03:08.060> them<00:03:08.180> out<00:03:08.330> they<00:03:08.540> don't

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
maybe you can try them out they don't

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.540 
maybe you can try them out they don't
always<00:03:08.930> work<00:03:09.140> but<00:03:09.800> they're<00:03:09.980> tricks<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.459> if

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
always work but they're tricks that if

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.280 
always work but they're tricks that if
they<00:03:10.700> do<00:03:10.760> work<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.420> can<00:03:11.810> get<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.050> lot<00:03:12.260> of

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
they do work you can get to a lot of

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.420 
they do work you can get to a lot of
different<00:03:12.620> caves<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:12.980> it's<00:03:13.100> friggin<00:03:13.340> awesome

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
different caves and it's friggin awesome

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.140 
different caves and it's friggin awesome
if<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.510> just<00:03:14.989> go<00:03:15.140> around<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.560> redstone<00:03:16.150> you

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
if I just go around the redstone you

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.479 
if I just go around the redstone you
know<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.300> don't<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.750> don't<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.280> steel<00:03:19.280> pick

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
know I don't I don't have the steel pick

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.620 
know I don't I don't have the steel pick
to<00:03:19.580> break<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:20.000> I'm<00:03:20.060> like<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.300> know<00:03:20.330> I'll

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
to break it so I'm like you know I'll

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.150 
to break it so I'm like you know I'll
just<00:03:20.780> go<00:03:20.989> around<00:03:21.110> then<00:03:21.410> I'll<00:03:21.709> just<00:03:21.860> go<00:03:22.010> around

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
just go around then I'll just go around

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.229 
just go around then I'll just go around
this<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:24.070> so<00:03:25.070> yeah<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.519> doesn't<00:03:25.730> take<00:03:25.910> long<00:03:26.030> as

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
this and so yeah it doesn't take long as

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.670 
this and so yeah it doesn't take long as
you<00:03:26.299> may<00:03:26.390> think<00:03:26.420> just<00:03:26.840> go<00:03:27.110> down<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.530> bottom

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
you may think just go down to the bottom

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.520 
you may think just go down to the bottom
three<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.489> five<00:03:28.700> blocks<00:03:29.120> up<00:03:29.450> from<00:03:29.480> top<00:03:30.320> layer

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
three to five blocks up from top layer

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.110 
three to five blocks up from top layer
of<00:03:30.620> bedrock<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.400> you're<00:03:31.730> good<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:31.910> go

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
of bedrock and you're good to go

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.319 
of bedrock and you're good to go
and<00:03:32.360> you<00:03:32.600> just<00:03:32.989> you're<00:03:33.829> you're<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.209> right

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
and you just you're you're in the right

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.759 
and you just you're you're in the right
direction<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.780> find<00:03:35.930> any<00:03:36.110> cave<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.560> want

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
direction to find any cave you want

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.880 
direction to find any cave you want
that's<00:03:36.980> gonna<00:03:37.130> have<00:03:37.370> diamonds<00:03:38.329> lapis<00:03:38.720> lazuli

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
that's gonna have diamonds lapis lazuli

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.710 
that's gonna have diamonds lapis lazuli
bunch<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:40.070> gold<00:03:40.400> bunch<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.880> iron<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.510> on<00:03:41.600> the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
bunch of gold bunch of iron and on the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.270 
bunch of gold bunch of iron and on the
way<00:03:41.840> you'll<00:03:42.079> probably<00:03:42.260> find<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.890> good<00:03:43.070> amount

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
way you'll probably find a good amount

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.610 
way you'll probably find a good amount
of<00:03:43.489> ore<00:03:43.730> as<00:03:44.000> well<00:03:44.150> like<00:03:44.329> if<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:44.959> might<00:03:45.500> not

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
of ore as well like if you might not

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.690 
of ore as well like if you might not
have<00:03:45.680> seen<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:45.980> well<00:03:46.160> because<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.400> sped

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
have seen it that well because I sped

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.740 
have seen it that well because I sped
through<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:46.910> really<00:03:47.000> fast<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.390> here's<00:03:47.600> the

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
through it really fast and here's the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.470 
through it really fast and here's the
cave<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:49.459> honestly<00:03:49.850> this<00:03:49.970> works<00:03:50.180> every<00:03:50.360> time

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
cave it honestly this works every time

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.970 
cave it honestly this works every time
I've<00:03:50.600> never<00:03:50.750> had<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.320> time<00:03:51.530> where<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.799> didn't

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
I've never had a time where it didn't

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.740 
I've never had a time where it didn't
work<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.610> guys<00:03:52.790> should<00:03:52.910> try<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.209> out<00:03:53.360> tell<00:03:53.630> me

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
work you guys should try it out tell me

work you guys should try it out tell me
what<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:53.959> think<00:03:54.079> in<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.290> comments<00:03:54.620> below

what you think in the comments below
about<00:03:54.950> whether<00:03:55.190> or<00:03:55.280> not<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.459> found<00:03:55.579> one<00:03:55.790> and

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
about whether or not you found one and

about whether or not you found one and
right<00:03:56.540> here<00:03:56.750> look<00:03:57.019> at<00:03:57.110> that<00:03:57.230> diamond<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.890> is

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
right here look at that diamond that is

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.610 
right here look at that diamond that is
actually<00:03:58.579> a<00:03:58.610> stack<00:03:58.910> of<00:03:58.940> seven<00:03:59.480> up<00:03:59.630> there<00:03:59.810> I<00:03:59.959> did

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
actually a stack of seven up there I did

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.890 
actually a stack of seven up there I did
mine<00:04:00.799> it<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.100> that's<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.700> stack<00:04:01.880> of<00:04:01.910> seven<00:04:02.329> gold

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
mine it and that's a stack of seven gold

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.240 
mine it and that's a stack of seven gold
iron<00:04:03.910> redstone<00:04:05.380> more<00:04:06.380> redstone<00:04:06.590> more<00:04:07.010> iron

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
iron redstone more redstone more iron

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.610 
iron redstone more redstone more iron
more<00:04:07.790> iron<00:04:07.940> above<00:04:08.269> me<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.959> right<00:04:09.110> top<00:04:09.410> is

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
more iron above me to the right top is

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.039 
more iron above me to the right top is
gold<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.160> then<00:04:10.640> there's<00:04:11.239> more<00:04:11.390> iron<00:04:11.600> this<00:04:11.900> way

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
gold and then there's more iron this way

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.449 
gold and then there's more iron this way
I'm<00:04:12.350> setting<00:04:12.680> up<00:04:12.739> a<00:04:12.829> little<00:04:13.010> path<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.430> can

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
I'm setting up a little path so I can

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.060 
I'm setting up a little path so I can
get<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.670> get<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.450> alongside<00:04:15.170> check<00:04:15.650> press<00:04:15.890> the

cave so first thing you want to do is
when<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:17.900> find<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:18.140> cave<00:04:18.320> is<00:04:18.609> you<00:04:19.609> know

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
when you find a cave is you know

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.400 
when you find a cave is you know

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
something on them you can see that

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.019 
something on them you can see that
there's<00:05:48.889> there's<00:05:49.190> some<00:05:49.310> blocks<00:05:49.550> when<00:05:49.789> I<00:05:49.819> get

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:50.029 
there's there's some blocks when I get

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:51.100 
there's there's some blocks when I get
rid<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.210> them<00:05:50.360> there's<00:05:50.659> lava<00:05:50.870> right

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
rid of them there's lava right

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.480 
rid of them there's lava right
underneath<00:05:51.409> there's<00:05:51.710> not<00:05:51.830> a<00:05:51.860> there's<00:05:52.400> not

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
underneath there's not a there's not

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.490 
underneath there's not a there's not
stone<00:05:52.789> underneath<00:05:53.090> so<00:05:53.779> that<00:05:53.960> you<00:05:54.199> know<00:05:54.289> I'm

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
stone underneath so that you know I'm

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.540 
stone underneath so that you know I'm
speeding<00:05:54.860> up<00:05:54.919> a<00:05:54.979> little<00:05:55.130> bit<00:05:55.250> here

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
speeding up a little bit here

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.459 
speeding up a little bit here
only<00:05:56.029> slightly<00:05:56.270> this<00:05:56.900> one<00:05:57.080> actually<00:05:57.229> doesn't

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:57.469 
only slightly this one actually doesn't

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:58.749 
only slightly this one actually doesn't
lead<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.770> anywhere<00:05:57.949> which<00:05:58.219> is<00:05:58.250> kind<00:05:58.669> of

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
lead to anywhere which is kind of

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.670 
lead to anywhere which is kind of
disappointing<00:05:58.909> but<00:05:59.870> I<00:05:59.900> do<00:06:00.020> find<00:06:00.409> one<00:06:00.529> that

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
disappointing but I do find one that

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.050 
disappointing but I do find one that
does<00:06:00.830> lead<00:06:01.039> somewhere<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.520> it's<00:06:01.759> not<00:06:01.909> very

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
does lead somewhere and it's not very

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.570 
does lead somewhere and it's not very
big<00:06:02.270> very<00:06:03.169> big<00:06:03.289> spot<00:06:03.680> but<00:06:03.949> it<00:06:04.130> was<00:06:04.250> good

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
big very big spot but it was good

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.550 
big very big spot but it was good
nonetheless<00:06:04.759> and<00:06:05.330> see<00:06:05.539> now<00:06:06.050> they<00:06:06.110> have<00:06:06.349> blocks

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
nonetheless and see now they have blocks

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.200 
nonetheless and see now they have blocks
under<00:06:06.770> I'm<00:06:06.860> like<00:06:06.979> oh<00:06:07.159> darn<00:06:07.550> this<00:06:07.789> isn't<00:06:08.029> a<00:06:08.060> good

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
under I'm like oh darn this isn't a good

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.029 
under I'm like oh darn this isn't a good
one<00:06:08.330> so<00:06:08.840> I'm<00:06:08.930> going<00:06:09.169> off<00:06:09.289> going<00:06:09.500> off<00:06:09.680> going<00:06:09.889> off

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
one so I'm going off going off going off

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.800 
one so I'm going off going off going off
and<00:06:10.219> like<00:06:10.400> see<00:06:10.880> if<00:06:10.940> there's<00:06:11.090> any<00:06:11.180> lava<00:06:11.449> check

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
and like see if there's any lava check

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.879 
and like see if there's any lava check
in<00:06:11.900> this<00:06:11.990> lab<00:06:12.199> but<00:06:12.349> just<00:06:12.500> in<00:06:12.590> case<00:06:12.710> there's

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
in this lab but just in case there's

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.040 
in this lab but just in case there's
maybe<00:06:13.009> one<00:06:13.400> of<00:06:13.759> the<00:06:13.819> things<00:06:14.029> there<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:14.960> it

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
maybe one of the things there and it

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.480 
maybe one of the things there and it
doesn't<00:06:15.259> seem<00:06:15.319> like<00:06:15.469> there<00:06:15.620> is<00:06:15.710> any<00:06:15.889> and<00:06:16.130> then

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
doesn't seem like there is any and then

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.159 
doesn't seem like there is any and then
I<00:06:16.520> find<00:06:16.789> this<00:06:17.000> lava<00:06:17.240> pit<00:06:17.509> which<00:06:17.630> is<00:06:17.750> just<00:06:17.990> off

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
I find this lava pit which is just off

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.730 
I find this lava pit which is just off
to<00:06:18.500> the<00:06:19.250> back<00:06:19.729> of<00:06:20.000> the<00:06:20.120> case<00:06:20.449> ISM<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.380> I<00:06:21.440> see

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
to the back of the case ISM and I see

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.890 
to the back of the case ISM and I see
that<00:06:21.889> there's<00:06:22.039> another<00:06:22.279> spot<00:06:22.580> where<00:06:22.849> you<00:06:23.750> see

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
that there's another spot where you see

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.360 
that there's another spot where you see
right<00:06:24.050> there<00:06:24.080> where<00:06:24.380> there's<00:06:24.620> obviously<00:06:25.009> not

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
right there where there's obviously not

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.219 
right there where there's obviously not
there's<00:06:26.000> lava<00:06:26.240> under<00:06:26.599> it<00:06:26.690> and<00:06:26.810> not<00:06:26.990> another

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
there's lava under it and not another

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.670 
there's lava under it and not another
stone<00:06:27.440> block<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:27.979> just<00:06:28.009> watch<00:06:29.169> on<00:06:30.169> my<00:06:30.380> videos

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
stone block and just watch on my videos

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.510 
stone block and just watch on my videos
actually<00:06:30.830> if<00:06:31.009> you<00:06:31.069> come<00:06:31.219> check<00:06:31.250> out<00:06:31.460> my

again if you come check out my channel
you'll<00:06:34.789> see<00:06:34.819> that<00:06:35.090> I've<00:06:35.630> actually<00:06:35.870> used<00:06:36.169> this

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 
you'll see that I've actually used this

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.839 
you'll see that I've actually used this
system<00:06:36.650> a<00:06:36.680> lot<00:06:36.830> and<00:06:37.069> for<00:06:37.099> some<00:06:37.430> reason<00:06:37.699> it

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
system a lot and for some reason it

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.899 
system a lot and for some reason it
leads<00:06:38.090> this<00:06:38.569> is<00:06:38.779> the<00:06:38.930> prime<00:06:39.199> area<00:06:39.669> at<00:06:40.669> this

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
leads this is the prime area at this

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:43.930 
leads this is the prime area at this
level<00:06:41.149> of<00:06:41.479> depth<00:06:42.080> for<00:06:42.860> diamonds<00:06:43.310> and<00:06:43.490> I've<00:06:43.789> had

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
level of depth for diamonds and I've had

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.270 
level of depth for diamonds and I've had
lava<00:06:44.210> lead<00:06:44.690> me<00:06:44.839> to<00:06:44.930> diamonds<00:06:45.320> multiple<00:06:45.770> times

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
lava lead me to diamonds multiple times

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.240 
lava lead me to diamonds multiple times
this<00:06:46.610> time<00:06:46.850> unfortunately<00:06:47.210> it<00:06:47.540> did<00:06:47.690> not<00:06:48.250> but

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
this time unfortunately it did not but

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.860 
this time unfortunately it did not but
you<00:06:49.370> know<00:06:49.400> it's<00:06:50.389> okay

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
you know it's okay

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.280 
you know it's okay
I'm<00:06:51.260> over<00:06:51.650> it<00:06:51.710> and<00:06:52.310> so<00:06:53.000> I<00:06:53.240> didn't<00:06:53.990> really<00:06:54.080> get

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
I'm over it and so I didn't really get

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.480 
I'm over it and so I didn't really get
very<00:06:54.380> far<00:06:54.620> with<00:06:54.770> this<00:06:54.860> but<00:06:55.070> you<00:06:55.100> guys<00:06:55.280> should

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
very far with this but you guys should

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.070 
very far with this but you guys should
definitely<00:06:55.639> try<00:06:55.970> this<00:06:56.090> trick<00:06:56.480> honestly<00:06:56.990> it

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
definitely try this trick honestly it

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.879 
definitely try this trick honestly it
works<00:06:57.200> almost<00:06:57.440> every<00:06:57.919> time<00:06:59.440> I've<00:07:00.440> never<00:07:00.650> had<00:07:00.860> a

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:00.889 
works almost every time I've never had a

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:01.960 
works almost every time I've never had a
time<00:07:01.040> it<00:07:01.220> didn't<00:07:01.430> work<00:07:01.460> I've<00:07:01.639> never<00:07:01.820> had

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
time it didn't work I've never had

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.030 
time it didn't work I've never had
somebody<00:07:02.120> tell<00:07:02.300> me<00:07:02.360> it<00:07:02.510> didn't<00:07:02.720> work<00:07:02.900> so<00:07:03.139> try

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
somebody tell me it didn't work so try

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.800 
somebody tell me it didn't work so try
it<00:07:04.070> out<00:07:04.280> guys<00:07:04.460> see<00:07:05.120> what<00:07:05.240> you<00:07:05.330> think<00:07:05.540> and<00:07:05.720> I'm

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
it out guys see what you think and I'm

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.390 
it out guys see what you think and I'm
just<00:07:06.020> checking<00:07:06.230> a<00:07:06.320> little<00:07:06.500> bit<00:07:06.590> here<00:07:06.740> and<00:07:06.919> the

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
just checking a little bit here and the

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.950 
just checking a little bit here and the
video<00:07:07.610> is<00:07:07.669> coming<00:07:07.760> to<00:07:07.940> an<00:07:08.030> end<00:07:08.120> there<00:07:08.330> and<00:07:08.540> I

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
video is coming to an end there and I

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.780 
video is coming to an end there and I
think<00:07:09.020> my<00:07:09.230> overall<00:07:09.350> haul<00:07:09.889> from<00:07:10.160> this<00:07:10.340> little

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
think my overall haul from this little

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.460 
think my overall haul from this little
cave<00:07:11.030> and<00:07:11.300> this<00:07:11.450> is<00:07:11.600> if<00:07:11.780> you<00:07:11.900> hold<00:07:12.050> f3<00:07:12.320> you'll

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470 
cave and this is if you hold f3 you'll
