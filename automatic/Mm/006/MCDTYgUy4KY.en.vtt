00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.040
 in the decision to start working already 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.690
 manage the climate in the organization 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.970
 It will be an excellent place to work 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.860
 it has to do with us being a 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.240
 company of people our people to 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.740
 make a difference and be the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.509
 true point of contact with our 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:26.490
 The better the customer is, the better 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.910
 advise better will sell 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.360
 better climate is going to believe in creating in the in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.770
 the customer especially on the client 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.140
 even better ideas will contribute and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 final all that go adding to that the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.960
 final product and the experience of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.790
 Buy from our customers be much 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.470
 best in our business the main 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.800
 challenges in the particular case of that from 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.800
 brand 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.820
 I told you before it's a very intense business 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.150
 labor and that's very rich and to the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.400
 final as I always 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.380
 we enjoy this business 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.910
 because we work with many people 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.670
 but that is also a challenge in itself 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.580
 understand each person and each 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.970
 group of people in their needs and 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.830
 your concerns what interests them 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.450
 accompany them in that I would say that is 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.829
 the biggest challenge we have in 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.060
 try 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.609
 understand them and shelter them and embrace them 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.920
 and accompany them among the diversity of 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:23.200
 people and this I tell you that they are 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.490
 no dogs stimulated or connected over 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.009
 all the younger generations I think 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.799
 that there are the main challenges 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.359
 know within diversity 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.859
 understand them and accompany them in what 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.340
 they need and I think the reasons why 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:38.240
 I am more relaxed in the great 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.310
 place to work 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.900
 they are basically that we respect 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.240
 really people 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.970
 that is part of our culture is part 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.360
 of our culture and treat the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.610
 people are part of our culture 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.370
 accept and celebrate diversity is 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.480
 be part of our culture be joyful 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.550
 It is part of our culture 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.640
 and smile 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.290
 again interacting with the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.020
 people and I think all those those 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.840
 granites that make the culture of sodimac 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.660
 and that thanks to it then it is also seen 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.840
 reflected in the customer's attention 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.790
 They make the difference and make us 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.400
 let's start, it's not hard for me to tell you there's a 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.370
 why we are and more in a 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.460
 business where the intensity of 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.720
 a lot where a very fast pace 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.790
 everything seems to indicate that the reiter is a 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.310
 business where very very difficult to keep 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.660
 the climate here on the contrary there is something 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.520
 there in the culture and a little flame in the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.810
 culture that makes us become a 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.510
 good place for everything within the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.390
 practices that we implemented I had to 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.860
 rescue an uned couple that has has 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.710
 a lot to do with the balance between 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.270
 work and personal life that we 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.340
 we launched what we had the program of 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.290
 Matters are useful for moms 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.610
 moms of newborn boys who are 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.380
 stretch 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.510
 after a year of birth when 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.440
 they come back from the license they can work 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.440
 the tables of the houses 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.990
 even also or for all 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.820
 personal on Fridays us the 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.320
 office staff naturally the 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.790
 Friday we cut at quarter past four 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.110
 in the afternoon and then we launched the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.700
 benefits that have a lot to do with 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.050
 our business and what we need 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.730
 one that has to do with the 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.470
 remodeling and another that has goal to 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.870
 the construction 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.210
 are two benefits of very discount 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.870
 strong for the people who are in plan 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.540
 to remodel your house or to make a 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.980
 first house looking to the future for 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.379
 keep 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.099
 the weather and we also keep in the 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.140
 ranking that we are always with the 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.209
 well-stopped tickets to see what it is that 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.810
 need people have meetings all 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.810
 the time and there 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.840
 a lot has to do probably with the 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.430
 teleworking or giving a little more 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.660
 freedom so that people can move 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.580
 be a little more flexible with the 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.830
 schedules I would say in general the demand 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.720
 and people come a little on that side 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.610
 training that we are 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.620
 working hard on everything that is and what 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.080
 arm on a platform for people 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.430
 can be trained online that 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.980
 It is also highly valued that it gets into 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.410
 the people in the store and out there for that 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.849
 side see the dogs I think that 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.540
 an excellent person company place for 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:21.060
 work first has to be very 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.280
 convinced that she must respect people 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.740
 have to have good leaders have 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.080
 have leaders who understand that the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.210
 key is to serve the people that the key 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.740
 from the service agency to be 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.740
 ready for collaborators 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.060
 and in the end a lot of commitment I think that 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.030
 when one is committed to the 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.170
 company but committed to people 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.320
 what the company does there is the 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.320
 difference 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.199
 these
