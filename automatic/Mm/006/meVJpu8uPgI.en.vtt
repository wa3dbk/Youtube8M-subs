00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
which are likely like the cosmos and it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.330

of this formation can you talk a bit

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.470 
of this formation can you talk a bit
more<00:02:52.750> about<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.370> well<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.610> mean<00:02:54.819> I<00:02:55.000> think<00:02:55.060> that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
more about that well I mean I think that

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.500 
more about that well I mean I think that
it<00:02:56.019> was<00:02:56.170> very<00:02:56.410> important<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.269> build

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
it was very important that if you build

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.600 
it was very important that if you build
and<00:02:58.959> first<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.890> all<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.069> was<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.190> vertical

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
and first of all it was a vertical

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.810 
and first of all it was a vertical
Museum<00:03:01.260> which<00:03:02.260> meant<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:03.400> galleries

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
Museum which meant that the galleries

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.810 
Museum which meant that the galleries
are<00:03:04.090> stacked<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:06.100> other<00:03:06.250> thing<00:03:06.549> which<00:03:06.700> was

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
are stacked up the other thing which was

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.190 
are stacked up the other thing which was
critical<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:07.570> that<00:03:07.600> this<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.260> downtown<00:03:08.769> was<00:03:09.040> a

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
critical is that this the downtown was a

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.539 
critical is that this the downtown was a
regeneration<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.560> therefore<00:03:12.459> the

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
regeneration and therefore the

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.130 
regeneration and therefore the
regeneration<00:03:13.030> was<00:03:13.269> not<00:03:13.450> for<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> cultural

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
regeneration was not for a cultural

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.140 
regeneration was not for a cultural
program<00:03:14.650> said<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.459> was<00:03:15.549> very<00:03:15.670> important<00:03:16.120> that

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
program said it was very important that

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.270 
program said it was very important that
people<00:03:16.420> know<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.900> this<00:03:17.500> is<00:03:17.709> not<00:03:17.980> a

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
people know that this is not a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.640 
people know that this is not a
commercial<00:03:18.880> facility<00:03:19.540> but<00:03:20.109> actually<00:03:20.500> the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
commercial facility but actually the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.349 
commercial facility but actually the
cultural<00:03:21.070> one<00:03:21.250> which<00:03:21.400> allows<00:03:21.760> everybody<00:03:22.120> to

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
cultural one which allows everybody to

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.099 
cultural one which allows everybody to
to<00:03:23.350> get<00:03:23.590> in<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.609> idea<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.690> simple

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
to get in and the idea of with a simple

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.660 
to get in and the idea of with a simple
mood<00:03:26.290> which<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.620> called<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.100> urban<00:03:27.370> common

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
mood which is called the urban common

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.880 
mood which is called the urban common
which<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.819> a<00:03:28.120> wall<00:03:28.750> which<00:03:29.079> starts<00:03:29.470> all<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.799> way

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
which is a wall which starts all the way

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.340 
which is a wall which starts all the way
from<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.069> top<00:03:30.370> all<00:03:30.579> the<00:03:30.640> way<00:03:30.880> down<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.510> concrete

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
from the top all the way down a concrete

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.229 
from the top all the way down a concrete
wall<00:03:32.500> which<00:03:32.709> takes<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.549> all<00:03:33.700> out<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
wall which takes you all out of the

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.390 
wall which takes you all out of the
street<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.989> was<00:03:35.260> curves<00:03:35.560> at<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.859> place<00:03:36.069> yeah

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
street it was curves at the place yeah

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.559 
street it was curves at the place yeah
but<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:36.760> think<00:03:36.970> when<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.120> was<00:03:37.209> interesting

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
but I think when it was interesting

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.229 
but I think when it was interesting
because<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.900> ground<00:03:38.079> is<00:03:38.230> transparent<00:03:39.010> it

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
because the ground is transparent it

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.170 
because the ground is transparent it
propels<00:03:40.239> people<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:42.190> come<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> other

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
propels people to to come to the other

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.840 
propels people to to come to the other
side<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.950> course<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.730> don't

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
side and and of course it's you don't

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.610 
side and and of course it's you don't
have<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.209> can<00:03:46.389> go<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.870> ground<00:03:47.109> and<00:03:47.380> use

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
have you can go on to the ground and use

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.330 
have you can go on to the ground and use
it<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.040> not<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:50.170> know<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.950> don't<00:03:51.069> have<00:03:51.160> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
program and the building what is called

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.620 
program and the building what is called
the<00:03:56.260> onion<00:03:56.700> which<00:03:57.700> is<00:03:57.819> also<00:03:58.150> interesting

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
mostly you know board board shows like a

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:28.779 
mostly you know board board shows like a
constant<00:04:18.410> honor<00:04:25.870> student<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.460> 35<00:04:28.460> years<00:04:28.639> ago

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
constant honor student and 35 years ago

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.070 
constant honor student and 35 years ago
they<00:04:28.940> thought<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.570> an<00:04:29.690> end<00:04:29.900> of

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
they thought it is an end of

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.860 
they thought it is an end of
architecture<00:04:31.150> no<00:04:32.150> there<00:04:32.330> was<00:04:32.479> I<00:04:32.509> went<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:32.840> a

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
architecture no there was I went to a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.790 
architecture no there was I went to a
conference<00:04:33.110> called<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.590> end<00:04:33.710> of

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
conference called the end of

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.370 
conference called the end of
architecture<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:35.600> I<00:04:36.050> thought<00:04:36.229> there

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
architecture and and I thought there

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.330 
architecture and and I thought there
would<00:04:36.470> be<00:04:36.500> no<00:04:36.740> progress<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.460> actually<00:04:39.340> there

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
would be no progress and actually there

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.029 
would be no progress and actually there
was<00:04:40.430> been<00:04:40.669> amazing<00:04:41.360> progress<00:04:41.600> in<00:04:41.960> 30<00:04:42.199> years<00:04:42.410> so

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
was been amazing progress in 30 years so

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.240 
was been amazing progress in 30 years so
so<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.580> think<00:04:44.470> we<00:04:45.470> should<00:04:45.500> end<00:04:45.740> on<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:45.919> note<00:04:46.010> of

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
so I think we should end on a note of

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.020 
so I think we should end on a note of
optimism<00:04:46.610> thank<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.240> very<00:04:47.270> much<00:04:47.419> Zaha<00:04:47.870> Hadid
