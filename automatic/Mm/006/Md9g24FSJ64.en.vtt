00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.940
 we answer some questions here 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.849
 they are often asked by people 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.980
 who came to visit some of the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.280
 our lessons in Nordic ie kong 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.870
 10 and from these questions 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.050
 we have been amazed because we have 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.020
 understood that we have taken for granted that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.230
 people knew a lot and instead there is 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.619
 a certain fear of coming to experiment 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.230
 what is in practice in practice 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.239
 a thesis lesson there is fear perhaps 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.059
 because because of the mysterious game 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.610
 of yin and yang all these arts 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.670
 they hide from the east they do not hide 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.760
 in the sense that we get an idea and then 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.340
 when practicing these queens 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.250
 completely changed then what 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.379
 we want to live and not be afraid not 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 trust the ones that can be 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.609
 your first false expectations because the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.560
 pc is not what you probably have 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.750
 seen 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.320
 I have the Latvian book indeed it is not that 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.300
 that you saw while walking around at 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.600
 park you 've seen of the people that 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.280
 they did something a little weird 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:20.870
 hitachi is not that part a little slow 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.770
 a boring very very sweet little where 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.330
 there are old people who move 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.200
 gently and breathe consciously 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.420
 that's not the 10 with 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.500
 or what we do others think 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.350
 that she teaches us instead an art 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.539
 esoteric a bin works itself 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.850
 on energy, in short, an art for 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.939
 gullible new age 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.819
 as they were the channels that are 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.069
 mysteriously open and not some 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.549
 they are simply a song from the point of 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.409
 intellectual art view this art 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.500
 saying it's not for me I don't feel like 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.299
 I don't wear Chinese dolls 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.400
 want to dress as a small child 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.320
 that goes to make the first ones 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.229
 so marzia this is also what 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.200
 some people think of other people 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.420
 they still think instead of the reverse 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.310
 let it be a martial art at the level 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.530
 snapshots of some are afraid of having to 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.870
 find and make strange movements e 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.730
 pull the legs so private of those 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.620
 that they wouldn't know how to do it 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.500
 they are afraid to get shots of 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.100
 dodge fear of becoming violent 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.640
 because they think that instead for them it is 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.459
 he thinks we were therefore saying that it is 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.590
 the elder who could possibly have to 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.010
 start moving then to make a 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.660
 almost therapeutic rehabilitative type can 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.000
 finding satisfaction is greater 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.470
 satisfaction than what is 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.220
 might think but also the young now 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.040
 young dancer actually the tc far 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.410
 work the body on several levels yes 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.140
 turns out to have the body turns out like 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.700
 use it fully ie contact 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.230
 one 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.080
 stretch reinforce the single most 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.060
 part of the body so that everything can 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.730
 work with one 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.280
 the body thus has a potential that comes 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.190
 discovered and progressively released 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.110
 this allows you to express yourself and allow 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.550
 to have satisfaction on several levels 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.070
 as if we could simultaneously 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.960
 relax meditating developing the broth 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.640
 natural particular type of 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.440
 concentration 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.110
 at the same time we are doing 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.520
 stretching we are doing fitness are 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.320
 toning c 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.360
 but all this is not so visible 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.310
 in the eyes of the outside observer 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.590
 but in this that makes art very much 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.900
 intriguing and very funny because not 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.840
 it is thought that there is in your body 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.630
 all this potential to pull out 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.060
 and to work to put into 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.890
 movement 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.870
 so the person I don't sell you will do there 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.740
 he will do something he did not suspect 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.100
 in the slightest he finds he can contact 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.680
 learn about new crabs reinforce each 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.650
 smallest part of the body they will do 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.410
 something that will not be sacrificed to one 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.880
 style a type of technique but it will indeed be a 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.820
 art that makes you discover what you are after 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.270
 the physiological potential of the body a 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.430
 body comes so to the side to find the 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.380
 its classic state where every part 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.770
 is stretched is opened comes 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.840
 mobilized in this is reinforced 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.630
 as if they are at the same time in others 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.430
 carry out an activity at the end of the month 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.900
 at the same time that of strange south 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.780
 and simultaneously with a relaxation 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.510
 deep this is the peculiarity 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.080
 it starts with some training and yes 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.970
 goes to integrate this discovery that does not 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.920
 will make or rediscover your own 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.380
 body and its own empowering of 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.120
 movement and expression of one's own 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.030
 body but also of well-being and 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.920
 vitality that is certainly the first 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.830
 steps are the real size the real reason 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.570
 for which one begins and that is I found the 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.050
 diction discover that all this makes me 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:17.370
 be very well so I wonder what 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.370
 what will be after this
