00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
hips these are so frequently asked it's

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.750 
hips these are so frequently asked it's
amazing<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:27.199> it's<00:00:27.350> a<00:00:27.500> great<00:00:27.619> question<00:00:27.859> now

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
amazing and it's a great question now

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.460 
amazing and it's a great question now
let's<00:00:29.090> understand<00:00:29.510> some<00:00:29.689> of<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.810> physiology

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
let's understand some of the physiology

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.090 
let's understand some of the physiology
another<00:00:31.330> basically<00:00:32.330> what<00:00:33.290> it<00:00:33.320> comes<00:00:33.410> down<00:00:33.650> to

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
another basically what it comes down to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.280 
another basically what it comes down to
is<00:00:34.309> I<00:00:34.850> don't<00:00:35.090> like<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.420> say<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:35.809> it's<00:00:35.960> almost

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
is I don't like to say that it's almost

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.240 
is I don't like to say that it's almost
predetermined<00:00:37.130> but<00:00:37.340> there<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.700> degree<00:00:37.940> of

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
predetermined but there is a degree of

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.350 
predetermined but there is a degree of
predetermination<00:00:40.250> in<00:00:40.610> this<00:00:40.910> in<00:00:41.210> this

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
predetermination in this in this

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.869 
predetermination in this in this
equation<00:00:41.750> if<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.920> look<00:00:43.100> at<00:00:43.219> your<00:00:43.309> body<00:00:43.520> shape

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
equation if you look at your body shape

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.569 
equation if you look at your body shape
right<00:00:44.390> most<00:00:44.899> likely<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:45.649> reflects<00:00:46.129> one<00:00:46.460> of

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
right most likely it reflects one of

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.369 
right most likely it reflects one of
your<00:00:46.730> parents<00:00:46.910> either<00:00:47.360> your<00:00:47.840> dad<00:00:48.079> or<00:00:48.350> your

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
your parents either your dad or your

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.310 
your parents either your dad or your
mother<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.610> if<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.000> want<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.360> have<00:00:50.510> an<00:00:50.660> idea<00:00:50.750> of

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
mother so if you want to have an idea of

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.910 
mother so if you want to have an idea of
how<00:00:52.539> you<00:00:53.539> know<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.750> potential<00:00:54.200> you<00:00:54.500> have<00:00:54.680> with

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
how you know the potential you have with

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.860 
how you know the potential you have with
of<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.160> mold<00:00:55.520> you<00:00:55.700> have<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.120> work<00:00:56.300> with<00:00:56.329> look

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
of the mold you have to work with look

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.319 
of the mold you have to work with look
at<00:00:57.020> one<00:00:57.170> of<00:00:57.199> your<00:00:57.350> parents<00:00:57.670> that's<00:00:58.670> most

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
at one of your parents that's most

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.369 
at one of your parents that's most
likely<00:00:59.559> the<00:01:00.559> frame<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.910> body<00:01:02.210> shape<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.170> way

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
likely the frame the body shape the way

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.380 
likely the frame the body shape the way
you'll<00:01:03.559> distribute<00:01:04.070> weights<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:05.059> you're

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
you'll distribute weights that you're

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.719 
you'll distribute weights that you're
going<00:01:05.509> to<00:01:05.600> take<00:01:05.750> on<00:01:05.930> as<00:01:06.050> well<00:01:06.310> so<00:01:07.310> for<00:01:07.640> instance

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
going to take on as well so for instance

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.880 
going to take on as well so for instance
I<00:01:08.149> have<00:01:08.450> more<00:01:08.690> of<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.869> physiology<00:01:09.500> morbot

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
I have more of a physiology morbot

similar make up to her mother right
having<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.049> heavier<00:01:18.710> set<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.189> hips<00:01:19.400> thinner

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
having a heavier set in the hips thinner

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.390 
having a heavier set in the hips thinner
up<00:01:20.450> top<00:01:20.750> other<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:21.770> mean<00:01:21.920> everyone<00:01:22.369> is

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
up top other I mean everyone is

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.609 
up top other I mean everyone is
individual<00:01:23.090> right<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.750> key<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.020> work<00:01:24.409> with

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
there's still a lot of obviously word

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.899 
there's still a lot of obviously word
that<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:29.600> can<00:01:29.780> do<00:01:30.049> to<00:01:30.770> help<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.310> lose<00:01:31.580> belly

fat or fat on your thighs regardless of
you<00:01:35.810> know<00:01:35.890> what<00:01:36.890> your<00:01:37.009> parents<00:01:37.280> body<00:01:37.820> shape

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
you know what your parents body shape

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.310 
you know what your parents body shape
might<00:01:38.329> look<00:01:38.659> like<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:39.759> let's<00:01:40.759> look<00:01:41.060> at<00:01:41.360> how<00:01:42.079> it

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
might look like so let's look at how it

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.140 
might look like so let's look at how it
comes<00:01:42.560> about<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.040> let's<00:01:43.189> look<00:01:43.280> at<00:01:43.430> Memphis<00:01:43.790> I'm

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
comes about so let's look at Memphis I'm

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.880 
comes about so let's look at Memphis I'm
just<00:01:44.479> going<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.750> commit<00:01:45.110> as<00:01:45.200> an<00:01:45.320> example<00:01:45.619> and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
just going to commit as an example and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.289 
just going to commit as an example and
then<00:01:46.310> I'll<00:01:46.400> kind<00:01:46.579> of<00:01:46.700> translate<00:01:47.030> this<00:01:47.150> into

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
then I'll kind of translate this into

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.080 
then I'll kind of translate this into
women<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.380> men<00:01:48.950> typically<00:01:49.520> gain<00:01:49.850> weight

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
women so men typically gain weight

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.850 
women so men typically gain weight
around<00:01:50.329> their<00:01:50.600> abdomen<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.649> there's<00:01:51.799> a

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
around their abdomen and there's a

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.929 
around their abdomen and there's a
reason<00:01:52.220> for<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.430> since<00:01:52.759> obviously

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
reason for this since obviously

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.120 
reason for this since obviously
testosterone<00:01:53.899> which<00:01:54.049> is<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.200> major<00:01:54.470> problem<00:01:54.829> in

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
testosterone which is a major problem in

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.530 
testosterone which is a major problem in
our<00:01:55.189> body<00:01:55.490> which<00:01:57.490> stimulates<00:01:58.490> or<00:01:58.729> or<00:01:58.939> triggers

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
our body which stimulates or or triggers

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.200 
our body which stimulates or or triggers
certain<00:01:59.990> receptors<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.860> be<00:02:00.979> located<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:01.790> our

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
certain receptors to be located in our

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.780 
certain receptors to be located in our
abdominal<00:02:02.630> area<00:02:02.960> now<00:02:03.649> we<00:02:03.710> have<00:02:04.340> different

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
abdominal area now we have different

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.490 
abdominal area now we have different
luck<00:02:04.909> against<00:02:05.180> too<00:02:05.450> technical<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.020> physiology

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
luck against too technical to physiology

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.560 
luck against too technical to physiology
but<00:02:06.860> we<00:02:07.310> did<00:02:07.460> basically<00:02:07.850> have<00:02:08.060> two<00:02:08.360> different

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
but we did basically have two different

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.870 
but we did basically have two different
types<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.929> fat<00:02:09.140> receptors<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.890> one<00:02:10.640> type<00:02:10.850> of

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
types of fat receptors and one type of

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.449 
types of fat receptors and one type of
fiber<00:02:11.120> sector<00:02:11.630> allows<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.530> body<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.829> oxidize

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
fiber sector allows the body to oxidize

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.729 
fiber sector allows the body to oxidize
or<00:02:13.489> burn<00:02:13.879> fat<00:02:14.180> while<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.660> other<00:02:14.780> one<00:02:14.989> tells

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
or burn fat while the other one tells

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:16.840 
or burn fat while the other one tells
the<00:02:15.890> body<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.220> store

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
the body the store

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.420 
the body the store
and<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.780> just<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.020> happens<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.560> men<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:19.340> we

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
and it just so happens in men that we

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.030 
and it just so happens in men that we
have<00:02:19.580> more<00:02:19.850> of<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> store<00:02:20.690> fat<00:02:21.080> receptors<00:02:21.770> in

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
have more of the store fat receptors in

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.730 
have more of the store fat receptors in
our<00:02:22.280> abdominal<00:02:22.700> area<00:02:23.090> that's<00:02:23.870> why<00:02:24.230> for<00:02:24.290> men

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
our abdominal area that's why for men

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.250 
our abdominal area that's why for men
that's<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.520> first<00:02:25.880> place<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.210> fat<00:02:26.900> will<00:02:27.170> be

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
that's the first place that fat will be

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.020 
that's the first place that fat will be
stored<00:02:27.650> that's<00:02:27.950> where<00:02:28.130> we<00:02:28.220> why<00:02:28.520> we<00:02:28.550> gain

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
stored that's where we why we gain

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.270 
stored that's where we why we gain
weight<00:02:29.420> in<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.200> abdominal<00:02:30.500> area<00:02:30.860> in<00:02:31.190> our

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
weight in the abdominal area in our

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.850 
weight in the abdominal area in our
belly<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.330> problem<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:32.930> belly<00:02:33.410> fat<00:02:33.710> is

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
belly the problem is that belly fat is

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.210 
belly the problem is that belly fat is
highly<00:02:34.310> correlated<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:35.080> cardiovascular

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220

highly correlated to cardiovascular
cardiovascular<00:02:37.220> disease<00:02:37.490> diabetes<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.720> all

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
cardiovascular disease diabetes and all

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.810 
cardiovascular disease diabetes and all
sorts<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.590> other<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.160> know<00:02:40.190> negative<00:02:40.670> health

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
sorts of other you know negative health

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.950 
sorts of other you know negative health
health<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.480> locations<00:02:42.140> for<00:02:42.980> women<00:02:43.570> those<00:02:44.570> say

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
health and locations for women those say

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.800 
health and locations for women those say
those<00:02:45.200> same<00:02:45.530> fat<00:02:46.220> storing<00:02:46.820> receptors<00:02:47.510> are

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
those same fat storing receptors are

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.020 
those same fat storing receptors are
located<00:02:48.440> around<00:02:48.620> their<00:02:48.920> hips<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.340> finds<00:02:49.640> and

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
located around their hips and finds and

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.950 
located around their hips and finds and
for<00:02:50.750> them<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.650> again<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.040> hormonal<00:02:52.700> thing

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
for them this is again a hormonal thing

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.490 
for them this is again a hormonal thing
mainly<00:02:53.960> because<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:55.220> body<00:02:55.460> is<00:02:55.610> telling<00:02:56.500> the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
mainly because the body is telling the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.290 
mainly because the body is telling the
brain<00:02:57.710> or<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.890> body<00:02:58.130> is<00:02:58.310> telling<00:02:58.490> itself<00:02:58.940> that

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
brain or the body is telling itself that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.960 
brain or the body is telling itself that
it<00:02:59.480> needs<00:02:59.750> fat<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.470> those<00:03:00.920> areas<00:03:01.460> for<00:03:01.640> instance

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
it needs fat in those areas for instance

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.330 
it needs fat in those areas for instance
to<00:03:02.120> protect<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.630> reproductive<00:03:03.260> system<00:03:03.680> right

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
to protect the reproductive system right

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.460 
to protect the reproductive system right
so<00:03:04.790> there's<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.060> reason<00:03:05.390> for<00:03:05.420> everything<00:03:05.570> now

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
so there's a reason for everything now

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.530 
so there's a reason for everything now
that's<00:03:07.220> not<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.460> say<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> can<00:03:08.330> lose

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
that's not to say that you can lose

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.730 
that's not to say that you can lose
weight<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.870> those<00:03:09.020> areas<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.650> you

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
weight in those areas and that you

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.650 
weight in those areas and that you
should<00:03:09.770> you<00:03:10.400> know<00:03:10.490> grow<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.880> 400<00:03:11.480> pounds

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
should you know grow to 400 pounds

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.110 
should you know grow to 400 pounds
because<00:03:11.990> that's<00:03:12.350> not<00:03:12.500> what<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.830> want<00:03:13.100> but<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
because that's not what you want but the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.690 
because that's not what you want but the
key<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.450> understand<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.260> okay<00:03:15.530> between<00:03:15.740> my

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
key is understand that okay between my

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.090 
key is understand that okay between my
genetic<00:03:17.240> makeup<00:03:17.450> my<00:03:17.960> genetic<00:03:18.350> predisposition

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
genetic makeup my genetic predisposition

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.160 
genetic makeup my genetic predisposition
and<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.820> understanding<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.570> what's<00:03:20.810> happened

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
and the understanding of what's happened

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.140 
and the understanding of what's happened
with<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.350> receptors<00:03:21.920> not<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.910> that<00:03:23.000> really

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
with the receptors not that that really

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150 
with the receptors not that that really
makes<00:03:23.390> too<00:03:23.480> much<00:03:23.570> of<00:03:23.720> an<00:03:23.840> issue<00:03:23.960> in<00:03:24.890> those

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
makes too much of an issue in those

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.310 
makes too much of an issue in those
areas<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:25.790> can<00:03:25.910> start<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.210> understand<00:03:26.750> how

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
areas you can start to understand how

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.750 
areas you can start to understand how
you<00:03:27.350> can<00:03:27.620> go<00:03:27.710> about<00:03:28.960> you<00:03:29.960> know<00:03:30.580> improving<00:03:31.580> and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
you can go about you know improving and

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.940 
you can go about you know improving and
getting<00:03:31.790> rid<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.210> some<00:03:32.360> bad<00:03:32.510> 5<00:03:32.750> those<00:03:32.960> areas<00:03:33.290> so

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
getting rid of some bad 5 those areas so

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.930 
getting rid of some bad 5 those areas so
for<00:03:34.190> instance<00:03:34.270> um<00:03:35.270> women<00:03:36.230> right<00:03:36.770> first<00:03:37.670> place

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
for instance um women right first place

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.790 
for instance um women right first place
to<00:03:38.120> store<00:03:38.330> fat<00:03:38.570> will<00:03:38.840> be<00:03:38.990> in<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.350> hips<00:03:39.560> and

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
to store fat will be in the hips and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.310 
to store fat will be in the hips and
thighs<00:03:40.160> generally<00:03:41.150> now<00:03:41.630> if<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.810> want<00:03:41.990> to<00:03:42.020> lose

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
thighs generally now if you want to lose

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.740 
thighs generally now if you want to lose
fat<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.950> first<00:03:43.340> place<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:43.670> will<00:03:44.090> lose<00:03:44.300> 5<00:03:44.570> is

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
fat the first place you will lose 5 is

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.660 
fat the first place you will lose 5 is
somewhere<00:03:45.110> else<00:03:45.350> at<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.710> last<00:03:46.010> place<00:03:46.280> during

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
somewhere else at the last place during

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.670 
somewhere else at the last place during
to<00:03:46.820> lose<00:03:46.970> fat<00:03:47.240> is<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:48.230> area<00:03:48.440> again

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
to lose fat is in that area again

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.490 
to lose fat is in that area again
because<00:03:49.550> those<00:03:49.760> receptors<00:03:50.180> are<00:03:50.480> very<00:03:50.720> good<00:03:51.350> to

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
because those receptors are very good to

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.170 
because those receptors are very good to
hold<00:03:51.800> on<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> fat<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:52.760> they<00:03:52.850> will<00:03:53.000> not

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
hold on to the fat and they will not

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.870 
hold on to the fat and they will not
release<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.630> until<00:03:53.990> it<00:03:54.470> very<00:03:54.680> last<00:03:54.890> moment<00:03:55.100> so

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
release it until it very last moment so

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.160 
release it until it very last moment so
you're<00:03:56.060> going<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.270> lose<00:03:56.600> you're<00:03:56.990> going<00:03:57.110> to

you're going to lose you're going to

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.160 
you're going to lose you're going to
gain<00:03:57.410> fat<00:03:57.740> in<00:03:57.980> those<00:03:58.130> areas<00:03:58.520> first<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.510> those

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
gain fat in those areas first and those

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.660 
gain fat in those areas first and those
same<00:04:00.500> areas<00:04:00.770> will<00:04:01.280> lose<00:04:01.640> fat<00:04:02.030> last<00:04:02.980> men<00:04:03.980> you're

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
same areas will lose fat last men you're

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.490 
same areas will lose fat last men you're
going<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:04.880> gain<00:04:05.090> fat<00:04:05.480> mainly<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.380> the

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
going to gain fat mainly of the

seeing the results that you want because

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.939 
seeing the results that you want because
the<00:04:34.000> key<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.449> to<00:04:34.479> develop<00:04:34.900> over<00:04:35.349> time<00:04:35.379> a

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
the key is to develop over time a

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.369 
the key is to develop over time a
lifestyle<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.639> promotes<00:04:37.139> healthy<00:04:38.139> eating

lifestyle that promotes healthy eating
regular<00:04:39.099> exercise<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:40.000> obviously<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.020> need

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
regular exercise and obviously you need

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.899 
regular exercise and obviously you need
to<00:04:41.259> do<00:04:41.349> periodic<00:04:41.860> cleansing<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.340> talked<00:04:42.639> about

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
to do periodic cleansing I talked about

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.179 
to do periodic cleansing I talked about
this<00:04:43.030> in<00:04:43.090> another<00:04:43.300> video<00:04:43.719> on<00:04:44.159> losing<00:04:45.159> weight

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
this in another video on losing weight

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.050 
this in another video on losing weight
and<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:46.210> importance<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:47.069> cleansing<00:04:48.069> to<00:04:48.849> help

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
and the importance of cleansing to help

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.300 
and the importance of cleansing to help
you<00:04:49.210> lose<00:04:49.419> weight<00:04:49.449> is<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.379> it<00:04:50.650> tells<00:04:51.009> the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
you lose weight is that it tells the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.179 
you lose weight is that it tells the
body<00:04:51.550> or<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.389> actually<00:04:52.539> helps<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.379> body<00:04:53.530> rid

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189 
body or it actually helps the body rid

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.869 
body or it actually helps the body rid
rid<00:04:54.669> itself<00:04:54.939> of<00:04:55.120> toxins<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:56.520> build<00:04:57.520> up<00:04:57.699> of

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:57.879 
rid itself of toxins and build up of

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.760 
rid itself of toxins and build up of
stuff<00:04:58.360> of<00:04:58.539> acid<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.020> toxins<00:04:59.529> that<00:04:59.590> gets

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
to be to say hey listen fat we can

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.050 
to be to say hey listen fat we can
actually<00:05:10.960> shrink<00:05:11.560> in<00:05:11.710> size<00:05:11.740> because<00:05:12.460> not<00:05:12.789> as

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
actually shrink in size because not as

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.749 
actually shrink in size because not as
many<00:05:13.689> of<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.930> toxins<00:05:14.560> are<00:05:14.680> in<00:05:14.740> our<00:05:14.830> body<00:05:15.069> right

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
many of the toxins are in our body right

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.360 
many of the toxins are in our body right
our<00:05:15.909> fat<00:05:16.180> cells<00:05:16.210> are<00:05:16.629> storage<00:05:17.110> basins<00:05:17.439> for

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
our fat cells are storage basins for

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.519 
our fat cells are storage basins for
toxins<00:05:18.819> right<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:19.419> they<00:05:19.539> basically<00:05:19.689> swell<00:05:20.319> in

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:20.529 
toxins right so they basically swell in

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.369 
toxins right so they basically swell in
size<00:05:20.830> with<00:05:21.699> more<00:05:22.029> toxic<00:05:22.569> accumulation<00:05:22.840> in<00:05:23.349> the

those<00:05:26.650> fat<00:05:26.889> cells<00:05:26.919> can<00:05:27.279> shrink<00:05:27.669> in<00:05:27.849> size<00:05:27.879> as

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
those fat cells can shrink in size as

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.869 
those fat cells can shrink in size as
more<00:05:28.779> the<00:05:28.870> toxins<00:05:29.439> and<00:05:29.560> acid<00:05:30.009> leave<00:05:30.669> our
