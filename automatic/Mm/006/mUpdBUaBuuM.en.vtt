are<00:00:28.050> an<00:00:28.470> overpowered<00:00:29.189> attack<00:00:29.519> strategy<00:00:30.150> but

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
are an overpowered attack strategy but

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
are an overpowered attack strategy but
from<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.170> first<00:00:31.439> attack<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:32.070> will<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.279> able

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
from this first attack we will be able

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.180

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190

it<00:00:35.820> isn't<00:00:36.239> always<00:00:36.480> completely<00:00:37.050> effective<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it isn't always completely effective to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040 
it isn't always completely effective to
use<00:00:37.829> dragons<00:00:38.550> even<00:00:39.180> when<00:00:39.360> you've<00:00:39.480> planned<00:00:39.840> out

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
use dragons even when you've planned out

use dragons even when you've planned out
a<00:00:40.079> pretty<00:00:40.649> effective<00:00:40.890> strategy<00:00:41.790> here

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
