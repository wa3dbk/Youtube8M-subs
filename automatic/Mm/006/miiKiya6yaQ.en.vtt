00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.049
 Dr. Jorge or 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:17.759
 please percent architecture for how borgia 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.419
 welcome please 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.320
 architecture 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.050
 the architecture of database systems of three schemas 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.780
 was approved by the an cilia es park 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.999
 in 1975 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:45.469
 as an aid in achieving separation between application programs and 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:46.420
 data 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.420
 the management of multiple lists by users 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:54.029
 and the use of a catalog to store the database schema 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.100
 internal level 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.539
 but internal scheme 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.129
 which describes the physical structure of database storage employs 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.890
 a physical data model 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.450
 and the public data that exists that are really at this level 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.080
 conceptual level 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.290
 that in this conceptual scheme 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.770
 describes the structure of all the database for a community of users 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 hides the physical details of storage 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.840
 and works with playful elements as an entity 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.810
 attribute that and relationships 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.880
 external level or views 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.950
 has several is that more than external users bishops 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.490
 each scheme describes the vision that you have of the base of 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.460
 to a group his farewell hiding the rest 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.590
 arcor 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.680
 p 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.950
 a data model 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.950
 is the structure or format of a database 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.090
 Within this there are many models 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.160
 first I move from tables 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.610
 which consists of a unique two-dimensional series of data elements 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.590
 where all members of a column are assumed to have similar roles 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.889
 and all the members of the row are assumed to be related by the one 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.839
 with the other 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.049
 hierarchical model 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.150
 in this the data is organized in a similar structure with a tree 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:27.029
 implying with a link only ascending in each record to 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.909
 write nest 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.389
 i a class field 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.159
 to keep the remains of a particular wall 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.729
 of same level quality 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.289
 network model is a variation on hierarchical model 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.559
 has given that it is built on the concept of fine bouquets emanating from one 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.279
 ovaries not os 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.349
 network mode 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.409
 is able to represent data redundancy in a more efficient way 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.439
 that the hierarchical model 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.389
 dimensional model 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.029
 is a specialized adaptation of the relational model 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:06.009
 I used to represent data in data repositories 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.049
 on a road 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.209
 that the data can easily be consumed using hello queries 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.639
 not what 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.759
 In recent years the paradigm through objects has been applied to pedagogy 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.079
 Database 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.079
 creating a new model of the program 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.889
 for the application of database systems it is necessary to take into account that 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.140
 there is a parameter 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.140
