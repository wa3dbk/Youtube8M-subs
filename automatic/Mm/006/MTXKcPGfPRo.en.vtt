00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey YouTube it's ICU and today just want

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.850 
hey YouTube it's ICU and today just want
to<00:00:03.600> talk<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.870> you<00:00:03.960> guys<00:00:04.020> about<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.410> possible

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:04.860 
to talk to you guys about a possible

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.480 
to talk to you guys about a possible
ipod<00:00:05.610> nano<00:00:05.880> 6th<00:00:06.480> generation<00:00:06.930> jailbreak<00:00:07.859> this

ipod nano 6th generation jailbreak this
guy<00:00:08.670> named<00:00:08.970> James<00:00:09.300> Welton<00:00:10.050> managed<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.769> hack

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
guy named James Welton managed to hack

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.299 
guy named James Welton managed to hack
his<00:00:11.160> 6th<00:00:11.519> generation<00:00:11.760> ipod<00:00:12.510> nano<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.309> he

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
his 6th generation ipod nano and he

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.849 
his 6th generation ipod nano and he
actually<00:00:14.719> bypassed<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> cache<00:00:16.170> comparison

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
actually bypassed the cache comparison

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.950 
actually bypassed the cache comparison
of<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.069> device<00:00:17.339> which<00:00:17.999> resulted<00:00:18.749> in

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
of the device which resulted in

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.499 
of the device which resulted in
installing<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:20.069> a<00:00:20.189> hack<00:00:20.399> on<00:00:20.669> the<00:00:20.909> springboard

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
installing of a hack on the springboard

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.919 
installing of a hack on the springboard
of<00:00:21.839> the<00:00:21.960> ipod<00:00:22.380> nano<00:00:22.970> which<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.359> allowed<00:00:24.659> him

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
of the ipod nano which then allowed him

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.089 
of the ipod nano which then allowed him
to<00:00:25.199> create<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.890> blank<00:00:26.189> space<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.529> basically<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to create a blank space so basically the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.489 
to create a blank space so basically the
hack<00:00:29.309> is<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:30.089> the<00:00:30.269> removal<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> nap<00:00:31.169> in<00:00:31.409> the

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
hack is just the removal of a nap in the

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.500 
hack is just the removal of a nap in the
creation<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> blank<00:00:32.489> space<00:00:32.789> it's<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.300> most

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
creation of a blank space it's what most

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.200 
creation of a blank space it's what most
people<00:00:34.050> who<00:00:34.260> hack<00:00:34.500> their<00:00:34.769> iOS<00:00:34.949> devices<00:00:35.640> used

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
people who hack their iOS devices used

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.779 
people who hack their iOS devices used
to<00:00:36.390> create<00:00:36.480> complex<00:00:37.440> themes<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.190> just

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
to create complex themes is just

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.579 
to create complex themes is just
basically<00:00:39.149> blank<00:00:39.600> spots<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.199> their

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
basically blank spots in their

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.880 
basically blank spots in their
springboard<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.820> he's<00:00:42.629> saying<00:00:42.929> that<00:00:43.350> that's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
springboard so he's saying that that's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
springboard so he's saying that that's
not<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> actual<00:00:44.579> important<00:00:45.179> part<00:00:45.359> but<00:00:45.510> what's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
not the actual important part but what's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.049 
not the actual important part but what's
really<00:00:45.989> important<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.129> bypass<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
really important is the bypass of the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.779 
really important is the bypass of the
nanos<00:00:48.420> cash<00:00:48.749> comparison<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:50.160> compares<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
nanos cash comparison which compares the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.239 
nanos cash comparison which compares the
modified<00:00:51.300> springboard<00:00:51.960> file<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.589> reverse<00:00:53.010> it

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.249 
modified springboard file and reverse it

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:55.669 
modified springboard file and reverse it
if<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.550> doesn't<00:00:53.909> like<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.359> so<00:00:54.809> he<00:00:55.289> says<00:00:55.499> that

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
if it doesn't like it so he says that

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.739 
if it doesn't like it so he says that
this<00:00:55.829> opens<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.429> the<00:00:56.579> possibility<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.179> hacking

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
this opens up the possibility of hacking

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.829 
this opens up the possibility of hacking
and<00:00:58.019> modding<00:00:58.620> well<00:00:59.159> not<00:00:59.640> adding<00:01:00.210> boot<00:01:00.449> loaders

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
and modding well not adding boot loaders

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.020 
and modding well not adding boot loaders
or<00:01:00.989> any<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.350> other<00:01:01.469> stuff<00:01:01.769> so<00:01:02.579> basically

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
or any of that other stuff so basically

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.149 
or any of that other stuff so basically
boot<00:01:03.359> loaders<00:01:03.659> can<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.170> complex<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> that's

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
boot loaders can be complex and that's

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.160 
boot loaders can be complex and that's
why<00:01:05.430> sometimes<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.299> jailbreaks<00:01:06.780> take

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
why sometimes the jailbreaks take

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380 
why sometimes the jailbreaks take
forever<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.799> come<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.119> I'm

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
forever to come out but with this I'm

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
forever to come out but with this I'm
assuming<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.619> you'd<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.979> able<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.220> jailbreak

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
assuming that you'd be able to jailbreak

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.840 
assuming that you'd be able to jailbreak
it<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.149> any<00:01:12.479> version<00:01:12.810> whatever<00:01:13.470> version<00:01:14.430> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it on any version whatever version of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760 
it on any version whatever version of
operating<00:01:15.450> system<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.899> running<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> doesn't

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
operating system it's running it doesn't

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.010 
operating system it's running it doesn't
matter<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.549> most<00:01:18.060> likely<00:01:18.299> will<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.780> able<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
matter you most likely will be able to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
matter you most likely will be able to
jailbreak<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:19.680> don't<00:01:19.920> quote<00:01:20.189> me<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.399> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
jailbreak and now don't quote me on that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
jailbreak and now don't quote me on that
that's<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.210> what<00:01:21.329> I<00:01:21.540> take<00:01:21.810> from<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that's just what I take from this and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.730 
that's just what I take from this and
that's<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.219> understand<00:01:23.880> from<00:01:23.969> it

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
that's just what I understand from it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.889 
that's just what I understand from it
also<00:01:25.740> he<00:01:26.250> said<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> device<00:01:27.329> is<00:01:27.570> P

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
also he said that in the device is P

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.279 
also he said that in the device is P

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so on so basically a plist file is just

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
so on so basically a plist file is just
a<00:01:38.039> file<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.369> tells<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:39.000> device<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
a file that tells your device what it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.200 
a file that tells your device what it
can<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.869> cannot<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.060> guys

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
can and cannot do so if you guys

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.139 
can and cannot do so if you guys
remember<00:01:42.390> correctly<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.469> iphone<00:01:44.460> 3g

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
remember correctly in the iphone 3g

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.660 
remember correctly in the iphone 3g
there<00:01:45.359> was<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> plist<00:01:46.770> setting<00:01:47.280> for

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
there was actually a plist setting for

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.429 
there was actually a plist setting for
some<00:01:47.850> things<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.210> were<00:01:48.420> disabled<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.289> in

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
some things that were disabled in it in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.060 
some things that were disabled in it in
iOS<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.969> things<00:01:51.630> include<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.799> Game

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
iOS for now the things include like Game

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.870 
iOS for now the things include like Game
Center<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.880> also<00:01:54.469> multitasking<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:55.880> just

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
Center and also multitasking and just

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.669 
Center and also multitasking and just
certain<00:01:57.210> things<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.869> well<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.350> has

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
certain things like that well this has
