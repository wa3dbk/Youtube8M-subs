so for those who are looking for a

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
blu-ray playback you have to look

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.610 
blu-ray playback you have to look
elsewhere<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.840> most<00:01:42.020> highlighted<00:01:42.440> feature

with<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.040> super<00:01:43.280> drive<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.610> my<00:01:43.730> opinion<00:01:44.060> is

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
with the super drive in my opinion is

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.460 
with the super drive in my opinion is
that<00:01:44.270> really<00:01:44.480> is<00:01:44.630> anything<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.170> do<00:01:45.260> with<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
that really is anything to do with the

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.530 
that really is anything to do with the
specs<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:45.890> actually<00:01:46.190> its<00:01:46.370> design<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.300> drive

solid design which would definitely

to give a grip as was the Apple logo in

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.990 
to give a grip as was the Apple logo in
the<00:02:39.739> center<00:02:40.010> here<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.370> turn<00:02:40.790> some

the center here and turn some
assumptions<00:02:41.510> very<00:02:41.780> simple<00:02:42.140> as<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.470> guys<00:02:42.590> saw

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
assumptions very simple as you guys saw

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.260 
assumptions very simple as you guys saw
on<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.920> diagram<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.459> box<00:02:43.730> spring<00:02:44.180> which

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
on the diagram on the box spring which

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.690 
on the diagram on the box spring which
is<00:02:44.420> plug<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:44.930> play

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
is plug in and play

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.490 
is plug in and play
so<00:02:47.270> here's<00:02:47.480> what<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.720> super<00:02:47.959> job<00:02:48.110> looks<00:02:48.349> like

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
so here's what the super job looks like

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.140 
so here's what the super job looks like
with<00:02:48.620> next<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.980> my<00:02:49.069> retina<00:02:49.430> map<00:02:49.640> Pro<00:02:49.970> it

with next to my retina map Pro it

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.850 
with next to my retina map Pro it
doesn't<00:02:50.480> look<00:02:50.569> too<00:02:50.720> bad<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:51.380> nice<00:02:51.560> at<00:02:51.770> the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
doesn't look too bad it's nice at the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.070 
doesn't look too bad it's nice at the
two<00:02:52.040> devices<00:02:52.580> do<00:02:52.970> kind<00:02:53.300> of<00:02:53.330> match<00:02:53.510> because<00:02:53.900> of

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
two devices do kind of match because of

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.650 
two devices do kind of match because of

the metal aluminum design on the drive

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.240 
the metal aluminum design on the drive
itself<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.230> will<00:02:57.650> say<00:02:57.830> though<00:02:58.010> it's<00:02:58.099> probably

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
itself I will say though it's probably

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.680 
itself I will say though it's probably
something<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.910> won't<00:02:59.150> keep<00:02:59.390> on<00:02:59.569> your

eject button built on the drive itself I

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.770 
eject button built on the drive itself I
think's<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.730> little<00:03:40.880> bit<00:03:40.970> more<00:03:41.120> easier<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.690> do

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
think's a little bit more easier to do

think's a little bit more easier to do
it<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.049> way<00:03:42.200> but<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.920> eject<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.430> desk<00:03:43.640> is

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
it that way but to eject the desk is

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.309 
it that way but to eject the desk is
very<00:03:43.790> simple<00:03:44.269> just<00:03:44.480> hit<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.720> eject<00:03:44.989> button<00:03:45.049> on

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
very simple just hit the eject button on

very simple just hit the eject button on
your<00:03:45.440> Mac<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.250> should<00:03:46.430> come<00:03:46.610> out<00:03:46.760> in<00:03:46.819> a<00:03:47.030> few

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
your Mac and it should come out in a few

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.490 
your Mac and it should come out in a few
seconds<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:50.019> that's<00:03:51.019> pretty<00:03:51.230> much<00:03:51.290> how<00:03:51.440> it

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
seconds and that's pretty much how it

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.819 
seconds and that's pretty much how it
works

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
works

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030

pause<00:03:56.180> though<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.540> reason<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:56.840> say<00:03:57.049> that<00:03:57.079> is

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
pause though the reason I say that is

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.630 
pause though the reason I say that is
just<00:03:57.380> because<00:03:57.620> there's<00:03:58.100> really<00:03:58.220> nothing

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
just because there's really nothing

special about it it's just doing

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.900 
special about it it's just doing
something<00:03:59.989> that<00:04:00.380> it's<00:04:00.769> been<00:04:00.920> around<00:04:01.130> for<00:04:01.430> a

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
drive is many to match your Apple

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.920

the<00:04:28.729> best<00:04:28.820> one<00:04:29.060> out<00:04:29.150> there<00:04:29.210> in<00:04:29.479> terms<00:04:29.600> of

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
the best one out there in terms of

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.180 
the best one out there in terms of
matching<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.380> aesthetics<00:04:30.770> of<00:04:30.860> both<00:04:31.039> your

how<00:04:33.650> much<00:04:33.770> third-party<00:04:34.400> CD<00:04:34.760> drives<00:04:35.000> do<00:04:35.240> run<00:04:35.479> by

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
how much third-party CD drives do run by

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.700 
how much third-party CD drives do run by
I'm<00:04:35.690> sure<00:04:35.750> they're<00:04:36.020> considerably<00:04:36.440> cheaper

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
I'm sure they're considerably cheaper

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.550 
I'm sure they're considerably cheaper
than<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.360> $79<00:04:38.360> asking<00:04:38.810> price<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.140> Apple<00:04:39.440> has

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
than the $79 asking price that Apple has

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.060 
than the $79 asking price that Apple has
to<00:04:39.710> offer

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
to offer

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.710 
to offer
in<00:04:40.520> quite<00:04:40.700> honestly<00:04:41.030> because<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.479> super

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
in quite honestly because the super

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.270 
in quite honestly because the super
drive<00:04:41.900> does<00:04:42.110> take<00:04:42.350> up<00:04:42.500> quite<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.710> bit<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:42.950> desk

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
drive does take up quite a bit of desk

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.860 
drive does take up quite a bit of desk
real<00:04:43.490> estate<00:04:43.760> especially<00:04:44.150> if<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.300> small<00:04:44.539> desk

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
real estate especially if a small desk

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.029 
real estate especially if a small desk
it's<00:04:45.139> probably<00:04:45.410> something<00:04:45.560> that<00:04:45.650> I'll<00:04:45.770> sit<00:04:46.010> in

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
it's probably something that I'll sit in

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.590 
it's probably something that I'll sit in
my<00:04:46.220> drawers<00:04:46.550> rather<00:04:46.940> than<00:04:47.150> sitting<00:04:47.419> on<00:04:47.479> the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
my drawers rather than sitting on the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.330 
my drawers rather than sitting on the
desk<00:04:47.750> itself<00:04:48.229> so<00:04:48.650> unless<00:04:48.830> you're<00:04:49.010> using<00:04:49.160> these

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
desk itself so unless you're using these

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.190 
desk itself so unless you're using these
all<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.760> time<00:04:49.789> I<00:04:50.180> recommend<00:04:50.600> a<00:04:50.690> third<00:04:50.840> party

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
all the time I recommend a third party

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.810 
all the time I recommend a third party
one<00:04:51.350> as<00:04:51.530> they're<00:04:51.680> much<00:04:51.830> more<00:04:52.010> cheaper<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.580> if

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
one as they're much more cheaper and if

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.980 
one as they're much more cheaper and if
something<00:04:53.090> just<00:04:53.240> can<00:04:53.389> easily<00:04:53.690> throw<00:04:53.810> in<00:04:53.960> a

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
something just can easily throw in a

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.480 
something just can easily throw in a
desk<00:04:54.200> and<00:04:54.440> when<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.650> need<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:54.950> pull<00:04:55.220> it<00:04:55.340> out

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
desk and when you need it pull it out

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.670 
desk and when you need it pull it out
use<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.030> when<00:04:56.390> you're<00:04:56.510> done<00:04:56.599> put<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.080> away<00:04:57.169> for

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
use it when you're done put it away for

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.200 
use it when you're done put it away for
my<00:04:57.770> purposes<00:04:58.250> it's<00:04:58.490> simply<00:04:58.760> something<00:04:58.909> nice

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
my purposes it's simply something nice

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.860 
my purposes it's simply something nice
