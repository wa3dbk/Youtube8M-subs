00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.799
 our house on raiding the other half 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.289
 of the price 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.270
 Hey guys, how are you? All right, how many times? 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.010
 already heard that phrase is not 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.070
 already in the Brazilian culture will win 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.900
 discount asking that the low price is 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.400
 that every time you hear it, it's 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.949
 because the customer did not understand why 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.570
 must pay this price and did not realize the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.369
 value of your product 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.100
 I already did a video talking about how 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.960
 put value and not price of your product 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.820
 I'll leave the link down here if you 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.700
 have not seen i always show in 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.110
 I like the house, just so I do not have 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.950
 sure if he's talking because 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.989
 really liked it or why it was 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.300
 automatic trying to conquer school 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.390
 and there continues my questioning why 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.760
 It's expensive compared here eating the customer 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.579
 knows that his cake will not appear in 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.840
 another wedding album is exclusive not 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.270
 is a homemade handmade case with 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.790
 quality therefore costs more 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.740
 when your client comes to talk about 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.360
 benefits of the product of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.010
 it costs half the price 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.909
 never replace a product of the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.369
 competition listen agree quickly 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.560
 and come back to the subject soon but that's it 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.750
 So I'll talk about your cake and then 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.150
 Engages in talking about your differential 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.729
 the increase in the differential always knows 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.369
 which holds the price of what the service is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.659
 quality is uniqueness of use 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.430
 of this information 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.189
 in his argument in his conversation with his 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.600
 customer good people for today so hopefully 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.520
