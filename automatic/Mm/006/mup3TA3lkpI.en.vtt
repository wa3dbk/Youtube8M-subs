00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
tournament it's not that hard to win

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.270 
tournament it's not that hard to win
actually<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.990> pretty<00:01:07.140> hard<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.590> win<00:01:07.740> look<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
actually is pretty hard to win look the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
actually is pretty hard to win look the
reason<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> glitch<00:01:09.210> no<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.720> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
reason it's not a glitch no more is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
reason it's not a glitch no more is
because<00:01:10.140> before<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.830> start<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.430> play<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
because before you start to play the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.330 
because before you start to play the
tournament<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.869> were<00:01:13.049> able<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> continue

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
tournament and you were able to continue

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
tournament and you were able to continue
to<00:01:14.520> win<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.299> tournament<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.869> get<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> packs

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to win the tournament and get the packs

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289 
to win the tournament and get the packs
but<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> wasn't<00:01:17.490> supposed<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.000> thing

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
but that wasn't supposed to be a thing

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.870 
but that wasn't supposed to be a thing
now<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.110> actually<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> fact<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
now it actually is a fact really this

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.280 
now it actually is a fact really this
should<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> thing<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.689> always<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
should be a thing that's always in the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.320 
should be a thing that's always in the
