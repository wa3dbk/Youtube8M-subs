know you live by the ocean and you just
constantly<00:00:30.470> drop<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.519> camera<00:00:31.789> into<00:00:31.999> water

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
constantly drop the camera into water

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.670 
constantly drop the camera into water
and<00:00:32.480> do<00:00:32.599> stuff<00:00:32.810> like<00:00:32.930> that

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
and do stuff like that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.800 
and do stuff like that
it's<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.160> perfect<00:00:34.520> camera<00:00:34.700> for<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:34.970> because

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
it's the perfect camera for that because

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.630 
it's the perfect camera for that because
it<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:36.110> fully<00:00:36.710> shockproof<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:37.550> waterproof

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
which is really pretty deep as well as

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.130 
which is really pretty deep as well as
it's<00:00:43.340> also<00:00:43.460> shock<00:00:43.820> absorbing<00:00:44.180> it's<00:00:44.270> up<00:00:44.330> to<00:00:44.450> 6.6

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
it's also shock absorbing it's up to 6.6

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.800 
it's also shock absorbing it's up to 6.6
foot<00:00:45.680> drop<00:00:46.010> it<00:00:46.220> can<00:00:46.370> take<00:00:46.610> its<00:00:47.000> winterize<00:00:47.600> and

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
foot drop it can take its winterize and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.470 
foot drop it can take its winterize and
go<00:00:47.930> negative<00:00:48.200> 10<00:00:48.560> but<00:00:49.280> below<00:00:49.760> zero<00:00:50.000> Celsius

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
go negative 10 but below zero Celsius

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.140 
go negative 10 but below zero Celsius
which<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.020> really<00:00:51.440> really<00:00:51.560> cold<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.550> LED<00:00:53.000> can

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
which is really really cold the LED can

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.170 
which is really really cold the LED can
absorb<00:00:53.420> up<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.830> 220<00:00:54.830> pounds<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:55.340> impact<00:00:55.760> it's

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
absorb up to 220 pounds of impact it's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.790 
absorb up to 220 pounds of impact it's
absolutely<00:00:57.050> incredible

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
absolutely incredible

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.890 
absolutely incredible
it's<00:00:58.250> got<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.400> 14<00:00:58.880> megapixel<00:00:59.450> sensor<00:00:59.750> so<00:00:59.870> you

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
it's got a 14 megapixel sensor so you

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.270 
it's got a 14 megapixel sensor so you
know<00:01:00.080> it's<00:01:00.170> going<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:00.350> produce<00:01:00.980> some<00:01:01.250> pretty

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
know it's going to produce some pretty

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.270 
know it's going to produce some pretty
awesome<00:01:01.700> images<00:01:02.530> 5x<00:01:03.530> optical<00:01:03.710> zoom<00:01:04.009> it's

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
awesome images 5x optical zoom it's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.030 
awesome images 5x optical zoom it's
actually<00:01:04.549> an<00:01:04.610> f3<00:01:05.000> point<00:01:05.239> 5<00:01:05.420> 2<00:01:05.630> F<00:01:05.750> 5.1<00:01:06.470> it's<00:01:06.860> got

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
actually an f3 point 5 2 F 5.1 it's got

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.430 
actually an f3 point 5 2 F 5.1 it's got
image<00:01:07.370> stabilization<00:01:07.730> in<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.900> lens<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:09.290> is<00:01:09.320> a

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
image stabilization in the lens it is a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.050 
image stabilization in the lens it is a
sensor<00:01:10.010> shift<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:10.370> it's<00:01:10.460> actually<00:01:10.580> not<00:01:10.910> the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
sensor shift so it's actually not the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.730 
sensor shift so it's actually not the
lens<00:01:11.240> it's<00:01:11.660> actually<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.140> sensor<00:01:12.500> but<00:01:12.650> it's

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
lens it's actually the sensor but it's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.020 
lens it's actually the sensor but it's
kind<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:12.920> in<00:01:13.010> between<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.640> sensor<00:01:13.910> will

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
kind of in between the sensor will

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.490 
kind of in between the sensor will
actually<00:01:14.420> shift<00:01:14.630> up<00:01:14.870> and<00:01:15.050> down<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.380> if<00:01:15.470> you're

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
actually shift up and down so if you're

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.080 
actually shift up and down so if you're
shaking<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.010> camera<00:01:16.190> and<00:01:16.550> that<00:01:16.820> was<00:01:16.970> gonna

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
shaking the camera and that was gonna

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.820 
shaking the camera and that was gonna
produce<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.480> blurry<00:01:17.720> image<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.440> sensor<00:01:18.770> is

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
produce a blurry image the sensor is

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.020 
produce a blurry image the sensor is
gonna<00:01:18.980> shake<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.220> little<00:01:19.460> bit<00:01:19.550> too<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:19.970> it

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
gonna shake a little bit too so that it

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.820 
gonna shake a little bit too so that it
matches<00:01:20.180> up<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.810> get<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:21.080> sharp<00:01:21.409> image

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
matches up and you get a sharp image

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.990 
matches up and you get a sharp image
it's<00:01:22.520> got<00:01:22.790> a<00:01:22.820> very<00:01:23.420> very<00:01:23.510> nice<00:01:23.750> 2.7<00:01:24.560> inch
