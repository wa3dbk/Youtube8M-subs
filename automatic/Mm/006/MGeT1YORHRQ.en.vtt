know<00:01:19.920> each<00:01:20.100> other<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.580> well<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.909> you'll

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
know each other so well that you'll

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.850 
know each other so well that you'll
start<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.960> exactly<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.650> they're<00:01:22.740> gonna

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
start to know exactly what they're gonna

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.140 
start to know exactly what they're gonna
do<00:01:23.100> how<00:01:23.340> they're<00:01:23.490> gonna<00:01:23.549> move<00:01:23.790> around<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> map

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
do how they're gonna move around the map

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.260 
do how they're gonna move around the map
and<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.310> automatically<00:01:26.310> adapt<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and you can just automatically adapt to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.730 
and you can just automatically adapt to
what<00:01:27.420> they're<00:01:27.659> doing<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.590> that's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
what they're doing and I think that's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.370 
what they're doing and I think that's
just<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> most<00:01:29.159> important<00:01:29.579> thing<00:01:29.759> um<00:01:30.380> next

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
just the most important thing um next

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.469 
just the most important thing um next
thing<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.850> rest<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.180> these<00:01:33.240> aren't

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
thing is and the rest of these aren't

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.179 
thing is and the rest of these aren't
really<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.750> any<00:01:33.930> particular<00:01:34.200> order<00:01:34.619> because

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
really in any particular order because

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.560 
really in any particular order because
it's<00:01:35.369> hard<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.790> rank<00:01:36.180> them<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.509> order

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's hard to really rank them in order

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
it's hard to really rank them in order
of<00:01:36.900> importance<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> next<00:01:38.400> thing<00:01:38.460> would

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of importance but the next thing would

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.660 
of importance but the next thing would
probably<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.720> sensitivity<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
probably be sensitivity and this is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.289 
probably be sensitivity and this is
talking<00:01:41.970> about<00:01:42.000> controller<00:01:42.630> sensitivity<00:01:43.320> um

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
talking about controller sensitivity um

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.569 
talking about controller sensitivity um
for<00:01:45.299> competitive<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.890> game<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.490> would

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
for competitive in this game I would

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.580 
for competitive in this game I would
have<00:01:48.149> your<00:01:48.299> sensitivity<00:01:48.990> anywhere<00:01:49.470> between

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
have your sensitivity anywhere between

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.370 
have your sensitivity anywhere between
three<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.340> five<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.720> reason<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.259> this

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
three and five and the reason for this

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.080 
three and five and the reason for this
is<00:01:52.829> because<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.520> need<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.880> able<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
is because you need to be able to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.480 
is because you need to be able to
control<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:55.439> aim<00:01:55.710> better<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.159> need<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> be

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
control your aim better you need to be

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.889 
control your aim better you need to be
able<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.700> keep<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.119> target<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> lot<00:01:57.869> of

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
able to keep it on target and a lot of

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.840 
able to keep it on target and a lot of
if<00:01:58.170> any<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.159> public<00:01:59.430> match<00:01:59.579> players

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
if any of you are public match players

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
if any of you are public match players
you<00:02:00.149> may<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.420> wondering<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:01.500> are<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
you may be wondering what are you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.990 
you may be wondering what are you
talking<00:02:02.009> about<00:02:02.159> you're<00:02:02.340> supposed<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> bump<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
talking about you're supposed to bump it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.740 
talking about you're supposed to bump it
up<00:02:03.119> um<00:02:04.369> with<00:02:05.369> competitive<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.509> doesn't

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
up um with competitive it really doesn't

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.969 
up um with competitive it really doesn't
make<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> difference<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.829> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
make a difference you have to have that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.330 
make a difference you have to have that
low<00:02:08.220> sensitivity<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:09.619> mean<00:02:10.619> generally<00:02:11.099> if

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
low sensitivity I mean generally if

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.930 
low sensitivity I mean generally if
you're<00:02:11.580> an<00:02:11.670> AR<00:02:11.940> player<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.420> would<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.629> even

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
you're an AR player it would be even

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.850 
you're an AR player it would be even
lower<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.390> would<00:02:13.900> say<00:02:14.080> for<00:02:14.230> an<00:02:14.320> AR<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.740> would

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
lower I would say for an AR you would

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.910 
lower I would say for an AR you would
want<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.070> be<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> 3<00:02:16.110> maybe<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.260> four<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.800> then

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
want to be a 3 maybe a four and then

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.830 
want to be a 3 maybe a four and then
submachine<00:02:18.580> gun<00:02:18.760> would<00:02:18.940> be<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> for<00:02:19.420> maybe<00:02:19.690> a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
submachine gun would be a for maybe a

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.740 
submachine gun would be a for maybe a
five<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.700> depending<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.540> long

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
five it's just depending on the long

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.750 
five it's just depending on the long
range<00:02:23.080> gunfights<00:02:23.380> versus<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.130> closer<00:02:24.370> range

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
range gunfights versus the closer range

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.340 
range gunfights versus the closer range
you<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.150> have<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:25.570> able<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.780> control

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
you just have to be able to control

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.250 
you just have to be able to control
where<00:02:26.680> your<00:02:26.830> gun<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.130> going<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.600> next<00:02:28.900> thing

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
where your gun is going the next thing

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.060 
where your gun is going the next thing
is<00:02:30.090> your<00:02:31.090> controller<00:02:31.510> layout<00:02:31.780> should

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
is your controller layout should

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.490 
is your controller layout should
probably<00:02:33.070> be<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.640> tactical<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:35.200> reason

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
probably be on tactical and the reason

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.460 
probably be on tactical and the reason
for<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.740> is<00:02:35.800> drop<00:02:36.610> shotting<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.300> pretty<00:02:38.230> good

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
for this is drop shotting is pretty good

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.730 
for this is drop shotting is pretty good
in<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.710> game<00:02:38.980> I'd<00:02:39.880> say<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.300> problem<00:02:41.200> kind

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
in this game I'd say it's problem kind

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.620 
in this game I'd say it's problem kind
of<00:02:41.920> equal<00:02:42.340> width<00:02:42.490> jump<00:02:42.730> shouting<00:02:43.060> some<00:02:43.360> people

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
of equal width jump shouting some people

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.790 
of equal width jump shouting some people
would<00:02:43.690> say<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.080> better<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.410> don't<00:02:44.710> know

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
would say it's better I don't know

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.530 
would say it's better I don't know
Infinity<00:02:45.250> Ward<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.550> known<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:45.940> drop<00:02:46.270> shotting

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
Infinity Ward is known for drop shotting

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.050 
Infinity Ward is known for drop shotting
being<00:02:46.840> better<00:02:47.110> than<00:02:47.550> jump<00:02:48.550> shouting<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.030> I

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
being better than jump shouting so I

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.140 
being better than jump shouting so I
mean<00:02:49.300> it's<00:02:49.450> still<00:02:49.510> personal<00:02:50.320> preference<00:02:50.740> but

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
mean it's still personal preference but

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.120 
mean it's still personal preference but
by<00:02:52.150> having<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.540> on<00:02:52.710> tactical<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:53.860> can<00:02:53.980> just

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
by having it on tactical you can just

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.040 
by having it on tactical you can just
press<00:02:54.310> in<00:02:54.550> your<00:02:54.580> joystick<00:02:55.480> you're<00:02:55.870> right

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
press in your joystick you're right

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.380 
press in your joystick you're right
joystick<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.010> it'll<00:02:57.250> just<00:02:57.280> drop<00:02:58.240> you

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
joystick and it'll just drop you

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.870 
joystick and it'll just drop you
straight<00:02:58.630> down<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.840> don't<00:02:59.140> have<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.760> know

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
straight down you don't have to you know

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.550 
straight down you don't have to you know
press<00:03:01.270> any<00:03:01.480> buttons<00:03:01.870> or<00:03:01.990> anything<00:03:02.020> take<00:03:02.440> your

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
press any buttons or anything take your

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.500 
press any buttons or anything take your
control<00:03:02.920> hamp<00:03:03.370> your<00:03:03.640> thumb<00:03:03.880> off<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.420> your

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
control hamp your thumb off of your

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.030 
control hamp your thumb off of your
joystick<00:03:04.930> or<00:03:04.990> anything<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.590> think<00:03:05.710> that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
joystick or anything so I think that

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.160 
joystick or anything so I think that
works<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.490> lot<00:03:07.060> better<00:03:07.120> for<00:03:07.540> most<00:03:07.810> people<00:03:08.290> um

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
works a lot better for most people um

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.720 
works a lot better for most people um
the<00:03:11.170> next<00:03:11.440> thing<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.980> course<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.460> was

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
the next thing is of course I was

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.070 
the next thing is of course I was
talking<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.030> little<00:03:13.120> bit<00:03:13.240> about<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.660> drop

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
talking a little bit about this drop

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.949 
talking a little bit about this drop
shotting<00:03:14.320> /<00:03:14.620> jump<00:03:14.860> shotting<00:03:15.280> um<00:03:15.630> generally<00:03:16.630> in

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
shotting / jump shotting um generally in

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.949 
shotting / jump shotting um generally in
this<00:03:17.140> game<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:18.040> want<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.550> probably<00:03:19.239> drop<00:03:19.720> shot

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
this game you want to probably drop shot

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.800 
this game you want to probably drop shot
over<00:03:20.320> drop<00:03:20.500> shotting<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:20.950> still<00:03:21.250> do<00:03:21.370> both<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.910> do

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
over drop shotting I still do both I do

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.180 
over drop shotting I still do both I do
a<00:03:22.930> lot<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.170> jump<00:03:23.440> shot<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.739> because<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:23.950> was

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
a lot of jump shot in because that was

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.770 
a lot of jump shot in because that was
what<00:03:24.340> was<00:03:24.459> better<00:03:24.700> in<00:03:24.910> black<00:03:25.120> ops<00:03:25.360> 2<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.660> it's

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
what was better in black ops 2 and it's

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.940 
what was better in black ops 2 and it's
taken<00:03:26.050> me<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.200> while<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.350> get<00:03:26.560> out<00:03:26.739> of<00:03:26.860> that

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
taken me a while to get out of that

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.040 
taken me a while to get out of that
habit<00:03:27.190> but<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.180> know<00:03:28.300> drop<00:03:28.510> shotting<00:03:28.780> is

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
habit but you know drop shotting is

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.400 
habit but you know drop shotting is
better<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.860> because<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:31.020> you<00:03:32.020> don't

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
better and because of this you don't

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.870 
better and because of this you don't
necessarily<00:03:32.680> have<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.310> have<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.580> scuff

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
necessarily have to have a scuff

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.540 
necessarily have to have a scuff
especially<00:03:34.780> since<00:03:35.100> marksman<00:03:36.100> rifles<00:03:36.430> are

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
especially since marksman rifles are

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.880 
especially since marksman rifles are
banned<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:37.050> competitive<00:03:38.050> this<00:03:38.500> means<00:03:38.770> that

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
banned in competitive this means that

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.840 
banned in competitive this means that
you<00:03:39.640> don't<00:03:39.850> have<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.160> trigger<00:03:42.489> finger

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
you don't have to have a trigger finger

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.290 
you don't have to have a trigger finger
at<00:03:43.030> all<00:03:43.390> um<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:44.980> don't<00:03:45.220> need<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.550> the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
at all um so you don't need the the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.090 
at all um so you don't need the the
trigger<00:03:46.660> stops<00:03:46.989> in<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.500> in<00:03:47.769> a<00:03:47.860> scuf

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
trigger stops in the in a scuf

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.620 
trigger stops in the in a scuf
controller<00:03:48.550> or<00:03:48.730> anything<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.540> you

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
controller or anything like that and you

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.199 
controller or anything like that and you
don't<00:03:49.870> need<00:03:50.280> really<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.400> extra<00:03:51.730> buttons<00:03:52.090> I

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
don't need really the extra buttons I

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.640 
don't need really the extra buttons I
mean<00:03:52.360> they're<00:03:52.480> nice<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.110> if<00:03:53.320> you<00:03:53.410> can<00:03:53.560> afford

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
mean they're nice and if you can afford

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.500 
mean they're nice and if you can afford
a<00:03:54.010> scuff<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.550> you<00:03:54.700> have<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:54.970> money<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.269> would

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
a scuff and you have the money I would

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.240 
a scuff and you have the money I would
still<00:03:55.870> get<00:03:56.019> it<00:03:56.200> but<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:56.890> don't<00:03:57.070> necessarily

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
still get it but you don't necessarily

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.710 
still get it but you don't necessarily
have<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.910> have<00:03:58.060> them<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.950> next<00:04:00.580> thing<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.970> I

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
have to have them the next thing is I

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.650 
have to have them the next thing is I
would<00:04:02.320> um<00:04:02.910> if<00:04:03.910> you<00:04:04.120> have<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.269> little<00:04:04.480> bit<00:04:04.630> of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
would um if you have a little bit of

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.300 
would um if you have a little bit of
money<00:04:04.810> these<00:04:04.989> only<00:04:05.200> cost<00:04:05.440> like<00:04:05.530> 10<00:04:05.830> bucks<00:04:06.010> I

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
money these only cost like 10 bucks I

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.550 
money these only cost like 10 bucks I
would<00:04:06.910> go<00:04:07.090> buy<00:04:07.330> some<00:04:07.720> control<00:04:08.080> freak<00:04:08.320> so<00:04:08.500> you

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
would go buy some control freak so you

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.150 
would go buy some control freak so you
can<00:04:08.739> go<00:04:09.220> online<00:04:09.400> for<00:04:09.820> them<00:04:10.110> they<00:04:11.110> are<00:04:11.160> little

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
can go online for them they are little

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.390 
can go online for them they are little
things<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.120> put<00:04:13.330> on<00:04:13.860> their<00:04:14.860> extensions

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
things that you put on their extensions

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.360 
things that you put on their extensions
for<00:04:15.580> your<00:04:16.080> joysticks<00:04:17.080> and<00:04:17.290> they<00:04:17.980> really<00:04:18.250> do

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
for your joysticks and they really do

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.130 
for your joysticks and they really do
help<00:04:18.400> improve<00:04:18.880> your<00:04:19.000> aim<00:04:19.150> I<00:04:19.419> was<00:04:19.600> skeptical<00:04:20.080> at

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
help improve your aim I was skeptical at

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.479 
help improve your aim I was skeptical at
first<00:04:20.200> but<00:04:20.470> I've<00:04:20.620> had<00:04:20.830> them<00:04:21.010> for<00:04:21.039> over<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.430> year

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
first but I've had them for over a year

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.830 
first but I've had them for over a year
now<00:04:21.700> I

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
now I

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.570 
now I
one<00:04:23.530> thing<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.770> should<00:04:24.010> be<00:04:24.100> noted<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.550> that

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
one thing that should be noted is that

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.710 
one thing that should be noted is that
some<00:04:25.090> are<00:04:25.120> better<00:04:25.389> than<00:04:25.570> others<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:27.669> CQC's<00:04:28.389> I

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
some are better than others the CQC's I

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.330 
some are better than others the CQC's I
thought<00:04:29.139> were<00:04:29.290> really<00:04:29.530> good<00:04:29.800> at<00:04:29.919> first<00:04:30.130> but

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
thought were really good at first but

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.060 
thought were really good at first but
they<00:04:31.150> they<00:04:31.870> tend<00:04:32.139> to<00:04:32.169> come<00:04:32.380> apart<00:04:32.680> fairly

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
they they tend to come apart fairly

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.650 
they they tend to come apart fairly
easily<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.580> I<00:04:33.639> would<00:04:33.880> stay<00:04:34.090> away<00:04:34.210> from<00:04:34.360> them

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
easily so I would stay away from them

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.680 
easily so I would stay away from them
the<00:04:35.080> others<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.740> I've<00:04:35.889> tried<00:04:36.449> have<00:04:37.449> worked

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
the others that I've tried have worked

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.650 
the others that I've tried have worked
so<00:04:37.900> far<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.410> currently<00:04:38.710> use<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.340> elite<00:04:39.669> they

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
so far I currently use the elite they

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.879 
so far I currently use the elite they
were<00:04:40.720> black<00:04:41.139> ops<00:04:41.410> 2<00:04:41.770> exclusive<00:04:42.610> ones<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.889> they

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
were black ops 2 exclusive ones and they

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.469 
were black ops 2 exclusive ones and they
work<00:04:45.310> really<00:04:45.520> well<00:04:45.639> they<00:04:45.850> haven't<00:04:46.000> broken<00:04:46.300> yet

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
work really well they haven't broken yet

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.659 
work really well they haven't broken yet
I've<00:04:46.630> had<00:04:46.780> them<00:04:46.960> for<00:04:47.139> like<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.620> don't<00:04:48.550> know

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
I've had them for like I don't know

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:49.920 
I've had them for like I don't know
since<00:04:48.880> they<00:04:49.000> came<00:04:49.150> out<00:04:49.300> like<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.510> first<00:04:49.720> week

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
since they came out like the first week

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.240 
since they came out like the first week
that<00:04:49.990> they<00:04:50.290> came<00:04:50.440> out<00:04:50.470> with<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.860> that's<00:04:51.040> when<00:04:51.190> I

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
that they came out with it that's when I

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.830 
that they came out with it that's when I
ordered<00:04:51.610> them<00:04:51.790> so<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.270> don't<00:04:52.479> know<00:04:52.540> how<00:04:52.660> long

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
ordered them so I don't know how long

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.090 
ordered them so I don't know how long
ago<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:53.080> was<00:04:53.260> but<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.620> was<00:04:53.710> several<00:04:53.860> months

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
ago that was but it was several months

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.090 
ago that was but it was several months
um<00:04:55.200> let's<00:04:56.200> see<00:04:56.350> we're<00:04:56.470> starting<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.770> run<00:04:56.889> a

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
um let's see we're starting to run a

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.280 
um let's see we're starting to run a
little<00:04:57.370> bit<00:04:57.580> low<00:04:57.729> on<00:04:57.760> time<00:04:58.060> here<00:04:58.300> but<00:04:58.510> I'll<00:04:59.110> go

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
little bit low on time here but I'll go

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.750 
little bit low on time here but I'll go
as<00:04:59.410> far<00:04:59.590> as<00:04:59.710> I<00:04:59.770> can<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.130> i'll<00:05:00.220> probably<00:05:00.430> make
