away so it's very reassuring for me to

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.920 
away so it's very reassuring for me to
know<00:00:53.350> that<00:00:53.560> if<00:00:53.680> that<00:00:54.190> dad<00:00:54.340> has<00:00:54.520> got<00:00:54.970> stuff<00:00:55.300> that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
having to worry about that so the fat

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.170 
having to worry about that so the fat
leads<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.080> somewhere<00:01:08.740> secure<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:09.729> somewhere

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
leads to somewhere secure and somewhere

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.469 
leads to somewhere secure and somewhere
where<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.479> stuff<00:01:10.720> is<00:01:10.869> so<00:01:11.020> caring<00:01:11.619> is<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.970> huge

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
where the stuff is so caring is a huge

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.980 
where the stuff is so caring is a huge
relief<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:14.080> me<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:16.150> it<00:01:16.270> sort<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.479> takes<00:01:16.780> a

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
relief to me then it sort of takes a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.670 
relief to me then it sort of takes a
weight<00:01:17.890> off<00:01:18.130> my<00:01:18.340> mind

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
it to be excellent and of course I would

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.850
