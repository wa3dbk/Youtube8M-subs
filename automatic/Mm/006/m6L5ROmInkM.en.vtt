00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.150 
just said that he did a quick test on
the<00:02:58.540> note<00:02:58.720> 2<00:02:59.020> LTE<00:02:59.440> which<00:02:59.770> we<00:02:59.920> believe<00:03:00.340> was<00:03:00.700> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
the note 2 LTE which we believe was the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.250 
the note 2 LTE which we believe was the
n7105<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.810> benched<00:03:05.200> marked<00:03:05.850> at<00:03:07.020> 9000<00:03:08.020> on

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
n7105 and it benched marked at 9000 on

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.610 
n7105 and it benched marked at 9000 on
into<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:09.239> which<00:03:10.239> he<00:03:10.660> thinks<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.709> LTE<00:03:12.160> will<00:03:12.700> be

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
into to which he thinks the LTE will be

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.949 
into to which he thinks the LTE will be
twenty<00:03:14.620> five<00:03:14.890> percent<00:03:14.920> less<00:03:15.959> than

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
twenty five percent less than

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.050 
twenty five percent less than
performance<00:03:17.620> than<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.280> LTE<00:03:18.640> model<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:21.060> I'm

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
performance than the LTE model but I'm

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.930 
performance than the LTE model but I'm
afraid<00:03:22.180> you're<00:03:22.690> wrong<00:03:22.870> my<00:03:23.200> friend<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:24.520> LTE

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
afraid you're wrong my friend the LTE

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.440 
afraid you're wrong my friend the LTE
model<00:03:25.239> in<00:03:26.459> performance<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.700> exactly<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:29.320> same

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
model in performance is exactly the same

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.530 
model in performance is exactly the same
my<00:03:31.450> only<00:03:31.630> worry<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.520> because<00:03:33.520> I<00:03:33.640> love<00:03:33.880> dev

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540
