for<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.900> teams<00:03:57.109> that<00:03:57.229> they're<00:03:57.470> buying<00:03:57.680> the

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
for the teams that they're buying the

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.879 
for the teams that they're buying the
fans<00:03:58.370> want<00:03:58.609> someone<00:03:58.879> that<00:03:59.000> they<00:03:59.650> can<00:04:00.650> hold

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
fans want someone that they can hold

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.159 
fans want someone that they can hold
accountable<00:04:01.549> if<00:04:01.729> you<00:04:01.879> will<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.510> they<00:04:02.720> feel

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
accountable if you will that they feel

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.920 
accountable if you will that they feel
they<00:04:03.319> know<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.769> understand<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.639> and<00:04:05.569> so<00:04:05.900> I

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
they know and understand that and so I

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.319 
they know and understand that and so I
think<00:04:06.049> that<00:04:06.379> there<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.729> some<00:04:07.729> benefit<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.150> that

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
think that there is some benefit to that

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.580 
think that there is some benefit to that
but<00:04:08.479> I<00:04:08.540> don't<00:04:08.720> know<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:08.989> would<00:04:09.139> say<00:04:09.169> that

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
but I don't know that I would say that

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.979 
but I don't know that I would say that
there's<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.370> one-size-fits-all<00:04:11.239> kind<00:04:11.930> of

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
there's a one-size-fits-all kind of

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.719 
there's a one-size-fits-all kind of
approach<00:04:12.349> in<00:04:12.590> these<00:04:12.680> things<00:04:12.979> we've<00:04:13.459> seen

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:13.729 
approach in these things we've seen

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.969 
approach in these things we've seen
several<00:04:14.389> teams<00:04:14.629> in<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.959> last<00:04:15.290> few<00:04:15.500> years<00:04:15.560> get

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:15.979 
several teams in the last few years get

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.289 
several teams in the last few years get
in<00:04:16.070> trouble<00:04:16.340> because<00:04:16.430> they've<00:04:16.669> had<00:04:16.880> too<00:04:17.120> much

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
in trouble because they've had too much

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.539 
in trouble because they've had too much
debt<00:04:17.630> in<00:04:17.889> purchasing<00:04:18.889> this<00:04:19.010> team<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:19.489> is

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
debt in purchasing this team that is

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.129 
debt in purchasing this team that is
something<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.239> were<00:04:20.359> very<00:04:20.570> careful<00:04:21.019> about

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
something you were very careful about

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.690 
something you were very careful about
there<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.529> not<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.769> lot<00:04:22.099> of<00:04:22.130> debt<00:04:22.400> on<00:04:22.550> this

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
there is not a lot of debt on this

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.950 
there is not a lot of debt on this
franchise<00:04:23.060> do<00:04:24.050> you<00:04:24.139> think<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:24.710> in<00:04:24.950> general

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
franchise do you think that in general

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.560 
franchise do you think that in general
owners<00:04:26.830> are<00:04:27.010> becoming<00:04:27.400> more<00:04:27.850> careful<00:04:28.390> about

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
owners are becoming more careful about

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.210 
owners are becoming more careful about
the<00:04:28.750> amount<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.080> debt<00:04:29.230> they<00:04:29.440> load<00:04:29.650> onto<00:04:29.830> teams

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
the amount of debt they load onto teams

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.770 
the amount of debt they load onto teams
I<00:04:30.400> can't<00:04:30.730> speak<00:04:30.880> for<00:04:31.060> other<00:04:31.180> owners<00:04:31.480> but<00:04:31.600> we're

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
I can't speak for other owners but we're

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.660 
I can't speak for other owners but we're
in<00:04:31.840> uncertain<00:04:32.350> economic<00:04:32.440> times<00:04:32.890> there's<00:04:33.610> a

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
in uncertain economic times there's a

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
in uncertain economic times there's a
lot<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.940> volatility<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:36.010> so<00:04:36.820> you<00:04:37.570> know<00:04:37.660> I

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
lot of volatility and so you know I

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.630 
lot of volatility and so you know I
think<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.380> need<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.860> set<00:04:39.220> up<00:04:39.250> your

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
think that you need to set up your

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.180 
think that you need to set up your
capital<00:04:40.120> structure<00:04:40.480> in<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.660> way<00:04:40.690> that

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
capital structure in a way that

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.100 
capital structure in a way that
addresses<00:04:42.190> those<00:04:42.670> issues<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:43.420> stuff<00:04:43.750> you

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
addresses those issues and stuff you

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.990 
addresses those issues and stuff you
know<00:04:44.170> consumers<00:04:44.740> are<00:04:45.010> don't<00:04:45.700> have<00:04:45.790> as<00:04:45.880> much

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
know consumers are don't have as much

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.240 
know consumers are don't have as much
money<00:04:46.060> as<00:04:46.390> they<00:04:46.510> once<00:04:46.720> did<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.770> economy

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
money as they once did and the economy

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.490 
money as they once did and the economy
is<00:04:48.850> goes<00:04:49.270> up<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.630> goes<00:04:49.750> down<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:49.990> goes<00:04:50.260> sideways

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
is goes up it goes down it goes sideways

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.440 
is goes up it goes down it goes sideways
that<00:04:50.980> we<00:04:51.040> could<00:04:51.160> probably<00:04:51.250> have<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.820> many<00:04:52.270> our

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
that we could probably have a many our

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.790 
that we could probably have a many our
discussion<00:04:53.050> on<00:04:53.080> what's<00:04:53.290> gonna<00:04:53.410> happen<00:04:53.710> the

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
discussion on what's gonna happen the

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.250 
discussion on what's gonna happen the
economy<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.400> we<00:04:54.490> both<00:04:54.880> leave<00:04:55.180> with<00:04:56.050> someone

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
economy and we both leave with someone

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.050 
economy and we both leave with someone
certain<00:04:56.650> in<00:04:56.740> her<00:04:56.830> head<00:04:57.010> so<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.370> think<00:04:57.550> you<00:04:57.970> know

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
certain in her head so I think you know

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.720 
certain in her head so I think you know
using<00:04:58.630> less<00:04:58.990> debt<00:04:59.290> than<00:04:59.620> you<00:05:00.250> might<00:05:00.700> have

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
using less debt than you might have

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.270 
using less debt than you might have
otherwise<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.450> use<00:05:01.660> in<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.530> boom<00:05:02.710> times<00:05:03.070> it's

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
otherwise to use in the boom times it's

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.800 
otherwise to use in the boom times it's
probably<00:05:03.610> an<00:05:03.700> appropriate<00:05:03.790> thing<00:05:04.480> and<00:05:04.690> so

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
probably an appropriate thing and so

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.540 
probably an appropriate thing and so
that's<00:05:04.990> how<00:05:05.170> you<00:05:05.770> know<00:05:05.860> we<00:05:05.980> set<00:05:06.160> up<00:05:06.190> a<00:05:06.280> team<00:05:06.430> we

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
that's how you know we set up a team we

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.370 
that's how you know we set up a team we
also<00:05:06.730> wanted<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:07.270> position<00:05:07.930> ourselves<00:05:08.020> to

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
also wanted to position ourselves to

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.830 
also wanted to position ourselves to
make<00:05:08.560> investments<00:05:09.100> in<00:05:09.160> the<00:05:09.340> team<00:05:09.550> if<00:05:09.880> if<00:05:10.480> that

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
make investments in the team if if that

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.910 
make investments in the team if if that
makes<00:05:11.260> sense<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:11.920> we've<00:05:12.640> done<00:05:12.880> that
