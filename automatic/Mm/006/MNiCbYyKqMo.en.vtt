00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.629
 walked through the park and saw a sculpture from 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.700
 natural flowers and branches 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.290
 tell me how this work 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.830
 art is done and what is the name 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.389
 Galina Ploshki on Moscow 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.039
 sculpture of flower trees 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.010
 called topiary 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.340
 and how it is done will tell you Olga 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.340
 rustle 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.760
 Dear Galina, I will not only tell you 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.800
 Well, let me show you what is topiar 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.630
 art because flowers are in my hands 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.700
 it only interests me 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.489
 find out what it is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.059
 to decorate our city with our beautiful gardens 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.250
 compositions let's go curly 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.739
 trees and shrubs is a whole 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.140
 art came up about a hundred years ago 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.239
 skeleton for topiary Americans started 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.550
 revive topiary art and in new 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.590
 measurements present in urban 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.160
 gardens and parks can be found large 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.920
 the trees 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.100
 the form of balls cylinder animals and various 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.049
 fairytale characters by lawmakers in 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.570
 the art of topiary is the Americans 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.869
 but ours as you can see are not badly sewn but 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.180
 honestly tell you dirty little work 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.950
 just be artists need to be still 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.900
 unskilled laborer 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.119
 put it all in the frame more about 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.520
 this I will tell you a little later but in general 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.140
 need to be and of course a little more 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.750
 geologists understand which plants 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.970
 actually and what does this figure consist of 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.579
 because our lion for example can through 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.009
 week overgrow mane from head to tail 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.280
 we do not need it we need to create 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.180
 beautiful shape and create and and more 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.030
 two weeks 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.680
 but I hope with my help we will succeed 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.680
 make it a bit of desert 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.310
 by the way this is a big mistake that 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.710
 the figure lives only one that's only 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.690
 in the summer for the winter, the guru can be closed from 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.490
 snow and frost and in the spring as soon as 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.200
 the sun will begin to bake your figures 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.110
 will turn into the same beautiful green 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.720
 like last summer you need to start 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.179
 to make a frame and from very durable 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.820
 armature because we fill this 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.130
 the skeleton of the earth needs him to endure 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.580
 every family here thanks to such valves 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.620
 not very solid, I think that we all 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.140
 but every master has his own 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.430
 tricks yes Sergey 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.680
 for example foam which can 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.780
 fill in some amount of this 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.720
 frame and then it will become a little bit 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.200
 take it easy but then you all get so fixed 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.730
 and here it is already possible to land about some 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.190
 plants whichever 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.769
 actually figure what goal you are 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.780
 put and so this could be 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.720
 secured and I'm still a little bit do not understand 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.269
 need to go there somehow in grow up just at 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.990
 the help of studs here such studs we 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.770
 this moss is funny 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.910
 in the frame and after some time this 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.910
 moss will take root 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.450
 really little decorate this figure a 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.610
 beautiful herbs and flowers for her need 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.650
 be sure to take care first water 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.670
 every day for sure 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.530
 protect their bark beetles 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.450
 Well, in general, we are Sergei, in fact 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.700
 trying to speed up our order to show 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:28.540
 you will look like this figure already in 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.700
 ready-made well my friends entrusted me 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.800
 put in the ear on the head of a lion by the way 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.830
 make a lion if you forget 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.010
 but in general it really depends on 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.180
 fantasy artist can make slam 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.440
 asuras and in full size and may be 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:51.520
 confine a little bug and this 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:53.290
 will also be very pretty and here it is 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.420
 look at the little bug 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.770
 pretty but in fact it's pr on and 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.110
 art develops by leaps and bounds 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.940
 steps no international exhibition on 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.930
 landscape design is complete without 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.610
 here such 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.470
 sculptures from plants without 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.510
 artistic haircut is degrading 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.970
 old technology appear of course 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.310
 new if you are bored of growing 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.590
 the cilantro on the garden can be grown and and 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.950
 here in the mane of this beautiful pony 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.700
 and cut off your twig every morning 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.700
 salad 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.240
 These are the years we have and how many 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.070
 we worked on it 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.960
 you need to bring it yourself 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.130
 divine look and send on back 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.919
 some kind of 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.090
 for this we cut it all will remove 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.820
 some irregularities sticking grass 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.960
 it remains to make our lion hide 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.060
 so he looked at all his 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.030
 beautiful floral eyes 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.720
 This is how Galina looks modern 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.700
 theory and you yourself can do it but 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.729
 dresses under the strict guidance of the master 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.889
 yet dress like a lion will not wither like 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.070
 most of the plants living on my 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.070
 window sill
