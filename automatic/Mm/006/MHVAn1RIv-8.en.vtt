00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
guess when you go from a chemically like

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.399 
guess when you go from a chemically like
that<00:01:13.969> color<00:01:14.179> to<00:01:14.509> chemically<00:01:14.869> dark<00:01:15.139> color

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
that color to chemically dark color

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.739 
that color to chemically dark color
doesn't<00:01:15.649> last<00:01:15.859> as<00:01:16.189> well<00:01:16.369> last<00:01:16.939> time<00:01:17.149> I<00:01:17.209> told<00:01:17.299> my

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
doesn't last as well last time I told my

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:22.779 
doesn't last as well last time I told my
my<00:01:18.350> head<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:19.700> dark<00:01:20.299> black<00:01:21.109> dark<00:01:21.740> brown<00:01:22.009> black<00:01:22.429> my

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
my head a dark black dark brown black my

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.789 
my head a dark black dark brown black my
cousin<00:01:23.270> its<00:01:23.539> natural<00:01:23.959> state<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.350> wasn't

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
cousin its natural state so wasn't

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.160 
cousin its natural state so wasn't
lighter<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:25.579> I<00:01:25.609> guess<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:26.029> just<00:01:26.060> wasn't<00:01:26.479> as

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
lighter so I guess it just wasn't as

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.499 
lighter so I guess it just wasn't as
noticeable<00:01:27.499> then<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.249> anyway<00:01:28.549> I<00:01:28.789> have<00:01:29.359> to<00:01:29.389> go

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
noticeable then so anyway I have to go

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.870 
noticeable then so anyway I have to go
in<00:01:29.929> and<00:01:30.079> color<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.859> so<00:01:31.099> I<00:01:31.130> just<00:01:31.369> recolored

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
in and color that so I just recolored

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.089 
in and color that so I just recolored
the<00:01:32.450> front<00:01:32.719> of<00:01:32.810> my<00:01:32.869> hair<00:01:33.139> so<00:01:33.349> it<00:01:33.469> does<00:01:33.679> look<00:01:33.979> a

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:34.099 
the front of my hair so it does look a

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.790 
the front of my hair so it does look a
bit<00:01:34.130> darker<00:01:34.759> than<00:01:35.599> normal<00:01:35.899> all<00:01:36.409> the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
bit darker than normal all the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.230 
bit darker than normal all the
this<00:01:37.800> is<00:01:37.980> my<00:01:38.100> natural<00:01:38.160> color<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:38.970> didn't

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
this is my natural color so I didn't

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.290 
this is my natural color so I didn't
like<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:40.080> in<00:01:40.260> here<00:01:40.470> i<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.590> did<00:01:41.300> you

I'm really happy about that go in

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.610 
I'm really happy about that go in
certain<00:02:35.640> how<00:02:35.730> well<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.060> would<00:02:36.150> hold<00:02:36.420> up<00:02:36.720> after

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
certain how well it would hold up after

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.070 
certain how well it would hold up after
washing<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.190> but<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.670> stayed<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.600> it

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
washing it but it stayed like it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.720 
washing it but it stayed like it
wouldn't<00:02:40.560> even<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.890> had<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.190> lock<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.640> that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
wouldn't even know I had a lock in that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.070 
wouldn't even know I had a lock in that
area<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.690> was<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.890> big<00:02:44.519> success<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.660> I'll

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
area so that was a big success so I'll

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.039 
area so that was a big success so I'll
turn<00:02:46.260> around<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.860> see<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:48.299> area<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
turn around so you can see the area and

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.870 
turn around so you can see the area and
that's<00:02:49.500> pretty<00:02:49.739> much<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.040> i<00:02:50.340> guess

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.500 

okay<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.310> right<00:02:58.310> here<00:02:58.520> is<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.670> area<00:02:59.090> we<00:02:59.300> have

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
okay so right here is the area we have

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.280 
okay so right here is the area we have
the<00:02:59.690> lock<00:03:01.510> combine<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.780> one<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.080> corner

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
the lock combine the one in the corner

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.650 
the lock combine the one in the corner
here<00:03:03.620> when<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.130> cut<00:03:04.370> out<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.880> they<00:03:05.300> just<00:03:05.450> read

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
here when I cut out and they just read

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.400 
here when I cut out and they just read
here<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:05.990> by<00:03:06.590> adding<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.450> loose<00:03:08.450> hair<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:09.200> this

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
here it by adding the loose hair to this

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.860

lock<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.010> walk<00:03:10.190> above<00:03:10.490> it<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.540> can<00:03:11.690> see

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
lock and a walk above it so you can see

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.170 
lock and a walk above it so you can see
that<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.170> part<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.740> so<00:03:13.550> pretty<00:03:13.790> straight

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
that the part is so pretty straight

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.780 
that the part is so pretty straight
can't<00:03:14.870> we<00:03:15.020> tell<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.740> this<00:03:16.220> part<00:03:16.520> is<00:03:16.610> true

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
can't we tell that this part is true

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.240 
can't we tell that this part is true
only<00:03:16.970> goes<00:03:17.210> twisted<00:03:17.720> but<00:03:17.960> trust<00:03:18.680> me<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:18.950> still
