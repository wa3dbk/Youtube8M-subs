does today at least the big cardboard
giant<00:00:14.980> mock-up<00:00:15.490> that<00:00:15.519> we've<00:00:15.849> been<00:00:15.969> working<00:00:16.150> on

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
giant mock-up that we've been working on

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.640 
giant mock-up that we've been working on
certain<00:00:18.460> see<00:00:18.789> at<00:00:19.119> least<00:00:19.270> what<00:00:19.599> one<00:00:19.810> half<00:00:20.140> of<00:00:20.290> it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
certain see at least what one half of it

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.970 
certain see at least what one half of it
look<00:00:20.919> like<00:00:23.700> design<00:00:24.700> I<00:00:25.439> still<00:00:26.439> kind<00:00:26.619> of<00:00:26.680> wonder

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
look like design I still kind of wonder

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.850 
look like design I still kind of wonder
if<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:28.480> bow<00:00:28.750> angle<00:00:29.169> here<00:00:29.380> need<00:00:29.619> to<00:00:29.649> be

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
if this bow angle here need to be

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.639 
if this bow angle here need to be
flattered<00:00:30.160> that<00:00:30.939> would<00:00:31.540> take<00:00:31.750> another<00:00:31.989> foot

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
flattered that would take another foot

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.270 
flattered that would take another foot
or<00:00:32.680> so<00:00:32.829> out<00:00:33.219> of<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.760> usable<00:00:34.149> area<00:00:34.329> but<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:36.070> I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
or so out of the usable area but as I

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.740 
or so out of the usable area but as I
said<00:00:36.340> before<00:00:36.670> this<00:00:36.969> thing's<00:00:37.180> like<00:00:37.329> freakin

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
said before this thing's like freakin

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.400 
said before this thing's like freakin
three<00:00:38.290> miles<00:00:38.559> long<00:00:38.770> so<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:40.480> thing<00:00:40.660> to<00:00:40.870> kind<00:00:41.260> of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
three miles long so one thing to kind of

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.740 
three miles long so one thing to kind of
remember<00:00:41.590> too<00:00:42.040> is<00:00:42.399> this<00:00:43.000> point<00:00:43.239> here<00:00:43.719> is

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
remember too is this point here is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.869 
remember too is this point here is
actually<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.679> point<00:00:44.890> for<00:00:45.160> this<00:00:45.249> breaks<00:00:45.609> over

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
actually the point for this breaks over

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.299 
actually the point for this breaks over
so<00:00:46.300> this<00:00:46.929> piece<00:00:47.199> here<00:00:47.469> will<00:00:47.679> actually<00:00:47.890> wrap

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
so this piece here will actually wrap

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.349 
so this piece here will actually wrap
back<00:00:49.030> down<00:00:49.359> and<00:00:49.749> around<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:52.059> you<00:00:52.179> don't

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
back down and around but you don't

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.689 
back down and around but you don't
really<00:00:52.510> see<00:00:52.659> here<00:00:53.019> in<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.230> mock-up<00:00:53.679> which<00:00:54.550> is

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
really see here in the mock-up which is

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.840 
really see here in the mock-up which is
going<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:54.909> require<00:00:56.190> probably<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.370> removal<00:00:57.819> of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
going to require probably the removal of

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.819 
going to require probably the removal of
this<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.510> redoing<00:00:58.960> some<00:00:59.289> of<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.440> framing

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
this and redoing some of the framing

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.169 
this and redoing some of the framing
members<00:01:00.219> that<00:01:00.339> are<00:01:00.519> there<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.850> make<00:01:00.969> that

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
members that are there to make that

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.049 
members that are there to make that
happen<00:01:01.359> but<00:01:02.159> we'll<00:01:03.159> get<00:01:03.249> to<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.399> limit<00:01:03.850> later

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
happen but we'll get to that limit later

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.120 
happen but we'll get to that limit later
down<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.420> road<00:01:04.510> once<00:01:05.019> we<00:01:05.229> decide<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:06.010> the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
down the road once we decide this is the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.920 
down the road once we decide this is the
way<00:01:06.250> we're<00:01:06.460> going<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:10.360> definitely<00:01:10.420> starting

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
way we're going it's definitely starting

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.270 
way we're going it's definitely starting
to<00:01:11.080> take<00:01:11.530> some<00:01:11.560> shape

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
to take some shape

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.249 
to take some shape
I<00:01:14.159> think<00:01:15.159> this<00:01:15.340> angle<00:01:15.790> back<00:01:15.970> here<00:01:16.329> to<00:01:16.600> I<00:01:16.960> would

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
I think this angle back here to I would

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.840 
I think this angle back here to I would
like<00:01:17.469> to<00:01:17.619> be<00:01:17.740> flatter<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:19.930> has<00:01:20.850> more

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
like to be flatter so that it has more

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.399 
like to be flatter so that it has more
of<00:01:21.969> a<00:01:22.000> right<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.840> I've<00:01:22.899> kind<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.170> toyed

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
of a right to it and I've kind of toyed

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.170 
of a right to it and I've kind of toyed
with<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.649> idea<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:24.100> raising<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.700> back<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:25.090> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
with the idea of raising the back of the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.310 
with the idea of raising the back of the
boat<00:01:25.360> up<00:01:25.649> as<00:01:26.649> far<00:01:26.860> as<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.040> deck<00:01:27.219> height<00:01:28.320> maybe

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
boat up as far as the deck height maybe

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.800 
boat up as far as the deck height maybe
creating<00:01:29.890> some<00:01:30.130> space<00:01:30.399> for<00:01:30.759> battery<00:01:31.329> storage

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
creating some space for battery storage

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.420 
creating some space for battery storage
fuel<00:01:32.439> tanks<00:01:32.860> etc<00:01:33.579> below<00:01:33.850> deck<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.430> having

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
fuel tanks etc below deck and having

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.039 
fuel tanks etc below deck and having
from<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:37.840> point<00:01:38.049> up<00:01:39.630> having<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.750> covered

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
from this point up having the covered

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.590 
from this point up having the covered
deck<00:01:41.079> area<00:01:41.680> so<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.579> have<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.090> play<00:01:43.270> with<00:01:43.450> that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
deck area so I have to play with that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.929 
deck area so I have to play with that
that<00:01:44.439> maybe<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.859> next<00:01:45.009> thing<00:01:45.250> we<00:01:45.369> mock<00:01:45.549> up<00:01:45.820> I

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
that maybe the next thing we mock up I

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.639 
that maybe the next thing we mock up I
guess<00:01:46.090> really<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.659> biggest<00:01:46.840> decision<00:01:47.409> I<00:01:47.500> need

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
guess really the biggest decision I need

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.029 
guess really the biggest decision I need
to<00:01:47.740> make<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.070> whether<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.430> want<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:49.740> take<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.770> look

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
to make is whether I want to take a look

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.649 
to make is whether I want to take a look
at<00:01:51.270> building<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.329> model<00:01:52.750> that<00:01:52.960> has<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.799> flatter

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
at building a model that has the flatter

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.370 
at building a model that has the flatter
bow<00:01:55.659> section<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.659> have<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.109> think<00:01:59.229> about

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
bow section so I have to think about

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.950 
bow section so I have to think about
that<00:01:59.590> too<00:01:59.740> my<00:02:00.119> depends<00:02:01.119> on<00:02:01.240> how<00:02:01.359> much<00:02:01.479> energy<00:02:01.719> I

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
that too my depends on how much energy I

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.389 
that too my depends on how much energy I
have<00:02:02.229> tomorrow<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.799> other<00:02:02.950> thing<00:02:03.189> they

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
have tomorrow and the other thing they

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.060 
have tomorrow and the other thing they
thought<00:02:03.609> about<00:02:03.820> then<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.570> taking<00:02:05.259> and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
thought about then is taking and

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.510 
thought about then is taking and
dropping<00:02:06.369> part<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.119> down<00:02:08.399> part<00:02:09.399> of<00:02:09.460> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
dropping part of this down part of the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.340 
dropping part of this down part of the
way<00:02:09.670> down<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.330> then<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.720> rest<00:02:10.960> of<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.170> way

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
way down and then the rest of the way

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.530 
way down and then the rest of the way
down<00:02:11.460> but<00:02:12.460> it<00:02:12.580> doesn't<00:02:12.880> really<00:02:12.970> work<00:02:13.240> with<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
down but it doesn't really work with the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.760 
down but it doesn't really work with the
seating<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.080> think<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.410> would<00:02:14.500> look<00:02:14.710> really
