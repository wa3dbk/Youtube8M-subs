so<00:02:39.840> right<00:02:40.650> here<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.040> tightened<00:02:41.490> up<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.390> he

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
so right here I tightened up and he

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.900 
so right here I tightened up and he
switches<00:02:42.780> out<00:02:43.050> into<00:02:43.950> his<00:02:44.070> hearts<00:02:44.430> girl<00:02:44.670> I

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
switches out into his hearts girl I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.850 
switches out into his hearts girl I
don't<00:02:45.480> understand<00:02:45.870> why<00:02:46.050> he<00:02:46.260> did<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.560> either

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
don't understand why he did this either

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.460 
don't understand why he did this either
maybe<00:02:47.250> he<00:02:47.490> thought<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.940> honchos<00:02:48.750> blind<00:02:49.080> type

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
maybe he thought that honchos blind type

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.240 
maybe he thought that honchos blind type
with<00:02:49.920> neutral<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.880> would<00:02:51.450> not<00:02:51.780> actually<00:02:52.530> not<00:02:53.070> be

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
with neutral I would not actually not be

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.890 
with neutral I would not actually not be
effective<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.730> my<00:02:53.850> focus<00:02:54.150> punch<00:02:54.300> but<00:02:54.570> his<00:02:54.750> dark

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
effective to my focus punch but his dark

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.140 
effective to my focus punch but his dark
type<00:02:55.080> neutralizes<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.370> while<00:02:57.000> this

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
type neutralizes it so while this

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.520 
type neutralizes it so while this
Infernape<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.720> still<00:02:57.870> asleep<00:02:58.080> she's<00:02:58.380> probably

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
Infernape is still asleep she's probably

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.470 
Infernape is still asleep she's probably
hoping<00:02:58.920> it'd<00:02:59.100> wake<00:02:59.430> up<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.910> give<00:03:00.090> me<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> mock

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
hoping it'd wake up and give me a mock

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.200
