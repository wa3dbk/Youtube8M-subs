00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.640
 conasev interesting case of success alan agenda 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.439
 of at a time when companies are having difficulty 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.159
 face the crisis 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:23.270
 I want to share the interview I had with the brilliant director of bancomext 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.460
 the engineer ignacio deschamps 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.349
 they have a 17-year career in the company 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.560
 performance and successfully said function 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.600
 the first thing that we are told about the chances 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 is that there was an organization to grow must have and develop talents 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.840
 in the leaders who are those who execute the strategic decisions 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.069
 a team is important tells us 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:50.189
 since we are a bank or 30 thousand people that serve more than 16 

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:52.040
 millions of customers 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.140
 we are a company of people 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.920
 we need a motivated committed team 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.940
 safe 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.670
 and confident in the future 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.939
 the service is the key in our type of business to be able to compete 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.220
 with the goals 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.780
 that we set ourselves 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.340
 As for actions in the face of crises, he says that every crisis is a 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.050
 difficult time for any business 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.289
 but for us to have a good time the crisis 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.880
 we needed to control the risk 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.869
 in bancomer 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.560
 We have worked to grow credit and to be more relevant in all 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.750
 segments 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.590
 from the country 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.640
 that requires it 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.890
 He says that it was very important for us to develop the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.830
 control and admission tools and how we had it well controlled the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.480
 truth tells us the crisis has been a porteña for us 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.359
 the crisis emphasizes deschamps 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:47.470
 we face it 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.390
 solids we had capital we did not close the credits until we gave in certain 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.009
 moments 60% of the credit 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.680
 new which is twice our size 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.690
 and we never stop 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.130
 all plans 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.390
 of innovation bancomer is a universal bank if we serve all levels 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 socio-economic 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.539
 for this we decided to go deeper into each client 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.740
 create new models of business attention 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.220
 and we were without more 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.579
 accessibility 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.790
 of services 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.639
 to the entire population 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:26.159
 in the crisis emphasizes curiously we have achieved further expansion of the 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.669
 credit 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:34.059
 proud in bancomer to have spent in the last years from 8 to 16 million 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:35.389
 of people 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.849
 in fact both emphasizes 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.989
 that I could not be possible through conventional means to carry 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.080
 customer to the branches as was done before today is unfeasible 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:51.249
 today we have to use says devices like telephony in 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.099
 ATMs 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.020
 terminals in shops 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.289
 not if it throws light 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.250
 that the electronic world is the world 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.669
 of the accessibility record 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.439
 in that we are committed 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.269
 to be able to give people 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.720
 All the services 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.179
 from a bank the challenge is great but very hopeful 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.430
 as you can see 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.610
 the vision of a brilliant leader like inazio deschamps allows you 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.940
 conceptualize growth before situations of uncertainty that 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.030
 allowed strategists like him to lead to bancomer to truly growth 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.710
 admirable if you want to know more about strategies for the crisis I invite 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.589
 read my last book 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.410
 recipes to grow in time of crisis 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.960
 today they threaten 55 34 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.009
 19 6 5 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.499
 good luck
