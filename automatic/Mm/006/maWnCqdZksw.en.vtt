 So funny story in this

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.730
 should not eat carbs if 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.320
 you want to lose weight and I have just that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.869
 an interesting story of one 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.980
 friend who now tells what he is with 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:39.530
 carbohydrates has experienced my name 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.040
 interesting experience in my stomach 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.200
 have to do or made but for that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.770
 also a very pleasing makes into it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.670
 thanks veronika and that is me 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.510
 for a long time a lot of pasta and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.059
 So noodle and pizza nourished and yourself 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.180
 my mother always worries 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.010
 here is young enough at all has me 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.010
 then at some point addressed say 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.890
 you have to but you have really gained weight 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.250
 have and that was the moment where i got the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.990
 got a crisis and not just mine 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.790
 mother said that a lot of friends 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 known colleagues think you can 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.710
 it is that you have taken to, namely 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.030
 my problem areas at all and it is 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.900
 is terrible i could not do it anymore 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.270
 I'm so lucky at this point 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.770
 i also encountered veronika and she 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.990
 had given a very simple tip 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.180
 is said to pass the x carbohydrates 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 away, they require only times carbohydrates 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.270
 what do you mean now where they are at all 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 Carbohydrate and I have no idea 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.920
 I'll stop carbohydrates proteins myself 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.659
 honestly have no idea what that 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.330
 is 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:57.910
 and yes she meant that's exactly what in 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.050
 pasta in pasta potatoes pizza milk 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.030
 should I drink you first 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.180
 to do with carbohydrate but with 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.220
 I know insulin today and I have 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.990
 that admittedly made me very radical 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.690
 have two weeks completely on this 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.090
 I did not do all that stuff 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.210
 I ate a lot of meat and vegetables 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.090
 eaten fish and bodendorf esser 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.210
 Although it sees carbohydrates in it 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.090
 slowly 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.050
 so it does not matter now she can 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.630
 explain better 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.550
 I just stuck to it and 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.959
 After two weeks, the result was 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.940
 really impressive so that 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.750
 I'll just put it on now 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.540
 try 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.680
 then you understand what it is sugar may 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.270
 neither is that completely 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.580
 Carbohydrates are also bad 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.280
 I still remember 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.310
 but more can you veronika on each one 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.630
 case only tell the matter again 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.030
 pizza and pasta i got off 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.800
 cost reasons and because so easy 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.750
 The stomach was ready to prepare 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.330
 Of course, it turned out great 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.680
 tasted but today I notice too 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.269
 if that's really true for me 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.370
 hard and then a super feeling 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.019
 completely to have belly and for that 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.190
 then I like to give up sometimes 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.870
 all that carbs 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.970
 yes, I still believe the red card 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.769
 what to say 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.100
 Thanks for watching and yes now 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.959
 have fun with veronika so you have it 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.900
 carbohydrates omit it 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.900
 So try it too 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.100
 that it will be gone two weeks a week 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.920
 I think too little but everyone 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.540
 case two you will notice it in any case 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.250
 okay now the question is what it is 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.320
 instead, thomas had already 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.910
 implied 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.610
 you can eat a lot of meat so 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.670
 eating lean meat fish is too 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.820
 delicious vegetable thomas has already 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.500
 said live and so on and lenses 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.390
 may just eat carbohydrates 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.180
 but these are just the slow ones 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.560
 carbohydrates are rubbish and they are not 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.330
 but they would make me fat too 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.400
 omit in the evening but in the beginning it is 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.860
 first of all not so bad for you though 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.660
 first of all, you make the first start like 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.080
 said pizza pasta 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.940
 everything in the omission must be allowed 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.500
 you also eat but not so many 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.050
 Do not overdo it every third day 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.239
 a handful that would be enough yes 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.590
 try it out you will too 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.459
 more info still on my blog 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.450

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.050
 video description just times 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.090
 look up 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.010
 yes I wish you much success that the 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.120
 carbohydrates off and we'll see each other
