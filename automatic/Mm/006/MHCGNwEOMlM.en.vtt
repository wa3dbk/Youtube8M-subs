00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello and welcome to do it 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.480
 yourself inspiration kids club i have 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.370
 a nice way to find one 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.830
 teaching children how to do one 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.290
 Elephant paints and that is what you do 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.310
 with a little story first 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.539
 If you paint a huge mountain so 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.180
 the story begins like that 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:28.369
 Huge mountain is in the middle of the country 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 A big tunnel leads through the mountain 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:39.899
 and next to it is also a small one 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:44.850
 tunnel then only the eye and is missing 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.950
 a big ear and behind it comes 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:53.520
 nor a tail as simple as that 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.289
 and you have an elephant of the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.789
 Of course, everyone wins something different 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.280
 depending on how you get the tunnel 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.050
 but that's how you can do that for kids 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.980
 simply explain how that with the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.799
 elephant goes 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.150
 I just do it again so only 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.080
 a big mountain and a big one 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.740
 tunnel through the mountain through and one 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.860
 small tunnel through the mountain and 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.640
 one eye one ear and behind a 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.640
 tail on it 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.380
 So one recognizes in any case already 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.390
 times what it should be and so can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.640
 children playfully then learn one 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.600
 to paint elephants 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 maybe you would like to be part of it 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.479
 to try someone and you wanted 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.600
 that show a little child that 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.649
 just starting to paint and painting 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.750
 to discover for yourself 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.429
 You can also do it yourself 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.380
 beautiful little history invent it 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.380
 can still have a name for the mountain 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.920
 think of it or the tunnels still 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.689
 describe in more detail you can 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.149
 yes times in the comments write whether 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.520
 We tried it and like you 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.770
 So this technique is with the big one 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.969
 mountain and in two tunnels around one 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.549
 to paint elephants 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.370
 if you like try it 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.349
 gives the video a thumbs up 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.610
 and watching my other videos and 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.610
 See you next time
