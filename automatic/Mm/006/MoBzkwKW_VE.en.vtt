fall down a hole right go oh I was
trying<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.410> get<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.769> off<00:03:31.889> guard<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.459> ended

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
trying to get you off guard but it ended

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.020 
trying to get you off guard but it ended
up<00:03:32.730> clicking<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.180> command<00:03:33.569> block<00:03:33.810> instead<00:03:35.030> is

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
up clicking the command block instead is

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.349 
up clicking the command block instead is
break<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.600> code<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:37.230> no<00:03:37.730> everything<00:03:38.730> is

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
break the code like no everything is

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.530 
break the code like no everything is
broken<00:03:39.680> all<00:03:40.680> right<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.340> he's<00:03:42.000> currently<00:03:42.420> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
broken all right so he's currently the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.330 
broken all right so he's currently the
lead<00:03:42.750> I'm<00:03:42.959> pretty<00:03:43.440> sure<00:03:43.590> he's<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.799> bit<00:03:43.950> too<00:03:44.100> fast

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
lead I'm pretty sure he's a bit too fast

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.090 
lead I'm pretty sure he's a bit too fast
right<00:03:44.670> now<00:03:45.260> well<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.319> feel<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:46.590> he's<00:03:46.709> faster

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
right now well I feel like he's faster

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.770 
right now well I feel like he's faster
than<00:03:47.130> he<00:03:47.250> was<00:03:47.489> we<00:03:47.639> were<00:03:47.790> doing<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:48.120> earlier<00:03:48.480> I

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
than he was we were doing this earlier I

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.319 
than he was we were doing this earlier I
don't<00:03:49.560> know<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.889> it<00:03:50.130> where<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.519> he<00:03:50.670> oh<00:03:50.819> god<00:03:51.150> he's

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329

hard mode accidentally so what we were
messing<00:03:57.690> around<00:03:57.750> with<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.049> speeds<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.470> him

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
messing around with the speeds of him

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.000 
messing around with the speeds of him
and<00:03:58.829> uh<00:03:59.989> we're<00:04:00.989> planning<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.470> having<00:04:01.650> like<00:04:01.920> an

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
and uh we're planning on having like an

whatever the case we're like different

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.420 
whatever the case we're like different
speeds<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:07.650> he<00:04:07.739> would<00:04:07.859> be<00:04:07.950> able<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.160> go<00:04:08.250> at

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
speeds that he would be able to go at

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.309 
speeds that he would be able to go at
and<00:04:08.700> uh<00:04:09.859> wait<00:04:10.859> unless<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.669> win<00:04:11.750> no<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.780> say<00:04:13.019> you're
