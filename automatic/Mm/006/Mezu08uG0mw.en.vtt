00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.980
 kilo of premium rice 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.160
 two onions each time are red 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.600
 finely chopped 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.730
 2 red peppers 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:40.340
 2 cloves of crushed garlic optional ones 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.950
 pieces of butter salt and oil 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.740
 let's put the peppers to cook 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.470
 we leave them there for 3 to 5 minutes 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.170
 after it boils in a teaspoon 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.850
 of oil we are going to put to sautÃ© the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.850
 onion and garlic 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.820
 until the onion turns 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.530
 We are going to make it transparent 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.390
 high 2 peppers and here we have them 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.640
 cooked we're going to expect it to 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.670
 report a little while frying the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.490
 onion and then we liquefy them and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 we put in here and we are going to place the rice 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.270
 we already lit the fire in high what 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.740
 we have previously washed 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.150
 let's add the paprika already 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:48.850
 cooked liquefied and strained 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.850
 in that same water we put the rice 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.780
 add the onion and garlic 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.780
 that are already suffered we mix it well 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.310
 if necessary 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.310
 water we add here once and for all 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.080
 they are more or less three or four deposits 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.640
 of water 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.640
 we add the salt 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.440
 more or less a spoonful 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.810
 and if necessary we add more 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.810
 and we are going to add oil now 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.680
 with two stops 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.920
 big 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.900
 It's enough 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.900
 here we leave it until it boils 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.230
 to mix it 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.800
 Here I know how come the rice we will 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.290
 mix it 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.290
 so that it is finished cooking 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.240
 we lower the fire 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.680
 we cover it and wait until it's 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.790
 about 20 minutes a half hour 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.550
 here already the rice is ready already burst 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.100
 let's add 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.940
 a few pieces of butter this is 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.940
 optional 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.140
 if you do not want to, do not leave it alone 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.760
 I've been here before we mix 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.549
 well the butter we put out the fire 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.950
 and it's ready to serve butter 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.950
 it gives a nice bright touch
