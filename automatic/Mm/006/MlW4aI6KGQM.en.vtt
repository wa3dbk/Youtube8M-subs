welcome back sethbling here I'm in
survival<00:00:03.120> mode<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.720> end<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.410> demonstrate

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
survival mode in the end to demonstrate

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.980 
survival mode in the end to demonstrate
what<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.339> call<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:06.060> poor<00:00:06.299> man's<00:00:06.540> enter<00:00:06.870> man

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
what I call the poor man's enter man

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.490 
what I call the poor man's enter man
form<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.790> this<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.120> it's<00:00:09.510> very<00:00:09.750> small<00:00:10.200> but

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
form and this is it it's very small but

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.850 
form and this is it it's very small but
I<00:00:11.340> think<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.790> works<00:00:11.940> pretty<00:00:12.030> well<00:00:12.269> given<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
I think it works pretty well given the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.919 
I think it works pretty well given the
very<00:00:14.309> small<00:00:14.700> amount<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.150> resources<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.870> you

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
very small amount of resources that you

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.720 
very small amount of resources that you
actually<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.379> spend<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.490> use

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
actually have to spend on it so to use

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.550 
actually have to spend on it so to use
it<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.910> stand<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.779> middle<00:00:18.810> here<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.439> this

if you have a containment weapon a
little<00:02:34.360> bit<00:02:34.450> faster<00:02:34.810> than<00:02:35.110> waiting<00:02:35.709> for<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
little bit faster than waiting for the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.360 
little bit faster than waiting for the
whole<00:02:36.100> thing<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:37.030> pretty<00:02:37.480> good<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:38.440> got<00:02:39.130> quite<00:02:39.310> a

couple these guys I guess but it's
pretty<00:02:48.010> simple<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.370> build<00:02:48.550> let<00:02:48.790> me<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:49.000> hop

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
pretty simple to build let me just hop

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.449 
pretty simple to build let me just hop
into<00:02:49.330> creative<00:02:49.720> mode<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.620> can<00:02:50.800> build<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.430> new

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
into creative mode and I can build a new

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.600 
into creative mode and I can build a new
one<00:02:51.700> for<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:54.190> basically<00:02:54.400> what<00:02:54.519> you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
want to do is find a nice open flat area

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.520 
want to do is find a nice open flat area
you<00:02:58.209> don't<00:02:58.390> need<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.600> be<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.750> big<00:02:59.110> but<00:02:59.350> you

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
you want to go 2 meters off the ground

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.570 
you want to go 2 meters off the ground
and<00:03:16.540> build<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:17.830> have<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.340> Gilley's

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
and build a I just have to Gilley's

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.020 
and build a I just have to Gilley's
come<00:03:20.060> on<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:21.560> want<00:03:21.710> you<00:03:21.980> want<00:03:22.130> me<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:23.000> want

come on you want you want me you want
some<00:03:23.770> build<00:03:24.770> a<00:03:24.830> two<00:03:24.980> meters<00:03:25.220> off<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.820> ground

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
some build a two meters off the ground

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.490 
some build a two meters off the ground
platform<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.690> that'll<00:03:26.870> stop<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:27.230> Enderman

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
platform and that'll stop the Enderman

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.180 
platform and that'll stop the Enderman
from<00:03:27.770> getting<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.490> you<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.420> make<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:30.190> you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
from getting to you and you make it you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.590 
from getting to you and you make it you
just<00:03:31.340> make<00:03:31.460> a<00:03:31.490> little<00:03:31.550> ring<00:03:31.850> like<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.330> and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
just make a little ring like this and

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.720 
just make a little ring like this and
then<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:34.040> do<00:03:34.280> another<00:03:34.640> layer<00:03:35.090> above<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:35.840> and

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
then you do another layer above that and

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.070 
then you do another layer above that and
then<00:03:37.730> another<00:03:38.000> ring<00:03:38.360> above<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:41.080> I'll

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
then another ring above that and I'll

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.980 
then another ring above that and I'll
grab<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.350> lever<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.970> want<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.180> put<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.480> lever

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
grab a lever you want to put the lever

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.630 
grab a lever you want to put the lever
underneath<00:03:45.910> underneath<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.360> platform<00:03:47.810> here

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
underneath underneath the platform here

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.550 
underneath underneath the platform here
this<00:03:49.640> power<00:03:50.120> will<00:03:50.390> actually<00:03:50.690> go<00:03:50.810> through<00:03:51.050> so

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
this power will actually go through so

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.680 
this power will actually go through so
that's<00:03:52.220> what<00:03:52.580> this<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.060> what<00:03:53.270> powers<00:03:53.570> the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
that's what this is what powers the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.690 
that's what this is what powers the
Pistons<00:03:54.110> so<00:03:54.650> then<00:03:54.770> you<00:03:54.860> put<00:03:55.040> those<00:03:55.160> there

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
Pistons so then you put those there

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.510 
Pistons so then you put those there
and<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.120> get<00:03:56.210> a<00:03:56.240> sticky<00:03:56.540> piston<00:03:56.720> and<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:01.340> these

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
and you get a sticky piston and so these

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.810 
and you get a sticky piston and so these
will<00:04:01.850> these<00:04:02.330> will<00:04:02.480> get<00:04:02.570> powered<00:04:02.930> by<00:04:03.140> those<00:04:03.410> and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.160 

then<00:04:07.820> I<00:04:07.850> just<00:04:08.510> need<00:04:08.660> another<00:04:08.960> set<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.680> blocks

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
then I just need another set of blocks

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.990 
then I just need another set of blocks
underneath<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.260> sticky<00:04:12.560> pistons<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.250> then

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
underneath the sticky pistons and then

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.960 
underneath the sticky pistons and then
the<00:04:14.450> last<00:04:14.630> thing<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:14.990> want<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.290> do<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:16.040> just

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
the last thing I want to do is just

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.300 
the last thing I want to do is just
actually<00:04:17.840> fill<00:04:18.080> out<00:04:18.109> fill<00:04:18.709> off<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:19.040> rest<00:04:19.220> of

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
actually fill out fill off the rest of

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.770 
actually fill out fill off the rest of
this<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:20.900> it's<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.580> 5x5<00:04:22.580> square<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.150> so

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
this so that it's a 5x5 square and so

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.450 
this so that it's a 5x5 square and so
when<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:23.930> pull<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.470> sticky<00:04:24.770> pistons<00:04:25.070> back<00:04:25.250> up

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
when I pull the sticky pistons back up

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.950 
when I pull the sticky pistons back up
it's<00:04:25.700> not<00:04:25.820> going<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.030> pull<00:04:26.180> those<00:04:26.390> blocks<00:04:26.840> in

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
it's not going to pull those blocks in

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.540 
it's not going to pull those blocks in
the<00:04:27.020> corner<00:04:27.320> these<00:04:27.890> are<00:04:27.950> going<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.250> sort<00:04:28.490> of

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
the corner these are going to sort of

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.700 
the corner these are going to sort of
stop<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.790> intermón<00:04:29.270> from<00:04:29.660> wandering<00:04:30.320> off<00:04:30.500> to

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
stop the intermón from wandering off to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.750 
stop the intermón from wandering off to
the<00:04:30.800> side<00:04:31.040> when<00:04:31.340> they<00:04:31.430> start<00:04:31.669> getting

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
the side when they start getting

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.570 
the side when they start getting
suffocated<00:04:32.080> which<00:04:33.080> is<00:04:33.290> which<00:04:33.860> is<00:04:34.010> nice<00:04:34.190> it's

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
suffocated which is which is nice it's

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.610 
suffocated which is which is nice it's
going<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:34.940> increase<00:04:35.660> your<00:04:35.750> kill<00:04:36.260> rates<00:04:36.470> this

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
going to increase your kill rates this

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.090 
going to increase your kill rates this
is<00:04:36.680> it

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
is it

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.640 
is it
this<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.490> whole<00:04:37.610> thing<00:04:37.840> whoops<00:04:38.840> I<00:04:39.080> missed

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
this is the whole thing whoops I missed

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.020 
this is the whole thing whoops I missed
one<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:41.260> yeah<00:04:42.260> let<00:04:42.500> me<00:04:42.560> just<00:04:42.820> hop<00:04:43.820> in<00:04:43.940> it

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
one of the yeah let me just hop in it

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.640 
one of the yeah let me just hop in it
here<00:04:44.560> okay<00:04:45.560> there<00:04:45.919> we<00:04:46.010> go<00:04:46.040> and<00:04:46.700> that's<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.650> and

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
here okay there we go and that's it and

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.060 
here okay there we go and that's it and
now<00:04:48.890> I<00:04:49.310> can<00:04:49.850> go<00:04:50.000> back<00:04:50.240> into<00:04:51.070> my<00:04:52.070> throttle<00:04:52.880> mode

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
now I can go back into my throttle mode

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.220 
now I can go back into my throttle mode
start<00:04:55.070> staring<00:04:55.370> at<00:04:55.460> inner<00:04:55.580> moon<00:04:56.050> I'm<00:04:57.050> not

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
start staring at inner moon I'm not

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.540 
start staring at inner moon I'm not
going<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.470> try<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:57.800> count<00:04:58.100> while<00:04:58.280> I'm<00:04:58.370> talking

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
going to try and count while I'm talking

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.380 
going to try and count while I'm talking
but<00:04:59.060> yep<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.050> then<00:05:00.700> now<00:05:01.700> only<00:05:01.940> so<00:05:02.270> many

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
but yep so then now only so many

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.500 
but yep so then now only so many
intervene<00:05:02.780> can<00:05:02.960> actually<00:05:03.260> fit<00:05:03.530> in<00:05:03.710> here<00:05:04.510> like

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
intervene can actually fit in here like

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.990 
intervene can actually fit in here like
in<00:05:05.810> each<00:05:05.990> of<00:05:06.110> these<00:05:06.200> spots<00:05:06.470> because<00:05:06.890> it's<00:05:07.760> kind

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
in each of these spots because it's kind

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.580 
in each of these spots because it's kind
of<00:05:08.030> there's<00:05:08.390> only<00:05:08.600> so<00:05:08.780> much<00:05:08.900> room<00:05:09.169> so<00:05:09.410> some<00:05:09.560> of

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
of there's only so much room so some of

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.260 
of there's only so much room so some of
the<00:05:09.710> Enderman<00:05:09.950> will<00:05:10.190> sit<00:05:10.640> in<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.760> back<00:05:10.910> and<00:05:13.270> it

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
the Enderman will sit in the back and it

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.870 
the Enderman will sit in the back and it
won't<00:05:14.510> get<00:05:14.630> killed<00:05:14.930> in<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.770> first<00:05:16.490> round<00:05:16.760> of

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
won't get killed in the first round of

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.320 
won't get killed in the first round of
this<00:05:16.940> but<00:05:17.930> still<00:05:18.590> still<00:05:19.040> pretty<00:05:19.100> good<00:05:19.430> it's<00:05:19.760> a

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
this but still still pretty good it's a

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.180 
this but still still pretty good it's a
really<00:05:20.419> really<00:05:21.020> easy<00:05:21.169> way<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.620> build<00:05:21.800> an<00:05:22.070> urban

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
really really easy way to build an urban

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.909 
really really easy way to build an urban
farm<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.900> still<00:05:24.110> get<00:05:24.260> really<00:05:24.410> good<00:05:24.650> spawn

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
farm you still get really good spawn

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.980 
farm you still get really good spawn
rates<00:05:25.190> because<00:05:25.669> you<00:05:25.970> have<00:05:26.180> basically<00:05:26.780> the

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
rates because you have basically the

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.050 
rates because you have basically the
entire

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
entire

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.390 
entire
and<00:05:28.240> that's<00:05:28.720> already<00:05:28.930> set<00:05:29.200> up<00:05:29.230> for<00:05:29.530> mobs<00:05:30.250> to

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
and that's already set up for mobs to

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.680 
and that's already set up for mobs to
spawn<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:32.490> see<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:34.120> have<00:05:34.240> just<00:05:34.390> a<00:05:34.510> huge

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
spawn and see you have just a huge

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.140 
spawn and see you have just a huge
amount<00:05:34.900> of<00:05:35.050> spawning<00:05:35.470> so<00:05:35.620> this<00:05:35.800> area<00:05:36.070> which<00:05:37.030> is

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
amount of spawning so this area which is

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.060 
amount of spawning so this area which is
great<00:05:37.300> these<00:05:38.140> guys<00:05:38.230> are<00:05:38.470> still<00:05:38.590> angry<00:05:38.680> at<00:05:38.920> me

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
great these guys are still angry at me

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.890 
great these guys are still angry at me
let<00:05:40.060> the<00:05:40.210> man<00:05:40.390> I<00:05:41.170> just<00:05:42.130> there<00:05:43.000> we<00:05:43.090> go

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.630 

huge<00:05:46.900> amount<00:05:47.110> of<00:05:47.140> spawning<00:05:47.380> surface<00:05:47.800> area<00:05:48.100> so

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
huge amount of spawning surface area so

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.330 
huge amount of spawning surface area so
it's<00:05:49.390> you<00:05:49.750> probably<00:05:50.080> get<00:05:50.320> rates<00:05:50.560> comparable

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
it's you probably get rates comparable

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.880 
it's you probably get rates comparable
to<00:05:51.670> a<00:05:51.700> you<00:05:52.630> know<00:05:52.720> real<00:05:53.020> Enderman<00:05:53.440> farm<00:05:53.650> if<00:05:53.800> you

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
to a you know real Enderman farm if you

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.640 
to a you know real Enderman farm if you
went<00:05:54.160> out<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:54.280> built<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.790> out<00:05:55.360> far<00:05:55.720> and<00:05:55.990> it's

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
went out and built it out far and it's

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.170 
went out and built it out far and it's
really<00:05:57.070> it's<00:05:57.340> just<00:05:57.400> useful<00:05:57.850> that<00:05:57.970> you<00:05:58.000> can

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
really it's just useful that you can

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.659 
really it's just useful that you can
look<00:05:58.360> at<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:58.570> Enderman<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.140> stand<00:05:59.770> still<00:06:00.070> so

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
look at the Enderman and stand still so
