00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
now I don't know why I think to do this

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.240 
now I don't know why I think to do this
earlier<00:02:39.500> but<00:02:40.180> boom<00:02:41.740> doesn't<00:02:42.740> get<00:02:42.830> more<00:02:42.950> simple

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
earlier but boom doesn't get more simple

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.000 
earlier but boom doesn't get more simple
as<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.270> use<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:44.990> nice<00:02:45.200> terry<00:02:45.620> towel

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.110 
as that just I use a nice terry towel
and<00:02:46.400> some<00:02:48.040> armor<00:02:49.040> all<00:02:49.160> original<00:02:49.580> protectant

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
and some armor all original protectant

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.790 
and some armor all original protectant
and<00:02:50.210> I<00:02:50.780> thought<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.230> was<00:02:51.410> gonna<00:02:51.500> have<00:02:51.590> an<00:02:51.740> issue

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
and I thought I was gonna have an issue

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.410 
and I thought I was gonna have an issue
with<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.280> dirt<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.730> dust<00:02:52.880> stickin<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.390> it

with like dirt and dust stickin to it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.880 
with like dirt and dust stickin to it
because<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:53.930> know<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.170> kind<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.410> does<00:02:54.590> make<00:02:54.770> it

because you know it kind of does make it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.440 
because you know it kind of does make it
a<00:02:54.920> little<00:02:54.950> slick<00:02:56.860> but<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.310> stayed<00:02:59.150> remarkably
