sure<00:02:41.060> your<00:02:41.359> elbows<00:02:41.389> are<00:02:41.750> up<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.409> I<00:02:42.500> just<00:02:42.530> like

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
sure your elbows are up and I just like

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:43.899 
sure your elbows are up and I just like
to<00:02:42.859> keep<00:02:42.980> my<00:02:43.129> head<00:02:43.250> back<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.489> little<00:02:43.639> bit

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
to keep my head back a little bit

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.339 
to keep my head back a little bit
because<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.359> find<00:02:44.569> my<00:02:44.750> head<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.019> too<00:02:45.200> far

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
because I find my head is too far

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.440 
because I find my head is too far
forward<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:46.310> tends<00:02:46.609> to<00:02:46.760> make<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.000> bar<00:02:47.150> slip

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
forward that tends to make the bar slip

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.690 
forward that tends to make the bar slip
not<00:02:47.659> to<00:02:47.810> mention<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.290> chokes<00:02:48.590> my<00:02:48.739> ass<00:02:48.889> out<00:02:49.129> so

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
not to mention it chokes my ass out so

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.220 
not to mention it chokes my ass out so
the<00:02:49.819> next<00:02:49.970> thing<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:50.209> moved<00:02:50.419> on<00:02:50.629> to<00:02:50.659> was

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
the next thing we moved on to was

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.470 
the next thing we moved on to was
deficit<00:02:51.919> stiff<00:02:52.220> like<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.459> dead<00:02:52.730> lifts<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.180> my

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
deficit stiff like a dead lifts and my

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.420 
deficit stiff like a dead lifts and my
goal<00:02:53.720> here<00:02:53.900> was<00:02:54.019> do<00:02:54.230> three<00:02:54.650> sets<00:02:54.919> of<00:02:55.189> eight

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
goal here was do three sets of eight

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.369 
goal here was do three sets of eight
reps<00:02:55.760> working<00:02:56.209> up<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.510> heavy<00:02:56.750> set<00:02:57.019> of<00:02:57.139> eight

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
reps working up to a heavy set of eight

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.369 
reps working up to a heavy set of eight
so<00:02:58.010> i<00:02:58.040> started<00:02:58.250> here<00:02:58.459> with<00:02:58.609> 320<00:02:59.359> pounds<00:02:59.810> also

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
so i started here with 320 pounds also

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.470 
so i started here with 320 pounds also
going<00:03:00.530> beltless<00:03:01.010> on<00:03:01.189> this<00:03:01.489> one<00:03:01.730> now<00:03:01.939> one<00:03:02.419> of

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
going beltless on this one now one of

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.459 
going beltless on this one now one of
the<00:03:02.569> things<00:03:02.599> you<00:03:02.750> probably<00:03:02.900> notice<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.349> my

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
the things you probably notice is my

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:04.990 
the things you probably notice is my
back<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.889> slightly<00:03:04.129> rounded<00:03:04.549> in<00:03:04.669> the<00:03:04.760> fact

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
back is slightly rounded in the fact

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.099 
back is slightly rounded in the fact
that<00:03:05.090> if<00:03:05.239> you're<00:03:05.359> doing<00:03:05.629> stiff<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.049> a

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
that if you're doing stiff like a

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.229 
that if you're doing stiff like a
deadlift<00:03:06.560> not<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.189> mention<00:03:07.340> at<00:03:07.549> a<00:03:07.579> deficit<00:03:08.060> you

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
deadlift not to mention at a deficit you

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.000 
deadlift not to mention at a deficit you
are<00:03:08.389> going<00:03:08.629> to<00:03:08.750> have<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.109> little<00:03:09.319> bit<00:03:09.530> so

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
are going to have this a little bit so

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.860 
are going to have this a little bit so
it's<00:03:10.159> really<00:03:10.310> important<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.060> really<00:03:11.599> try<00:03:11.840> to

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
it's really important you really try to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.599 
it's really important you really try to
keep<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.290> bar<00:03:12.500> close<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.129> legs<00:03:13.400> so

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
keep the bar close to your legs so

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.129 
keep the bar close to your legs so
you're<00:03:13.760> not<00:03:13.879> out<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.120> front<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.540> yourself<00:03:14.900> and

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
you're not out in front of yourself and

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:16.960 
you're not out in front of yourself and
just<00:03:15.560> really<00:03:15.769> kind<00:03:16.099> of<00:03:16.189> pull<00:03:16.639> through<00:03:16.849> your

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
just really kind of pull through your

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.699 
just really kind of pull through your
core<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.239> utilize<00:03:18.049> your<00:03:18.199> glutes<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.650> your

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
core and utilize your glutes and your

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.210 
core and utilize your glutes and your
hips<00:03:18.949> as<00:03:19.099> well<00:03:19.489> second<00:03:20.329> set<00:03:20.479> we<00:03:20.599> moved<00:03:20.810> on<00:03:21.019> to

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
hips as well second set we moved on to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.979 
hips as well second set we moved on to
370<00:03:22.220> pounds<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:23.239> for<00:03:23.479> this<00:03:23.599> you'll<00:03:23.750> probably

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
370 pounds so for this you'll probably

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.569 
370 pounds so for this you'll probably
notice<00:03:24.260> too<00:03:24.560> i'm<00:03:24.680> using<00:03:24.919> a<00:03:24.979> double<00:03:25.250> overhand

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
notice too i'm using a double overhand

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.580 
notice too i'm using a double overhand
grip<00:03:25.729> I<00:03:26.030> hadn't<00:03:26.419> actually<00:03:26.569> put<00:03:26.930> on<00:03:27.049> any<00:03:27.260> chalk

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
grip I hadn't actually put on any chalk

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.009 
grip I hadn't actually put on any chalk
at<00:03:27.739> this<00:03:27.889> point<00:03:28.250> but<00:03:28.819> after<00:03:29.060> this<00:03:29.419> set<00:03:29.659> I<00:03:29.689> felt

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
at this point but after this set I felt

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.719 
at this point but after this set I felt
like<00:03:30.109> my<00:03:30.169> grip<00:03:30.530> was<00:03:30.709> giving<00:03:31.069> just<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.459> little

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:31.729 
like my grip was giving just a little

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.849 
like my grip was giving just a little
bit<00:03:31.879> not<00:03:32.449> to<00:03:32.599> mention<00:03:32.780> again<00:03:33.139> not<00:03:33.379> using<00:03:33.709> my

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
bit not to mention again not using my

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.439 
bit not to mention again not using my
belt<00:03:34.129> on<00:03:34.310> these<00:03:34.489> really<00:03:34.849> trying<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.120> build<00:03:35.359> up

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
belt on these really trying to build up

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.539 
belt on these really trying to build up
that<00:03:35.510> core<00:03:35.989> instability<00:03:36.290> this<00:03:37.099> was<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.310> really

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
that core instability this was a really

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.580 
that core instability this was a really
tough<00:03:37.579> set<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.329> really<00:03:38.599> debated<00:03:39.019> how<00:03:39.319> much

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
tough set and I really debated how much

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.830 
tough set and I really debated how much
heavier<00:03:39.919> I<00:03:40.010> should<00:03:40.340> go<00:03:40.549> on<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.819> last<00:03:41.269> one<00:03:41.449> but

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
heavier I should go on the last one but

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.599 
heavier I should go on the last one but
knowing<00:03:42.829> that<00:03:42.949> I've<00:03:43.040> done<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.549> past

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
knowing that I've done this in the past

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.009 
knowing that I've done this in the past
and<00:03:44.030> knowing<00:03:44.209> that<00:03:44.299> I've<00:03:44.449> been<00:03:44.629> able<00:03:44.689> to<00:03:44.900> do

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
and knowing that I've been able to do

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.319 
and knowing that I've been able to do
over<00:03:45.049> 400<00:03:45.709> pounds<00:03:46.069> I<00:03:46.220> kind<00:03:46.639> of<00:03:46.790> had<00:03:46.909> it<00:03:46.939> in<00:03:47.150> my

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
over 400 pounds I kind of had it in my

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.969 
over 400 pounds I kind of had it in my
mind<00:03:47.359> that<00:03:47.689> I<00:03:47.810> wanted<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.290> do<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:48.889> that's

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 
mind that I wanted to do that so that's

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.249 
mind that I wanted to do that so that's
exactly<00:03:49.430> what<00:03:49.639> i<00:03:49.669> was<00:03:49.819> going<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.090> attempt<00:03:50.540> now

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:51.259 
exactly what i was going to attempt now

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:52.869 
exactly what i was going to attempt now
again<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.620> know<00:03:51.919> this<00:03:52.069> last<00:03:52.310> sets<00:03:52.549> getting

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
again you know this last sets getting

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.849 
again you know this last sets getting
serious<00:03:53.269> because<00:03:53.449> the<00:03:54.049> hat<00:03:54.229> goes<00:03:54.259> backwards

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
serious because the hat goes backwards

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.289 
serious because the hat goes backwards
the<00:03:55.069> belt<00:03:55.250> comes<00:03:55.459> on<00:03:55.639> and<00:03:55.790> i<00:03:55.879> also<00:03:55.970> have<00:03:56.060> the

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
the belt comes on and i also have the

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.149 
the belt comes on and i also have the
nice<00:03:56.479> head<00:03:57.169> movement<00:03:57.560> from<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.829> guy<00:03:57.919> doing

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
nice head movement from the guy doing

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.069 
nice head movement from the guy doing
setups<00:03:58.579> on<00:03:58.729> the<00:03:58.879> glute<00:03:59.180> ham<00:03:59.389> rays<00:03:59.599> coming<00:03:59.900> in

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
setups on the glute ham rays coming in

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.319 
setups on the glute ham rays coming in
so<00:04:00.290> really<00:04:00.769> get<00:04:00.889> a<00:04:00.949> perception<00:04:01.639> of<00:04:01.729> depth<00:04:02.030> here

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
so really get a perception of depth here

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.140 
so really get a perception of depth here
but<00:04:02.840> this<00:04:03.049> set<00:04:03.349> was<00:04:03.590> very<00:04:04.069> tough<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:04.519> 410

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
but this set was very tough so 410

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.080 
but this set was very tough so 410
pounds<00:04:05.329> again<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.870> goal<00:04:06.049> was<00:04:06.109> eight<00:04:06.530> reps<00:04:06.799> and

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
pounds again the goal was eight reps and

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.429 
pounds again the goal was eight reps and
although<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.239> looks<00:04:08.540> fairly<00:04:08.840> smooth<00:04:09.229> in<00:04:09.349> my

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
although it looks fairly smooth in my

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.740 
although it looks fairly smooth in my
opinion<00:04:09.769> I<00:04:09.979> was<00:04:10.280> really<00:04:10.879> struggling<00:04:11.209> this<00:04:11.540> not

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
opinion I was really struggling this not

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.170 
opinion I was really struggling this not
only<00:04:11.780> with<00:04:12.229> grip<00:04:12.560> with<00:04:12.799> just<00:04:13.040> overall<00:04:13.790> pulling

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
only with grip with just overall pulling

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.300 
only with grip with just overall pulling
it<00:04:14.269> up<00:04:14.419> so<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:15.319> was<00:04:15.439> a<00:04:15.470> struggle<00:04:15.739> but<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:16.159> went

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
it up so it was a struggle but it went

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.039 
it up so it was a struggle but it went
up<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.699> just<00:04:17.180> just<00:04:17.299> means<00:04:17.509> next<00:04:17.720> week<00:04:17.900> I'm

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
up and just just means next week I'm

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.390 
up and just just means next week I'm
going<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.229> have<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.409> try<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.709> up<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:19.070> weight<00:04:19.220> if

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
going to have to try to up the weight if

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.490 
going to have to try to up the weight if
possible<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.180> that<00:04:20.209> should<00:04:20.659> definitely<00:04:21.139> be

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
possible so that should definitely be

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.290 
possible so that should definitely be
