I<00:02:11.819> remember<00:02:12.690> an<00:02:12.780> interview<00:02:12.959> with<00:02:13.440> Dorian

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
I remember an interview with Dorian

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.910 
I remember an interview with Dorian
Yates<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.580> read<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.060> 1999<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.319> he<00:02:16.530> flat

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
Yates that I read in 1999 and he flat

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.820 
Yates that I read in 1999 and he flat
said<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.790> record<00:02:18.209> at<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.930> time<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:19.680> he's

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
said for the record at that time if he's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.740 
said for the record at that time if he's
changed<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.370> since<00:02:20.670> since<00:02:21.120> he's<00:02:21.330> involved

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
changed this since since he's involved

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.420 
changed this since since he's involved
in<00:02:21.810> protein<00:02:22.170> companies<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.920> since<00:02:23.250> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
in protein companies and since the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.820 
in protein companies and since the
status<00:02:23.790> quo<00:02:23.970> has<00:02:24.000> changed<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:25.379> back<00:02:25.530> then<00:02:25.709> I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
status quo has changed but back then I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.229 
status quo has changed but back then I
heard<00:02:26.010> him<00:02:26.190> say<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.430> an<00:02:26.550> interview<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.120> as

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
heard him say in an interview that as

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.550 
heard him say in an interview that as
mr.<00:02:27.810> Olympia<00:02:27.959> he<00:02:28.739> generally<00:02:29.099> ate<00:02:29.400> between<00:02:30.560> 0.8

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
mr. Olympia he generally ate between 0.8

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.220 
mr. Olympia he generally ate between 0.8
and<00:02:32.549> one<00:02:33.000> gram<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.269> protein<00:02:33.450> per<00:02:33.900> pound<00:02:33.930> of

and one gram of protein per pound of
body<00:02:34.410> weight<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.830> he<00:02:34.980> said<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.400> he<00:02:35.519> often

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
body weight and he said that he often

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.640 
body weight and he said that he often
times<00:02:35.940> averaged<00:02:36.269> about<00:02:36.390> 200<00:02:37.200> grams<00:02:37.410> of

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650

protein<00:02:38.010> sometimes<00:02:38.519> maybe<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.540> little<00:02:39.750> more

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
protein sometimes maybe a little more

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.039 
protein sometimes maybe a little more
when<00:02:40.260> he<00:02:40.379> was<00:02:40.530> competing<00:02:40.709> at<00:02:41.129> 250<00:02:42.120> pounds<00:02:42.150> one

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
when he was competing at 250 pounds one

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.170 
when he was competing at 250 pounds one
of<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> biggest<00:02:43.769> men<00:02:44.130> on<00:02:44.430> earth<00:02:44.730> carrying

of the biggest men on earth carrying

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.759 
of the biggest men on earth carrying
more<00:02:45.390> muscle<00:02:45.750> mass<00:02:45.780> -<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> overwhelming

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
more muscle mass - the overwhelming

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.350 
more muscle mass - the overwhelming

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
majority of pro bodybuilders at that

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.380 
majority of pro bodybuilders at that
time<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.920> he<00:02:50.160> built<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.640> kind<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.970> size<00:02:51.180> off

200<00:02:51.840> grams<00:02:52.019> maybe<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.440> little<00:02:52.620> more<00:02:52.860> protein<00:02:53.329> so

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
200 grams maybe a little more protein so

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.289 
200 grams maybe a little more protein so
it<00:02:54.450> begs<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.720> question<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.349> does<00:02:56.000> 185<00:02:57.000> pound

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299

it begs the question of does 185 pound
bodybuilder<00:02:57.870> really<00:02:58.260> need<00:02:58.470> 200<00:02:59.069> or<00:02:59.190> more

much and so now I'm going to provide
