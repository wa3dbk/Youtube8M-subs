and<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.570> was<00:04:19.690> perfect<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.470> was<00:04:20.530> actually

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
and it was perfect and it was actually

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.409 
and it was perfect and it was actually
the<00:04:20.979> only<00:04:21.010> way<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.519> scene<00:04:21.729> could<00:04:21.940> really<00:04:22.150> play

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
the only way the scene could really play

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.030 
the only way the scene could really play
band<00:04:22.720> actually<00:04:23.110> if<00:04:23.169> you<00:04:23.260> look<00:04:23.320> at<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:23.680> scene

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
band actually if you look at that scene

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.800 
band actually if you look at that scene
the<00:04:24.370> juxtaposition<00:04:25.240> between<00:04:25.360> what<00:04:25.690> you're

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
the juxtaposition between what you're

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.480 
the juxtaposition between what you're
seeing<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.200> what<00:04:26.260> you're<00:04:26.470> hearing<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:27.160> really

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
seeing and what you're hearing is really

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.290 
seeing and what you're hearing is really
amazing<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.210> actually<00:04:28.599> amplified

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
amazing and it actually amplified

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.779 
amazing and it actually amplified
all<00:04:29.509> your<00:04:29.690> emotions<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.430> that's<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.520> really

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
all your emotions so that's a really

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.909 
all your emotions so that's a really
good<00:04:31.909> example<00:04:32.389> of<00:04:32.449> how<00:04:32.740> how<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.800> don't

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
good example of how how you don't

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.920 
good example of how how you don't
necessarily<00:04:34.129> have<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.639> follow<00:04:34.970> exactly<00:04:35.509> what

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
necessarily have to follow exactly what

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.589 
necessarily have to follow exactly what
you're<00:04:36.169> seeing<00:04:36.500> having<00:04:37.430> worked<00:04:38.240> out<00:04:38.419> my

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
you're seeing having worked out my

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.390 
you're seeing having worked out my
themes<00:04:38.900> at<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.289> piano<00:04:39.590> then<00:04:40.069> I'd<00:04:40.190> probably

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
themes at the piano then I'd probably

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.330 
themes at the piano then I'd probably
move<00:04:40.759> across<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.270> my<00:04:41.449> my<00:04:42.009> computers<00:04:43.009> and<00:04:43.190> my

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
move across to my my computers and my

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.180 
move across to my my computers and my
sense<00:04:43.909> and<00:04:44.030> whatnot<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:45.319> start<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.710> imagine

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
sense and whatnot and start to imagine

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.399 
sense and whatnot and start to imagine
how<00:04:46.430> I<00:04:46.460> can<00:04:46.759> express<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.389> theme<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:48.199> know<00:04:48.229> is

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
how I can express that theme you know is

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.350 
how I can express that theme you know is
it<00:04:48.500> gonna<00:04:48.620> be<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.800> clarinet<00:04:49.280> with<00:04:49.759> an<00:04:49.909> acoustic

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
it gonna be a clarinet with an acoustic

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.210 
it gonna be a clarinet with an acoustic
guitar<00:04:50.389> player<00:04:50.930> is<00:04:51.379> it<00:04:51.590> gonna<00:04:51.710> be<00:04:51.830> some<00:04:51.979> gnarly

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
guitar player is it gonna be some gnarly

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.460 
guitar player is it gonna be some gnarly
drum<00:04:52.610> loop<00:04:52.819> underneath<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:53.629> know<00:04:53.659> electric

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
drum loop underneath you know electric

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.580 
drum loop underneath you know electric
guitar<00:04:54.800> sound<00:04:55.330> or<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.659> it<00:04:56.810> is<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.080> going<00:04:57.409> to<00:04:57.470> be

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
guitar sound or is it is it going to be

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.529 
guitar sound or is it is it going to be
you<00:04:58.220> know<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.340> set<00:04:58.550> of<00:04:58.639> marimbas<00:04:59.090> an<00:04:59.240> empty

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
you know a set of marimbas an empty

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.200 
you know a set of marimbas an empty
bagpipe<00:05:00.340> so<00:05:01.340> that's<00:05:01.699> where<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:01.940> fun<00:05:02.180> really

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
bagpipe so that's where the fun really

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.600 
bagpipe so that's where the fun really
begins<00:05:02.479> for<00:05:03.080> me<00:05:03.199> because<00:05:03.650> then<00:05:04.039> I<00:05:04.069> move<00:05:04.340> over

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
begins for me because then I move over

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.059 
begins for me because then I move over
to<00:05:04.789> here<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:05.449> start<00:05:06.259> experimenting<00:05:06.620> with

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
to here and start experimenting with

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.040 
to here and start experimenting with
different<00:05:07.250> different<00:05:08.210> orchestrations<00:05:08.690> and

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
different different orchestrations and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.209 
different different orchestrations and
though<00:05:09.229> there<00:05:09.530> wouldn't<00:05:09.770> necessarily

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:10.219 
though there wouldn't necessarily

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:12.550 
though there wouldn't necessarily
involve<00:05:10.639> the<00:05:11.180> orchestra's<00:05:11.690> at<00:05:11.840> work<00:05:11.990> or<00:05:12.319> any

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560

involve the orchestra's at work or any
organic<00:05:13.129> sound<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.639> could<00:05:13.819> be<00:05:13.940> the

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
organic sound it could be the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.830 
organic sound it could be the

I<00:05:22.479> did<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.539> lot<00:05:23.690> of<00:05:23.810> sampling<00:05:24.229> of<00:05:24.500> huge<00:05:25.099> Middle

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
I did a lot of sampling of huge Middle

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.619 
I did a lot of sampling of huge Middle
Eastern<00:05:26.300> drums<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:28.370> once<00:05:28.669> I've<00:05:29.030> got<00:05:29.210> sound

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
I'll have spent many hours sequencing up

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.839 
I'll have spent many hours sequencing up
a<00:06:26.960> certain<00:06:27.440> cue<00:06:27.740> making<00:06:28.430> it<00:06:28.520> sound<00:06:28.669> as

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
a certain cue making it sound as

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.490 
a certain cue making it sound as
realistic<00:06:29.389> and<00:06:29.539> wonderful<00:06:29.930> as<00:06:30.050> I<00:06:30.139> possibly

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
realistic and wonderful as I possibly

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.769 
realistic and wonderful as I possibly
can<00:06:30.740> but<00:06:31.190> really<00:06:31.460> orchestrating<00:06:32.150> how<00:06:32.419> it's

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:32.779 
can but really orchestrating how it's

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.510 
can but really orchestrating how it's
going<00:06:33.080> to<00:06:33.169> sound<00:06:33.349> on<00:06:33.590> the<00:06:33.710> stage<00:06:33.949> so<00:06:34.250> that<00:06:34.279> we

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
going to sound on the stage so that we

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.010 
going to sound on the stage so that we
can<00:06:34.699> actually<00:06:34.879> get<00:06:35.270> into<00:06:35.479> the<00:06:35.750> nitty-gritty

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
can actually get into the nitty-gritty

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.719 
can actually get into the nitty-gritty
other<00:06:36.440> thing<00:06:36.650> before<00:06:37.159> it's<00:06:37.279> too<00:06:37.460> late

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
other thing before it's too late

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.730 
other thing before it's too late
so<00:06:38.240> I<00:06:38.270> can<00:06:38.570> have<00:06:38.810> a<00:06:38.839> director<00:06:39.229> sit<00:06:39.409> here<00:06:39.589> and
