takeoffs<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.450> landings<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:13.049> every<00:00:13.349> single

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
takeoffs and landings of every single

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.950

there in eighth place but that could
change<00:01:04.340> I<00:01:05.200> think<00:01:07.000> everybody's<00:01:08.000> going<00:01:08.210> to

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.180 
because there are a couple of fences at
least<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.580> couple<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.910> fences<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.480> front

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
would think and it's going to be

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.300 
would think and it's going to be
fascinating<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.160> watch<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:22.580> I<00:01:24.010> think<00:01:25.010> this<00:01:25.130> is

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
fascinating to watch it I think this is
