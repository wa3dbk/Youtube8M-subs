00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
variety of lettuce that I don't quite

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.229 
variety of lettuce that I don't quite
recall<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:27.519> have<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.640> get<00:02:28.790> out<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.030> seed

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
recall I have to get out the seed

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.069 
recall I have to get out the seed
packages<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:31.180> it's<00:02:32.180> getting<00:02:32.450> affected<00:02:32.930> by

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
packages and it's getting affected by

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.910 
packages and it's getting affected by
some<00:02:33.410> kind<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.940> fungus<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.440> believe<00:02:36.739> it's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
some kind of fungus and I believe it's

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.880 
some kind of fungus and I believe it's
the<00:02:37.099> same<00:02:37.130> fungus<00:02:37.849> that's<00:02:38.150> keeping<00:02:38.840> my<00:02:39.110> basil

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
the same fungus that's keeping my basil

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.130 
the same fungus that's keeping my basil
back<00:02:40.099> here<00:02:40.519> I'm<00:02:41.329> really<00:02:41.629> growing<00:02:42.910> also<00:02:43.910> this

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
back here I'm really growing also this

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
back here I'm really growing also this
basil<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.290> not<00:02:45.500> growing<00:02:46.030> now<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:48.560> basil

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
basil is not growing now the basil

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.000 
basil is not growing now the basil
this<00:02:50.120> basil<00:02:50.359> back<00:02:50.720> here<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.319> bought<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.829> Whole

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
this basil back here I bought it a Whole

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.319 
this basil back here I bought it a Whole
Foods<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:53.660> think<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.049> had<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:55.040> fungus<00:02:55.700> in<00:02:56.060> it

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
Foods and I think it had a fungus in it

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.910 
Foods and I think it had a fungus in it
that<00:02:56.870> causing<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:58.160> stunt<00:02:58.639> its<00:02:58.970> growth<00:02:59.889> so<00:03:00.889> a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
that causing it to stunt its growth so a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.360
