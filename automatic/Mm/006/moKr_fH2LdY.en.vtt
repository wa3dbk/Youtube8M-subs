this<00:00:02.190> is<00:00:02.429> braid<00:00:02.909> number<00:00:03.210> three<00:00:03.710> for<00:00:04.710> King

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
this is braid number three for King

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.770 
this is braid number three for King
Canute<00:00:05.250> braiding<00:00:06.259> this<00:00:07.259> again<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> five

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
Canute braiding this again is a five

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.299 
Canute braiding this again is a five
loop<00:00:09.780> braid<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.679> we're<00:00:10.830> gonna<00:00:10.920> start<00:00:11.219> it

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
loop braid and we're gonna start it

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.339 
loop braid and we're gonna start it
exactly<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.880> same<00:00:12.059> way<00:00:12.210> we're<00:00:13.139> actually

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
exactly the same way we're actually

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.160 
exactly the same way we're actually
going<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.799> do<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.880> square<00:00:15.179> braid<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.049> we

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
going to do the square braid that we

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.450 
going to do the square braid that we
just<00:00:16.440> did<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:18.410> then<00:00:19.410> I'm<00:00:19.619> gonna<00:00:19.740> change<00:00:20.160> one

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
just did and then I'm gonna change one

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.050 
just did and then I'm gonna change one
little<00:00:20.640> thing<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:22.220> you<00:00:23.220> don't<00:00:23.369> make<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.699> split

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
little thing and you don't make it split

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.080 
little thing and you don't make it split
into<00:00:24.210> two<00:00:24.480> separate<00:00:24.869> braids<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.939> for

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
into two separate braids and do that for

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.310 
into two separate braids and do that for
a<00:00:27.180> little<00:00:27.330> while<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.630> then<00:00:27.779> I'll<00:00:27.869> switch<00:00:28.080> back

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
a little while and then I'll switch back

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.580 
a little while and then I'll switch back
to<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> square<00:00:28.769> braid<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:30.140> you'll<00:00:31.140> see<00:00:31.320> I'll

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
to the square braid and you'll see I'll

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.049 
to the square braid and you'll see I'll
have<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.769> split<00:00:32.099> braid<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> middle<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
have a split braid in the middle of a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.260 
have a split braid in the middle of a
square<00:00:33.329> braid<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.760> same<00:00:35.969> way<00:00:36.149> with

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
square braid so it's the same way with

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.110 
square braid so it's the same way with
the<00:00:36.420> square<00:00:36.719> braid<00:00:36.960> three<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.309> hand<00:00:38.670> two

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
the square braid three on one hand two

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.750 
the square braid three on one hand two
on<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> other<00:00:39.600> these<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.550> middle

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
on the other these are on the the middle

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330 
on the other these are on the the middle
and<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.450> ring<00:00:42.660> over<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> index

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and the ring over here you on the index

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.310 
and the ring over here you on the index
middle<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.820> ring<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.750> gonna<00:00:45.930> reach<00:00:46.079> through

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
middle and ring I'm gonna reach through

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.270 
middle and ring I'm gonna reach through
both<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.260> strings<00:00:49.590> over<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
both of the the strings over here and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.180 
both of the the strings over here and
I'm<00:00:50.399> gonna<00:00:50.520> take<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> bottom<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:52.190> reversed

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
I'm gonna take the bottom one reversed

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.299 
I'm gonna take the bottom one reversed
so<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.239> taking<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.719> bottom<00:00:55.110> string<00:00:55.309> walk

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so I'm taking that bottom string walk

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.049 
so I'm taking that bottom string walk
them<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.660> bottom<00:00:57.660> reversed<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
them down bottom reversed this is the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.109 
them down bottom reversed this is the
exact<00:01:00.390> same<00:01:00.600> one<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.020> did<00:01:01.609> okay<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:05.119> I'm

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
more okay so I got some square braids

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.630 
more okay so I got some square braids
going<00:01:31.390> there<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:32.590> what<00:01:32.950> I'm<00:01:33.040> gonna<00:01:33.160> do<00:01:33.370> is<00:01:33.520> I'm

going there now what I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:01:33.760> to<00:01:33.880> change<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.360> just<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.660> little<00:01:34.900> bit

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
going to change it just a little bit

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.900 
going to change it just a little bit
instead<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.580> taking<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:38.340> reversed<00:01:39.340> over<00:01:39.550> here

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
instead of taking it reversed over here

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.330 
instead of taking it reversed over here
I'm<00:01:40.210> gonna<00:01:40.420> take<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.900> unruhe<00:01:41.260> versed<00:01:41.500> so<00:01:42.250> I'm

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
I'm gonna take it unruhe versed so I'm

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.000 
I'm gonna take it unruhe versed so I'm
going<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.610> take<00:01:42.730> the<00:01:42.910> top<00:01:43.330> string<00:01:43.840> off<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.860> my

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
going to take the top string off of my

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.400 
going to take the top string off of my
ring<00:01:45.250> finger<00:01:45.610> over<00:01:45.730> here<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:46.300> then<00:01:47.230> we're

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
ring finger over here and then we're

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.840 
ring finger over here and then we're
gonna<00:01:47.500> do<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:47.800> for<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.130> little<00:01:48.280> while<00:01:48.370> from

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
gonna do that for a little while from

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.780 
gonna do that for a little while from
both<00:01:49.270> sides<00:01:49.570> take<00:01:50.410> it<00:01:50.680> unruhe<00:01:51.220> versed<00:01:51.460> from

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
both sides take it unruhe versed from

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:09.960 
both sides take it unruhe versed from
both<00:01:51.970> sides

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.340 

okay<00:02:10.840> now<00:02:12.330> now<00:02:13.330> let's<00:02:13.540> switch<00:02:13.780> back<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.080> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
okay now now let's switch back to the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.010 
okay now now let's switch back to the
square<00:02:14.650> braid<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:16.000> I'm<00:02:16.450> going<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.690> go<00:02:16.810> back<00:02:16.990> to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
square braid so I'm going to go back to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:36.190 
square braid so I'm going to go back to
taking<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.190> reversed

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.050 

I'm<00:02:36.650> wearing<00:02:37.010> my<00:02:37.190> fingers<00:02:37.760> out<00:02:38.000> today

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.010 

okay<00:02:45.430> more

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
okay more

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.880 
okay more
yeah<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.680> think<00:02:48.800> that's<00:02:49.070> enough<00:02:49.540> okay<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:51.680> is

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
yeah I think that's enough okay this is

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.290 
yeah I think that's enough okay this is
cool<00:02:52.520> one<00:02:53.020> so<00:02:54.040> it's<00:02:55.040> like<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:56.120> regular

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
cool one so it's like this the regular

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.780 
cool one so it's like this the regular
square<00:02:56.750> braid<00:02:56.990> like<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:57.560> did<00:02:57.770> except

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.440 

it's<00:03:01.790> actually<00:03:02.120> split<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.750> center<00:03:04.450> when

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
it's actually split in the center when

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.820 
it's actually split in the center when
we<00:03:05.570> change<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.990> pattern

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
we change the pattern

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.950 
we change the pattern
it<00:03:07.220> made<00:03:07.490> it<00:03:07.670> split<00:03:08.030> into<00:03:08.150> two<00:03:08.510> separate

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
it made it split into two separate

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.770 
it made it split into two separate
braids<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.880> I've<00:03:11.210> got<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.810> square<00:03:12.590> braid<00:03:13.390> with<00:03:14.390> a
