school so there is no reason to go on by
another<00:01:15.000> pencil<00:01:15.540> case<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.049> one's<00:01:16.290> just

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
by hand it's a really good thing to be

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.340 
by hand it's a really good thing to be
organized<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.840> why<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.200> these

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
organized that's why I have these

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.810 
organized that's why I have these
highlighters<00:01:22.799> again<00:01:23.189> these<00:01:23.340> are<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.580> high

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

because they still work I've three of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
because they still work I've three of

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
them when I take notes it's a really

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
them when I take notes it's a really
good<00:01:29.610> idea<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.240> organize<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.470> by

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
good idea to organize and I do that by

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.109 
good idea to organize and I do that by
using<00:01:32.009> different<00:01:32.189> pen<00:01:32.579> colors<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
using different pen colors and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.940 
using different pen colors and
highlighters<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.780> things<00:01:34.409> stand<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.890> more

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
highlighters so things stand out more

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
highlighters so things stand out more
what<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.579> want<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.119> stand<00:01:36.390> out<00:01:36.509> stands<00:01:36.900> out

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
what I want to stand out stands out
