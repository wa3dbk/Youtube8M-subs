 the rain is only verified in the three 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.250
 newspapers of genius that we will take care of 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 our goal then is what the engine 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.350
 1.6 have sent portugal in a way 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.779
 healthy and high

 watching luiz from the mainland 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.840
 backstrom a party if the coach 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:44.540
 get to the top box vi he'll already be 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.540
 joyful 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.770
 Miguel - Guizzo I think it was a good guess 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.130
 that the team had a good attitude 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.780
 I think the result should be yes and I think 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 that the group try down by 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.000
 I got the four goals here 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.760
 It was so and I think that with this 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.200
 mentality this all with a group that 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.420
 people have to move forward and above all 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.670
 to achieve our goal as it is 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.230
 your football from a song I think 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.660
 positive workouts every day 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.280
 practically say the team sizes 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.990
 charged was also on the level of my 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.390
 Work, I'm happy with myself. 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.980
 now is not to lower your head and continue 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.410
 how the environment in the 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.270
 The spa is very good 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:49.400
 I think the way I have 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.030
 I have found so far last year and 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 this team is another level 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.650
 are divisions difference a goal 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.910
 different level dimension your speech 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.020
 completely different 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.390
 I think what is more save path 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.830
 the series and therefore I was chosen in this 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.830
 house yes certainly 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:31.450
 the ox's hill 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:33.510
 tonight joy jung team goal 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.510
 House 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.360
 the book draw the hymn a micro council 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.600
 all together 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.060
 cobain think after the world 15 11 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.980
 I think you should be satisfied even if 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.440
 in the first part we had some 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.010
 problems that we set early but later 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.860
 we relaxed many left we marked today 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.590
 the second part we were better ball 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.810
 stop mark the 2 1 and 13 11 and then 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.180
 already dominated the game completely 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.290
 because when you hear in the goal throw 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.640
 Launched Mothers Team Coordination 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.770
 we lost the ball in the middle not 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.500
 we can lose the ball our player 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.320
 begins to dribble them what happens in 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.570
 going to work and in the future we will 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.880
 study how the differences we're going to get 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.220
 this year by the benfica of last year 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.600
 I think the union I think the group 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.450
 is much more united 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.170
 we organize much more outputs, I think the 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.380
 even in the bathhouse is one thing 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.380
 extraordinary
