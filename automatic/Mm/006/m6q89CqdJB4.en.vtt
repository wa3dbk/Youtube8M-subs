start<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.559> run<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.950> low<00:00:11.370> idle<00:00:11.610> because<00:00:12.030> it

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
start and run a low idle because it

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.810 
start and run a low idle because it
wasn't<00:00:12.509> producing<00:00:12.780> spark<00:00:13.170> at<00:00:13.320> high<00:00:13.530> speeds<00:00:13.889> so

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
wasn't producing spark at high speeds so
