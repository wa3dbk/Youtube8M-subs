00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.450
 simple that I have a shirt that leaves 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.630
 off your shoulders like you're going 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.560
 this end of the year I hope for 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.050
 you because mine is starting me 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.539
 really this crap era of suck 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.740
 heart after December 21 brought me 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.750
 immediately a broken iphone in the sense 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.100
 that this is my iphone 5 as a present 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.059
 for graduation and fell off my stomach 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.360
 pam so and it broke me 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.620
 you don't have the slightest screen 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.579
 idea of ​​how I am in this period 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 however apart from all this and this is the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.289
 make up that I thought for new year 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.590
 then make up for christmas let's say that 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.020
 five out of five girls liked it 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.180
 there was a fifty movie now you me 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.390
 you will say but oh my God also recalls the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.590
 statistics to the accountants for you that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.229
 they work in the laundry 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
 no it is not so simply i saw that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.610
 there was an unfavorable comment one no one 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.930
 favorable comment one then not 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.159
 I think it's more or less 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.220
 went so 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.540
 I will tell you the truth to give you much more now 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.040
 nice the lights don't say they don't have 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.060
 that make-up really stood out 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.780
 New Year 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.990
 in any case as me as youtuber 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.650
 I travel much more on the line of tricks 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.360
 natural of tricks also clear being 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 also blonde etc. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.490
 I thought that for this new year 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.229
 precisely I wanted to do 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.930
 a little more strong given that new year 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:55.060
 we can use all of them and therefore I have 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:58.060
 thought of limestone is at the level of 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.259
 eyes that at mouth level what to say 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.710

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.530
 royal blue note the blood is called of 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.060

 stratospheric and on the lips instead the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:18.880

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.920
 all of us is alive and nothing this is the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.250
 situation there are also some 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.400
 glitter both on the eyeliner on the line of 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.620
 eyeliner that I wanted to stretch 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.500
 enough and the very pronounced cheekbone 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.760

 a very good delicious new year in 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.620
 action to be found by then goodbye 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.450
 let's start as you see I was already made up 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.700
 for the day I had a colored eye shadow 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.430
 meat over the entire eyelid and already the 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.500
 rimmel so I do n't need me 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.650
 strucchi I will go to apply only one 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.650
 further base which will be a concealer 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:29.380
 after having spread it well I go to 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.460
 take the black silver of collistar with 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.940
 this little sephora brush that I find 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.520
 really brilliant in the sense that it is created 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.870
 in such a way and using the 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.490
 tip 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.910
 let's go just to apply the color is 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.560
 instead the fade just fades 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.170
 color itself and I 'm finding it 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.240
 great especially for the application 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.240
 dark colors in the crease of the eye 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.860
 now I'm going to get blood which is a 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.950
 snow cosmetics pigment of the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.800
 royal collection yes and it is stratospheric is 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.170
 practically an indigo is a purple blue 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.230
 here some pigment has fallen and I am 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.380
 gone to eliminate it with mine 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:25.270
 huge range of freud line it 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:29.410
 tampon and then with a bit of fix plus I go 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.669
 to fix the last layer we say so 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.790
 to make the color even more 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.790
 brilliant 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.570
 I went to apply black like this 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.610
 that precisely I did not go then to 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.419
 dirty the purple 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:49.200
 I still get some black, but it is 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.200
 let's say I emphasize the fold 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.240
 to 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.150
 and now with a concealer I go to 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.979
 illuminate the areas that interest me 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.830
 I don't use white colors as much 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:09.250
 clear because I don't know why but 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.610
 I 'm not fine I 'm going to get the 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:17.370
 phantasmagoric 24 hours debora eyeliner 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.370
 from which I do not separate anymore I adore it 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.080
 I made this very eyeliner line 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:40.259
 long as you can see now I go to 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.630
 take it mac naked line and open it 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:47.360
 look 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:49.940
 and now the valium for ten which is mine 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.530
 favorite mascara in this period 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.600
 see the difference for example between 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.580
 that of rimmel occhioni di 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.740
 snow cosmetics now with some foundation 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.220
 I am going to clean the surrounding areas and with 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.680
 of glitter liri pass over the lai liner e 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.900
 then also on the eyelashes 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.840
 I just wanted to clarify that she was born 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.430
 also a diatribe on local facebook of 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.350
 snow cosmetics I never said that 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.390
 be a bad mascara simply do it 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.220
 I find a very valid day mask 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.040
 for the day as it contains neither 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.930
 even rubbish with foundation I go to 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.340
 neutralize redness around the 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.050
 mouth 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.530
 I make my lip contour with one 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.080
 red pencil and maybe then fades 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.170
 also inward and then with the 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.750
 rimmel cherry blossom I go precisely 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.910
 fill in the contours if you don't have them 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.600
 big lips like me I recommend you 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.350
 use a small brush 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.210
 now 106 of kiko who has a blush 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.070
 phantasmagoric that I love to achieve 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.840
 the consuming are not like me now 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:07:00.180
 much more than the earth and always noblesse 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.180
 snow cosmetics on the barrel 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.590
 enlightening hour of collistar 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.720
 I send you a big kiss girls and 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.720
 happy new year from eric iowa 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.350
