00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.259
 answered one of the elders and asked me 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.259
 These are dressed in long white clothes 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.109
 who are they 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.059
 and where have they come from 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.089
 and I said sr 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.489
 you know it 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.859

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.229
 these are the ones who have come from great tribulation 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.549
 and he has praised his show at home clothes 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.169

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.389
 in the blood of the lamb 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.389
 for this they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.509
 in his temple 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.540
 and he who sits on the throne 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.399
 he will dwell among them 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:21.089
 they will no longer hunger or thirst and the sun will not fall on them anymore 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.299
 nor any other heat 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.049
 because the lamb that is in the middle of the throne 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.399
 will govern them 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.909
 and guide them to living sources of water 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.529

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.969
 Silence was made in heaven about half an hour 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.819
 I started the angels who were before God 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.130
 and they were given 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.079
 seven trumpets 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.480
 and another angel came 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.559
 and he stood in front of the altar 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.189
 having a golden censer 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.379
 and he was given a lot of incense 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.929
 of the populations of all the saints 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:08.309
 to put them on the golden altar which is in front of the throne 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.519
 and the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.389
 went up 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.829
 from the hand of the angel in front of God 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.079
 and the angel took the censer 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.519
 and filled it with fire from the altar 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.300
 and what is done on earth 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.099
 and they were made had in two 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.340
 and buses and lightning 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.550
 and earth tremor 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.629
 and the seven angels who had the seven trumpets 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.879
 if they rigged to play trumpet 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.360
 and the first angel played the trumpet 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.919
 and there was hail and fire mixed with blood 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.840
 and they were sent on earth 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.199
 and a third of the coals was burned 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.559
 and all the green grass was burned 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.169
 and the second angel played the trumpet 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.279
 and like a great mountain having fire 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.099
 it was thrown in the sea 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.029
 and a third of the sea 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.069
 it was turned in blood 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.749
 and a third of the creatures died 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.469
 that were in the sea 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.389
 which had life 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.040
 and the third part 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.400
 of the ships perished 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.909
 and the third angel sounded the trumpet 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.380
 and fell from heaven 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.099
 a great star 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.249
 attending like a lit torch 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:23.260
 and fell 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.460
 in the third part of the rivers 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.029
 and in the sources of the waters 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.360
 and the name of the star is called absinthe 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.410
 and a third of the waters 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.490
 it was back in absinthe 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.050
 and many peaks died by the waters because they were made love 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.240
 and the fourth angel played the trumpet 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.819
 and was hurt to the third part of the sun 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.990
 and the third part of the moon 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.879
 and a third of the stars 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.740
 in such a way that a third of them darkened 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.699
 and it did not light the third part of the day 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.789
 and the same thing about the night 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.020
 and look 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.979

 hadi there there 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:09.889
 of those who dwell on earth 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.809
 because of the fillies trumpet voices 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.230
 of the three angels who have to touch 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.289
 his trumpets 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.400
 apocalypse chapter 9 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.919
 and the fifth angel sounded the trumpet 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.930
 and a star that fell from heaven on earth 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.930
 and he was given the key to the bottomless pit of the abyss 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.580
 and opened the bottom of the abyss and went up 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.800
 well smoke 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.249
 like the smoke of a large furnace 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:38.919
 and the sun darkened 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:39.830
 and the air 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.889
 by the smoke from the well 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.430
 and the smoke from the well came out on coasts in the land 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.610
 and they were given power 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.610
 as they have the power of the scorpions of the earth 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.149
 and they were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.080
 nor to anything green 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.599
 nor to any tree 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:01.699
 if not only to buy 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.119
 that they do not have a sign of god in their foreheads 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:07.509
 and it was given to them that they would not be killed 

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.509
 but that the mints cathodes in five months 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.199
 and his torment was like scorpion torment 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.219
 when and is that man 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:17.729
 and in those days 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.909
 they will look for the men of death 

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:21.419
 and there will be no 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.830
 and wish to die and death unity of them 

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.430
 and the look of the mongoose 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.620
 It was similar to horses rigged for war 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.059
 and on their heads they had as crowns 

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:35.749
 similar to gold 

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:36.919
 and their faces 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:39.419
 they were like faces of men 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.349
 and they had hair like women's hair 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:45.419
 and their teeth were like teeth of lions 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:46.949
 and they had armor 

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:48.819
 as iron shells 

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:50.800
 and the rumble of their wings 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.599
 like the noise of cars 

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:54.389
 that with many horses 

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:56.379
 they run to battle 

00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:59.659
 and they had tail like the scorpions 

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:02.169
 and they had in their tails there jones 

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:03.529
 and his power 

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:05.649
 It was about hurting men 

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:06.579
 five months
