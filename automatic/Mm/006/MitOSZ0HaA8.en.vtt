 you can find so let's see the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.980
 step by step and we start with the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.690
 ingredients 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.989
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.879
 for a cup of 225 milliliters are 15 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.160
 grams of unsalted butter and without 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.559
 lactose if you are intolerant a gram of 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.110
 sweetener an egg the juice of a lemon 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.720
 and its grated 3 tablespoons flour 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.520
 rice a tablespoon of corn flour a 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.710
 quarter teaspoon of yeast without 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.600
 gluten if it is intolerant a pinch of 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.150
 salt and optionally half 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.340
 teaspoon of sesame 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.050
 first let's put in a bowl the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.460
 butter and we melted it in the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.110
 microwave oven 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.330
 If you are lactose intolerant, you can 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.700
 see the butter for two tablespoons of 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.460
 oil 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.070
 to which we add the sweetener and the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.540
 egg and whisk 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.370
 and this time it has done with 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.200
 sweetener to make it healthier but 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.540
 If you are very sweet you can replace it with 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.950
 a spoonful of sugar and even up 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.930
 two 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.020
 then we are adding the juice of the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.020
 lemon the mixture of flours next to the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.580
 yeast and zest and mix 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.650
 until we have no group left 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.670
 If you do not have lemon you can also put 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.670
 the essence of lemon 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.130
 when we get a homogeneous mixture and 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.130
 without lumps we put the pinch of salt 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.879
 then pour the mixture in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.099
 our cup making sure we stay 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.349
 one third without filling approximately 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.790
 are three centimeters to the edge by 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.189
 last we put the two in the microwave 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.530
 placing it on the edge of the plate and 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.659
 we put at 800 watts for a minute 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.420
 after this time we open the door 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.640
 we rotate the cup to 180 degrees and what 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.799
 we put another minute to 600 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.450
 watts of power at this time 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.299
 we can train as I said 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.799
 put over sesame seed and like 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.989
 that the ovens every microwave is a 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.489
 world so it is detected is that it is not 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.250
 done you can continue cooking it to 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.989
 intervals of 10 seconds and you know that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.150
 we have to let it rest inside the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.260
 microwave about 5 minutes before 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.730
 enjoy him 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.730
 and we go more matter
