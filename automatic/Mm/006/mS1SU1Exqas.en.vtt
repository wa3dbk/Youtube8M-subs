 that's a few 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.830
 had application interviews due to studies 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.509
 and I thought that maybe completely 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.000
 many of you soon because of 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.470
 any internships or training 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.210
 or other things too 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.400
 could have an interview 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.869
 and that's why it just shows you today 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.550
 something I mean by mine 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.800
 interviews and 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.570
 how I made up and the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.790
 Julia from the channel ex invites you then 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.950
 even so handbags must haves 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.840
 Always imagine her then always 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.670
 should have and I became it 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.440
 If you're just in 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.879
 the comments so a few tips and 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.010
 tricks you write at 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.300
 Attend application interview then 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.980
 we could all be so in there a bit 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.870
 I am exchanging comments with you 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.879
 think that would be cool or otherwise 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.949
 I would say we are now with times 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.989
 The make-up of the men currently has 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.660
 very similar I use first of 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.339
 p2 so an all control base and the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.200
 defended one on my face her 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.780
 See also that I have many good ones 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.399
 Currently I have some tips for 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.170
 pure skin and writes it like to 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.429
 times in the comments I order a me 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.429
 little to see 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.849
 then I have to continue for my own 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.830
 lumia ak foundation decided 

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:23.569
 simply because I really like the foundation 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.649
 very trusted and knows that the long 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.929
 holds and that with it too 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.929
 will look reasonably well 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.520
 because of course concealer I have 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.740
 simply of such a used and the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.719
 on all my redness and yet times 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.100
 applied under the eye and thus the 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.509
 beauty blender blinded brother may 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.549
 Of course , I'm not missing 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.859
 just from patrice such a nice sweet 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.990
 Powder used around a concealer like this 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.789
 to save a bit and yet before 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.590
 especially on the t zone the powder on 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.280
 I would not start to operate 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.560
 shine 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.849
 right in the eyeshadow of p2 I have 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.149
 then just my eyebrows 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:03.950
 filled up and then I have from mac 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.929
 enter shadow is used it is a whole 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.340
 natural brown tone and have it 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.690
 just given to my eyelids 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.459
 in connection with it I have such a 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.400
 taken black kajalstift and the 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.930
 just very close to the upper lash line 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.239
 applied and then I have the multi 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.739
 action mascara used by essens and 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.739
 just lashes my eyelashes 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.530
 with the same song shadow for mine 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.940
 I then used eyebrows 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.350
 also my cheek bit 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.840
 contoured and my face like this 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.280
 lent a little more trees 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.600
 then i have alena easy 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.640
 just so I used as a 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.100
 light bluesy glow somehow im 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.830
 face had quite the circuit was then 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.180
 still from l'oreal so a lipgloss and the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.340
 I applied on my lips 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.280
 and in the end you really have one 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.960
 very natural make-up you can see 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.070
 bit fresh but it's up 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.070
 Not too much in any case 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.930
 it continues with the handbags 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.580
 Master is and should be first 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.650
 your bags will be clean and tidy 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.360
 since you are also with your outfit 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.790
 is fit so well with her handbag 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.950
 and what should be in it urgently 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.840
 is your cell phone so that you also reachable 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.760
 Above all, before the application interview 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.989
 so that you can also learn if the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.000
 Date for any reasons 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.799
 canceled or something else 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.569
 that's important 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.400
 In addition, you should in any case 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.260
 have handkerchiefs because there is nothing 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.790
 more unpleasant than one 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.040
 to put a running nose 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.450
 A hand mirror would also be very handy 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.420
 so that he can also look again 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.400
 if you lipstick or the bare 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.810
 still right bite and there it would be 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.190
 practically the one again 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.840
 grabber with ideas before the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.060
 interview again 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.010
 can then always be good 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.140
 to have kÃ¤mmerchen here or 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.940
 Depending on what bobby give bobby 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.829
 hairstyle you've got me here for 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.420
 a waterfall head decided 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.640
 that's why it makes sense for me too 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.049
 to have a replacement springsteen with you 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.810
 at the result then with the next 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.160
 Do us what the fan has been since she is always 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.410
 to be good at it 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.030
 as well as chewing gum but the 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.380
 Light during the application interview 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.359
 build but before that 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.040
 You can also get one 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.870
 write notes with the name of one 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.329
 Talking partner because it's pretty 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.769
 embarrassing if you had the fix as well 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.599
 should you still in the block and one 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.489
 pen with it you have to take notes 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.440
 but you can make sure that you 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.780
 neutral matter thus takes without 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.370
 any party or company name on 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.200
 if you tend to sharpen it 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.940
 If you are nervous I would wake you up 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.310
 every case also a deo recommends 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.260
 what reduces the odor 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.330
 and that would be very much on the new one 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.010
 Application interview and handbags moderately 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.050
 are you already perfectly prepared? 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.280
 then come for your application interview 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.280
 Let's go to the outfits 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.569
 I have the first car at 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.069
 Application interview worn where there is no 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.930
 Real dress code was there but I wanted 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.680
 still a bit chic and elegant 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.300
 appearance 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.099
 I just have such a long time 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.819
 dress for my relationships of h m 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.430

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.729
 a blazer from tara such a cute little one 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.710
 chain and all very simple and 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.229
 kept simple and then one more 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.580
 black bag so mary janes the 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.860
 are now from deichmann this still 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.259
 not so high and super comfortable and that 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.449
 was actually the first outfit fried am 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:16.340
 best always what the dress code is with it 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.340
 be the really fit always attracted 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.190
 the cash register 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.940
 at the second conversation I should one 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.889
 be dressed a little fancier where you 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.229
 told me and then came this outfit 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.319
 It's still very bad 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.599
 but actually the elegant day 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.310
 Here is this great clock and have me 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.229
 extra for making the nails because 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.789
 I actually dreamed and then have 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.259
 I do not care for such a great blazer 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.190
 I decided secondhand 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.379
 have found 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.780

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:49.000
 my shoes and that is really too 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.009
 very comfortable the whole outfit and looks 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.479
 so a bit businesslike from it 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.669
 you see one more time this gathering the 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.770
 The dress has and the shoes in detail 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.690
 are also mary janes but I think so 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.139
 a bit more elegant and adult 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.919
 like the first ones and yes they were 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.919
