hide the car so he cut some it looks way
we<00:00:52.870> used<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:53.109> do<00:00:53.230> when<00:00:53.379> I<00:00:53.440> used<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.679> do<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:53.920> we

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
we used to do when I used to do it we

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.130 
we used to do when I used to do it we
would<00:00:54.460> look<00:00:54.640> at<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.789> high<00:00:54.940> mark<00:00:55.870> all<00:00:56.050> the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
would look at the high mark all the

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.290 
would look at the high mark all the
imperfections<00:00:56.350> in<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:56.859> heart

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
I'm sure they've had got that and we

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.050 
I'm sure they've had got that and we
would<00:01:01.200> put<00:01:01.380> say<00:01:01.590> or<00:01:01.950> rear<00:01:02.250> seat<00:01:02.490> in<00:01:02.610> one<00:01:02.820> guy

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
would put say or rear seat in one guy

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.090 
would put say or rear seat in one guy
all<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> fantasy<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:03.990> another<00:01:04.199> hide<00:01:04.410> do

all the fantasy do another hide do

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.550 
all the fantasy do another hide do
another<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.360> computer<00:01:06.840> doesn't<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.230> that<00:01:07.410> we

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
another the computer doesn't do that we

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.500 
another the computer doesn't do that we
mark<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> quality<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.400> essence<00:01:08.640> ape<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
mark the quality for essence ape the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.930 
mark the quality for essence ape the
computer<00:01:09.960> scans<00:01:10.320> ax<00:01:10.470> hide<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.430> works<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.820> the

computer scans ax hide and works out the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.360 
computer scans ax hide and works out the
optimum<00:01:12.300> method<00:01:12.420> cutting<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.160> and<00:01:14.160> then<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
optimum method cutting it and then it

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.800 
optimum method cutting it and then it
will<00:01:14.460> cut<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.940> he<00:01:15.000> might<00:01:15.180> put<00:01:15.360> part<00:01:15.750> of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
will cut that so he might put part of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.150 
will cut that so he might put part of
the<00:01:15.870> rear<00:01:16.050> seating<00:01:16.290> one<00:01:16.470> high<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.070> of

Appleseed in the same I mix and match it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.170 
Appleseed in the same I mix and match it
all<00:01:19.710> comes<00:01:19.920> together<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> end

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
all comes together to the end

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.110 
all comes together to the end
when<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> does<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.700> what<00:01:23.700> he<00:01:23.790> doesn't

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
when it does this what he doesn't

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120 
when it does this what he doesn't
actually<00:01:24.300> slightly<00:01:24.840> undersized<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.800> we<00:01:25.950> put

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
actually slightly undersized so we put

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.520 
actually slightly undersized so we put
them<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.310> very<00:01:26.490> very<00:01:26.670> tight<00:01:27.170> we<00:01:28.170> only<00:01:28.350> glue

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
them on very very tight we only glue

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.220 
them on very very tight we only glue
about<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.800> centimeter<00:01:29.370> down<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.760> there<00:01:30.230> move

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
about a centimeter down from there move

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.420 
about a centimeter down from there move
about<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:31.440> centimeter<00:01:31.980> down<00:01:32.100> from<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> middle

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
about a centimeter down from the middle

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.480 
about a centimeter down from the middle
each<00:01:32.850> side<00:01:33.200> turn<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:34.860> cut<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
each side turn it in and then cut with a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.120 
each side turn it in and then cut with a
scalpel<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.000> leave<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> slight<00:01:36.480> gap<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
scalpel and leave a slight gap the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.130 
scalpel and leave a slight gap the
reason<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.520> leave<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> gap<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:39.870> when

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
reason we leave the gap is because when

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.040 
reason we leave the gap is because when
it's<00:01:40.260> only<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.710> such<00:01:40.920> slides<00:01:41.250> together<00:01:41.870> if<00:01:42.870> we

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
it's only do such slides together if we

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.270 
it's only do such slides together if we
were<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.320> accurate<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.220> we

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
were to accurate if you like and we

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
were to accurate if you like and we
didn't<00:01:44.550> if<00:01:45.210> there's<00:01:45.450> no<00:01:45.570> gap<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.900> would<00:01:46.050> tend

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
didn't if there's no gap we would tend

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.490 
didn't if there's no gap we would tend
to<00:01:46.260> rich<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.190> we<00:01:47.220> don't<00:01:47.550> do<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:49.050> computer

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to rich so we don't do that the computer

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.760 
to rich so we don't do that the computer
is<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.620> $200,000<00:01:50.490> computer<00:01:50.910> that<00:01:51.060> does<00:01:51.240> these

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
is a $200,000 computer that does these

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.430 
is a $200,000 computer that does these
it<00:01:52.770> cuts<00:01:53.040> everything<00:01:53.400> perfectly<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.440> it

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
it cuts everything perfectly but it

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.320 
it cuts everything perfectly but it
can't<00:01:55.710> punch<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.010> holes<00:01:56.190> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.369> hide<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
can't punch the holes of the hide the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.530 
can't punch the holes of the hide the
stitching<00:01:58.490> we<00:01:59.490> rejected<00:01:59.940> so<00:02:00.119> my<00:02:00.270> name<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.420> Ahn

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
stitching we rejected so my name is Ahn

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.850 
stitching we rejected so my name is Ahn
soo<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.080> do<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.619> use<00:02:01.740> this

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
soo so what we do now is we use this

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.719 
soo so what we do now is we use this
instead<00:02:03.650> we<00:02:04.650> use<00:02:04.830> this<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:05.220> this<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.460> Bentley

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
instead we use this and this is Bentley

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.730 
instead we use this and this is Bentley
