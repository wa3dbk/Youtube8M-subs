00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:43.430
 God speaks to us through nature and revelation 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:47.110
 through his providence and through 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.110
 influence of silvio 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:56.720
 But this is not enough we must also 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:00.110
 he will open our confidence to have life 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.720
 and spiritual energy we need 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.420
 keep true fellowship with the father 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.310
 heavenly 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:14.270
 prayer is the opening of the heart to God 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.909
 How do you open a friend? 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.570
 not that it is necessary for God 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:26.060
 we know each other but to enable us to 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:30.609
 To receive the prayer does not make God lower the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.439
 we but and it takes us out 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.850
 God is ready to hear the prayer 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.799
 sincere 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.280
 the humblest of his children because 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.039
 should the sons and daughters of God 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.399
 They will be reluctant to times when the 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:52.759
 prayer is the key in the hands of faith to 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.789
 open the deposits of the sky where they are 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:03.109
 stored the limited resources of the 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:06.710
 those who are hungry and thirsty for 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:11.350
 justice there is in her goodbye 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.350
 you can be sure that they will be used 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:20.450
 our great need is for itself 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:25.189
 an argument intercedes in our favor 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.340
 very eloquently but having 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:32.510
 seek the Lord so that He makes these 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.900
 things for us he did not stop 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 to deliver even its own river but 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.719
 offered by all of us 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.900
 if he gave us his son 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:48.609
 will not you also give us for free 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.609
 all things 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.800
 if we keep still in quality in our 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.810
 heart if we cling to a sin 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.630
 conscious 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:09.510
 You will not hear us but the prayer of the 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.510
 repentant and sincere person 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.970
 Jesus said to his disciples when 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.780
 pray and ask for something believe that 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.380
 have already received and if all will be 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.380
 you 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.070
 we are so full of faults and we own 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.800
 a vision so narrow that sometimes 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.130
 we ask things that would not be a blessing 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.980
 for us 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.190
 the heavenly Father lovingly meets 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.110
 prayers giving us what is for us 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.560
 the greater good that which we ourselves 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:59.410
 we would like to be with the Divinely 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.090
 lit the tenth see all things 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.090
 they are reality 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.310
 when our prayers are 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.850
 seemingly unanswered 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.290
 We must cling to the promise, for it will come 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.830
 all right 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.359
 at the time of being met and 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.720
 we will receive the blessing that more 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.490
 needy 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.569
 God is very wise for wrong. 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.240
 do not be afraid of trusting him 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.690
 even if you do not see an immediate response to 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.690
 your prayers 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.690
 but if we come to God convinced of 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.320
 our protection and dependence 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.860
 such as we are and with humble confidence 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.770
 faith we carry our needs that 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.759
 whose knowledge is infinite and that everything 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:04.340
 sees in creation ruling all things 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:09.479
 for his word he can answer 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:15.330
 and shall hearken to our cry, and make light 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:16.740
 will shine in our heart through prayer 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.360
 sincere 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.120
 we are connected with the mind of infinity 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:29.100
 when we ask for mercy and blessings from 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:33.419
 God must have in his heart a spirit 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.699
 of love and forgiveness and hope that our 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.849
 prayers are answered 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:41.759
 we must forgive others in the same way 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:47.370
 and to the same extent that we expect the 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:51.139
 forgiveness of perseverance in prayer is also 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:55.110
 a condition for it to be met 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:59.490
 we should always pray if we want to grow 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:03.330
 in faith and experience but in all 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:08.870
 prayer win God what you need 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.870
 and always order with a thankful heart 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.340
 now in his private room and 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:25.590
 while you do your chores 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:28.920
 daily out and often holy we 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:32.990
 can not beat him that way 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.990
 if god 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:43.180
 no time or places unfit for 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:47.380
 make a prayer to God the door of the heart 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:50.260
 must be constantly open whenever 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:55.630
 asking Jesus to come and dwell in us 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:58.990
 as a celestial guest because some is 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:04.960
 very great for him the worlds inmates 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:08.620
 and directs the universe nothing than some 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:13.229
 way of relating to our peace is so 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.229
 insignificant that he fails to observe 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.900
 not there in our life no chapter 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:24.070
 too obscure so that he can not 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:26.350
 Finally , 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:31.360
 more complicated so that it can 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:33.729
 to resolve any purpose may 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.810
 to surprise the humblest of his 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:37.270
 children 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:40.210
 some anxiety that disturbs the 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:43.870
 phase of spirit no joy that 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:48.520
 may have no sincere prayer that you 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:50.110
 escape of the various yes that is observed 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:55.710
 by heavenly father 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:55.710
 those in which it attracts the immediate beauty 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:04.580
 the relations between God and each person are 

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:07.429
 rhymes as if they were not 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.990
 there was no other because he 

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:10.990
 I have cited
