trillion that's a very big number or you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.430 
trillion that's a very big number or you
might<00:00:32.160> think<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.660> tiny<00:00:33.930> number<00:00:34.050> like

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
might think of a really tiny number like

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.420 
might think of a really tiny number like

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.350 
three two that's 3,200 millions they
both<00:00:43.620> take<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.129> whole<00:00:44.399> lot<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.789> space<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
both take up a whole lot of space as you

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.209 
both take up a whole lot of space as you
can<00:00:45.390> see<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> screen<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.039> mention

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
can see on the screen not to mention

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.709 
can see on the screen not to mention
they're<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> lot<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:47.910> difficult<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.629> work

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
they're a lot more difficult to work

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
they're a lot more difficult to work
with<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.500> were<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.770> long<00:00:50.120> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
with when they were that long just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.400 
with when they were that long just
imagine<00:00:51.539> trying<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.809> multiply<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.289> divide

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
imagine trying to multiply and divide

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.250 
imagine trying to multiply and divide
those<00:00:52.800> numbers<00:00:53.629> so<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.750> why<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.110> use

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
those numbers so that's why we use

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.099 
those numbers so that's why we use
scientific<00:00:55.620> notation<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.850> make<00:00:57.000> things<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.079> bit

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
scientific notation to make things a bit

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
scientific notation to make things a bit
easier<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:59.370> you're<00:00:59.579> dealing<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.879> really

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
easier when you're dealing with really

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
easier when you're dealing with really
really<00:01:00.570> big<00:01:00.840> numbers<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:01.739> really

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
really big numbers or really really

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
really big numbers or really really
small<00:01:02.219> numbers<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.699> course<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.320> bit

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
small numbers of course it can be a bit

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
small numbers of course it can be a bit
confusing<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:05.220> how<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> scientific

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
confusing on how to get the scientific

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.899 
confusing on how to get the scientific
notation<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.650> we'll<00:01:07.830> look<00:01:07.979> at<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.310> step<00:01:08.880> by

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
notation so we'll look at it step by

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.100 
notation so we'll look at it step by
step<00:01:11.000> let's<00:01:12.000> start<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.869> big

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
step let's start with that really big

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.740 
step let's start with that really big
number<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:14.490> how<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.670> figure<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.360> how<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
number and see how to figure out how to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
number and see how to figure out how to
get<00:01:15.960> into<00:01:16.170> scientific<00:01:16.710> notation<00:01:17.090> that's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
get into scientific notation that's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.899 
get into scientific notation that's
three<00:01:18.659> quadrillion<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:20.009> hundred<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.640> two

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
three quadrillion one hundred and two

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.679 
three quadrillion one hundred and two
trillion<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:23.580> first<00:01:23.820> thing<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> real<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.420> do

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
trillion the first thing a real one do

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
trillion the first thing a real one do
is<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.460> write<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.970> first<00:01:27.450> number<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.900> see

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
is to write that first number we see

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.569 
is to write that first number we see
which<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.530> three<00:01:30.619> just<00:01:31.619> after<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> three<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
which is three just after the three to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.429 
which is three just after the three to
the<00:01:32.610> right<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.150> write<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.079> decimal<00:01:34.350> point

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
the right of it write a decimal point

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.080 
the right of it write a decimal point
when<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.530> write<00:01:37.710> scientific<00:01:38.040> notation<00:01:38.729> there

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
when you write scientific notation there

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.859 
when you write scientific notation there
will<00:01:39.240> always<00:01:39.720> only<00:01:39.990> ever<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:42.299> digit

I'm<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.890> gonna<00:01:59.070> keep<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.579> order<00:01:59.899> one

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
I'm just gonna keep going in order one

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
zero is okay because is between a1 and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.670 
zero is okay because is between a1 and
a2<00:02:15.830> all<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.420> rest<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.660> those<00:02:17.750> zeros<00:02:17.990> will

a2 all the rest of those zeros will
ignore<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:19.940> now<00:02:22.000> after<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.120> have<00:02:23.270> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
ignore just for now after we have the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.810 
ignore just for now after we have the
number<00:02:23.810> we'll<00:02:24.050> write<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.260> time<00:02:24.650> sign<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.670> we'll

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
number we'll write a time sign and we'll

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.380 
number we'll write a time sign and we'll
write<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> 10<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:27.790> now<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:28.850> have<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.120> figure<00:02:29.300> out

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
write a 10 and now we have to figure out

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.090 
write a 10 and now we have to figure out
the<00:02:29.600> exponent<00:02:30.140> for<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.500> 10<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.860> that's

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
the exponent for that 10 and that's

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.580 
the exponent for that 10 and that's
where<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.370> zeros<00:02:31.700> matter<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:35.810> one<00:02:36.170> easy<00:02:36.410> way

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
where the zeros matter now one easy way

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.949 
where the zeros matter now one easy way
I<00:02:36.890> found<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.459> do<00:02:37.670> scientific<00:02:38.030> notation<00:02:38.780> for

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
I found to do scientific notation for

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.600 
I found to do scientific notation for
the<00:02:39.020> exponent<00:02:39.470> instead<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.280> saying<00:02:40.430> there<00:02:40.580> and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
the exponent instead of saying there and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.340 
the exponent instead of saying there and
Counting<00:02:41.060> all<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.330> zeros<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> places

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
Counting all the zeros and the places

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.540 
Counting all the zeros and the places
and<00:02:42.380> trying<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.770> figure<00:02:43.010> out<00:02:43.040> where<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.310> stop

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.760 
and trying to figure out where the stop
as<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.600> start<00:02:44.900> with<00:02:45.080> my<00:02:45.200> decimal<00:02:45.560> places

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
as I start with my decimal places

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.210 
as I start with my decimal places
already<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.140> for<00:02:48.140> big<00:02:48.650> numbers<00:02:49.010> it's

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
already and for big numbers it's

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.100 
already and for big numbers it's
invisible<00:02:49.580> we<00:02:49.910> have<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.150> draw<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.540> first<00:02:50.750> and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
invisible we have to draw it first and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.290 
invisible we have to draw it first and
then<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.100> just<00:02:52.280> start<00:02:52.580> moving<00:02:52.940> my<00:02:53.030> decimal

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
then I just start moving my decimal

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.630 
then I just start moving my decimal
place<00:02:53.690> I'm<00:02:54.500> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.770> move<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.250> decimal

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
place I'm going to move the decimal

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.630 
place I'm going to move the decimal
place<00:02:55.790> until<00:02:56.570> it<00:02:56.810> matches<00:02:57.160> where<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.250> decimal

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
place until it matches where the decimal

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.550 
place until it matches where the decimal
place<00:02:58.820> is<00:02:59.060> down<00:02:59.690> here<00:02:59.989> in<00:03:00.080> my<00:03:00.170> scientific

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
place is down here in my scientific

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.010 
place is down here in my scientific
notation<00:03:01.190> I'm<00:03:01.370> going<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.510> count<00:03:02.780> how<00:03:02.989> many

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
notation I'm going to count how many

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.130 
notation I'm going to count how many
times<00:03:03.230> have<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.680> move<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.160> make<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.430> match

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
times have to move it to make it match

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:20.130 
times have to move it to make it match
so<00:03:06.140> there's<00:03:06.470> 1<00:03:07.010> 2<00:03:08.000> 3<00:03:09.549> 4<00:03:10.549> 5<00:03:11.239> 6<00:03:12.670> 7<00:03:13.670> 8<00:03:14.450> 9<00:03:15.850> 10<00:03:16.850> 11<00:03:17.980> 12<00:03:18.980> 13

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
so there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.500 
so there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14<00:03:21.140> 15<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.630> that<00:03:23.860> now<00:03:24.860> matches<00:03:25.519> where<00:03:26.269> it<00:03:26.390> is

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
14 15 and that now matches where it is

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.090 
14 15 and that now matches where it is
down<00:03:26.690> here<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:27.230> match<00:03:27.380> my<00:03:27.590> scientific

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
down here to match my scientific

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.039 
down here to match my scientific
notation<00:03:28.489> rule<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.600> moved<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.080> 15<00:03:30.620> times<00:03:30.980> and

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
notation rule so I moved it 15 times and

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.360 
notation rule so I moved it 15 times and
that's<00:03:33.049> going<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.230> be<00:03:33.320> my<00:03:33.470> exponent<00:03:34.070> for<00:03:34.340> the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
that's going to be my exponent for the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.009 
that's going to be my exponent for the
10<00:03:35.860> so<00:03:36.860> 3<00:03:37.160> quadrillion<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:38.030> hundred<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.900> two

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
10 so 3 quadrillion a hundred and two

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.979 
10 so 3 quadrillion a hundred and two
trillion<00:03:39.590> in<00:03:39.799> scientific<00:03:40.640> notation<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.540> three

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
trillion in scientific notation is three

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.370 
trillion in scientific notation is three
point<00:03:42.530> one<00:03:43.100> zero<00:03:43.510> two<00:03:44.510> times<00:03:45.500> 10<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.040> 15<00:03:47.380> so

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
point one zero two times 10 to the 15 so

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.870 
point one zero two times 10 to the 15 so
let's<00:03:48.560> look<00:03:48.709> at<00:03:48.829> that<00:03:48.920> very<00:03:49.190> tiny<00:03:49.489> number

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
let's look at that very tiny number

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.720 
let's look at that very tiny number
thirty-two<00:03:50.780> hundred<00:03:50.810> million<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.489> same

we<00:03:59.840> still<00:04:00.200> ignore<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.829> zeros<00:04:01.190> unless<00:04:01.670> they're

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
we still ignore the zeros unless they're

we still ignore the zeros unless they're

is<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.380> same<00:04:35.890> exact<00:04:36.280> thing<00:04:36.340> as<00:04:36.640> we<00:04:36.790> did<00:04:36.820> for

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
is the same exact thing as we did for

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.700 
is the same exact thing as we did for
the<00:04:37.300> big<00:04:37.450> numbers<00:04:37.780> we're<00:04:38.050> going<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.260> count<00:04:38.560> the

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
the big numbers we're going to count the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.590 
the big numbers we're going to count the
number<00:04:39.220> of<00:04:39.520> times<00:04:39.610> we<00:04:40.000> had<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.390> move<00:04:40.540> the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
number of times we had to move the

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.140 
number of times we had to move the
decimal<00:04:40.780> place<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:42.550> time<00:04:42.760> we're<00:04:42.940> just<00:04:42.970> going

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
decimal place this time we're just going

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.110 
decimal place this time we're just going
from<00:04:43.480> left<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.960> right<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.580> start<00:04:45.880> where<00:04:46.030> the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
from left to right so start where the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.480 
from left to right so start where the
decimal<00:04:46.300> place<00:04:46.660> is<00:04:46.930> already<00:04:47.230> and<00:04:47.740> start

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
decimal place is already and start

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.750 
decimal place is already and start
counting<00:04:48.670> as<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.180> move<00:04:49.390> spaces<00:04:50.110> 1<00:04:51.090> 2<00:04:52.290> 3<00:04:53.580> 4<00:04:54.690> 5<00:04:55.710> 6

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760

counting as you move spaces 1 2 3 4 5 6
7<00:04:57.760> I'll<00:04:58.560> remove<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.710> until<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.400> decimal<00:05:00.790> place

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
7 I'll remove it until the decimal place

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.110 
7 I'll remove it until the decimal place
matches<00:05:01.660> our<00:05:02.730> decimal<00:05:03.730> place<00:05:03.760> in<00:05:04.090> the

matches our decimal place in the
scientific<00:05:04.750> notation<00:05:05.230> we<00:05:05.470> moved<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.610> 7<00:05:07.150> times

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
scientific notation we moved it 7 times

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.310 
scientific notation we moved it 7 times
the<00:05:09.220> only<00:05:09.340> difference<00:05:09.850> here<00:05:09.940> for<00:05:10.510> doing<00:05:10.930> a

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
the only difference here for doing a

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.430 
the only difference here for doing a
very<00:05:11.950> tiny<00:05:12.280> number<00:05:12.400> is<00:05:12.850> the<00:05:13.690> exponent<00:05:14.320> is

very tiny number is the exponent is

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.940 
very tiny number is the exponent is
negative<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:16.390> let<00:05:16.570> us<00:05:16.690> know<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:17.620> we're<00:05:17.800> going

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
negative to let us know that we're going

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.620 
negative to let us know that we're going
in<00:05:18.250> that<00:05:18.790> direction<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:22.590> 3,200<00:05:23.590> millions<00:05:24.220> and

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
in that direction so 3,200 millions and

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.130 
in that direction so 3,200 millions and
scientific<00:05:25.630> notation<00:05:26.080> is<00:05:26.680> 3.2<00:05:27.430> times<00:05:28.120> 10<00:05:28.510> to

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
the negative 7 already let's see if we

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.930 
the negative 7 already let's see if we
can<00:05:34.960> go<00:05:35.169> from<00:05:35.380> scientific<00:05:36.010> notation<00:05:36.040> back<00:05:36.730> to

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
can go from scientific notation back to

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.560 
can go from scientific notation back to
standard<00:05:37.419> form<00:05:38.160> but<00:05:39.160> look<00:05:39.550> for<00:05:39.730> part<00:05:39.970> two<00:05:40.150> to

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
standard form but look for part two to
