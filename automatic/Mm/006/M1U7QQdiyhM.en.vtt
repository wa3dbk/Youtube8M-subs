00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.760
 so my dear today i have again 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:12.000
 make a new recipe video and that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.490
 Today we stuffed spitz paprika with 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.710
 cheese and that too in low carb 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.670
 version so that's really right 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.560
 fast is inexpensive so for the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.740
 narrow purse 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.510
 it is so delicious and it makes you feel full and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.250
 I show you this recipe from this 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.929
 reason because I always many after 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.700
 ask for this recipe 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.820
 I always feel everything in the world 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.739
 infobox but I thought so since that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.870
 recipe so it really is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.969
 we're doing that today for that good 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.829
 together it is really easy 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:52.110
 and let's go we need spiky peppers 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:58.770
 is also around 130 currently here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:03.750
 are now 14 I am always between 6 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.610
 7 and 8 pieces in there and I'm 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.200
 So people do a portion there 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.570
 that is, always half to three 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.040
 four pieces for one serving and if you are 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.229
 two portions makes the animal easy 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.090
 the whole spitz paprika we would like 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.530
 that I'm doing a portion today 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.270
 tomorrow I'll do the other one 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.009
 that's why we only need three now 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.909
 or four peppers that is always half 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:28.770
 From this we need four dances 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.070
 grated cheese I'm taking in the agrana 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.009
 pagano because he really no 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.079
 carbohydrates thus has exactly ghana off 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.360
 has no carbohydrates tastes very much 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.790
 delicious and the advantage of this cheese 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.890
 is he holding on so long when you're the one 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.409
 packing on power and putting it in the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.270
 this is not possible 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.979
 two to three days or so fast 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.570
 broken like normal grated cheese are 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.520
 It really lasts forever 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.799
 fridge and I like that very much 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.860
 That's why I only have good cheese 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.130
 no pagano yet 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.469
 then we need another onion 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.870
 or half for one 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.509
 portion 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.250
 We also need garlic oil 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.120
 link below in the info box 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.160
 where you order garlic can you 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.660
 could of course also take normal oil 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.640
 eg olive oil 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.640
 I always do that with garlic oil 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.880
 because that tastes particularly delicious and 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.250
 Lastly, we need mixed 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.320
 Herbs and her child accept that you 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.480
 you want to be able to take fresh herbs 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.670
 I always take these eight herbs 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.700
 you get at aldi in the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.700
 Frozen department so deep frozen and 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.830
 yes start 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.780
 the
