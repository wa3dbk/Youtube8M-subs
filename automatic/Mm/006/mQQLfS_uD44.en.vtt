other side and then feel free to run up

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.260 
other side and then feel free to run up
here<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.680> mean<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.340> slow<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
here I mean it's a little slow but I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.020 
here I mean it's a little slow but I
guess<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.750> faster<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> end<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.040> don't

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
guess it's faster in the end and don't

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.639 
guess it's faster in the end and don't
think<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.540> cheating<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:58.200> we're

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
think of this as cheating because we're

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.280 
think of this as cheating because we're
running<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.610> steep<00:02:00.450> hill<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.719> mean<00:02:00.960> cupola

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
running up a steep hill I mean cupola

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.600 
running up a steep hill I mean cupola
quick<00:02:01.439> does<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.829> too<00:02:02.009> he<00:02:02.130> runs<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
quick does that too he runs it like a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.179 
quick does that too he runs it like a
friggin<00:02:03.060> wall<00:02:03.810> whatever<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.890> then<00:02:05.040> when<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
friggin wall whatever and then when I

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.620 
friggin wall whatever and then when I
jump<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:05.850> we'll<00:02:06.030> see<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.270> teleport

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
jump in here we'll see you can teleport

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.199 
jump in here we'll see you can teleport

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
flagpole to complete it I believe you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.910 
flagpole to complete it I believe you
need<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.329> get<00:02:24.569> up<00:02:24.689> here<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.079> a<00:02:25.200> minute<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.620> 20

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
need to get up here in a minute in 20

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.069 
need to get up here in a minute in 20
seconds<00:02:26.250> or<00:02:26.400> less<00:02:26.579> so<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.939> feed<00:02:27.150> him<00:02:27.359> anyway

I guess you can say you're not battling
him<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.219> can<00:02:32.310> do<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.459> little<00:02:32.639> victory<00:02:32.969> dance<00:02:33.000> do

whatever you want

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.459 
whatever you want
climb<00:02:35.189> on<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.519> flagpole<00:02:35.760> just<00:02:36.389> just<00:02:37.260> do

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
climb on the flagpole just just do

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.259 
climb on the flagpole just just do
whatever<00:02:37.709> now<00:02:38.579> I<00:02:38.609> know<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.939> isn't<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
whatever now I know this isn't the

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.910 
whatever now I know this isn't the
fastest<00:02:39.719> time<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.079> world<00:02:40.349> but<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.560> think

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
fastest time in the world but I think

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.990 
fastest time in the world but I think
it's<00:02:41.459> relatively<00:02:41.909> decent<00:02:43.370> yeah<00:02:44.370> whatever

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
it's relatively decent yeah whatever

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.559 
it's relatively decent yeah whatever
okay

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
okay

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.479 
okay
and<00:02:46.109> with<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.680> don't<00:02:46.950> give<00:02:47.040> us<00:02:47.159> our<00:02:47.280> power

star so go ahead and grab it and then

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.080 
star so go ahead and grab it and then
power<00:02:52.049> star<00:02:52.439> obtain<00:02:53.010> yeah<00:02:55.310> all<00:02:56.310> right<00:02:56.579> this

silver stars or both this level has a
Silver<00:03:17.940> Stars<00:03:18.180> mission<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.629> basically<00:03:18.959> you

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
Silver Stars mission and basically you

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:20.809 
Silver Stars mission and basically you
just<00:03:19.260> have<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.530> get<00:03:19.650> five<00:03:19.859> silver<00:03:20.250> stars<00:03:20.519> and

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
just have to get five silver stars and

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.909 
just have to get five silver stars and
the<00:03:20.940> easiest<00:03:21.780> thing<00:03:21.900> about<00:03:22.199> this<00:03:22.409> is<00:03:22.530> also<00:03:22.680> the

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
the easiest thing about this is also the

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.300 
the easiest thing about this is also the
hardest<00:03:23.129> thing<00:03:23.819> about<00:03:23.849> it<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.959> stars<00:03:25.310> will

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
hardest thing about it the stars will

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.589 
hardest thing about it the stars will
move<00:03:26.689> so<00:03:27.689> basically<00:03:28.459> it's<00:03:29.459> easy<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.479> the<00:03:30.569> sense

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
move so basically it's easy in the sense

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.270 
move so basically it's easy in the sense
that<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:30.989> can<00:03:31.139> have<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> star<00:03:31.590> come<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.949> you<00:03:32.069> but

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
that you can have a star come to you but

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.229 
that you can have a star come to you but
it's<00:03:32.400> hard<00:03:32.579> in<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.729> sense<00:03:32.909> that<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.180> to

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
it's hard in the sense that you have to

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.159 
it's hard in the sense that you have to
chase<00:03:33.449> after<00:03:33.659> it<00:03:34.019> any<00:03:34.949> who<00:03:35.159> just<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:37.019> can<00:03:37.139> see

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
chase after it any who just you can see

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.839 
chase after it any who just you can see
your<00:03:37.409> silver<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.979> can<00:03:38.069> see<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.340> silver<00:03:38.549> stars

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
your silver you can see the silver stars

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.460 
your silver you can see the silver stars
in<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.090> map<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:39.509> see<00:03:39.689> one<00:03:39.900> over<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.349> the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
in the map and I see one over to the
