see the jawbone doesn't fit quite
perfectly<00:00:47.540> this<00:00:48.020> is<00:00:48.170> because<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.800> metal<00:00:49.130> bar

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
perfectly this is because the metal bar

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.340 
perfectly this is because the metal bar
is<00:00:49.460> used<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.090> hold<00:00:50.210> it<00:00:50.450> on<00:00:50.630> to<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.930> ear<00:00:51.200> and

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
because the bud is not quite the right

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.440 
because the bud is not quite the right
size<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.190> what<00:00:55.580> you'll<00:00:55.730> see<00:00:55.910> is<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.210> as

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
size and what you'll see is that as

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.700 
size and what you'll see is that as
you're<00:00:56.690> in<00:00:56.809> a<00:00:56.870> loud<00:00:57.020> environment<00:00:57.050> you'll

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
you're in a loud environment you'll

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.710 
you're in a loud environment you'll
actually<00:00:57.890> push<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.489> jaw<00:00:58.670> bone<00:00:58.910> into<00:00:59.330> the<00:00:59.480> ear

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
actually push the jaw bone into the ear

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.390 
actually push the jaw bone into the ear
to<00:01:00.080> make<00:01:00.230> a<00:01:00.260> better<00:01:00.530> seal<00:01:00.860> so<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:01.250> can

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
to make a better seal so that you can

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.060 
to make a better seal so that you can
hear<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:01.699> conversation<00:01:02.330> better<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.920> is

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
hear the conversation better and that is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.130 
hear the conversation better and that is
why<00:01:04.220> we<00:01:04.519> created<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:05.030> custom<00:01:05.449> molded<00:01:05.720> adapter

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
why we created the custom molded adapter

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.830 
why we created the custom molded adapter
for<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.410> jawbone<00:01:07.150> to<00:01:08.150> get<00:01:08.300> one<00:01:08.480> all<00:01:08.600> we<00:01:08.690> need

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
for the jawbone to get one all we need

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.570 
for the jawbone to get one all we need
is<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.080> impression<00:01:09.320> of<00:01:09.590> your<00:01:09.740> ear<00:01:09.980> which<00:01:10.370> our
