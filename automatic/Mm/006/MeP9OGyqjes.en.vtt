 of the video I come to inform you about the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.670
 cj vacations and suites because let's see 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:27.260

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.770

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.440

 excited makes you sick that you do not get the part 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.460
 5 do not take it 7 legal when you take the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.260
 part 5 and the fifth part see how much 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.900
 you made part 4 of the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.650
 cj and suite vacations we want the 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.650
 fifth part 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.850
 ah 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.310
 very good start and you have not 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.370
 I've done a fifth of the 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.070
 cj vacations and suites that's true 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.280
 but there are things that you do not have in 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.940
 mind I also have life or I have 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.860
 to study help at home and so on 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.050
 to the point that I want to get is that everything 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.030
 this has its time and unfortunately 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.420
 it leaves me very little to be in the pc 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.700
 speaking more exactly about two hours I have 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.130
 taken this time to explain what 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.930
 happens with the series really the problem 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.020
 it's not the people who ask me for the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.270
 fifth part but that I am always 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.119
 when I have a time to do it 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.680
 I do it because it's because the fucked up 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.009
 series I did not do a script like 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.899
 corresponds the four chapters are 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.570
 product of what I can think of in the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.700
 head but it's all in memory and I do not write down 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.030
 nothing for that reason the series is taking 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.250
 so much recently I had time to think 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.009
 how to follow it and I have everything planned 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.069
 until how it will end but there is something that 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.659
 it prevents me from doing it faster as you will know 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.240
 this series is based on the 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.609
 and so that I have humor I have to think 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.579
 a lot and that's what delays me a lot 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:09.179
 I have explained the problem 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.590
 they will know what the situation of the series is 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.660
 What I ask all of you is that you do not 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.910
 write stupid things like this 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.220
 hey pee fucking when fuck 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.830

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.810
 I will answer since in this video I explain 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.500
 all you need to know about 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.660
 the series when it will come out I still do not know 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 but to see what I'm doing to him 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.989

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.730
