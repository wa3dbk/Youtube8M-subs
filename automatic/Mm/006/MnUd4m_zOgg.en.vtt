00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:14.929
 first stage 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.089
 the first sugar cube first mechanical actions 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.579
 or putty 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.710
 and then chemical 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 the piece of sugar and say everything in the room 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.390
 once sucrose they can go 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.599
 it goes into the digestive system 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.350
 it does not undergo transformation in the stomach 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.820
 because it is already if we realize in the small intestine 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.070
 on the walls of this act is a little too particular cells 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.580
 in earth too 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.690
 they are in contact with food and his responsible for censorship of 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.280
 nutrients in the body 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.750
 their walls and bent back into the subway but they left 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.750
 quick increases the contact area with food 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.830
 sucrose and talent ap sorbet in this cell 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.790
 digest and cut by our factories 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.390
 the green 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.970
 she snacks it two smaller molecules 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.880
 who are the successful and the photographer 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.470
 glaucoma and the title I most used in the camp 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.040
 in the blood vessels 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.930
 in the cell of the small intestine about 25% of the fructose and converted into 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.760
 glucose 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.450
 the rest continues to be metabolized by other pathways 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.450
 it is the blood vessels that are the young people who are looking for them 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.960
 km a Tunisian family directly into the body 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.610
 it was necessary to give energy 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.460
 as many years 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.760
 but before 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.270
 he must be stopped 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.490
 karfa presence in the body must be constant 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.580
 this is where the liver comes in 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.650
 its role and retain excess glucose after significant intake 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.020
 and to release him 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.770
 during youth periods 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.370
 so that blood sugar 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.780
 the level of glucose in the blood 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.230
 remains constant 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.419
 and equal to its normal value 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.379
 about ingram paris 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.029
 it's the pancreas 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.029
 informs the point about the role he has to play 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.799
 so at the time orf glucose supplier 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.079
 and that thanks to the feline 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.559
 who makes during digestion 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.589
 the cause is stored in the liver 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:29.769
 his influence 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.419
 insulin 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.580
 in form 2 dj 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.710
 courchesne 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.579
 indeed 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.519
 glucose can only be a short stay in the liver 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.290
 when the blood glucose at the weight entry is greater than the value 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.439
 par 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.349
 and as needed 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.920
 a part of the glucose that is immediately restarted in the bloodstream 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.579
 absorbed by liver cells 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.599
 to transform it embellished cojep 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.179
 in the meal interval 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.409
 glucose that had been stored in the liver 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.449
 during the previous meal 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:05.719
 and released 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.450
 to provide energy 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.339
 in the heart of the body 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.339
 according to his needs 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.669
 the main htc-highroad runner 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.139
 transport them to the ardennes for now 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.540
 all benefit 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.859
 but some of them 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.429
 have special needs 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:31.569
 let's take the example of the brain 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.439
 which is made up of nerve cells or the neuron 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.149
 these cells are ready and active and Saturday but it's selling 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:43.619
 glucose and the only fuel that can be used by the brain 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.889
 which suddenly when we consume a lot 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.349
 is it totally 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.659
 the brain weighs 2% of the total weight of the human body 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.539
 but consume six months 100% of the glucose present in the body 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:01.199
 muscles one can also need energy needed actively from 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.259
 glucose for their operation 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:06.079
 it is primarily to use in intense efforts 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.099
 for a short time so far I can not glop but also in the 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.849
 moderate efforts 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.579
 over long periods 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.519
 for endurance 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.730
 outside periods of effort 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.250
 the muscles stock a little glucose 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.250
 as glycogen 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.319
 the important points when traveling in the nails 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.230
 especially sucrose and especially transformed 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.230
 in addition to the inhabitants in the vegetative cycle 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.169
 power and to conclude 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.439
 its responsible for regulating the level of glucose in the blood 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.050
 the muscles and the brain are the main users dispose in 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.969
 the body 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:52.960
 see you soon 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.960
 on new tourist areas 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.050
 stingy 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.589
 hunt 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.240
 who
