00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
it but that's not the case for me and I

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.770 
it but that's not the case for me and I

to<00:03:28.540> have<00:03:28.870> but<00:03:29.200> that's<00:03:29.410> fine<00:03:29.680> because<00:03:29.739> it's

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
to have but that's fine because it's

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.089 
to have but that's fine because it's
it's<00:03:31.450> not<00:03:31.720> very<00:03:32.709> noticeable<00:03:34.080> if<00:03:35.080> you<00:03:35.470> get<00:03:35.620> some

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
it's not very noticeable if you get some

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.670 
it's not very noticeable if you get some
wrinkling<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.940> we<00:03:37.390> hear<00:03:37.599> my<00:03:37.750> Whitney<00:03:37.959> okay<00:03:38.500> if

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
wrinkling and we hear my Whitney okay if

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.009 
wrinkling and we hear my Whitney okay if
you<00:03:38.830> get<00:03:38.950> some<00:03:39.250> wrinkling<00:03:39.880> then<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.870> can

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
you get some wrinkling then you can

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.289 
you get some wrinkling then you can
smooth<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.500> out<00:03:41.620> with<00:03:41.799> your<00:03:41.980> hand<00:03:42.250> if<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:43.180> gets

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
smooth it out with your hand if it gets

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.530 
smooth it out with your hand if it gets
too<00:03:43.630> bad<00:03:43.810> for<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.290> then<00:03:45.069> I<00:03:45.610> suggest<00:03:45.730> just
