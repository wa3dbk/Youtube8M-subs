00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 welcome friends of your cake that in 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.410
 this time I want to show you with a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.000
 Linux distribution very suitable for 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.650
 replace windows xp on machines with 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.799
 low resources I found a 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.410
 very light distribution and very very 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.720
 suitable for these situations the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.359
 distribution 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.480
 q is 42 on this page can be found 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.899
 the download links although it's not a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.510
 Large or robust distribution is more 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.820
 they are still in beta phases but 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.890
 You can try and work for use 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.140
 daily on this page you can find 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.000
 in the download section the version 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.670
 for 32 bits 313 megs and 64 bits in 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.610
 reality is very light and you can record it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.030
 on a cd or dvd or on a flash memory 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.580
 to install it I also downloaded the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.559
 additional software is not does not have many 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.049
 applications in fact is a 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.780
 distribution that is in the beginning but 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.909
 quite promising for example just 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.520
 clicking on this google link 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.909
 chrome downloads a file and you can 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.130
 give install and automatically you will have 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.310
 chrome like in this case native to 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.920
 linux also firefox which is actually 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 eyes wiesel since there is no firefox 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.670
 native for linux 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 ice with an but with the same 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.950
 functionalities that firefox also you 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.970
 recommend that you download that this 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.179
 free office a suite completely 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.399
 compatible with microsoft office has 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.700
 programs to write documents 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.509
 It works well 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.079
 your spreadsheet as excel impress 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.810
 which is a powerpoint and even a base 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:54.280
 of data as access in microsoft office 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.740
 It is 100% compatible also to install 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.329
 more applications these are the only ones 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.610
 that they have developed for that 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.240
 distribution but you can download this 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.700
 program that is apps to install 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.849
 programs from the repository of well 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.099
 I have it installed here already 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.680
 package manager obviously for 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.790
 movements in the system you have to 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.840
 use a superuser account and 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.840
 works the same as in a distribution 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.360
 from debian you can search here for your 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.610
 program and install it if there is any 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.470
 program or additional package that 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.250
 you need, I 'm going to mark it and you give it 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.319
 mark 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.579
 then you give it to apply and it will be installed 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.579
 and you will have the program 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.450
 they also recommend you to install wine 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.350
 to install native applications of 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.840
 windows i did it we have 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.360
 wine and we can play here in the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.760
 configuration this allowed me to install 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.310
 microsoft office of windows obviously 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.050
 for being a light distribution and for 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.910
 settle in old machines because I 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.690
 I recommend that you use versions of 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.690
 office as 2007 2003 no more recent 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.270
 because it will also be counterproductive 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.630
 works well you can even install in 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.300
 the desktop shortcut icons 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.640
 for example excel with the button 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.640
 right we add this element to the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.160
 desk and we were left here is 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.350
 quite easy to install applications 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.090
 download the file of any program 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.470
 double click and you're ready 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.060
 installation instructions as if 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.410
 you were in windows it made me very 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.260
 interesting the way it is 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.840
 distributed its start menu is very 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.880
 ordered very simple has for example in 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.670
 preferences somewhat similar to the panel 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.620
 control where all the aspects that 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.300
 they have to see the appearance of 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.580
 you can find them here 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.490
 to notes that here for example I have the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.340
 windows icon are there in the panel 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.220
 control on the desk in bread 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.430
 here in this menu tab you can 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.219
 change the start menu 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.109
 I have others you could even leave one of 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:05.170
 but this is where I changed 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:09.909
 I looked for my windows logo and I opened it 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.980
 and apply and I'm staying here so I do not 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:15.430
 it's very complicated just to give it a 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.530
 different subject the right button that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.810
 comes to other options for example to 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.000
 control panel the configuration of the 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.150
 desktop if you do it on a file 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.310
 its properties cut move or rename 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.830
 It has all the functions the most 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.990
 similar to windows xp it makes me very 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.180
 very good you can install it in Spanish 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.150
 without much problem the installation to 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.520
 start you choose the language and the first 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.770
 start of the system will ask you 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.410
 what do you install to update in that language and 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.370
 you have most of the Spanish 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.960
 the settings remain in Spanish 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.320
 for example in the control panel if 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.229
 we would like to see some peripherals 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.910
 training on peripherals 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.340
 devices all your partitions all 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.260
 the menus are in Spanish 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.710
 then it became very easy for me 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.530
 promising this album 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.230
 and it runs very fluid and it's very fast 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.480
 I hope that if there is someone interested what 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.460
 manifest and can teach them how 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.160
 install and revive some machine that already 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.320
 is destined for recycling with this 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.450
 operating system you can give some 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.910
 years more of life I hope that they have 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.910
 liked and see you in the next
