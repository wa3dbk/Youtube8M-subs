well<00:00:01.439> since<00:00:01.650> we're<00:00:01.829> on<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:02.040> subject<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.520> trees

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.080 
well since we're on the subject of trees

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.180 
well since we're on the subject of trees
there's<00:00:04.080> also<00:00:04.230> some<00:00:04.560> things<00:00:04.710> that<00:00:04.830> we<00:00:04.980> need<00:00:05.100> to

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
there's also some things that we need to

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.980 
there's also some things that we need to
be<00:00:05.310> doing<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.060> fruit<00:00:06.359> orchard<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:06.930> I

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
be doing in the fruit orchard and I

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.750 
be doing in the fruit orchard and I
think<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.379> time<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:08.010> spend<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.550> there

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
think the time that you spend in there

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.490 
think the time that you spend in there
this<00:00:09.000> fall<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.570> give<00:00:09.750> some<00:00:09.929> protection

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
this fall to give some protection

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.799 
this fall to give some protection
against<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.480> problems<00:00:12.480> associated

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
against some of the problems associated

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.950 
against some of the problems associated
with<00:00:13.230> winter<00:00:13.769> will<00:00:13.950> pay<00:00:14.849> off<00:00:15.030> are<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.330> welcome

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
with winter will pay off are you welcome

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.380 
with winter will pay off are you welcome
next<00:00:16.170> spring<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.980> some<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.730> these<00:00:17.850> tips<00:00:18.150> not

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
next spring and some of these tips not

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.120 
next spring and some of these tips not
only<00:00:18.449> apply<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.170> fruit<00:00:19.470> trees<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:19.949> also

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
only apply to the fruit trees but also

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.060 
only apply to the fruit trees but also
to<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.609> young<00:00:20.880> then<00:00:21.480> barked<00:00:21.930> trees<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.920> your

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.179 
to the young then barked trees in your
landscape<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:23.970> also<00:00:24.150> keep<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.019> mind<00:00:25.289> one

of the things we find in the wintertime
in<00:00:27.930> Oklahoma<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.890> some<00:00:29.099> days<00:00:29.340> if

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
in Oklahoma is that we have some days if

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.870 
in Oklahoma is that we have some days if
we<00:00:29.699> serve<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:30.119> very<00:00:30.330> bright<00:00:30.660> Sun<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.880> in

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
we serve some very bright Sun and in

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.670 
we serve some very bright Sun and in
addition<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.390> some<00:00:33.750> very<00:00:33.960> cold<00:00:34.320> nights

this change in temperature on the bark
of<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.250> tree<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.879> cause<00:00:39.090> severe<00:00:39.899> damage<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.680> the

of a tree can cause severe damage in the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.670 
of a tree can cause severe damage in the
form<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.700> winter<00:00:42.090> injury<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> ways<00:00:43.649> to

form of winter injury one of the ways to
protect<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.730> through<00:00:44.969> wrapping<00:00:45.480> the

help to reflect the heat of the Sun and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.050 
help to reflect the heat of the Sun and
also<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.829> course<00:01:31.860> give<00:01:32.220> protection<00:01:32.759> against

the rodent damage now one of the other

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
the rodent damage now one of the other
problems<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.689> may<00:01:36.869> find<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.530> some<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.100> our

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
problems we may find with some of our

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.719 
problems we may find with some of our
trees<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.110> winter<00:01:40.110> time<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.220> rodents

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
trees in the winter time is that rodents

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
trees in the winter time is that rodents
also<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.479> bury<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> mulch<00:01:43.170> around

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
also like to bury in the mulch around

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
also like to bury in the mulch around
the<00:01:43.770> tree<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> woody<00:01:45.270> mulch

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the tree so if you have a woody mulch

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.179 
the tree so if you have a woody mulch
around<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.140> trees<00:01:46.470> either<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
around your trees either in the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.950 
around your trees either in the
landscape<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> orchard<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> form

tight tearing it off and then coming

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.780 
tight tearing it off and then coming

back in and folding it over and stuffing
it<00:05:12.090> down<00:05:12.120> in<00:05:15.200> do<00:05:16.200> that<00:05:16.440> toss<00:05:16.800> with<00:05:17.010> that<00:05:17.160> last

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
it down in do that toss with that last

it down in do that toss with that last
route<00:05:23.960> toward<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.110> little<00:05:25.260> bit<00:05:25.410> there

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860

route toward it a little bit there
but<00:05:26.670> that<00:05:26.970> won't<00:05:27.120> matter<00:05:27.330> too<00:05:27.600> much<00:05:27.630> because<00:05:28.080> I

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
but that won't matter too much because I

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.760 
but that won't matter too much because I
could<00:05:28.380> still<00:05:28.470> come<00:05:28.890> in<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.280> fold<00:05:30.120> this<00:05:30.300> over

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
could still come in and fold this over

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.310 
could still come in and fold this over
and<00:05:31.770> stick<00:05:32.040> it<00:05:32.160> down<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.210> wrap<00:05:33.420> just<00:05:33.960> above

and stick it down to the wrap just above

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.510 
and stick it down to the wrap just above
that<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:34.950> even<00:05:35.670> to<00:05:35.760> make<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.030> more<00:05:36.240> secure

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
that and even to make it more secure

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.970 
that and even to make it more secure
masking<00:05:38.520> tape<00:05:38.790> would<00:05:39.030> work<00:05:39.620> to<00:05:40.620> hold<00:05:40.830> it

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
masking tape would work to hold it

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.040 
masking tape would work to hold it
secure<00:05:41.400> but<00:05:41.940> now<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.270> I've<00:05:42.360> got<00:05:42.630> it<00:05:42.810> nice<00:05:42.990> and

tidy and stuffed in the top it's going

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.640 
tidy and stuffed in the top it's going
