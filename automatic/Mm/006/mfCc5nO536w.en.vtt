00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.250 
I think I should have replaced Santi
Cazorla<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.720> doesn't<00:01:09.930> fit<00:01:10.170> my

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
is still getting the upper hand and why

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.050 
is still getting the upper hand and why
why<00:03:49.560> because<00:03:49.799> he<00:03:50.100> was<00:03:50.220> key<00:03:50.459> kept<00:03:50.670> pressuring

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
why because he was key kept pressuring

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.580 
why because he was key kept pressuring
and<00:03:51.239> he<00:03:51.299> had<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.480> very<00:03:51.720> attack<00:03:52.049> information

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590

strong and he gets another goal this was

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.370 
strong and he gets another goal this was
such<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.220> tight<00:04:11.670> game<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.209> i<00:04:12.750> couldn't<00:04:13.139> score

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
until he did and that was really

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.539 
until he did and that was really
frustrating<00:04:16.169> but<00:04:16.530> we<00:04:16.709> have<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:17.100> make<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.280> change

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.000 
should I could have definitely won that
game<00:04:51.390> if<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:51.840> played<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.410> little<00:04:52.620> bit<00:04:52.860> more

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010

to a good opponent so I'm not too bitter
about<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.480> but<00:04:58.170> as<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.830> was<00:04:58.860> saying<00:04:59.190> as<00:04:59.430> we

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
about that but as I was saying as we

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.220 
about that but as I was saying as we
opened<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.120> three<00:05:00.390> pack<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.900> we<00:05:01.020> earn<00:05:01.200> from

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
opened the three pack that we earn from

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.960 
opened the three pack that we earn from
this<00:05:01.590> matches<00:05:02.100> for<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.340> sake<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.820> rose

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
this matches for the sake of the rose

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.660 
this matches for the sake of the rose
I'm<00:05:03.270> going<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.050> tell<00:05:04.260> you<00:05:04.290> why<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.550> the

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
I'm going to tell you why this is the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.550 
I'm going to tell you why this is the
last<00:05:05.700> one<00:05:06.090> because<00:05:06.420> I<00:05:06.480> would<00:05:06.780> rather<00:05:06.810> focus<00:05:07.230> on

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
last one because I would rather focus on

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.200 
last one because I would rather focus on
my<00:05:07.740> main<00:05:08.130> series<00:05:08.460> might<00:05:08.610> become<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.910> legend

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
my main series might become a legend

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.230 
my main series might become a legend
fifa<00:05:09.480> world<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:09.960> be<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.530> pro<00:05:10.710> career<00:05:10.980> mode

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
fifa world and be a pro career mode

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.370 
fifa world and be a pro career mode
because<00:05:12.240> there's<00:05:12.630> only<00:05:12.750> two<00:05:13.200> months

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
because there's only two months

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.880
