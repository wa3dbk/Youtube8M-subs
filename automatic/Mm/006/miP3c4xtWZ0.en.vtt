bring you in an overlooked and trying to

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.160 
bring you in an overlooked and trying to
keep<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.390> way<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> light<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:27.930> trying<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
keep out the way the light I'm trying to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.109 
keep out the way the light I'm trying to
work<00:00:28.289> out<00:00:28.529> how<00:00:28.740> I'm<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.130> doing<00:00:29.310> all

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
work out how I'm going to be doing all

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.830 
work out how I'm going to be doing all
of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.449> looping<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.990> everything<00:00:32.630> really<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
of the looping and everything really I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.979 
of the looping and everything really I
should<00:00:34.350> turn<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.520> cpu<00:00:35.940> block<00:00:35.969> round<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.840> make

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
should turn the cpu block round to make

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.479 
should turn the cpu block round to make
it<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.290> tidier<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> want<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.219> keep<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it a bit tidier but I want to keep the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
it a bit tidier but I want to keep the
Alpha<00:00:38.760> cool<00:00:38.969> logo<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> right<00:00:39.719> way<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.079> because

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
Alpha cool logo the right way up because

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.500 
Alpha cool logo the right way up because
this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> inlet<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.940> I'd<00:00:42.120> had<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this is the inlet and if I'd had the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
this is the inlet and if I'd had the
inlet<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.870> top<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.710> would<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:43.950> used

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
inlet on the top then I would have used

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.880 
inlet on the top then I would have used
the<00:00:44.250> 90<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.000> come<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.570> way<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.770> then

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the 90 to come out this way and then

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.650 
the 90 to come out this way and then
come<00:00:47.129> round<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.550> radiator<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
come round to the radiator because as it

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.029 
come round to the radiator because as it
stands<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.320> moment<00:00:49.410> we've<00:00:49.800> got<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
stands at the moment we've got the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.430 
stands at the moment we've got the
reservoir<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> then<00:00:51.449> what<00:00:51.899> we're<00:00:52.050> doing<00:00:52.320> is

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
reservoir and then what we're doing is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.040 
reservoir and then what we're doing is
having<00:00:54.680> reservoir<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:56.510> point<00:00:57.510> camerata

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
having reservoir out point camerata

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.369 
having reservoir out point camerata
reservoir<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:59.300> down<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> pump<00:01:00.809> which<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
reservoir out down to the pump which is

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.880 
reservoir out down to the pump which is
hidden<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.579> their<00:01:02.609> trust<00:01:03.270> me<00:01:03.500> reservoir<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
hidden in their trust me reservoir and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.960 
hidden in their trust me reservoir and
pump<00:01:05.810> pump<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:07.049> into<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.520> side<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
pump pump up into this side of the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.929 
pump pump up into this side of the
radiator<00:01:10.070> obviously<00:01:11.070> gets<00:01:11.250> cold<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.790> then

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
radiator obviously gets cold and then

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.359 
radiator obviously gets cold and then
comes<00:01:12.150> out<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.630> side<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> radiator<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
comes out this side of the radiator it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.840 
comes out this side of the radiator it
comes<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> cpu<00:01:16.009> cpu<00:01:17.009> comes<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
comes down to the cpu cpu comes out and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
comes down to the cpu cpu comes out and
goes<00:01:17.970> down<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.390> graphics<00:01:18.750> card<00:01:19.020> graphics<00:01:19.950> card

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
goes down to graphics card graphics card

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.740 
goes down to graphics card graphics card
comes<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.270> will<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> loop

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
comes out and then there will be a loop

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
comes out and then there will be a loop
coming<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.700> into<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
coming up here going back into the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690 
coming up here going back into the
reservoir<00:01:24.780> again<00:01:25.380> nice<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> simple<00:01:26.280> loop

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
reservoir again nice and simple loop

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.179 
reservoir again nice and simple loop
I've<00:01:27.570> put<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> radio<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.409> reini<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:29.070> I've

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I've put the radio that reini out I've

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.719 
I've put the radio that reini out I've
put<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.840> pump<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.259> driveways<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.250> help<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
put the pump in the driveways to help it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
put the pump in the driveways to help it
keep<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.329> bit<00:01:33.540> tidy<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
keep that little bit tidy because if I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.490 
keep that little bit tidy because if I
had<00:01:35.159> put<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> pump<00:01:35.640> down<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> floor<00:01:36.540> then

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
had put the pump down in the floor then

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
had put the pump down in the floor then
you<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.770> had<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.549> much<00:01:39.210> bigger

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you would have had all the much bigger

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.480 
you would have had all the much bigger
loop<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.259> way<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.829> keep<00:01:40.979> quite<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> few

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
loop so this way I can keep quite a few

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.219 
loop so this way I can keep quite a few
column<00:01:41.850> interchanges<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.720> between<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
column interchanges in between the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.859 
column interchanges in between the
reservoir<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.040> radiator<00:01:44.549> out<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.689> ways

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
reservoir and the radiator out the ways

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
reservoir and the radiator out the ways
that<00:01:46.200> kind<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.530> keeps<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.040> walking<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.729> loop

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that kind of keeps the walking in loop

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.289 
that kind of keeps the walking in loop
up<00:01:48.930> towards<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> top<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.640> people<00:01:51.180> always

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
up towards the top and people always

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.870 
up towards the top and people always
Bowman<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.320> swallow<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> stuff<00:01:53.759> I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.819 
to work out the the loop order and stuff
and<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:06.990> think<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and I think I'm going to go with it the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.360 
and I think I'm going to go with it the
way<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:10.289> yes

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
way it is so yes

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.030 
way it is so yes
I<00:02:11.989> think<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.080> will<00:02:13.170> probably<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.590> all<00:02:13.769> right

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
I think it will probably be all right

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.830 
I think it will probably be all right
what<00:02:14.700> I'm<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.940> try<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.180> do<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.690> this

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
what I'm going to try and do on this

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.520 
what I'm going to try and do on this
video<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.379> get<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.590> looped<00:02:16.799> up<00:02:17.069> get<00:02:17.819> some

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
video is get it looped up get some

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.949 
video is get it looped up get some
coolant<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.680> here<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.849> see<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.750> kind

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
coolant in here so we can see the kind

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.300 
coolant in here so we can see the kind
of<00:02:22.049> colors<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.560> way<00:02:22.680> my<00:02:22.709> head's<00:02:23.129> been

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
of colors and the way my head's been

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.500 
of colors and the way my head's been
working<00:02:23.670> with<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.849> way<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.090> colors<00:02:24.269> should

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
working with the way the colors should

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.259 
working with the way the colors should
work<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.370> then<00:02:26.370> it'll<00:02:26.909> be<00:02:26.940> time<00:02:27.209> for

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
work on this and then it'll be time for

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.729 
work on this and then it'll be time for
me<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.629> start<00:02:27.810> trying<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.110> get<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.290> massive

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
me to start trying to get this massive

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.059 
me to start trying to get this massive
cabling<00:02:29.280> tidy<00:02:29.900> I'm<00:02:30.900> hoping<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.709> try<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:31.980> get

cabling tidy I'm hoping to try and get

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.740 
cabling tidy I'm hoping to try and get
as<00:02:32.159> much<00:02:32.310> as<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.579> can<00:02:32.640> done<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:33.510> week

overnight<00:03:43.420> now<00:03:43.840> I've<00:03:44.080> got<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.440> all<00:03:44.560> sorted<00:03:44.890> I

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.230 

know<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.050> colors<00:03:50.410> don't<00:03:50.620> match<00:03:50.890> but<00:03:51.670> do<00:03:52.090> not<00:03:52.180> i

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
know the colors don't match but do not i

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.290 
know the colors don't match but do not i
mean<00:03:52.300> it's<00:03:52.690> that's<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.890> best<00:03:54.100> i<00:03:54.280> could<00:03:54.340> do

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
mean it's that's the the best i could do

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.940 
mean it's that's the the best i could do
with<00:03:55.330> what<00:03:55.720> i<00:03:55.780> had<00:03:55.990> available<00:03:58.320> loop<00:03:59.320> is<00:03:59.560> all<00:03:59.770> in

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
with what i had available loop is all in

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.630 
with what i had available loop is all in
there<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.310> done<00:04:02.550> this<00:04:05.100> long<00:04:06.100> bit<00:04:06.310> of<00:04:06.430> hose

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
there and done this long bit of hose

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.060 
there and done this long bit of hose
here<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.660> bit<00:04:08.200> longer<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:08.770> that<00:04:08.800> the

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
here is a bit longer so that the

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.260 
here is a bit longer so that the
reservoir<00:04:09.880> can<00:04:10.090> still<00:04:10.360> one<00:04:10.950> come<00:04:11.950> out<00:04:12.160> as<00:04:13.150> you

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
reservoir can still one come out as you

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.590 
reservoir can still one come out as you
can<00:04:13.420> see<00:04:13.540> I've<00:04:13.690> put<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:13.930> pump<00:04:14.200> in<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.560> front

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
can see I've put the pump in the front

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.290 
can see I've put the pump in the front
kept<00:04:16.600> all<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.900> hoes<00:04:17.080> tidy<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.980> out<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:19.000> way

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
now still got the tissue in there where

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.530 
now still got the tissue in there where
I'm<00:04:23.980> bleeding<00:04:24.669> it<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:24.940> that's<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.240> power

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
I'm bleeding it and that's the power

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.270 
I'm bleeding it and that's the power
supply<00:04:25.780> on<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.230> side<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:26.740> just<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:27.010> slave

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
supply on that side it's just a slave

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.460 
supply on that side it's just a slave
unit<00:04:29.730> is<00:04:30.730> actually<00:04:31.150> used<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.660> lot<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:32.050> coolant

unit is actually used a lot of coolant
I'm<00:04:32.760> massively<00:04:33.760> surprised<00:04:34.480> with<00:04:34.690> this<00:04:34.780> one

and<00:04:45.340> yellow<00:04:45.669> dye<00:04:46.090> into<00:04:46.510> it<00:04:46.680> to<00:04:47.680> get<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.950> color

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
and yellow dye into it to get the color

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.510 
and yellow dye into it to get the color
as<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:49.090> can<00:04:49.210> see<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.540> in<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.780> hose<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:51.340> have<00:04:51.490> a

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
as you can see it in the hose you have a

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.390 
as you can see it in the hose you have a
look<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:52.390> color<00:04:52.600> in<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.870> hose<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:54.190> color

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
look the color in the hose and the color

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.280 
look the color in the hose and the color
in<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.669> front<00:04:54.940> are<00:04:55.180> very<00:04:55.450> different<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:58.290> yeah

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
in the front are very different and yeah

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.870 
in the front are very different and yeah
so<00:04:59.890> I've<00:05:00.100> actually<00:05:00.930> made<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.140> color<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:03.760> the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
so I've actually made the color to the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.610 
so I've actually made the color to the
color<00:05:04.090> that's<00:05:04.300> in<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.780> hose<00:05:04.960> there<00:05:05.350> now

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
color that's in the hose there now

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.280 
color that's in the hose there now
rather<00:05:06.220> than<00:05:06.370> what's<00:05:06.700> in<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.060> front<00:05:07.360> the

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
rather than what's in the front the

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.200 
rather than what's in the front the
color<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.650> came<00:05:08.830> out<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.130> bottle<00:05:09.460> just<00:05:09.729> it

didn't really cut the mustard it look
more<00:05:11.710> yellow<00:05:12.100> than<00:05:12.130> anything<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.640> was

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
more yellow than anything it was

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.110 
more yellow than anything it was
actually<00:05:13.000> quite<00:05:13.120> horrible<00:05:14.010> um<00:05:15.010> as<00:05:15.790> you<00:05:15.850> can

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.640 
the way the old coolant and the hose in

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.860 
the way the old coolant and the hose in
and<00:06:59.760> everything's<00:07:00.120> looking<00:07:00.300> I've<00:07:00.600> not<00:07:00.750> used

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
and everything's looking I've not used

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.500 
and everything's looking I've not used
too<00:07:01.170> many<00:07:01.320> kind<00:07:01.680> of<00:07:01.800> like<00:07:01.980> fancy<00:07:02.910> fittings<00:07:03.330> or

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510 
too many kind of like fancy fittings or

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.330 
too many kind of like fancy fittings or
anything<00:07:03.810> because<00:07:03.900> one<00:07:04.170> thing<00:07:04.200> that<00:07:04.620> vb<00:07:04.830> said

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
anything because one thing that vb said

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.670 
anything because one thing that vb said
to<00:07:05.490> me<00:07:05.640> is<00:07:05.700> that<00:07:06.000> he<00:07:06.690> wanted<00:07:06.960> to<00:07:07.020> be<00:07:07.290> able<00:07:07.350> to

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
to me is that he wanted to be able to

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.490 
to me is that he wanted to be able to
see<00:07:07.950> it<00:07:08.160> so<00:07:08.880> not<00:07:09.150> necessarily<00:07:09.300> have<00:07:09.990> it<00:07:10.110> is<00:07:10.260> the

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
see it so not necessarily have it is the

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.280 
see it so not necessarily have it is the
Tydeus<00:07:11.040> possible<00:07:11.640> loop<00:07:11.880> in<00:07:12.150> the<00:07:12.300> world<00:07:12.330> yeah

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
Tydeus possible loop in the world yeah

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.630 
Tydeus possible loop in the world yeah
actually<00:07:13.380> wanted<00:07:13.800> to<00:07:13.860> be<00:07:13.950> able<00:07:14.100> to<00:07:14.280> see<00:07:14.460> the

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.640 
actually wanted to be able to see the

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.990 
actually wanted to be able to see the
hose<00:07:14.850> which<00:07:15.270> let's<00:07:15.960> face<00:07:16.080> it<00:07:16.440> with<00:07:16.590> this<00:07:17.000> tube

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
hose which let's face it with this tube

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.620 
hose which let's face it with this tube
here<00:07:18.030> anyway<00:07:19.910> it's<00:07:20.910> the<00:07:21.000> way<00:07:21.210> it<00:07:21.270> is<00:07:21.390> because

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630 
here anyway it's the way it is because

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.240 
here anyway it's the way it is because
it<00:07:21.720> had<00:07:21.810> to<00:07:21.930> be<00:07:21.990> a<00:07:22.050> bit<00:07:22.200> longer<00:07:22.410> so<00:07:22.650> the<00:07:22.860> res<00:07:23.010> can

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
it had to be a bit longer so the res can

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.760 
it had to be a bit longer so the res can
still<00:07:23.490> come<00:07:23.730> out<00:07:23.760> but<00:07:24.210> I<00:07:24.500> think<00:07:25.500> you'll<00:07:25.620> like

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
still come out but I think you'll like

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.250 
still come out but I think you'll like
it<00:07:25.830> i've<00:07:26.070> obviously<00:07:26.280> kept<00:07:26.760> the<00:07:26.910> ER<00:07:27.050> the<00:07:28.050> loop

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260 
it i've obviously kept the ER the loop

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.960 
it i've obviously kept the ER the loop
pretty<00:07:28.590> much<00:07:28.800> in<00:07:28.980> the<00:07:29.070> top<00:07:29.280> half<00:07:29.460> of<00:07:29.670> the<00:07:29.730> case

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:29.970 
pretty much in the top half of the case

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.340 
pretty much in the top half of the case
anyway<00:07:30.360> I<00:07:30.390> didn't<00:07:30.690> see<00:07:30.780> any<00:07:30.870> point<00:07:30.960> in

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.350 
anyway I didn't see any point in

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.920 
anyway I didn't see any point in
dropping<00:07:32.220> the<00:07:32.370> pump<00:07:32.700> down<00:07:32.820> into<00:07:33.360> this<00:07:33.510> kind<00:07:33.810> of

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
dropping the pump down into this kind of

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:40.010 
dropping the pump down into this kind of
area<00:07:34.170> and<00:07:34.530> making<00:07:34.860> it<00:07:35.090> Messier<00:07:36.740> so<00:07:38.600> we<00:07:39.600> are<00:07:39.750> all

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 
area and making it Messier so we are all

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.570 
area and making it Messier so we are all
best<00:07:40.320> and<00:07:40.500> ever<00:07:40.650> is<00:07:40.800> you<00:07:40.980> can't<00:07:41.220> see<00:07:41.400> what's

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580 
best and ever is you can't see what's

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.810 
best and ever is you can't see what's
going<00:07:41.820> on<00:07:41.910> in<00:07:42.030> the<00:07:42.120> background<00:07:43.250> we<00:07:44.250> are<00:07:44.400> a<00:07:44.430> step

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:44.820 
going on in the background we are a step

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:51.920 
going on in the background we are a step
closer<00:07:45.450> to<00:07:46.020> completion

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:51.930 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.210 

anyway<00:07:52.930> I'm<00:07:53.440> going<00:07:53.530> to<00:07:53.650> leave<00:07:53.770> this<00:07:53.919> video

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.220 
anyway I'm going to leave this video

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.890 
anyway I'm going to leave this video
