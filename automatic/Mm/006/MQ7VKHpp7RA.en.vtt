00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.170
 williams is today I'm going to you 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.330
 show how to make your own 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.430
 own organ zumba hamburger bun 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.810
 in trade for easily 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.730
 Bergen parents and now 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.230
 paradoxes but I really do not find 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.539
 terrible and when you can do 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.040
 tan and when you have time to 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.989
 do it yourself and patience 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.850
 frankly make the change really 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.379
 where in addition you really have the pride 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.230
 to have done everything in the recipe of the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.640
 halal bread a final hamburger so 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.180
 in fact it's going to be very simple 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.949
 finally 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.300
 it just takes a little time, it's 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.860
 a double ration of bread so he goes 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.530
 have to let it rest but 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.210
 all so for us scared even when 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.950
 we will need already for the part 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.550
 four big ingredients liquid 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.989
 yellow of 10 806 liters of milk half 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.980
 skim I use post but uses some 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.050
 whole milk it's always better to have 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.930
 fat course here just 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.140
 50 g of butter and 14 110 liters of water 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.300
 normal faucet here I have 180 g of flour 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.950
 with the yeast incorporated in fact it's 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.460
 flour to make white bread 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.350
 would like to use 680 grams of flour 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.940
 t55 to which you will then add two 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.920
 teaspoons baker's yeast 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.450
 snapshot but this possible I took 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.820
 the decision to use one by one 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.650
 special strong to make my life easier 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.229
 then if I have four tablespoons 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.240
 of white sugar and 2 teaspoons of 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.369
 salt and that will be all for our ingredients 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.170
 you see it's really simple where the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.270
 have surely already at home so what 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.280
 i did this i'm going to use my 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.650
 kitchenette with my next I'm going 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.600
 to beat very quickly to the 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.790
 house sandstone binder dry so that the sugar 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.409
 and salt support to mix to 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.299
 through the flour and I'm going to do 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.210
 heat my mixture of water and butter 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.159
 over medium heat until the mixture 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.740
 be well homogeneous and that the butter is 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.909
 totally melted here is my office 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.579
 at least what I'm going to do is 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.579
 added everyone is in the mix 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.670
 butter and then you will take 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.340
 a confectionery thermometer is everything 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.869
 simply 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.480
 measure the temperature of this mixture 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.890
 normally wrong is supposed to be between 45 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.680
 and 55 2 celsius 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.330
 at least that's what we want so 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.569
 that I measure the temperature of my 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.800
 ok mix so that's it does it 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.599
 is in good shape eratures she has 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.010
 48 degrees celsius now what I 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.040
 am going to do is beat this 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.739
 preparation is added to while beating 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.739
 my mixture of milk water and butter 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.370
 So here you are after years 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.330
 begins to become for me so I 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.370
 it's perfect now what I want 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.349
 do is add a yellow two to the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.650
 times your little one are well between each 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.650
 addition 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.130
 so here's the ipad you throw it 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.380
 your last is what are you going 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.239
 pass it kneads your dough months during 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.430
 10 minutes since I have a good little 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.470
 friendly robot that will not work 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.579
 my place if you ever peck this dough 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.720
 by hand and you can very well the 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.060
 do we will take more time 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.799
 really double the limit your flat 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.209
 be well elastic and well kneaded so 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.010
 me it'll take me about 10 minutes 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.430
 and I will show you the consistency of 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.610
 my paw 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.410
 once she is well kneaded 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.560
 so after ten minutes you have 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.230
 a paste that is very elastic enough 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.269
 sticky so like these it is 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.799
 beautiful as you can see because 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.849
 than that but she still sticks a 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.260
 little bit as you can see 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.889
 so now what am I doing enough 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.900
 removed my hook here I have a salad bowl 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.150
 that I baste with oil and 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.130
 thanks to this little little little brush is 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.680
 what I'm going to do is put 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:42.079
 am about to point for hamburger in 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.340
 my on faladiÃ© here is now what 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.169
 I'm going to do so it's small remittance to 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.400
 grow in my salad bowl that I have 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.470
 quickly and most importantly it is yours 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.340
 salad bowl carbon not you are you really 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.139
 stuck to the edges of the salat say what I 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.790
 do then is that I recover my 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.549
 still a little bit of oil 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.200
 olive of what was left and then I 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.239
 let my paw rest 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.980
 room temperature for about 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.280
 1h30 or until they double 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.660
 you 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.810
 hume and then we can continue the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.610
 recipe so now my paw has well 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.410
 swollen it took about two hours this 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.150
 that I had closed these flours and my 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.290
 work plan and then I 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.669
 worked my paw 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.989
 I have here molds 10 cm in diameter 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.400
 and 2 cm in height 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.900
 I'm going to make this small decline 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.250
 balls that gets in because after this 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.169
 is not looking at me leather inside 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.389
 so that they keep there a form of 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.669
 world goods and I also take steps 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.320
 adobe to show you how to go from one 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.820
 baguette mold find you in the 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.630
 special bake shops the 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.100
 kitchens 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.900
 it is very convenient for generic way 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.690
 you, that's what I'm going to do 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.940
 it's already out my paw and then you 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.600
 worked a little with flour 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.010
 caracol for all you will see that 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.020
 you are I can not very nice to 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.060
 work she is really light 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.370
 flexible it's really a happiness 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.030
 so I 'm for but a you to whom I 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.460
 going divided into 8 to do is not to 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.080
 hot dog and burgers and then I 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.150
 formed chickens that I placed in my 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.610
 mussels and I'm going to make shapes too 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.930
 of crazies as you shuttle 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.550

 the beautiful teeth but ride but soft the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.729
 baguette 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.590
 as you can see gt5 not a burger 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.000
 and 3 for hot dogs 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.590
 now I have them rest at 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.210
 room temperature for about a 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.630
 time just fanned almost doubled from 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.130
 volume 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.229
 all covered 2 all covered with 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.100
 clingfilm 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.960
 so now my little ports have 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.400
 swollen it's great now I'm going 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.610
 simply brush them a little 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.650
 of milk for sleeping in the oven and 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.210
 every time for but not outside of 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.760
 the less I'm going to do it once 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.919
 I add licks magic of dpu 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.630
 small sesame seeds sure but we do not 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.280
 look that I find it very nice and 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.470
 his band a little bit of flavor like 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.210
 so this is what I'm going to do it's 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.500
 basting shot but painted and then 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.740
 I'm going to bake in preheated oven at 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.340
 200 or even degrees celsius for about 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.230
 two weeks 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.370
 until they are golden brown and 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.810
 that he be well inflated then but not 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.389
 cooked well for 20 minutes 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.650
 finally at 220 degrees celsius he 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.820
 longer longer simply because 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.830
 I cook them on two plates 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.840
 different on stuffs right now 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.220
 before more time if ever cook 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.990
 diffused only one plate that you 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.169
