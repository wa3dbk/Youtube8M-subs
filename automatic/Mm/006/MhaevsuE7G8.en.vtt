00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
just created just enough back pressure

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.360 
just created just enough back pressure
that<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.270> wasn't<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.960> work<00:00:52.140> bro<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.190> much

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
that it wasn't going to work bro so much

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.310 
that it wasn't going to work bro so much
for<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:54.140> now<00:00:56.449> let<00:00:57.449> me<00:00:57.539> grab<00:00:57.780> some<00:00:58.079> light<00:01:00.320> see

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
for that now let me grab some light see

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.160 
for that now let me grab some light see
what<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.620> got<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.170> always

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
what we got going back here I always

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.120 
what we got going back here I always
think<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> light<00:01:04.830> too<00:01:05.100> late<00:01:05.339> dota

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
think of the light too late dota

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.950 
think of the light too late dota
so<00:01:07.670> that's<00:01:08.510> where<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.869> ended<00:01:09.110> up

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
so that's where it ended up

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.679 
so that's where it ended up
as<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.200> can<00:01:12.320> see<00:01:12.880> if<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:13.999> look<00:01:14.030> real<00:01:14.420> close

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
as you can see if you look real close

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.179 
as you can see if you look real close

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
right there I had to cut a little notch

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.950 
right there I had to cut a little notch
out<00:01:16.640> at<00:01:16.819> the<00:01:16.880> side<00:01:17.119> of<00:01:17.270> myself

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
out at the side of myself

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.550 
out at the side of myself
to<00:01:18.619> get<00:01:18.740> fit<00:01:19.130> in<00:01:19.280> there<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:19.700> way<00:01:19.909> I<00:01:23.560> didn't

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
to get fit in there that way I didn't

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.330 
to get fit in there that way I didn't
want<00:01:24.709> it<00:01:24.829> facing<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:26.420> other<00:01:26.600> way

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
want it facing the other way

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.050 
want it facing the other way

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
mainly because the return blown right

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.180

other day from work I changed my bag of
a<00:03:42.040> Tim<00:03:42.670> appear<00:03:44.879> still<00:03:45.879> no<00:03:46.060> clean<00:03:46.390> in<00:03:46.569> here<00:03:46.750> and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
a Tim appear still no clean in here and

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.150 
a Tim appear still no clean in here and
there<00:03:46.989> still<00:03:47.260> need<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.560> get<00:03:47.680> some<00:03:47.890> cleaning

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
there still need to get some cleaning

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.949 
there still need to get some cleaning
done<00:03:49.500> everything's<00:03:50.500> coming<00:03:51.370> along

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.390 

should<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.709> say<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.099> swimmingly<00:03:57.099> anyway<00:03:58.099> I

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
should I say it swimmingly anyway I

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.809 
should I say it swimmingly anyway I
still<00:03:59.090> need<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.390> change<00:03:59.599> out<00:03:59.930> my<00:04:00.909> Ma's<00:04:01.909> band<00:04:02.469> I

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
still need to change out my Ma's band I

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.580 
still need to change out my Ma's band I
just<00:04:04.819> think<00:04:05.180> it's<00:04:05.390> probably<00:04:05.719> a<00:04:05.989> good<00:04:06.170> idea<00:04:06.230> I

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
just think it's probably a good idea I

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.020 
just think it's probably a good idea I
do<00:04:06.739> not<00:04:07.069> have<00:04:07.310> any<00:04:07.489> phosphates<00:04:08.000> in<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.329> tank

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
do not have any phosphates in the tank

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.119 
do not have any phosphates in the tank
but<00:04:11.030> it's<00:04:11.180> been<00:04:11.359> there<00:04:11.569> for<00:04:11.750> two<00:04:11.900> months

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
but it's been there for two months

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.319 
but it's been there for two months
probably<00:04:13.129> wouldn't<00:04:13.579> that<00:04:13.730> just<00:04:13.760> stop<00:04:14.150> too

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
probably wouldn't that just stop too

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.060 
probably wouldn't that just stop too
much<00:04:14.510> probably<00:04:15.290> wouldn't<00:04:15.560> hurt<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.799> change

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
much probably wouldn't hurt to change

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.390 
much probably wouldn't hurt to change
that<00:04:16.280> out

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.420 

one<00:04:22.030> or<00:04:22.150> two<00:04:22.300> minor<00:04:22.660> leaks<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.710> poor<00:04:23.949> wife<00:04:24.190> had

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
one or two minor leaks the poor wife had

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.970 
one or two minor leaks the poor wife had
to<00:04:24.550> deal<00:04:24.730> with<00:04:24.970> while<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.270> was<00:04:25.480> at<00:04:25.600> work<00:04:25.919> but<00:04:26.919> she

to deal with while I was at work but she

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.950 
to deal with while I was at work but she
took<00:04:27.280> care<00:04:27.520> of<00:04:27.550> one<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.270> them<00:04:28.389> and<00:04:28.540> then<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.750> had

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
took care of one of them and then I had

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.170 
took care of one of them and then I had
