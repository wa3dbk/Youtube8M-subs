00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.520 
this is urban decay's retrograde
eyeliner<00:04:04.849> which<00:04:05.750> i<00:04:05.840> think<00:04:05.900> is<00:04:06.110> actually<00:04:06.290> more

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
eyeliner which i think is actually more

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.410 
eyeliner which i think is actually more
of<00:04:06.650> like<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.799> purple<00:04:07.310> but<00:04:07.849> it's<00:04:08.000> really<00:04:08.180> pretty

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
of like a purple but it's really pretty

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.660 
of like a purple but it's really pretty
and<00:04:08.840> we're<00:04:09.440> only<00:04:09.560> using<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:10.010> very<00:04:10.310> very<00:04:10.549> very

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
and we're only using a very very very

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.460 
and we're only using a very very very
very<00:04:11.090> very<00:04:11.209> small<00:04:11.840> amount<00:04:12.140> because<00:04:12.260> when

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
very very small amount because when

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.949 
very very small amount because when
you're<00:04:12.590> doing<00:04:12.769> a<00:04:12.829> gradient<00:04:13.310> look<00:04:13.519> like<00:04:13.730> that

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
you're doing a gradient look like that

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.210 
you're doing a gradient look like that
if<00:04:14.959> you<00:04:15.140> don't<00:04:15.290> want<00:04:15.409> to<00:04:15.500> have<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.650> really<00:04:15.890> thick

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
if you don't want to have a really thick

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.250 
if you don't want to have a really thick
line<00:04:16.549> because<00:04:16.880> at<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.299> end<00:04:17.329> it'll<00:04:17.690> always<00:04:17.930> end

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
line because at the end it'll always end

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.409 
line because at the end it'll always end
up<00:04:18.350> covering<00:04:18.680> your<00:04:18.859> last<00:04:19.160> bit<00:04:19.400> of<00:04:19.430> gradient<00:04:19.940> so

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
up covering your last bit of gradient so

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.000 
up covering your last bit of gradient so
then<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.690> doesn't<00:04:20.840> really<00:04:20.959> look<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.590> really

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
then it doesn't really look that really

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.790 
then it doesn't really look that really
doesn't<00:04:22.160> give<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.400> same<00:04:22.580> cool<00:04:22.850> 3d<00:04:23.300> effect<00:04:23.800> so

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
doesn't give the same cool 3d effect so

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.379 
doesn't give the same cool 3d effect so
I'm<00:04:24.949> just<00:04:25.130> really<00:04:25.430> trying<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.760> drag<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.210> as

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
I'm just really trying to drag this as

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.950 
I'm just really trying to drag this as
close<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.900> lash<00:04:26.930> line<00:04:27.289> as<00:04:27.410> possible<00:04:28.960> and

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
close to the lash line as possible and

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:39.030 
close to the lash line as possible and
do<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.530> little<00:04:30.710> simple<00:04:31.310> wing<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:32.000> like<00:04:32.120> that

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040
