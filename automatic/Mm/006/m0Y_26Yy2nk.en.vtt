is a whopping 18 for a single feather
falling<00:02:30.550> for<00:02:31.170> enchantment<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.769> what<00:02:32.950> does

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
falling for enchantment so what does

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.729 
falling for enchantment so what does
this<00:02:33.129> mean<00:02:33.580> well<00:02:34.450> assuming<00:02:35.349> you<00:02:35.470> want<00:02:35.620> to

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
this mean well assuming you want to

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.309 
this mean well assuming you want to

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
protect yourself against projectile

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.080 
protect yourself against projectile
protection<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:38.980> fireballs<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.700> arrows<00:02:39.970> and

protection with fireballs and arrows and
stuff<00:02:40.239> like<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.690> if<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.440> got<00:02:41.650> two<00:02:42.220> pieces<00:02:42.610> of

stuff like that if you got two pieces of

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.790 
stuff like that if you got two pieces of
armor<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.599> were<00:02:43.720> enchanted<00:02:43.900> with<00:02:44.410> level

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
armor that were enchanted with level

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.250 
armor that were enchanted with level
four<00:02:45.069> remember<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.760> was<00:02:45.910> 11<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.989> would<00:02:47.140> put

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
four remember that was 11 that would put

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.600 
four remember that was 11 that would put
you<00:02:47.319> at<00:02:47.440> 22<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:49.090> if<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.569> got<00:02:49.750> just<00:02:50.280> one<00:02:51.280> more

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
you at 22 so if you got just one more

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.449 
you at 22 so if you got just one more
let's<00:02:52.120> say<00:02:52.450> level<00:02:53.380> for<00:02:53.560> protection<00:02:54.099> you'd<00:02:54.310> be

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
let's say level for protection you'd be

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.420 
let's say level for protection you'd be
over<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.540> 25<00:02:56.200> limit<00:02:57.000> for<00:02:58.620> enchanting<00:02:59.620> against

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
over the 25 limit for enchanting against

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.650 
over the 25 limit for enchanting against
arrow<00:03:01.150> fire<00:03:01.769> now<00:03:03.150> because<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:05.200> are<00:03:05.560> capped<00:03:06.280> at

quite going to get up to that 25 mark

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.440 
quite going to get up to that 25 mark
because<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.280> only<00:03:15.400> have<00:03:15.610> four<00:03:15.970> pieces<00:03:16.269> of

long amount of time and on top of that

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.280 
long amount of time and on top of that
why<00:03:56.829> don't<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.040> add<00:03:57.250> aqua<00:03:57.910> affinity<00:03:58.540> 1<00:03:58.989> as

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
why don't you add aqua affinity 1 as

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.410 
why don't you add aqua affinity 1 as
well<00:03:59.680> this<00:04:00.100> means<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.880> can<00:04:01.060> break

for the boots let's let's let's finish
out<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.049> whole<00:04:08.230> underwater<00:04:08.680> theme<00:04:09.040> with

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
out this whole underwater theme with

out this whole underwater theme with
doing<00:04:09.760> depth<00:04:09.970> Strider<00:04:10.420> 3<00:04:10.900> which<00:04:11.290> means<00:04:11.470> you

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
doing depth Strider 3 which means you

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.129 
doing depth Strider 3 which means you
basically<00:04:12.010> walk<00:04:12.400> at<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.120> exact<00:04:13.510> same<00:04:13.720> speed

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
damage when falling and live with it

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.779 
damage when falling and live with it
now<00:04:28.030> let's<00:04:28.539> move<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.530> sword<00:04:29.889> sharpness
