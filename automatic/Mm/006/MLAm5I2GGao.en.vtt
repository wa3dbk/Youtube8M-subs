Holland<00:00:19.929> I<00:00:20.769> just<00:00:21.730> seen<00:00:21.939> your<00:00:22.089> performance<00:00:22.630> I

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
Holland I just seen your performance I

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.349 
Holland I just seen your performance I
think<00:00:23.619> it<00:00:23.769> was<00:00:23.890> incredible<00:00:24.640> but<00:00:24.820> struck<00:00:25.240> me

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
think it was incredible but struck me

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.929 
think it was incredible but struck me
the<00:00:25.390> most<00:00:25.509> the<00:00:25.929> most<00:00:25.960> was<00:00:26.410> your<00:00:26.589> solo<00:00:26.890> I<00:00:27.189> think

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
the most the most was your solo I think

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.649 
the most the most was your solo I think
it<00:00:28.060> was<00:00:28.179> 20<00:00:29.019> 25<00:00:29.470> minutes<00:00:29.800> or<00:00:30.099> something

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:30.659 
it was 20 25 minutes or something

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.380 
it was 20 25 minutes or something
perhaps<00:00:31.659> perhaps<00:00:31.989> it<00:00:32.439> wasn't<00:00:32.619> long<00:00:32.890> but

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
perhaps perhaps it wasn't long but

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.430 
perhaps perhaps it wasn't long but
sometimes<00:00:34.390> long<00:00:34.600> is<00:00:34.750> not<00:00:34.870> good<00:00:35.050> because<00:00:35.170> you

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
sometimes long is not good because you

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.690 
sometimes long is not good because you
get<00:00:35.560> like<00:00:35.740> but<00:00:35.920> for<00:00:36.340> me<00:00:36.460> it<00:00:36.550> was<00:00:36.640> really

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
get like but for me it was really

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.810 
get like but for me it was really
perfect<00:00:37.090> because<00:00:37.420> I<00:00:37.570> I<00:00:38.050> was<00:00:38.830> enjoying<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.700> all

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
perfect because I I was enjoying it all

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.040 
perfect because I I was enjoying it all
the<00:00:39.910> time<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:40.270> learn<00:00:40.510> from<00:00:40.540> it<00:00:40.810> all<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.020> time

at<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:18.950> Nugget<00:02:19.250> did<00:02:19.340> not<00:02:19.460> get<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.670> dot<00:02:19.870> I'm

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
at the Nugget did not get the dot I'm

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.010 
at the Nugget did not get the dot I'm
very<00:02:20.930> loose<00:02:21.620> when<00:02:22.460> doing<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.630> doesn't

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
very loose when doing that so it doesn't

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.200 
very loose when doing that so it doesn't
take<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> lot<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.560> energy<00:02:24.890> really<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> faster

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
take a lot of energy really the faster

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.850 
take a lot of energy really the faster
you<00:02:26.360> play<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.680> loser<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:29.000> should<00:02:29.210> be<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.650> it's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
you play the loser you should be so it's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.760 
you play the loser you should be so it's
only<00:02:31.160> when<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.400> volume<00:02:31.880> gets<00:02:32.150> up<00:02:32.710> when<00:02:33.710> you

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
only when the volume gets up when you

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.830 
only when the volume gets up when you
start<00:02:34.010> bringing<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.460> arms<00:02:34.790> at<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.120> it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
start bringing in the arms at it it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.230 
start bringing in the arms at it it
feels<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.320> get<00:02:36.410> muscular<00:02:37.010> yeah<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.760> as<00:02:38.030> far<00:02:38.060> as

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
feels to get muscular yeah so as far as

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.900 
feels to get muscular yeah so as far as
far<00:02:38.540> as<00:02:38.630> playing<00:02:38.840> like<00:02:39.470> soft<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.250> fast<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.760> can

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
far as playing like soft and fast I can

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.370 
far as playing like soft and fast I can
do<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.180> all<00:02:41.360> day<00:02:41.390> with<00:02:41.810> very<00:02:41.990> little<00:02:42.170> effort

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
do that all day with very little effort

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.250 
do that all day with very little effort
so<00:02:42.800> it's<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.190> matter<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.960> working<00:02:44.960> that

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
so it's just a matter of working that

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.290 
so it's just a matter of working that
technique<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.370> molar<00:02:46.550> than<00:02:46.820> God<00:02:47.060> that

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
technique like the molar than God that

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.000 
technique like the molar than God that
got<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.170> gut<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.590> they<00:02:48.770> get<00:02:48.920> it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
got that the gut that they get it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.530 
got that the gut that they get it
together<00:02:49.130> together<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.760> get<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.090> gut<00:02:50.270> and

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
together together to get it to gut and
