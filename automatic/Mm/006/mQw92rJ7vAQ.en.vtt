to be the sacrifice for all this
enlightenment<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.060> supposed<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.390> change<00:02:15.630> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840

kingdom for the King and all this
craziness<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.300> I'm<00:02:18.390> thinking<00:02:18.720> exactly<00:02:18.900> what

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
craziness and I'm thinking exactly what

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.350 
craziness and I'm thinking exactly what
is<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.920> special<00:02:20.220> about<00:02:20.550> Lucy<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.240> they

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
is it that special about Lucy that they

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.150 
is it that special about Lucy that they
want<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.570> use<00:02:21.720> her<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.140> sacrifice<00:02:22.590> opposed

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
want to use her as a sacrifice opposed

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.560 
want to use her as a sacrifice opposed
to<00:02:23.310> anybody<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.880> they<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.300> grab<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
to anybody that they can just grab a

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.030 
to anybody that they can just grab a
kidnap<00:02:25.080> there<00:02:25.350> must<00:02:25.530> be<00:02:25.650> something<00:02:26.010> special

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
kidnap there must be something special

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.040 
kidnap there must be something special
to<00:02:26.490> her<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.850> I'm<00:02:27.060> guessing<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.600> probably<00:02:27.900> has

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
to her and I'm guessing it probably has

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.600 
to her and I'm guessing it probably has
to<00:02:28.080> do<00:02:28.320> something<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.770> her<00:02:28.890> mother<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
to do something with her mother and the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.580 
to do something with her mother and the
Heartfilia<00:02:30.120> name<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.470> her

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
Heartfilia name and you know just her

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.840 
Heartfilia name and you know just her
bloodline<00:02:32.010> or<00:02:32.160> something<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.670> because

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
bloodline or something like that because

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.920 
bloodline or something like that because
we<00:02:33.090> do<00:02:33.210> know<00:02:33.360> there<00:02:33.510> was<00:02:33.630> something<00:02:33.870> very

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
we do know there was something very

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.510 
we do know there was something very
special<00:02:34.110> about<00:02:34.440> her<00:02:34.650> mother<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.340> guess

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
special about her mother and I guess

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.710 
special about her mother and I guess
it's<00:02:35.670> probably<00:02:35.760> passed<00:02:36.150> out<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.510> her<00:02:36.570> as

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
it's probably passed out on to her as

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.270 
it's probably passed out on to her as
well<00:02:36.930> why<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.350> think<00:02:37.560> she<00:02:37.680> has<00:02:37.800> all<00:02:38.070> those

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
well why you think she has all those

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.860 
well why you think she has all those
keys<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.880> all<00:02:39.030> those<00:02:39.120> people<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.390> listen<00:02:39.810> to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
keys and all those people that listen to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.420 
keys and all those people that listen to
her<00:02:39.959> because<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.500> think<00:02:40.770> there's<00:02:41.100> something

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
her because I think there's something

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.010 
her because I think there's something
more<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.760> Lucy<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.209> meets<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.600> eye

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
more to Lucy that meets the eye

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.120 
more to Lucy that meets the eye
it's<00:02:43.140> kind<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.470> how<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.620> always<00:02:43.770> said<00:02:44.100> I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
it's kind of like how I always said I

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.949 
it's kind of like how I always said I
feel<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:44.610> though<00:02:44.640> Lucy's<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.180> main<00:02:45.480> character

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
feel as though Lucy's the main character

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.540 
feel as though Lucy's the main character
I<00:02:46.140> think<00:02:46.230> there's<00:02:46.590> something<00:02:46.740> inside<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.310> her

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
I think there's something inside of her

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.310 
I think there's something inside of her
kind<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.820> like<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.239> know<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.540> classics<00:02:49.080> shown

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
kind of like you know the classics shown

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.650 
kind of like you know the classics shown
in<00:02:49.500> power<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.310> when<00:02:50.670> Arnold<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.120> he<00:02:51.300> has<00:02:51.420> that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
in power like when Arnold so he has that

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.540 
in power like when Arnold so he has that
too<00:02:52.080> because<00:02:52.290> something<00:02:52.800> inside<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.250> Lucy

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
too because something inside of Lucy

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.240 
too because something inside of Lucy
that<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.820> gonna<00:02:54.000> definitely<00:02:54.350> be<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.380> key<00:02:55.770> factor

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
that is gonna definitely be a key factor

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.410 
that is gonna definitely be a key factor
in<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.459> arc<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.940> they're<00:02:57.030> saying<00:02:57.239> that

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
in this arc and they're saying that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.699 
in this arc and they're saying that
they're<00:02:57.600> gonna<00:02:57.690> use<00:02:57.959> her<00:02:58.080> as<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.230> sacrifice

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
they're gonna use her as a sacrifice

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.830 
they're gonna use her as a sacrifice
then<00:02:59.070> we<00:02:59.190> get<00:02:59.340> flashbacks<00:02:59.760> of<00:03:00.150> China<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.570> again

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
then we get flashbacks of China to again

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.050 
then we get flashbacks of China to again
thinking<00:03:01.200> about<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:02.100> I'm<00:03:02.220> exactly<00:03:02.790> not

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
thinking about that so I'm exactly not

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.880 
thinking about that so I'm exactly not
sure<00:03:03.360> what's<00:03:03.630> gonna<00:03:03.750> happen<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.530> do<00:03:04.620> think

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
sure what's gonna happen but I do think

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.470 
sure what's gonna happen but I do think
it<00:03:05.040> has<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.280> do<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> part<00:03:05.700> where<00:03:05.820> her<00:03:05.970> Heartfilia

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
it has to do a part where her Heartfilia

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.780 
it has to do a part where her Heartfilia
name<00:03:06.810> her<00:03:07.260> mother<00:03:07.530> her<00:03:07.770> bloodline<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.489> what

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
name her mother her bloodline and what

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.760 
name her mother her bloodline and what
makes<00:03:09.000> Lucy<00:03:09.420> very<00:03:09.600> special<00:03:10.110> opposed<00:03:10.560> to

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
makes Lucy very special opposed to

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.510 
makes Lucy very special opposed to
anybody<00:03:11.130> else

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
anybody else

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.550 
anybody else
