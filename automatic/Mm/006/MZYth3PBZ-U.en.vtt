00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hello people, I'm here today. 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.389
 with carrying as always in fact but 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.250
 300 with something different in the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.349
 screen because it is 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.310
 You're seeing something that kind of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.340
 This is tv and lifting me slowly. 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.480
 contest was on the round button cancer is 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.000
 Yeah 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.160
 I do not leave our dream fog nor do you know 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.849
 Do you know something about this map? 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.920
 name 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.070
 good guys, it 's the next thing with that play 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.710
 4 staff playing with a good as is 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.829
 against the play 4 level 2 playing here only 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.070
 to do a demonstration for you 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.739
 How is it that I'm sincere? 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.079
 difficult the issue of cement consumption 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.239
 of the year I have dictated the whole volume is 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.329
 English junk none of this 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.690
 ok let's start here we see delivered 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.690
 or not at all 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.160
 they started something other than a cover of 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160
 do not cry 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.900
 the galley is the following basically two 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.100
 a very cool news 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 It's already rolling cross platform 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.369
 rolling cross platform ie the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.740
 father's galley when he's already playing 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.200
 together and against the galley is playing in the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.799
 PraÃ§a 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.590
 so let's see I think the guys 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.799
 so many features to galley to galley 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.360
 that has an asterisk name is from play 4 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.960
 the galley that is using the coast name 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.880
 play rich here frame at 23 how much 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.579
 the gamepad he is so the guys 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.630
 4 asterisk is the play and without asterisk 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.170
 from pc 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.110
 so this is an interesting point of 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.570
 identification for you then beauty then 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.549
 It will be the tip for you. 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.430
 Good, I'm only 15 minutes from 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.170
 recording that is play 4 can pick up 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.270
 here I'll pick up after the recording 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.850
 computer and edit and everything 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.100
 more and all this good, let's see what I 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.270
 with that guy is 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.750
 is to have a shit so I must say that 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.239
 the r1 r2 when you put this camera 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.890
 here he follows the plane he almost makes the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.130
 curve just hit me 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.650
 bitch who gave birth to a play 4 guy warm up 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.239
 but the insured l2 he makes a camera o 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.150
 I do not know if I have a plane. 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.840
 this also does not as a thing in the for the 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.660
 computer because what happens I use is the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.660
 zoom these one here always understood use 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.940
 does not follow the cute little guy I'm 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:51.120
 holding the button looks down 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.920
 Let's select another target that proves 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.950
 that he'll make a turn if he goes 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.069
 up the stairs climb under understand 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.739
 Look, the plane is moving according to agreement. 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.350
 follows the same face, right ? 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.989
 from left to right is Iran today. 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:14.340
 right it is what controls the power 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:24.030
 engine and we'll try some 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:26.100
 thing that I can not now look at 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.890
 folks it's a big problem of mine here 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:35.690
 in this inverted game, not for questions of 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:41.370
 maneuver when looking at the same thing 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:44.570
 so I got completely confused like this 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.030
 maybe taking shot here right? 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:55.739
 I play the right thigh, he too 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:59.130
 has the arm January January in January was 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.450
 January that was very difficult is very 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.450
 difficult and has no concept 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.620
 It has no notion very difficult crowd 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.440
 The guy is going to broadcast so far. 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.220
 good in the world until it happens again face 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.950
 It's an expensive thing again, I hit. 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.090
 that it does not attend to those who already have 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:40.260
 even frog spirit let's say 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.510
 so it is threatening it is because what 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.430
 happens not to admire the control is 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.910
 inverted at the time I do here having 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.670
 I put up to right front're the plane 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.140
 informal down is for him to do so through 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.630
 especially during the time of 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.560
 Only maneuvers for me to go the guys to 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:03.810
 to improve what I understand is the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.540
 to see what complicates me because poet is 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.100
 much harder is not a comrade here 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:17.370
 and I do not even care to see the 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:20.340
 heavenly here then here near the engine 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.710
 asking all match has also 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.770
 asterisk galley play 4ta galley 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.300
 So the tip is there you see someone with 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.350
 asterisk name the guys who are playing 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.710
 no play 4 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.710
 now here 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.889
 It's not going to work, it's not going to work. 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.500
 I put it down to follow it, it goes to 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.409
 top for each inverted 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:58.639
 For me, this reversal only works 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:58.639
 piloting does not admire and the hits comes 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.090
 look at three enemies the law 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:14.570
 hit a third is guys is very 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.010
 crazy sag is one thing at last will show 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.600
 to play with to say some things 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.670
 new to you what's happening 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.170
 with what is important is what also affects the 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.250
 gameplay of the galley that is playing in the 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:27.020
 computer 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:28.460
 so only you have an idea is and anyway 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.190
 I'll bring a baby with a tank too. 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.570
 what is different but also time and 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.390
 four tanks are already rolling the same 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.220
 thing did not play and breaks held at all 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.620
 world plays with everyone was 4 on pc 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.450
 so it was the airplane forget to enjoy 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.500
 favor this video welcome chaos 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.140
 It's the first video you're playing. 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.480
 enjoying here and that's it 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:52.480
 Many thanks to all of you for a great 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.480
 Hugs thanks, I said
