you're<00:00:56.059> just<00:00:56.239> solving<00:00:56.780> puzzles<00:00:56.930> getting<00:00:57.559> to

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
you're just solving puzzles getting to

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.310 
you're just solving puzzles getting to
the<00:00:57.800> exit<00:00:58.250> with<00:00:58.700> help<00:00:58.940> of<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.239> portal<00:00:59.719> gun<00:00:59.750> and

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
the exit with help of a portal gun and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.139 
the exit with help of a portal gun and
how<00:01:00.800> this<00:01:00.920> gun<00:01:01.100> works<00:01:01.340> is<00:01:01.520> you<00:01:01.610> pick<00:01:01.790> it<00:01:01.879> up<00:01:02.000> and

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
how this gun works is you pick it up and

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.280 
how this gun works is you pick it up and
you<00:01:02.239> eventually<00:01:02.480> power<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:02.989> up<00:01:03.079> so<00:01:03.200> you<00:01:03.260> can

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
you eventually power it up so you can

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.139 
you eventually power it up so you can
shoot<00:01:03.469> two<00:01:03.739> portals<00:01:04.129> at<00:01:04.280> once<00:01:04.489> one<00:01:04.850> blue<00:01:05.119> and

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
shoot two portals at once one blue and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.060 
shoot two portals at once one blue and
one<00:01:05.329> orange<00:01:05.899> and<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.680> can<00:01:06.799> walk<00:01:07.039> through

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
one orange and you can walk through

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.770 
one orange and you can walk through
these<00:01:07.430> portals<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:08.000> kind<00:01:08.180> of<00:01:08.270> warp<00:01:08.450> yourself

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
these portals to kind of warp yourself

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.630 
these portals to kind of warp yourself
around<00:01:08.990> these<00:01:09.200> different<00:01:09.350> levels<00:01:09.649> physics

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
around these different levels physics

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.399 
around these different levels physics
also<00:01:10.759> comes<00:01:11.060> into<00:01:11.210> play<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:11.720> momentum<00:01:12.229> and

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
also comes into play and momentum and

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.960 
also comes into play and momentum and
force<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:12.950> stuff<00:01:13.100> like<00:01:13.190> that<00:01:13.400> where<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:13.909> know

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
force and stuff like that where you know

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.280 
force and stuff like that where you know
you're<00:01:14.150> shooting<00:01:14.510> a<00:01:14.570> portal<00:01:14.869> on<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.049> floor

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
you're shooting a portal on the floor

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.450 
you're shooting a portal on the floor
and<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:15.470> have<00:01:15.560> another<00:01:15.710> one<00:01:15.799> up<00:01:15.950> high<00:01:16.130> you'll

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
and you have another one up high you'll

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.190 
and you have another one up high you'll
jump<00:01:17.000> down<00:01:17.210> into<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.510> hole<00:01:17.659> pick<00:01:17.960> up<00:01:18.049> some

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
jump down into the hole pick up some

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.359 
jump down into the hole pick up some
speed<00:01:18.560> before<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:18.950> hit<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.130> one<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.310> the

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
speed before you hit the one of the

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.680 
speed before you hit the one of the
floor<00:01:19.580> then<00:01:19.760> come<00:01:19.880> flying<00:01:20.210> out<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.510> one<00:01:20.659> on

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
floor then come flying out the one on

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.260 
floor then come flying out the one on
the<00:01:20.810> top<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:22.220> game<00:01:22.369> really<00:01:22.580> plays<00:01:22.909> off<00:01:23.240> of

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
the top and the game really plays off of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.789 
the top and the game really plays off of
these<00:01:23.510> different<00:01:23.930> puzzle<00:01:24.320> elements<00:01:24.650> really

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
these different puzzle elements really

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.130 
these different puzzle elements really
well<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.220> form<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.760> really<00:01:26.330> interesting<00:01:26.930> kind

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
well to form a really interesting kind

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.500 
well to form a really interesting kind
of<00:01:27.229> mind-bending<00:01:27.860> game<00:01:28.400> but<00:01:29.210> what<00:01:29.360> really

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
of mind-bending game but what really

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.510 
of mind-bending game but what really
stands<00:01:29.869> out<00:01:30.080> about<00:01:30.320> portal<00:01:30.770> in<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.220> lot<00:01:31.340> of<00:01:31.369> ways

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
stands out about portal in a lot of ways

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.390 
stands out about portal in a lot of ways
is<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.820> writing<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.479> dialogue<00:01:32.720> is<00:01:33.409> amazing

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
is the writing the dialogue is amazing

probably ever created there are a ton of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.770 
probably ever created there are a ton of
different<00:01:39.080> jokes<00:01:39.920> in<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.280> game<00:01:40.460> that<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:41.330> won't

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
different jokes in the game that I won't

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.969 
different jokes in the game that I won't
really<00:01:41.930> go<00:01:42.080> into<00:01:42.229> too<00:01:42.409> much<00:01:42.439> detail<00:01:42.680> on

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
really go into too much detail on

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.140 
really go into too much detail on
because<00:01:43.189> they're<00:01:43.340> worth<00:01:43.460> experiencing<00:01:44.060> for

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
because they're worth experiencing for

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.179 
because they're worth experiencing for
yourself<00:01:44.540> it<00:01:45.200> feels<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:45.590> different<00:01:45.619> from

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
yourself it feels so different from

between the two platforms the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.890 
between the two platforms the
differences<00:04:36.880> are<00:04:37.000> more<00:04:37.120> kind<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.450> graphical

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
differences are more kind of graphical

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.870 
differences are more kind of graphical
in<00:04:38.020> nature<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.590> has<00:04:38.740> more<00:04:38.920> to<00:04:38.980> do<00:04:39.190> with<00:04:39.310> the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
in nature and it has more to do with the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.180 
in nature and it has more to do with the
different<00:04:40.270> power<00:04:40.510> of<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:41.440> know<00:04:41.530> whatever<00:04:41.710> PC
