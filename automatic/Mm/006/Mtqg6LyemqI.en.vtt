 January 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.820
 the Werderans 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.820
 solve and would 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.670
 Darkness lay over the Ruhr tide Ing and there he is hovering above the 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.670
 water 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.410
 So God created at the beginning of the creation story right at the beginning 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.360
 Day has the sky and she served 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.540
 our planet but then the name and what 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.809
 under pressure and had nine 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.190
 The Bible does not say that it does not say so warm in the beginning 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.049
 Chartered accountants in a tremendous mess his death over Bobo

 Tom Boonen 4 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.560
 so Rowan's word that we know it today is basically a huge mess 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.960
 mixed up in that God also bridges for organic decline 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 WDR DE the album will be

 Golob Kurti Solution To put some in the Koran I Harlow that our world

 as we know them today percent of customers the physical world Radu Muntean 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.970
 Start a compact size thereby less because of once serious 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.970
 kind 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.520
 Daimler so because the term used the Koran 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.450
 a body Merbanco Horb 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.320
 In Tehran and Antibes a splitting security software is taking place 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.690
 Walter so the second in large amount on the Development Corp. 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.990
 Nokia no separation between the Sun and Earth and Moon Mars is said to be the i Père 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.210
 Dr 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.500
 spoke briefly 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.470
 it will be light 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.470
 it became light 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.080
 the Altenaer cadres 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.490
 an eclipse 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.620
 Moreover, that does not mean relax 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.839
 and then life 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:14.059
 could restrict this spending so something is with the emergence during 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.899
 of science 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.899
 and the greens 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:24.140
 Galenica has a starting point that carries everything 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.000
 the size of a pinhead yet she says 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.719
 Euros as well as banks 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:34.279
 May terminate and it all comes to do that comes from the lore that 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:38.319
 Ghost everything was already pretty much before the release can listener 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.650
 fight she was pop rock the Bonneville Bonneville no live I see 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.569
 not necessarily as the originals on the other hand, now comes the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.230
 Creation story also nothing with the big bang theory the Seas goal is it 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.139
 is the smallest common intellectual men we look for 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.139
 can agree 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.629
 For each patient the big bang theory may be decided further 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.419
 Theories do not develop theory well so far I can not do that 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.299
 shut up how else would by Javier Villa where now yes she has to 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.039
 The bartender Skopek can not clarify 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.789
 The line-up that is the automatic starting point for Klose will not 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:12.380
 easy 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.129
 every victim 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.540
 the church is a milestone in the shipping history www itself 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.919
 or is that justified by an external occasion he is rare 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.009
 do you mean 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.429
 I do not believe that the world justifies itself, but rather became 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:32.719
 through a previous one and created the very first reason the reason for the 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.279
 Round namely compactness or we mean God 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:37.749
 call 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.749
 Patrick Breitenstein 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:44.489
 and as the origin of the big bang 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.510
 this view so the Vatican enforce as the big bang theory end of the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.439
 Twenties is formulated 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.349
 a discovery that owes them to a priest, too 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.689
 Scientist was 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.689
 already many people 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.179
 a look to Tübingen 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.749
 Hansen used to be a close friend of Pope Benedict the sixteenth 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.969
 today he is moderately regulated by the church the theologians are his sharpest 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.969
 adversary 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.880
 that is a very gratifying fact that it was a theologian 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.880
 for many girls a professor of 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.999
 choose the big-band Paoli 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.620
 has justified 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.090
 and basically that would have 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.439
 can definitely help 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.960
 the science 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.169
 the theology that they bring to each other 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:42.980
 it has 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.979
 Count often 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.939
 lacked in theology 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.289
 that did not understand well 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.619
 But the Big Bang also means a challenge 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.440
 the theology and the church 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.529
 the walk 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.759
 Volkmer not abused 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.839
 for a proof of God 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:08.189
 to prove with the big bang only that's how it started but what the cause 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:13.889
 is not a matter of proof Son is a matter of faith satisfaction 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.490
 the upper hand keeps 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:23.069
 meanwhile, the church usually seems to be entitled to their problem with the title 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.069
 to have 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.169
 according to the official version of the Vatican Observatory 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:34.720
 he remains the big bang 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.720
 the best explanation for the creation of the universe 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:40.139
 the big Bang Theory 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.139
 is not inconsistent with belief 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.229
 d 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:58.860
 on 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.819
 one and cut short called the light 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:02.759
 question 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.330
 and the darkness called Lienhard 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
 the first 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.239
 in Genesis he does what the world can do in just a week 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.720
 Strange if you know that the earth is the science of four 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.719
 Billion years old 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.750
