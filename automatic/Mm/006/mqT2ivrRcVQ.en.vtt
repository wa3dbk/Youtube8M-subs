Apple's website and for example here's
an<00:01:19.290> iPhone<00:01:19.619> 5c<00:01:20.220> let's<00:01:20.820> say<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.330> model

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
an iPhone 5c let's say you have model

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.100 
an iPhone 5c let's say you have model
1529<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.770> would<00:01:22.890> make<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.430> gsm<00:01:24.090> model<00:01:24.689> so

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
1529 that would make it a gsm model so

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.210 
1529 that would make it a gsm model so
that's<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> go<00:01:25.950> ahead<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that's how you're going to go ahead and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
that's how you're going to go ahead and
identify<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.880> device<00:01:27.090> rather<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.450> CDMA<00:01:28.020> or
