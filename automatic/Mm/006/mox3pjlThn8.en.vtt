did<00:02:31.019> not<00:02:31.200> upload<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.950> live<00:02:32.130> stream<00:02:32.519> because

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
did not upload the live stream because

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.600 
did not upload the live stream because
if<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:34.440> would<00:02:34.829> just<00:02:34.920> want<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> make<00:02:35.340> sense

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
if it would just want to make sense

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.729 
if it would just want to make sense
because<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.910> have<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.269> skip<00:02:36.450> around<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:37.200> 99<00:02:37.590> so

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
because you have to skip around to 99 so

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.560 
because you have to skip around to 99 so
I<00:02:37.799> just<00:02:37.980> made<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.250> highlight<00:02:38.579> video<00:02:38.850> anyways
