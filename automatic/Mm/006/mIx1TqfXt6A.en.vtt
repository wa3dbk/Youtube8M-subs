hey<00:00:01.920> guys<00:00:02.190> I<00:00:03.170> wanted<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.259> do<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> video<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:05.069> my

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
hey guys I wanted to do a video of my

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.589 
hey guys I wanted to do a video of my
gauges<00:00:06.440> cuz<00:00:07.440> whoever<00:00:07.710> sits<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.130> my<00:00:08.250> car<00:00:08.599> they

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
gauges cuz whoever sits on my car they

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.240 
gauges cuz whoever sits on my car they
always<00:00:09.809> ask<00:00:10.019> me<00:00:10.260> why<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.830> need<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.160> many

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
always ask me why you need so many

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.789 
always ask me why you need so many
gauges<00:00:11.519> what<00:00:12.059> do<00:00:12.150> they<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.620> well<00:00:13.620> let<00:00:13.769> me

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
gauges what do they do well let me

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.289 
gauges what do they do well let me
answer<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.190> question<00:00:14.700> for<00:00:14.940> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
pressure drops below six pounds I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.049 
pressure drops below six pounds I
believe<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:58.050> goes<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.609> goes<00:00:59.789> on

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
believe that goes on if that goes on

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.979 
believe that goes on if that goes on
there's<00:01:00.510> problems<00:01:01.190> shut<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> car<00:01:02.460> off<00:01:02.989> or

of course when you first up the car this
is<00:01:40.740> thick<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.430> oils<00:01:41.610> thick<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.270> until<00:01:42.689> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
is thick the oils thick so until it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
is thick the oils thick so until it
thins<00:01:42.960> out<00:01:43.170> when<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.770> first<00:01:43.950> started<00:01:44.250> shoots

thins out when you first started shoots
up<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.060> sixty<00:01:46.189> but<00:01:47.189> once<00:01:47.520> you're<00:01:47.729> Eiling

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
up to like sixty but once you're Eiling

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.690 
up to like sixty but once you're Eiling
Eiling<00:01:48.840> around<00:01:49.140> 1000<00:01:49.799> RP<00:01:50.270> LRO<00:01:51.270> 900<00:01:51.840> 800<00:01:52.700> 850

there you go water temperature gauge you

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.960 
there you go water temperature gauge you
need<00:02:11.989> that<00:02:12.170> that's<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.040> next<00:02:13.220> order<00:02:13.880> of

gauge<00:05:12.670> I<00:05:13.450> also<00:05:13.780> put<00:05:14.140> it<00:05:14.230> in<00:05:14.260> here<00:05:14.500> because<00:05:14.620> that

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800

depends what it's doing could be doing a
lot<00:05:30.850> of<00:05:30.880> things<00:05:31.090> here<00:05:31.270> but<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.690> lots<00:05:32.050> of<00:05:32.170> steady

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
lot of things here but a lots of steady

lot of things here but a lots of steady
and<00:05:33.400> idle<00:05:34.210> it<00:05:34.330> should<00:05:34.630> be<00:05:34.720> around<00:05:35.020> 9<00:05:35.140> 10<00:05:35.710> ish

you're<00:05:36.340> good<00:05:36.520> I'm<00:05:37.060> good<00:05:38.730> now<00:05:39.730> the<00:05:39.790> reason<00:05:40.300> I

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
you're good I'm good now the reason I

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.870 
you're good I'm good now the reason I
got<00:05:40.510> a<00:05:40.570> boost<00:05:41.020> gauge

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
got a boost gauge

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.880 
got a boost gauge
well<00:05:42.880> now<00:05:43.030> I'm<00:05:43.120> using<00:05:43.270> as<00:05:43.450> a<00:05:43.480> vacuum<00:05:43.720> gauge<00:05:43.900> but

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
well now I'm using as a vacuum gauge but

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.520 
well now I'm using as a vacuum gauge but
one<00:05:45.880> of<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.030> reasons<00:05:46.150> why<00:05:46.420> I<00:05:46.450> got<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:46.690> is

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
one of the reasons why I got that is

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.910 
one of the reasons why I got that is
because<00:05:47.740> I'm<00:05:47.890> gonna<00:05:48.040> go<00:05:48.190> supercharger<00:05:49.060> soon

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
because I'm gonna go supercharger soon

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.850 
because I'm gonna go supercharger soon
so<00:05:51.030> to<00:05:52.030> be<00:05:52.180> continued<00:05:55.320> damn<00:05:56.320> it's<00:05:56.500> cold

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
so to be continued damn it's cold

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.730 
so to be continued damn it's cold
