00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.770
 welcome this new profile 43 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.630
 opportunities let's see how they can 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.599
 activate the gates of the map called 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.670
 dragon fused obviously from tlc's 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.410
 tram I like this I do it for all 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.480
 people who are looking to complete the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.550
 mission called jumps into the water that you 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.190
 serves to unlock the weapon or the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.300
 pistol call only 6 or also for 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.949
 the people who are trying to 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.019
 get the achievement another game called 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.580
 fighter callegher then what 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.800
 we have to do is obviously play 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.900
 a game on the map called now with 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.360
 a video but they have to play a 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.489
 big conquest game to be able 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.960
 activate those floodgates since if they play 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.629
 another a new game as a network of 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.979
 links or domination or assault because no 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.080
 It will work for us because it is not going to 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.489
 let activate the floodgates the only thing 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.140
 what they have to do is take any 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.180
 vehicle or just get there walking 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.830
 let's get here until that 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.780
 sector and right now we're going 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.729
 to give the map simply what we have 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 what to do is go up and in the part of 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.809
 above we will find a console where 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.909
 we can activate the floodgates here 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.290
 this dragon map sunk as they are given 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.640
 account then that I will show you in 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.950
 the map simply have to arrive 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.820
 until this location is quite 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.050
 simple 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.550
 in the console on the left 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.260
 where are these screens we can 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.640
 activate the floodgates of the map 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.590
 pressing this button 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.200
 then it's quite easy on a computer 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.420
 for it is the key to buses 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.430
 button x 5 and a play station is with the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.619
 square button doing this that we 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.450
 we can realize that what happens is 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.460
 that begins to enter something to this 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.470
 sector where the objective is and what 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.540
 we want to flood all that sector and already 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.280
 when we try to enter the dragon a 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.869
 video that is this restaurant that is 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.270
 because the front because we will have 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.550
 than doing it swimming then it's like that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.170
 easy the truth has nothing complicated 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.910
 activate the bus doors 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.950
 just know where they are 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.630
 the floodgates is pretty simple 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.280
 so I hope you liked the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.680
 video if it was that well we left a 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.509
 like favorites as an entity that seems to them 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.340
 this to activate the floodgates 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.420
 again do not forget to subscribe to 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.920
 channel if you have not done it yet 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.780
 so I hope you can activate the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.000
 floodgates will surely get the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.500
 achievement of the trophy or soon in arms and 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.280
 is what they are looking for and we 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.280
 we see until the next 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.390
 but no
