00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.679
 degrees and then casual nose monterrey is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.380
 a need is that simply sometimes 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.170
 decide hey today is monday monday of 40 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.410
 degrees suddenly comes out that is 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.810
 Wednesday Wednesday I would like to give you 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
 something different what if we leave them to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.699
 minus 10 degrees if you like the variety 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.070
 climatic definitively monterrey this 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.320
 city but do not get distracted from the subject 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 because today I bring you 3 curious facts 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.700
 atom number 1 did you know that the seven 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.710
 main characters of 'spongebob' 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.579
 be inspired by the seven sins 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.579
 capitals 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.489
 and a crab would be greed like 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.680
 we all know don crabs this is 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.410
 all about money money money money 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.510
 money money plankton would be envy 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.309
 because we have already seen in all 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.949
 chapters that always tries to steal 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.339
 the success in Greco tries to send it to the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.320
 ruin or always try to do something 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.720
 because he is jealous of the success of a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.060
 Patrician crab is laziness because 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.710
 for the love of god 'won the prize of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.259
 the person who has done nothing during the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.520
 more time now would be the pride 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.310
 because she's always bragging that 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 is a squirrel of texas and that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.550
 It symbolizes that she is super cool and that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 she in texas all are well wow and the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.289
 garrafones that can be heads and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.390
 all that roll with your hands and they 're going to go 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.970
 here I really did not see that coming 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.820
 because squid is not a character so 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.320
 nice and so cute obviously we do not know 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.850
 the squid is anger because always 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.610
 I was seeing everyone who makes a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.180
 sponge and patrician and forgetting income 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.120
 From his job 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.090
 basically everything 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.000
 it looks like my home and is described 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.400
 like gluttony or gluttony you already know 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.920
 that you're stuck with food during 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.110
 all the time and the last but not the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.810
 least important 'bob sponge' 'bob 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.480
 sponge 'is described as lust 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.730
 but not in the calm sexual sense 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.460
 wait lust is described as being 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.950
 passionate about something and as we know what 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.050
 what sponge is passionate about basically 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.500
 everything loves his work with madness and with 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.450
 A lot of passion loves to go fishing 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.880
 jellyfish and he loves to go out with his 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.920
 friends is very very extreme in terms of 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.040
 the things that he likes and that's why 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.930
 flame lust data number 2 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.240
 did you know that blue eyes actually 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.340
 they are a mutation and so many of 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.160
 you may already know this information but 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.020
 There are some that do not and that's why I come to 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.760
 informing them about melanin is one thing that 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.950
 makes our skin have the color that 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.600
 our eyes are dark that our 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.110
 hair be 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.570
 of some color and so on and this mutation that 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.210
 causes blue eyes and also clarifies 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.880
 and light hair is rather something that 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.490
 attacks these proteins that prevents 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.500
 the melanin attack completely instead 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:04.440
 of giving you 10 points of melanin gives you 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.630
 5 and that's why it has this is clearer but 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.340
 lighter eyes clearer what it is like 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.890
 it is obvious people with a lot of mania 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.510
 be African Americans and people with 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.270
 very little melanin would be the redheads 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.490
 and the albinos do not have melanin in 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.880
 absolute so you already know lack of 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.670
 melanin the only mutation that is 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.560
 accepted by society data number 3 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.050
 this data will love people 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.760
 technological bloggers photographers this 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.160
 kind of people you know but on camera 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.890
 normal use or so you have 18 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.500
 megapixels I do not know what a panoramic or 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.870
 whatever it is since not so long ago 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.240
 has taken a picture of Machu Picchu with 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:49.020
 a camera of 15.9 and pixel 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.930
 beam pixels but kate 4 is a pixel day 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.760
 a thousand times more than a mega pixel is , 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.070
 this camera that I am using in this 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.680
 moment is 18 megapixels good 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.690
 imagine basically having a thousand times 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.170
 better resolution than that is to say is a 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.170
 Photography 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:13.720
 it's a photograph so so good that 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.720
 you can be how many times farc 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.800
 same 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.009
 that is, it is such a good photograph that 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.139
 you can zoom in how many times 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.090
 you want and the image is still going to be 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.949
 better than any photo taken with your 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.360
 cellular so you're probably 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.130
