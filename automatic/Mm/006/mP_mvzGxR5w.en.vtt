pound<00:01:55.590> already<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.220> we<00:01:56.429> also<00:01:56.610> talked<00:01:56.940> about

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
pound already and we also talked about

pound already and we also talked about
it<00:01:57.330> on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.569> last<00:01:57.720> episode<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.319> it<00:01:58.380> seems<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it on the last episode but it seems that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.559 
it on the last episode but it seems that
there<00:01:59.100> are<00:01:59.130> more<00:01:59.520> moves<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.209> we<00:02:00.300> haven't

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
there are more moves that we haven't

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.690 
there are more moves that we haven't
seen<00:02:00.810> yet<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.319> wonder<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.069> these<00:02:02.220> are<00:02:02.429> and<00:02:02.459> if

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
seen yet I wonder what these are and if

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.249 
seen yet I wonder what these are and if
they<00:02:02.850> also<00:02:03.000> scale<00:02:03.420> accordingly<00:02:03.929> to<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
they also scale accordingly to the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.840 
they also scale accordingly to the
number<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.679> humans<00:02:05.130> you're<00:02:05.310> invading

number of humans you're invading

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.850 
number of humans you're invading
according<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.630> George<00:02:06.959> groups<00:02:07.500> are<00:02:07.709> more

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
according to George groups are more

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.130 
according to George groups are more
susceptible<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.729> OE<00:02:09.090> attacks<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.810> having

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
susceptible to a OE attacks so having

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.470 
susceptible to a OE attacks so having
more<00:02:10.440> humans<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.190> risk<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.849> well<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
more humans is a risk as well as a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.190 
more humans is a risk as well as a
benefit

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
benefit

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.199 
benefit
besides<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.830> AOE<00:02:14.160> skills<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.819> we<00:02:14.940> haven't

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
besides the AOE skills that we haven't

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.790 
besides the AOE skills that we haven't
heard<00:02:15.420> about<00:02:15.660> yet<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.230> night<00:02:16.410> hunters

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
heard about yet the night hunters

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.980 
heard about yet the night hunters
abilities<00:02:17.340> will<00:02:17.580> also<00:02:18.030> scale<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:18.599> more

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990

abilities will also scale as more
players<00:02:19.500> join<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.490> you'll<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.849> able<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.270> use

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
players join so you'll be able to use

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.080 
players join so you'll be able to use
them<00:02:21.690> more<00:02:21.959> often<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.590> more<00:02:22.830> aggressively<00:02:23.430> so

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
them more often and more aggressively so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.790 
them more often and more aggressively so

depending on the number of human players
you're<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.099> against<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.610> cooldowns<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.209> your

you're up against the cooldowns on your
abilities<00:02:27.840> will<00:02:28.020> be<00:02:28.050> different

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
abilities will be different

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.980 
abilities will be different
they<00:02:29.190> might<00:02:29.400> also<00:02:29.670> do<00:02:29.819> more<00:02:30.000> damage<00:02:30.240> but<00:02:30.630> that

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
they might also do more damage but that

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.750 
they might also do more damage but that
much<00:02:31.230> isn't<00:02:31.590> clear<00:02:31.829> from<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.189> answer<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:32.579> got

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
much isn't clear from the answer we got

another factor that's being used to
balance<00:02:35.069> this<00:02:35.189> game-mode<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.239> number<00:02:36.540> of

humans have humans also respond just

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.560 
humans have humans also respond just
like<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.310> night<00:02:41.490> hunter<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.240> they<00:02:42.360> have<00:02:42.540> a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
like the night hunter but they have a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.810 
like the night hunter but they have a
limited<00:02:42.870> number<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.500> lives<00:02:43.860> whilst<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.670> night

hunter will only stop respawning once
you<00:02:47.250> destroy<00:02:47.430> all<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.120> zombie<00:02:48.450> hives<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
you destroy all the zombie hives the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.960 
you destroy all the zombie hives the
number<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.590> lives<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.220> humans<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:50.790> is

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
number of lives that the humans have is

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.850 
number of lives that the humans have is
shared<00:02:51.330> between<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.900> players<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.440> no<00:02:52.650> matter

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
shared between the players so no matter

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.310 
shared between the players so no matter
how<00:02:53.010> many<00:02:53.550> humans<00:02:54.030> you're<00:02:54.180> up<00:02:54.300> against<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
how many humans you're up against as the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.020 
how many humans you're up against as the
night<00:02:55.470> hunter<00:02:55.680> you'll<00:02:56.010> always<00:02:56.310> need<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:57.000> have

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
night hunter you'll always need to have

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.660 
night hunter you'll always need to have
a<00:02:57.180> certain<00:02:57.540> number<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.230> kills<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:59.250> example

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
a certain number of kills for example

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.760 
a certain number of kills for example
let's<00:02:59.850> imagine<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.510> humans<00:03:00.840> have<00:03:01.050> four<00:03:01.410> lives

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
let's imagine the humans have four lives

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.710 
let's imagine the humans have four lives
if<00:03:02.130> you're<00:03:02.670> playing<00:03:02.880> against<00:03:03.240> two<00:03:03.420> players

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
that means you have to kill each one

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.000 
that means you have to kill each one
twice<00:03:05.880> or<00:03:06.450> one<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.990> them<00:03:07.140> three<00:03:07.380> times<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.920> the

twice or one of them three times and the

twice or one of them three times and the
other<00:03:08.130> one<00:03:08.400> only<00:03:08.640> once<00:03:08.970> if<00:03:09.570> you're<00:03:09.750> playing

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
other one only once if you're playing

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.540 
other one only once if you're playing
against<00:03:10.260> four<00:03:10.440> players<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.010> they<00:03:11.070> still<00:03:11.340> have

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
against four players and they still have

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.310 
against four players and they still have
four<00:03:11.820> lives<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.630> have<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.900> kill<00:03:13.080> each

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
four lives you just have to kill each

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.620 
four lives you just have to kill each
human<00:03:13.860> player<00:03:14.190> once<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.120> know<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.330> can

means<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:51.900> overall<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.739> will<00:03:52.980> make<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.519> nests

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
means but overall it will make the nests

means but overall it will make the nests
harder<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.570> destroy<00:03:54.930> maybe<00:03:55.709> they<00:03:55.890> simply<00:03:56.220> take

harder to destroy maybe they simply take

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.949 
harder to destroy maybe they simply take
