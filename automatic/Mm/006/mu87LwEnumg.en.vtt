00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
readiness is showing is zero we don't

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.490

readiness<00:04:05.280> is<00:04:05.430> one<00:04:05.580> of<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.790> new<00:04:05.970> stats<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.660> it

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
readiness is one of the new stats and it

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.690 
readiness is one of the new stats and it
increases<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.470> cooldown<00:04:07.920> recovery<00:04:08.460> right

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
increases the cooldown recovery right

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.960 
increases the cooldown recovery right
for<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:10.560> it's<00:04:10.800> not<00:04:10.920> Blizzard<00:04:11.430> it's<00:04:11.580> me<00:04:11.730> being

for so it's not Blizzard it's me being
an<00:04:12.120> idiot<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:13.430> forgetting<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.550> readiness

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
an idiot and forgetting that readiness

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.120 
an idiot and forgetting that readiness
is<00:04:15.180> one<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.600> new<00:04:15.750> secondary<00:04:16.260> stats<00:04:16.680> so

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
is one of the new secondary stats so

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.900 
is one of the new secondary stats so
here's<00:04:17.340> what<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.549> gear<00:04:17.760> looks<00:04:17.940> like<00:04:18.890> it's<00:04:19.910> of
