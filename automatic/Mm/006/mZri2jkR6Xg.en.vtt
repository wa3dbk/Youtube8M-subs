00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello everyone today we will make a 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.860
 ideal characterization makeup 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.469
 the film of the 'mechanical orange' to 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.789
 request of one of our subscribers 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.629
 and if you want to know how he did it 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.629
 seeker 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.260
 all right 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.160
 in the photo that I was inspired to do 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.470
 this makeup the actor tends to have 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.140
 a reddish pigmentation below 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.989
 his eyes and on the fin of his nose 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.940
 this is a natural pigmentation of the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.640
 white skins the brown skins 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.690
 they also tend to have it if it's not a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.760
 very orange tone is something more violet 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.449
 but it is natural and it is what always 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.460
 we covered with with correctors but this 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.250
 let's take advantage of all those aspects 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.350
 that maybe in other makeups could 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.449
 be negative now we are going to use them 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.159
 as positive 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.049
 only me as I am too 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.530
 generous I will apply a little bit of 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:07.140
 corrector in the part below and a 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.650
 little bit of dust and then 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 we will proceed to make up the eyes 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.220

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.330
 plus 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.280
 now we will give it to our eyebrows a 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.259
 touch more charged with a brown tone if your 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.390
 skin is dark and your eyebrows are dark 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.770

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.770
 contour of the face 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.930
 now we will use an orange tone to 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.090
 Give a little more drama in 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.730
