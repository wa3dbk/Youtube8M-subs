thing<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.450> blue<00:00:48.450> turns<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.989> blue<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.620> point<00:00:49.920> for

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
thing a blue turns on blue in point for

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
thing a blue turns on blue in point for
blue<00:00:50.309> yay<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.809> hit<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> can

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
blue yay then you hit this and you can

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
blue yay then you hit this and you can
play<00:00:52.890> another<00:00:52.980> round<00:00:53.160> doesn't<00:00:53.789> reset<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
play another round doesn't reset that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
play another round doesn't reset that
doesn't<00:00:54.600> reset<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.219> there<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.340> no

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
doesn't reset that there is no

doesn't reset that there is no
scoreboard<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.149> ties<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.870> felt<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.530> would<00:00:58.770> be

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
scoreboard for ties I felt that would be

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.939 
scoreboard for ties I felt that would be
extremely<00:01:00.000> pointless<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.260> waste<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.800> lot

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
extremely pointless and a waste of a lot

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.190 
extremely pointless and a waste of a lot
of<00:01:02.070> space<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.180> did<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.140> but

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
of space so I did not put that in but

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.850 
of space so I did not put that in but
yeah<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.970> will<00:01:09.570> display<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> extremely

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
yeah so it will display it extremely

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.410 
yeah so it will display it extremely
quick<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.490> reset<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.780> soon<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.770> hit<00:01:13.890> that

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
quick and reset as soon as you hit that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.240 
quick and reset as soon as you hit that
or<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.750> soon<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.049> these<00:01:16.140> fears<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.530> turn<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:16.890> you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
can reset it that's how fast the system

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.070 
can reset it that's how fast the system
is<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.670> choke<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.270> points<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.750> until

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
is and it will choke up points up until

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.929 
is and it will choke up points up until
nine<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:24.140> nine<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.500> B<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.799> C<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:28.310> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.759> guys

go ahead best two out of three is what i
recommend<00:01:34.860> though<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.090> how<00:01:36.689> these

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
recommend though so how these

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630 
recommend though so how these
scoreboards<00:01:37.619> work<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> reset

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
scoreboards work is they have a reset

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.780 
scoreboards work is they have a reset
that<00:01:39.210> when<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> hit<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> button<00:01:40.159> it<00:01:41.159> cycles

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that when you hit the button it cycles

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.480 
that when you hit the button it cycles
all<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.420> way<00:01:42.509> back<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.899> zero<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:44.130> has<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.399> go

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
all the way back to zero it has to go

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.830 
all the way back to zero it has to go
through<00:01:44.549> all<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> numbers<00:01:45.210> there's<00:01:45.600> kind<00:01:45.810> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
through all the numbers there's kind of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.670 
through all the numbers there's kind of
no<00:01:45.899> way<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.290> around<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:48.320> just<00:01:49.320> let<00:01:49.530> this

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
no way to get around that just let this

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.490 
no way to get around that just let this
course<00:01:50.520> its<00:01:50.670> way<00:01:50.790> through<00:01:51.090> 9a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
course its way through 9a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.900 
course its way through 9a
a<00:01:52.530> B<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.090> C<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:55.950> it'll<00:01:56.130> hit<00:01:56.280> zero<00:01:56.580> and

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
a B and C and then it'll hit zero and

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.330 
a B and C and then it'll hit zero and
stop<00:01:57.800> alright<00:01:58.800> so<00:01:59.460> how<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.540> works<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.190> or<00:02:02.190> you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
stop alright so how that works is or you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.100 
stop alright so how that works is or you
know<00:02:02.430> better<00:02:02.970> demo<00:02:03.240> head<00:02:03.360> over<00:02:03.510> here<00:02:03.690> we<00:02:03.930> got

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
know better demo head over here we got

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.840 
know better demo head over here we got
two<00:02:04.229> points<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:06.470> cycle<00:02:07.470> through<00:02:07.860> three<00:02:08.310> all

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
two points here cycle through three all

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.699 
two points here cycle through three all
right<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.450> how<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.780> works<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:12.440> button<00:02:13.440> goes

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
right so how it works is the button goes

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.340 
right so how it works is the button goes
to<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.100> RS<00:02:14.430> nor<00:02:14.610> latch<00:02:14.780> which<00:02:15.780> gets<00:02:16.020> flipped

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
to this RS nor latch which gets flipped

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.290 
to this RS nor latch which gets flipped
and<00:02:17.310> goes<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.150> gate<00:02:19.610> which<00:02:20.610> lets<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
and goes to this and gate which lets the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.560 
and goes to this and gate which lets the
clock<00:02:21.600> circuit<00:02:22.140> through<00:02:23.060> which<00:02:24.060> goes<00:02:24.540> through

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
clock circuit through which goes through

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.770 
clock circuit through which goes through
this<00:02:24.900> monostable<00:02:25.380> circuit<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.630> spirals<00:02:27.630> this

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
this monostable circuit and spirals this

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.949 
this monostable circuit and spirals this
around<00:02:28.580> until<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.670> reaches<00:02:30.000> zero<00:02:30.300> which<00:02:30.810> it

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
around until it reaches zero which it

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.320 
around until it reaches zero which it
just<00:02:31.140> did<00:02:31.320> when<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.160> reaches<00:02:32.520> 0<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:34.200> 0<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:36.090> 0

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
just did when it reaches 0 the 0 this 0

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.690 
just did when it reaches 0 the 0 this 0
is<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.170> only<00:02:37.380> one<00:02:37.739> with<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.190> block<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.580> this

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
is the only one with a block in this

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.360 
is the only one with a block in this
space<00:02:38.989> so<00:02:39.989> when<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.500> reaches<00:02:40.770> zero<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
space so when it reaches zero the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.960 
space so when it reaches zero the
current<00:02:41.670> goes<00:02:41.820> through<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:44.160> RS<00:02:44.790> nor

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
current goes through and to this RS nor

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.820 
current goes through and to this RS nor
latch<00:02:45.030> which<00:02:45.720> flips<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.320> Arsenal<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.680> look

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
latch which flips the Arsenal I look

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.890 
latch which flips the Arsenal I look
back<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> clock<00:02:48.030> current<00:02:48.390> can<00:02:48.630> no<00:02:48.720> longer

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
back so the clock current can no longer

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.710 
back so the clock current can no longer
get<00:02:49.140> through<00:02:49.320> this<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.560> gate<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:51.120> that'll

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
get through this and gate so that'll

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.020 
get through this and gate so that'll
cycle<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.080> all<00:02:52.140> go<00:02:52.260> back<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.440> zero<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.910> were

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
cycle it all go back to zero if I were

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.280 
cycle it all go back to zero if I were
to<00:02:54.120> press<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.390> reset<00:02:54.630> button<00:02:54.690> again<00:02:54.989> nothing

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
to press the reset button again nothing

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.330 
to press the reset button again nothing
would<00:02:55.380> happen<00:02:55.530> because<00:02:55.800> it's<00:02:56.010> already<00:02:56.190> at

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
would happen because it's already at

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.520 
would happen because it's already at
zero<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.880> trying<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.750> flip<00:02:57.959> an<00:02:58.170> hour<00:02:58.260> the

wrong torch when RS nor latch doesn't do

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.560 
wrong torch when RS nor latch doesn't do
anything<00:03:01.100> so<00:03:02.100> that's<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.489> works<00:03:02.610> if<00:03:03.450> you

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
anything so that's how that works if you

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.759 
anything so that's how that works if you
guys<00:03:03.720> are<00:03:03.870> wondering<00:03:03.989> though<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.350> put<00:03:04.680> these

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
guys are wondering though I put these

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.630 
guys are wondering though I put these
furnaces<00:03:05.250> here<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.880> prevent<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:07.440> ejection<00:03:08.160> of

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
furnaces here to prevent the ejection of

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.100 
furnaces here to prevent the ejection of
data<00:03:09.150> which<00:03:09.540> seems<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.620> happening<00:03:12.110> fairly

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
data which seems to be happening fairly

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.350 
data which seems to be happening fairly
rarely<00:03:13.380> but<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:13.980> still<00:03:14.370> happens<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.209> if<00:03:15.269> you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
rarely but it still happens so if you

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.580 
rarely but it still happens so if you
guys<00:03:15.480> want<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.750> improve<00:03:15.930> your<00:03:16.019> system<00:03:16.380> she's

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
guys want to improve your system she's

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.960 
guys want to improve your system she's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
up to resets from below that's right I

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.199 
up to resets from below that's right I
filled<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.350> in<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:51.049> they<00:03:52.880> come<00:03:53.880> through

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
filled this in and they come through

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.330 
filled this in and they come through
here<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:55.470> so

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
here like so

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.140 
here like so

the piston extends into the current and

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.710 
the piston extends into the current and
I'm<00:04:06.610> going<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.849> turn<00:04:06.970> my<00:04:07.120> sound<00:04:07.300> on<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:07.599> you<00:04:07.660> can

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
I'm going to turn my sound on so you can

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.910 
I'm going to turn my sound on so you can
actually<00:04:07.900> hear<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:10.349> so<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.620> piston<00:04:12.870> extends

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
actually hear it so the piston extends

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.229 
actually hear it so the piston extends
crap<00:04:17.459> let's<00:04:18.459> see<00:04:18.579> if<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:18.729> can<00:04:18.760> actually<00:04:19.000> get

crap let's see if I can actually get

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.270 
crap let's see if I can actually get

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
the current passes through to flash

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.230 
the current passes through to flash
those<00:04:27.790> torches<00:04:28.030> on<00:04:28.270> like<00:04:28.449> you<00:04:28.540> just<00:04:28.690> saw

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
those torches on like you just saw

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.940 
those torches on like you just saw

causing the RS nor latch is to flip and
these<00:04:35.950> are<00:04:36.220> stars<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.760> reset<00:04:37.180> when<00:04:38.669> if<00:04:39.669> filter

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
these are stars to reset when if filter

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.469 
these are stars to reset when if filter
if<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.690> wire<00:04:41.229> is<00:04:41.260> off<00:04:41.500> on<00:04:41.530> top<00:04:42.389> resetting<00:04:43.389> the

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
if the wire is off on top resetting the

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.290 
if the wire is off on top resetting the
game<00:04:43.660> so<00:04:44.440> from<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.160> Arsenal<00:04:45.490> latches<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.150> gets

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
game so from the Arsenal latches it gets

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.370 
game so from the Arsenal latches it gets
inverted<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:48.510> pulled<00:04:49.510> out<00:04:49.810> two<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.130> gates

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
inverted and pulled out two and gates

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.180 
inverted and pulled out two and gates
now<00:04:53.380> these<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.669> gates<00:04:55.260> lead<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.979> blue

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
now these and gates lead to the blue

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.469 
now these and gates lead to the blue
inside<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.110> take<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.650> blue<00:05:00.070> rock<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.639> the

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
inside so I take the blue rock and the

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.100 
inside so I take the blue rock and the
red<00:05:01.990> scissors<00:05:02.410> and<00:05:03.479> push<00:05:04.479> them<00:05:04.660> to<00:05:04.840> one<00:05:04.990> and

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
red scissors and push them to one and

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.830 
red scissors and push them to one and
gate<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:05.789> then<00:05:06.789> have<00:05:07.060> their<00:05:07.620> win<00:05:08.639> detection

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
gate and then have their win detection

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.379 
gate and then have their win detection
go<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.900> there<00:05:11.169> then<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:12.100> take<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.669> blue<00:05:13.120> paper

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
go to there then I take the blue paper

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.560 
go to there then I take the blue paper
the<00:05:14.200> Red<00:05:14.229> Rock<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.099> blue<00:05:16.000> scissors<00:05:16.360> and

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
the Red Rock and the blue scissors and

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.300 
the Red Rock and the blue scissors and
the<00:05:16.660> red<00:05:16.810> paper<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.500> those<00:05:17.710> go<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:17.979> separate

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
the red paper and those go to separate

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.100 
the red paper and those go to separate
and<00:05:18.430> gates<00:05:18.639> and<00:05:18.940> those<00:05:19.570> all<00:05:19.750> get<00:05:19.930> hooked

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
and gates and those all get hooked

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.830 
and gates and those all get hooked
together<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:20.740> go<00:05:21.550> to<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.760> blue<00:05:21.880> win<00:05:22.060> since

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
together and go to the blue win since

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.990 
together and go to the blue win since
this<00:05:23.080> is<00:05:23.380> the<00:05:23.440> blue<00:05:23.800> one<00:05:23.950> scoreboard<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:24.729> also

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
this is the blue one scoreboard I also

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.810 
this is the blue one scoreboard I also
split<00:05:25.510> off<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:26.289> final<00:05:27.250> blue<00:05:27.370> in<00:05:27.490> detection

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
split off the final blue in detection

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.529 
split off the final blue in detection
and<00:05:28.620> put<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:29.770> directly<00:05:30.250> in<00:05:30.940> front<00:05:30.970> of<00:05:31.389> this

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
and put it directly in front of this

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.110 
and put it directly in front of this
monostable<00:05:31.960> circuit<00:05:32.460> so<00:05:33.460> that<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:34.450> could<00:05:34.720> a

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
monostable circuit so that I could a

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.950 
monostable circuit so that I could a
clock<00:05:37.120> up<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.720> point<00:05:38.260> for<00:05:38.620> blue<00:05:39.099> whenever<00:05:39.490> a

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
clock up the point for blue whenever a

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.589 
clock up the point for blue whenever a
blue<00:05:40.960> wind<00:05:41.169> comes<00:05:41.590> through<00:05:42.000> so<00:05:43.000> then<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:43.419> same

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
blue wind comes through so then the same

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.540 
blue wind comes through so then the same
thing<00:05:43.660> for<00:05:44.139> the<00:05:44.200> ties<00:05:44.470> rock<00:05:44.950> rock<00:05:45.190> paper

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
thing for the ties rock rock paper

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.029 
thing for the ties rock rock paper
scissors<00:05:45.940> scissors<00:05:46.120> is<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:47.470> only<00:05:47.590> difference

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
scissors scissors is the only difference

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.360 
scissors scissors is the only difference
and<00:05:48.340> then<00:05:48.460> this<00:05:48.610> is<00:05:48.729> red<00:05:48.910> wind<00:05:49.680> which<00:05:50.680> goes<00:05:51.190> off

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
and then this is red wind which goes off

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.370 
and then this is red wind which goes off
to<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.580> same<00:05:51.729> man<00:05:51.880> Kate<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.240> then<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:52.840> take<00:05:53.169> the

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
to the same man Kate and then I take the

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.520 
to the same man Kate and then I take the
road<00:05:53.620> win<00:05:53.800> detection<00:05:54.840> string<00:05:55.840> it<00:05:55.960> up<00:05:56.050> here

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
road win detection string it up here

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.270 
road win detection string it up here
over<00:05:57.520> and<00:05:58.349> basically<00:05:59.349> do<00:05:59.590> the<00:05:59.650> same<00:05:59.770> thing<00:06:00.130> for

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
over and basically do the same thing for

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.800 
over and basically do the same thing for
here<00:06:00.490> as<00:06:00.610> i<00:06:00.729> did<00:06:00.880> over<00:06:01.030> there<00:06:01.240> i<00:06:01.300> put<00:06:01.479> it<00:06:01.750> in

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
here as i did over there i put it in

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.210 
here as i did over there i put it in
front<00:06:01.960> of<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.110> mount<00:06:02.260> of<00:06:02.349> stable<00:06:02.710> and

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
front of the mount of stable and

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.700 
front of the mount of stable and
whenever<00:06:03.849> i<00:06:04.000> were<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:04.389> get<00:06:04.599> a<00:06:04.630> point<00:06:04.930> it<00:06:05.409> would

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
whenever i were to get a point it would

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.520 
whenever i were to get a point it would
go<00:06:06.190> through<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.430> mount<00:06:06.580> of<00:06:06.640> stable<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.530> clock

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
go through the mount of stable and clock

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.350 
go through the mount of stable and clock
up<00:06:08.680> one

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
up one

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.570 
up one
point<00:06:09.960> for<00:06:10.530> red<00:06:11.750> a<00:06:12.750> fairly<00:06:13.650> simplistic<00:06:13.979> system

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
point for red a fairly simplistic system

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.040 
point for red a fairly simplistic system
if<00:06:14.729> you<00:06:14.759> just<00:06:15.060> understood<00:06:15.419> anything<00:06:15.780> I<00:06:16.020> just

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
if you just understood anything I just

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.279 
if you just understood anything I just
said<00:06:17.150> and<00:06:18.150> for<00:06:18.810> those<00:06:18.900> of<00:06:18.960> you<00:06:19.169> wondering

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
said and for those of you wondering

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.860 
said and for those of you wondering
these<00:06:19.889> are<00:06:20.189> very<00:06:20.969> old<00:06:23.509> seven<00:06:24.509> segment

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
these are very old seven segment

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.860 
these are very old seven segment
displays<00:06:25.199> that<00:06:26.159> explains<00:06:26.729> the<00:06:26.969> super<00:06:27.300> stupid

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
displays that explains the super stupid

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.029 
displays that explains the super stupid
and<00:06:28.460> dumb<00:06:29.460> wiring<00:06:29.960> for<00:06:30.960> the<00:06:30.990> middle<00:06:31.560> section

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
and dumb wiring for the middle section

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.670 
and dumb wiring for the middle section
but<00:06:32.909> I<00:06:32.939> made<00:06:33.240> these<00:06:33.330> long<00:06:33.629> long<00:06:34.139> time<00:06:34.409> ago<00:06:34.469> I

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
but I made these long long time ago I

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.320 
but I made these long long time ago I
think<00:06:35.009> I<00:06:35.099> made<00:06:35.280> these<00:06:35.460> when<00:06:36.889> 1.3<00:06:37.889> came<00:06:38.400> out<00:06:38.580> so

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
think I made these when 1.3 came out so

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.689 
think I made these when 1.3 came out so
they're<00:06:39.509> fairly<00:06:40.050> old<00:06:40.349> you<00:06:41.189> could<00:06:41.400> probably

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
they're fairly old you could probably

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.439 
they're fairly old you could probably
improve<00:06:42.210> them<00:06:42.419> on<00:06:42.599> the<00:06:43.080> middle<00:06:43.759> but<00:06:44.759> that's<00:06:45.060> up

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
improve them on the middle but that's up

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.070 
improve them on the middle but that's up
to<00:06:45.479> you<00:06:45.629> guys<00:06:47.120> but<00:06:48.120> that<00:06:48.270> is<00:06:48.449> the<00:06:48.479> basics<00:06:48.960> of
