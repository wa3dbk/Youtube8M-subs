today i'm going to show you how to draw

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.299 
today i'm going to show you how to draw
a<00:00:06.690> cone<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.350> google<00:00:07.980> sketchup<00:00:09.290> so<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.349> begin<00:00:10.769> we

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
a cone in google sketchup so to begin we

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.839 
a cone in google sketchup so to begin we
will<00:00:11.340> delete<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.179> person<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.309> draw<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> circle

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
will delete this person in draw a circle

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.519 
will delete this person in draw a circle
on<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.780> bottom<00:00:16.730> plane<00:00:17.779> when<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.050> two<00:00:19.230> feet

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
on the bottom plane when we get two feet

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.060 
on the bottom plane when we get two feet
next<00:00:22.529> we'll<00:00:22.830> grab<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.279> line<00:00:23.550> tool<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.890> draw<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
next we'll grab the line tool and draw a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.580 
next we'll grab the line tool and draw a
line<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.460> straight<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.630> height<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
line going straight up the height of the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.939 
line going straight up the height of the
cone<00:00:29.220> everyone<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:31.170> case<00:00:31.439> when<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.679> get

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
cone everyone in this case when we get

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.150 
cone everyone in this case when we get
five<00:00:32.160> feet<00:00:35.840> since<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> line<00:00:37.230> tool<00:00:37.500> continues

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
five feet since the line tool continues

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.790 
five feet since the line tool continues
we<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.210> draw<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> line<00:00:39.510> straight<00:00:39.930> down<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.620> any

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
we just draw a line straight down to any

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.729 
we just draw a line straight down to any
point<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> circle<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.500> from<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
point on the circle and then from that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.810 
point on the circle and then from that
point<00:00:43.920> back<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:45.870> center<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:47.520> should<00:00:47.700> not

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
point back to the center you should not

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.810 
point back to the center you should not
have<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> triangle<00:00:49.219> going<00:00:50.219> vertical<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
have a triangle going vertical in the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.680 
have a triangle going vertical in the
circle<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.020> horizontal<00:00:52.680> plane<00:00:53.510> once<00:00:54.510> you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
circle on the horizontal plane once you

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.959 
circle on the horizontal plane once you
have<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.989> go<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> tools<00:00:55.820> follow<00:00:56.820> me<00:00:58.789> grab<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
have this go to tools follow me grab the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.540 
have this go to tools follow me grab the
triangle<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.780> bring<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.770> around<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.309> whole

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
triangle and bring it around the whole

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.250 
triangle and bring it around the whole
circle<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.420> now<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.500> cone<00:01:04.760> if<00:01:06.260> for

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
circle and now you have your cone if for

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
circle and now you have your cone if for
some<00:01:07.290> reason<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:07.890> cone<00:01:08.159> doesn't<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
some reason your cone doesn't have a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.460 
some reason your cone doesn't have a
bottom<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.560> grab<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> line<00:01:11.189> tool

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
bottom to it then grab the line tool

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.859 
bottom to it then grab the line tool
from<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> center<00:01:14.010> draw<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> line<00:01:15.210> going<00:01:15.630> across

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
from the center draw a line going across

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.320 
from the center draw a line going across
the<00:01:16.170> whole<00:01:16.200> thing<00:01:19.729> then<00:01:20.729> once<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.119> done

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the whole thing then once that's done

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.570 
the whole thing then once that's done
you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.810> delete<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.470> line<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> just

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you can delete the line that you just

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.750 
you can delete the line that you just
finished<00:01:23.970> drawing

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.520 

now<00:01:29.760> if<00:01:29.910> you<00:01:30.030> want<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.300> circle<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.750> cone<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
now if you want to circle a cone it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.970 
now if you want to circle a cone it
doesn't<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> point<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.610> top<00:01:33.620> you<00:01:34.620> can<00:01:34.860> draw

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
doesn't have a point on top you can draw

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.910 
doesn't have a point on top you can draw
a<00:01:35.010> circle<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.610> top<00:01:35.820> instead<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> begin

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
a circle on top instead so to begin

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
a circle on top instead so to begin
we'll<00:01:38.100> draw<00:01:38.280> another<00:01:38.520> circle<00:01:38.790> with<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
we'll draw another circle with the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.870 
we'll draw another circle with the
two-foot<00:01:40.290> radius<00:01:43.160> draw<00:01:44.160> a<00:01:44.250> line<00:01:44.580> going

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
two-foot radius draw a line going

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.580 
two-foot radius draw a line going
through<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.270> center<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.530> circle<00:01:51.590> then

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
through the center of the circle then

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.310 
through the center of the circle then
from<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.950> midpoint<00:01:53.750> draw<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> line<00:01:55.080> going

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
from the midpoint draw the line going

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.710 
from the midpoint draw the line going
straight<00:01:55.650> up<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.310> distance<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
straight up the distance you want or the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.990 
straight up the distance you want or the
height<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.320> want<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.560> cone<00:01:58.820> will<00:01:59.820> make

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
height that you want the cone will make

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.219 
height that you want the cone will make
it<00:02:00.119> five<00:02:00.300> feet<00:02:00.509> again<00:02:02.869> now<00:02:03.869> instead<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
it five feet again now instead of

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.440 
it five feet again now instead of
drawing<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.560> line<00:02:04.680> straight<00:02:05.070> down<00:02:05.300> we<00:02:06.300> will

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
drawing a line straight down we will

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.699 
drawing a line straight down we will
draw<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> circle<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.259> top<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.860> line<00:02:09.709> we'll

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
draw a circle on top of that line we'll

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.570 
draw a circle on top of that line we'll
make<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.130> half<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.580> foot<00:02:16.130> now<00:02:17.130> once<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.550> have

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
make it half a foot now once you have

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.010 
make it half a foot now once you have
the<00:02:17.910> circle<00:02:18.330> drawn<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.320> line<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:21.720> want<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the circle drawn on the line you want to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.550 
the circle drawn on the line you want to
go<00:02:22.140> back<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> line<00:02:22.920> tool<00:02:24.470> select<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
go back to the line tool select the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.300 
go back to the line tool select the
midpoint<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.640> top<00:02:26.910> circle<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.130> draw<00:02:29.130> a

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
midpoint of the top circle and draw a

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.360 
midpoint of the top circle and draw a
line<00:02:29.550> going<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.480> one<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.200> main<00:02:31.709> axes

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
line going out on one of the main axes

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:45.020 
line going out on one of the main axes
and<00:02:33.300> you're<00:02:33.989> going<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.380> use<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.739> red<00:02:34.950> one

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.270 

then<00:02:46.030> i<00:02:46.060> zoom<00:02:46.150> out<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.810> connect<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:47.920> line<00:02:48.069> to

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
then i zoom out and connect that line to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.210 
then i zoom out and connect that line to
the<00:02:48.400> bottom<00:02:49.530> make<00:02:50.530> sure<00:02:50.560> you're<00:02:50.860> staying<00:02:51.040> on

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the bottom make sure you're staying on

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.839 
the bottom make sure you're staying on
the<00:02:51.340> same<00:02:51.549> axis<00:02:52.420> or<00:02:52.569> else<00:02:52.689> this<00:02:52.870> won't<00:02:53.049> work

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.470 

then<00:03:00.849> draw<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.150> line<00:03:01.420> going<00:03:01.750> back<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.620> base

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
then draw a line going back to the base

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.670 
then draw a line going back to the base
Center<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.840> then<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.379> should<00:03:05.500> have<00:03:05.650> a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
Center and then you should have a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.640 
Center and then you should have a
triangle<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:07.540> leave<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.840> top<00:03:08.079> circle<00:03:08.530> by

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
triangle to leave the top circle by

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.670 
triangle to leave the top circle by
selecting<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.840> border<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.440> hitting

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
selecting the border of it and hitting

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.539 
selecting the border of it and hitting
delete<00:03:12.689> and<00:03:13.689> then<00:03:13.840> delete<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.379> mid<00:03:14.590> line<00:03:15.040> that

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
delete and then delete the mid line that

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.899 
delete and then delete the mid line that
you<00:03:15.670> made<00:03:17.879> go<00:03:18.879> to<00:03:18.940> tools<00:03:19.299> follow<00:03:20.200> me<00:03:20.909> once

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
you made go to tools follow me once

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.289 
you made go to tools follow me once
again<00:03:22.440> draw<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.500> triangle<00:03:24.129> around<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:25.000> base

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
again draw the triangle around the base

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.009 
again draw the triangle around the base
and<00:03:26.099> now<00:03:27.099> you<00:03:27.159> have<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.459> cone<00:03:27.790> with<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.269> flat<00:03:28.659> top

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
and now you have a cone with a flat top

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.920 
and now you have a cone with a flat top
instead<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.680> point
