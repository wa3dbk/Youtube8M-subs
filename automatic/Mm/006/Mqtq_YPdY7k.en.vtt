the sciences so you know in this country
I<00:00:15.570> think<00:00:15.900> there's<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.680> big<00:00:16.980> emphasis<00:00:17.160> now<00:00:17.789> on

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
I think there's a big emphasis now on

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.179 
I think there's a big emphasis now on
trying<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.630> improve<00:00:18.960> stem<00:00:19.830> science

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
education and younger people I think

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.509 
education and younger people I think
that<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.140> order<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.500> pursue<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> career<00:00:26.130> in

research there have to be role models
and<00:00:29.519> incentives<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.660> not<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.349> same<00:00:31.679> as<00:00:32.540> law

research is unbelievably daunting and
challenging<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> lot<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> reasons<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.780> mean

challenging for a lot of reasons I mean
first<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.559> hard<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:51.390> go<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> school

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
first of all it's hard you go to school

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.529 
first of all it's hard you go to school
for<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.050> very<00:00:52.289> long<00:00:52.500> time<00:00:53.149> but<00:00:54.149> when<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.420> get

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
for a very long time but when you get

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.319 
for a very long time but when you get
out<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.750> school<00:00:54.899> after<00:00:55.500> five<00:00:55.980> years<00:00:56.059> for<00:00:57.059> doing

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329

out of school after five years for doing
a<00:00:57.390> PhD<00:00:58.280> at<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.879> point<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.690> generally

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
a PhD at that point you're generally

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.200 
a PhD at that point you're generally
about<00:01:02.160> thirty<00:01:02.520> years<00:01:02.760> old

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
still have to go into a postdoc and

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
still have to go into a postdoc and
postdoc<00:01:10.470> salaries<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.729> dictated<00:01:12.119> by

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
postdoc salaries are really dictated by

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.210 
postdoc salaries are really dictated by
the<00:01:12.479> NIH<00:01:13.020> by<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> National<00:01:13.740> Institutes<00:01:14.130> of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
Health and those salaries are very hard

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.950 
Health and those salaries are very hard
to<00:01:18.869> live<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> starting<00:01:21.000> postdoc<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to live on so a starting postdoc a

to live on so a starting postdoc a
thirty<00:01:22.439> year<00:01:22.500> old<00:01:22.740> person<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> PhD<00:01:23.549> might

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
thirty year old person with a PhD might

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
thirty year old person with a PhD might
be<00:01:24.270> making<00:01:25.400> $42,000<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> year<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.110> see

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
be making $42,000 a year and you can see

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.410 
be making $42,000 a year and you can see
why<00:01:31.619> many<00:01:32.340> people<00:01:32.460> maybe<00:01:32.909> wouldn't<00:01:33.270> choose

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
why many people maybe wouldn't choose

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.749 
why many people maybe wouldn't choose
that<00:01:33.570> path<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.740> even<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.400> choose<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that path but even if you do choose that

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.350 
that path but even if you do choose that
path<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.540> are<00:01:36.720> gonna<00:01:37.130> live<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.369> 42,000

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
path and you are gonna live on 42,000

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.789 
path and you are gonna live on 42,000
dollars<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.720> year<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> place<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.470> New<00:01:40.590> York

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
dollars a year in a place like New York

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
dollars a year in a place like New York
City<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.759> lot<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.450> people<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
City which a lot of people do it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
City which a lot of people do it
obviously<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.829> did<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
obviously I did it

and at the time not even making $42,000

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.670 
and at the time not even making $42,000
a<00:01:47.520> year<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.729> think<00:01:47.909> my<00:01:48.000> salary<00:01:48.329> was<00:01:48.649> $33,000<00:01:49.649> a

a year I think my salary was $33,000 a
year<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.890> know<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> still<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.689> very

there's<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.450> big<00:02:21.630> drop<00:02:21.990> off<00:02:22.230> at<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.100> postdoc

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
there's a big drop off at the postdoc

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.110 
there's a big drop off at the postdoc
stage<00:02:24.330> because<00:02:24.980> making<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.340> transition<00:02:26.640> to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
stage because making that transition to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.540 
stage because making that transition to
the<00:02:27.240> next<00:02:27.360> phase<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:28.230> really<00:02:29.220> really

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
the next phase is really really

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.720 
the next phase is really really
difficult<00:02:30.380> because<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.640> be

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
difficult because you have to be

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.430 
difficult because you have to be
unbelievably<00:02:33.240> successful<00:02:33.480> scientifically

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
unbelievably successful scientifically

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.800 
unbelievably successful scientifically
you<00:02:34.650> have<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.950> publish<00:02:35.250> your<00:02:35.400> work<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:36.690> would

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
you have to publish your work it would

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.910 
you have to publish your work it would
be<00:02:36.840> great<00:02:37.110> if<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.350> were<00:02:37.530> funded

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
be great if you were funded

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.280 
be great if you were funded
independently<00:02:38.580> as<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> researcher<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.750> then

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
independently as a researcher and then

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.550 
independently as a researcher and then
those<00:02:40.560> positions<00:02:40.890> for<00:02:42.530> assistant<00:02:43.530> professors

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
those positions for assistant professors

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.290 
those positions for assistant professors
associate<00:02:44.310> professors<00:02:44.670> full<00:02:44.880> professors

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
associate professors full professors

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.240 
associate professors full professors
they<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.080> don't<00:02:46.380> come<00:02:47.100> up<00:02:48.030> very<00:02:48.540> often<00:02:49.250> so

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
they just don't come up very often so

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.780 
they just don't come up very often so
it's<00:02:50.400> hard<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.910> be<00:02:51.780> positively<00:02:52.650> reinforced<00:02:53.459> I

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
it's hard to be positively reinforced I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.830 
it's hard to be positively reinforced I
think<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.080> hard<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:59.209> succeed<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.630> mean

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
think and it's hard to succeed I mean

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.410 
think and it's hard to succeed I mean
it's<00:03:00.990> hard<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.230> compete<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.850> giant<00:03:03.300> pool

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
it's hard to compete with the giant pool

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.350 
it's hard to compete with the giant pool
of<00:03:03.480> postdocs<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.320> that<00:03:04.860> are<00:03:05.010> out<00:03:05.130> there

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
where's the inflection point how do you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.470 
where's the inflection point how do you
how<00:03:07.590> do<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.709> make<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:08.040> easier<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.580> don't<00:03:09.270> think

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
how do you make it easier I don't think

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.400 
how do you make it easier I don't think
it's<00:03:09.600> gonna<00:03:09.720> become<00:03:10.080> easier<00:03:10.530> until<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:13.490> NIH

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
it's gonna become easier until the NIH

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.550 
it's gonna become easier until the NIH
changes<00:03:16.640> their<00:03:17.640> funding<00:03:18.180> structure<00:03:18.660> the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
budget for the NIH has been basically

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.490 
budget for the NIH has been basically
flat<00:03:22.019> for<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.560> while<00:03:23.810> which<00:03:24.810> doesn't<00:03:25.230> give<00:03:25.380> you

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
flat for a while which doesn't give you

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.630 
flat for a while which doesn't give you
a<00:03:25.530> lot<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:26.070> incentive<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.709> go<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.980> route<00:03:29.250> I

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
a lot of incentive to go that route I

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.780 
a lot of incentive to go that route I
mean<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.510> success<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.530> your<00:03:32.160> grant<00:03:32.700> proposal

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
mean the success of your grant proposal

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.190 
mean the success of your grant proposal
is<00:03:34.010> not<00:03:35.010> very<00:03:35.250> promising<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:36.150> think<00:03:36.959> there<00:03:37.080> have

is not very promising I think there have

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.740 
is not very promising I think there have
to<00:03:37.350> be<00:03:37.380> big<00:03:37.769> changes<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.090> way<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.510> we

to be big changes in the way that we
