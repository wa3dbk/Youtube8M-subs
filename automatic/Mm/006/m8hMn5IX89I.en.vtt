left the doctor's office area and I made

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.269 
left the doctor's office area and I made
a<00:00:15.570> left<00:00:15.809> onto<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.199> road<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.770> then<00:00:16.890> made<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> right

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
a left onto a road and then made a right

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.519 
a left onto a road and then made a right
onto<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.730> nother<00:00:18.210> road<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.720> reason<00:00:19.199> why<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> said

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
onto a nother road and reason why I said

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.810 
onto a nother road and reason why I said
that<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.949> know<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.250> didn't<00:00:20.490> when<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.670> go

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
that so you know that I didn't when I go

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.450 
that so you know that I didn't when I go
that<00:00:21.029> far<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:22.350> road<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> turned<00:00:22.830> onto<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.430> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
that far the road I turned onto is a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.340 
that far the road I turned onto is a
two-lane<00:00:24.119> road<00:00:24.330> which<00:00:24.570> means<00:00:24.779> as<00:00:24.930> two<00:00:25.140> lanes

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
two-lane road which means as two lanes

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.859 
two-lane road which means as two lanes
on<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.830> right<00:00:26.279> side<00:00:26.490> has<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> barrier<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.539> like

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
on the right side has a barrier of like

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.169 
on the right side has a barrier of like
concrete<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> concrete-like<00:00:29.460> highway<00:00:29.939> but

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
concrete not a concrete-like highway but

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.659 
concrete not a concrete-like highway but
just<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.500> curb<00:00:31.859> type<00:00:32.130> concrete

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
just like like a curb type concrete

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.970 
just like like a curb type concrete
thing<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> other<00:00:34.530> side<00:00:34.770> there's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
thing and then on the other side there's

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.750 
thing and then on the other side there's
two<00:00:35.070> lanes<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.460> well<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:37.350> into<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.040> left

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
two lanes as well so I got into the left

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.069 
two lanes as well so I got into the left
lane<00:00:38.820> which<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.149> guess<00:00:39.300> would<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> passing

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
lane which I guess would be the passing

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.049 
lane which I guess would be the passing
lane<00:00:40.230> there's<00:00:40.440> also<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.739> lot<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.010> there's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.910> few

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
lane there's also a lot of there's a few

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.430 
lane there's also a lot of there's a few
lights<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.540> road<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> there's<00:00:43.110> also<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
lights on that road and there's also a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 
lights on that road and there's also a
lot<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> turns<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.520> network<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.629> off

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
lot of turns on network like that go off

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.660 
lot of turns on network like that go off
into<00:00:46.079> other<00:00:46.170> places<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.460> there's<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
into other places I think there's a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.950 
into other places I think there's a
school<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.120> something<00:00:48.390> over<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.780> well

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
school or something over there as well

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.869 
school or something over there as well
which<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.230> didn't<00:00:49.469> know<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.219> i<00:00:50.250> thought<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
which it didn't know so i thought the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.029 
which it didn't know so i thought the
speed<00:00:51.120> limit<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.390> 45<00:00:51.719> because<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.829> area

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
speed limit is 45 because in my area

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.220 
speed limit is 45 because in my area
mostly<00:00:53.399> limits<00:00:53.699> are<00:00:53.789> 45<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.539> back<00:00:54.719> roads<00:00:54.989> even

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
mostly limits are 45 on back roads even

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.450 
mostly limits are 45 on back roads even
40<00:00:56.100> 45<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.809> I<00:00:57.809> usually<00:00:58.320> drive<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:59.070> traffic

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
40 45 and I usually drive with traffic

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.430 
40 45 and I usually drive with traffic
however<00:01:00.180> there<00:01:00.390> was<00:01:00.449> no<00:01:00.690> traffic<00:01:00.870> other<00:01:01.199> than

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
however there was no traffic other than

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.080 
however there was no traffic other than
a<00:01:01.469> red<00:01:01.770> car<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> passed<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> was<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
a red car that I passed that was in the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
a red car that I passed that was in the
the<00:01:03.359> right<00:01:03.570> lane<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> guess<00:01:04.920> because<00:01:05.189> there

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the right lane so I guess because there

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.010 
the right lane so I guess because there
was<00:01:05.519> no<00:01:05.610> traffic<00:01:05.760> i<00:01:06.030> ended<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.299> speeding<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
was no traffic i ended up speeding up I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.990 
was no traffic i ended up speeding up I
saw<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> car<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.100> other<00:01:08.310> side<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.850> was

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
saw the car on the other side it was

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
saw the car on the other side it was
just<00:01:09.180> sitting<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
just sitting there it was like a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.200 
just sitting there it was like a
deterrent<00:01:11.280> area<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> was

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
deterrent area I don't know if it was

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359 
deterrent area I don't know if it was
turning<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> saw<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
turning or not but I saw it I was like I

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.920 
turning or not but I saw it I was like I
wonder<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.119> cop<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> don't<00:01:15.720> know

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
wonder if that's a cop now I don't know

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.539 
wonder if that's a cop now I don't know
what<00:01:16.049> they're<00:01:16.080> cops<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:17.070> cops<00:01:17.310> have

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
what they're cops look like my cops have

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.730 
what they're cops look like my cops have
the<00:01:17.729> awesome<00:01:17.909> cop<00:01:18.390> cars<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.930> chargers<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the awesome cop cars the chargers and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
the awesome cop cars the chargers and
they're<00:01:19.860> amazing<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.390> area<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:21.930> have

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
they're amazing but this area they have

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.320 
they're amazing but this area they have
like<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> was<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> chevy<00:01:23.700> impala<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
like I think it was a chevy impala I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.390 
like I think it was a chevy impala I
think<00:01:24.570> that's<00:01:24.720> what<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:24.960> are<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.070> solid

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
think that's what they are in a solid

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
think that's what they are in a solid
and<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.820> by<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.270> saw<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.869> made<00:01:28.290> me

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and then by the time I saw it it made me

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
and then by the time I saw it it made me
look<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:28.710> at<00:01:28.829> my<00:01:28.890> speed<00:01:29.070> limit<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.460> saw<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> was

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
look down at my speed limit I saw I was

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
look down at my speed limit I saw I was
going<00:01:30.030> 60<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.630> thought<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> speed<00:01:31.500> limit<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.829> 45

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
going 60 I thought the speed limit is 45

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890 
going 60 I thought the speed limit is 45
so<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.700> maybe<00:01:32.880> he'll<00:01:33.119> let<00:01:33.240> me<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.540> since<00:01:33.810> I'm

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
so like maybe he'll let me go since I'm

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.920 
so like maybe he'll let me go since I'm
only<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.229> 15<00:01:34.439> I'll<00:01:34.799> slow<00:01:34.950> down<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.659> I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
only going 15 I'll slow down and then I

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.260 
only going 15 I'll slow down and then I
I<00:01:37.590> then<00:01:37.950> saw<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> speed<00:01:38.729> limit<00:01:38.880> sign<00:01:39.060> that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
I then saw the speed limit sign that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.260 
I then saw the speed limit sign that
said<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.540> was<00:01:39.630> 35<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.590> 45<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.240> like

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
said it was 35 not 45 and then I'm like

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.020 
said it was 35 not 45 and then I'm like
oh<00:01:42.659> shit<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.409> screwed<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> started<00:01:44.850> slowing

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
oh shit I'm screwed so I started slowing

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.600 
oh shit I'm screwed so I started slowing
down<00:01:45.210> even<00:01:45.509> more<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:46.020> saw<00:01:46.920> him<00:01:47.100> doing<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.430> u-turn

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
down even more I saw him doing a u-turn

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.330 
down even more I saw him doing a u-turn
I<00:01:48.000> turned<00:01:48.270> into<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.780> right<00:01:49.049> lane<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.829> slowed

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
I turned into the right lane I slowed

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.280 
I turned into the right lane I slowed
down<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.850> 40<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:51.899> he<00:01:51.990> came<00:01:52.110> up

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
down to about 40 and then he came up

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.020 
down to about 40 and then he came up
behind<00:01:52.380> me<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.710> turned<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.189> his<00:01:53.460> lights<00:01:53.490> now

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
behind me and turned on his lights now

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.639 
behind me and turned on his lights now
when<00:01:54.450> he<00:01:54.509> pulled<00:01:54.689> me<00:01:54.840> over<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> turned<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.590> my

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
when he pulled me over I turned on my

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.649 
when he pulled me over I turned on my
for<00:01:56.579> ways<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.759> let<00:01:57.030> him<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
for ways to let him know and then I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.480 
for ways to let him know and then I
drove<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:58.140> further<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.829> saw<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
drove a bit further because I saw that

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.670 
drove a bit further because I saw that
the<00:01:59.640> road<00:01:59.820> was<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.969> lot<00:02:00.149> bigger<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:01.200> ahead<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.500> bit

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the road was a lot bigger up ahead a bit

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.050 
the road was a lot bigger up ahead a bit
so<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> turned<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.430> my<00:02:02.490> turn<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.790> knowing<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so I turned on my turn so knowing that

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.999 
so I turned on my turn so knowing that
pulled<00:02:03.299> over<00:02:03.509> there<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.290> got<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.560> license<00:02:04.920> my

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
pulled over there so I got my license my

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.010 
pulled over there so I got my license my
registration<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:06.030> insurance<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
registration and my insurance like you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.960 
registration and my insurance like you
do<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.530> then<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.979> waited<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.429> cop<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.789> show

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
do and then I waited for the cop to show

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.669 
do and then I waited for the cop to show
up<00:02:09.149> now<00:02:09.450> he<00:02:09.509> came<00:02:09.720> over<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> passenger

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
up now he came over to the passenger

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.960 
up now he came over to the passenger
side<00:02:10.739> which<00:02:10.979> I've<00:02:11.099> actually<00:02:11.250> never<00:02:11.489> had<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> cop

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
side which I've actually never had a cop

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.309 
side which I've actually never had a cop
do<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.420> they

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
do that they

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.050 
do that they
that<00:02:13.469> because<00:02:13.739> it's<00:02:14.010> more<00:02:14.310> safe<00:02:14.519> for<00:02:14.579> them<00:02:14.819> to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
that because it's more safe for them to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.670 
that because it's more safe for them to
be<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.390> passenger<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:15.959> there's<00:02:16.170> cars<00:02:16.530> on

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
be on the passenger if there's cars on

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.839 
be on the passenger if there's cars on
the<00:02:16.739> left<00:02:16.950> which<00:02:17.129> is<00:02:17.159> fine<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:17.639> it<00:02:17.730> was<00:02:17.819> just

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
the left which is fine but it was just

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.429 
the left which is fine but it was just
really<00:02:18.060> weird<00:02:18.269> having<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.810> cop<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.139> that<00:02:19.170> come

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
really weird having a cop to that come

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.319 
really weird having a cop to that come
to<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> passenger<00:02:19.889> window<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.969> I<00:02:20.999> put<00:02:21.180> down<00:02:21.269> my

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
to the passenger window so I put down my
