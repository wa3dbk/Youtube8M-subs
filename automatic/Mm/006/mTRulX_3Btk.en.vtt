important and critical at the end of the
process<00:04:44.160> when<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.030> build<00:04:45.270> your<00:04:45.420> custom

application some of these things take a

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.920 
application some of these things take a
little<00:04:49.110> bit<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.410> time<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:50.160> build<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:51.540> may<00:04:51.720> have

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
little bit of time to build you may have

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.740 
little bit of time to build you may have
to<00:04:52.140> wait<00:04:52.590> for<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.980> bit<00:04:53.160> of<00:04:53.280> email<00:04:53.640> for<00:04:54.420> instance

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
to wait for a bit of email for instance

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.230 
to wait for a bit of email for instance
getting<00:04:55.050> an<00:04:55.140> Adobe<00:04:55.500> ID<00:04:55.650> does<00:04:56.310> require<00:04:56.670> you<00:04:57.060> to

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
getting an Adobe ID does require you to

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.020 
getting an Adobe ID does require you to
respond<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> piece<00:04:58.290> of<00:04:58.320> email<00:04:58.760> so<00:04:59.760> start

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
respond to a piece of email so start

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.280 
respond to a piece of email so start
this<00:05:00.210> process<00:05:00.480> before<00:05:01.170> a<00:05:01.830> critical<00:05:02.460> deadline

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
this process before a critical deadline

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.360 
this process before a critical deadline
now<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.350> other<00:05:04.650> thing<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:05.010> keep<00:05:05.160> in<00:05:05.310> mind

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
now the other thing to keep in mind

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.810 
now the other thing to keep in mind
mostly<00:05:06.300> is<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:06.450> planning<00:05:06.960> process<00:05:07.200> is

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
mostly is a planning process is

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.130 
mostly is a planning process is
eventually<00:05:08.820> you're<00:05:09.510> going<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:09.780> build<00:05:09.930> a

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
eventually you're going to build a

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.470 
eventually you're going to build a
custom<00:05:10.590> application<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:12.090> custom

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
custom application that custom

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.840 
custom application that custom
application<00:05:13.170> has<00:05:13.320> an<00:05:13.440> icon<00:05:13.950> on<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.250> device

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
application has an icon on the device

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.050 
application has an icon on the device
and<00:05:15.180> it's<00:05:15.840> got<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.050> splash<00:05:16.470> screen<00:05:16.980> so<00:05:17.970> you're

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
and it's got a splash screen so you're

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.280 
and it's got a splash screen so you're
going<00:05:18.180> to<00:05:18.270> need<00:05:18.450> to<00:05:18.570> start<00:05:18.810> thinking<00:05:18.840> about

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
going to need to start thinking about

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.050 
going to need to start thinking about
the<00:05:19.440> artwork<00:05:20.100> you<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.490> you<00:05:20.610> want<00:05:20.790> to<00:05:20.880> build

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
the artwork you that you want to build

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.900 
the artwork you that you want to build
for<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:21.480> icon<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.110> splash<00:05:22.530> screen<00:05:22.950> also

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
for the icon and splash screen also

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.700 
for the icon and splash screen also
consider<00:05:24.540> a<00:05:24.600> little<00:05:24.870> bit<00:05:25.020> what<00:05:25.440> you're<00:05:25.560> going

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
consider a little bit what you're going

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.500 
consider a little bit what you're going
to<00:05:25.830> use<00:05:25.860> in<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.310> way<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.640> title<00:05:26.940> for<00:05:27.450> your

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
to use in the way of a title for your

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.570 
to use in the way of a title for your
application<00:05:28.290> and<00:05:28.440> what<00:05:28.860> you<00:05:28.980> want<00:05:29.220> people<00:05:29.550> to

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
application and what you want people to

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.760 
application and what you want people to
see<00:05:29.910> in<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.420> viewer<00:05:30.720> when<00:05:31.380> they're<00:05:31.530> reading

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
see in the viewer when they're reading

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.520 
see in the viewer when they're reading
your<00:05:32.040> content<00:05:32.600> so<00:05:33.600> a<00:05:33.900> little<00:05:34.290> bit<00:05:34.500> of

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
your content so a little bit of

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.560 
your content so a little bit of
forethought<00:05:35.040> ahead<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.550> time<00:05:35.760> is<00:05:35.970> going<00:05:36.480> to

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
forethought ahead of time is going to

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.420 
forethought ahead of time is going to
make<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.930> process<00:05:37.260> of<00:05:37.740> building<00:05:38.010> and

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
make the process of building and

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.220 
make the process of building and
publishing<00:05:39.030> a<00:05:39.090> lot<00:05:39.300> easier<00:05:39.540> at<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.870> other<00:05:39.990> end

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
publishing a lot easier at the other end

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.740 
publishing a lot easier at the other end
so<00:05:40.980> there<00:05:41.160> you<00:05:41.190> go<00:05:41.280> there's<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:42.240> little<00:05:42.630> bit

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
so there you go there's a little bit

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.810 
so there you go there's a little bit
more<00:05:43.170> information<00:05:43.830> on<00:05:43.950> preparing<00:05:44.550> for<00:05:44.730> the

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
more information on preparing for the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.010 
more information on preparing for the
