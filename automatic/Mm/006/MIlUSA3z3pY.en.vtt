 Federico Roca Marketing Director of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.369
 alex pension will feel a presentation 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.040
 very particular first 4x4 of the brand in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.400
 the country although with technology from another 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.920
 brand so that Peugeot has a vehicle 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.379
 of very specific characteristics that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 comes to complete or integrate into a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.510
 range that is increasingly being completed 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.040
 more if indeed good of its fruit 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.570
 of a collaboration there are collaborations 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.100
 with different brands without groups of 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.440
 brands that weigh as much as all the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.000
 brands have in the world in this case 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.309
 specifically to develop it how 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.460
 it works is a 4x4 product where we 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.510
 we have partnered with experts and we have 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.580
 managed to develop this product 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.370
 peugeot 4008 that comes to complete the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.010
 offer within the universe of the sv that 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.530
 we already had with the 3008 as the first 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.110
 proposal of this is a vehicle that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.090
 propose a silhouette that you do not 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.330
 they had what we are doing at the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.700
 silhouette is the silhouette of a 4x4 let's say 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.250
 3008 is a similar proposal regarding 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.230
 to silhouette with its specific design and its 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.760
 specific characteristics here 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.710
 differential is in the proposal 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.570
 mechanics we need to offering a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.820
 product that is 100% in all its 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.850
 4x4 versions both in manual box and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850
 automatic 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.690
 yes I already know that I just 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.650
 wrong 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.830
 daily 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.960
 what is the perspective in relation to the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.810
 motorization and there's the system of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.600
 variable change that brings out the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.770
 Mechanical proposal is a proposal 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.060
 mean within the segment with the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.710
 proposal in aste was two liters of 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.230
 150 horses that allows you to have 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.390
 performance without exceeding the 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.430
 consumptions and in the specific case of the box 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.770
 It is a continuous drive box 7 that 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.060
 the truth that is a level of use is a 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.790
 pretty box 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.860
 let's say nice and smooth in use 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.810
 own management or the pleasant handling that 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.880
 Look for the Peugeot customer and he does not put 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.620
 I resigned benefits so we believe 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.240
 that will be partial of the most demanded 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.070
 within the proposal of four thousand 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.600
 eight the largest the largest amount 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.730
 demand will be within the 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.800
 automatic proposal bancaja cbt la 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.130
 priority beyond satisfying a 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.830
 private public of 4x4 that could 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.350
 get to have the brand is that or the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.480
 image that can be earned with the product 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.580
 the whole game is not in fact when 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.920
 we state or share the objectives 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.690
 of 4 thousand 81 is clearly to be 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.130
 complementary three thousand eight that is 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.370
 earn additional sales volumes 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.819
 because we are attacking other customers 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.049
 specifically a 4x4 but also without 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.150
 resign for it the contribution that makes 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.430
 any high-end product or 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.950
 high as is the four thousand eight to the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.299
 construction and contribution to the image of 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.900
 the peugeot brand through the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.900
 proposal that we make 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.170
 what is the idea of â€‹â€‹working for a 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.270
 Unpublished product for the range of 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.130
 vehicles that you have in the 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.110
 argentina what we are doing is 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.030
 work to our database of 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.850
 customers of both production and 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.700
 competition that allow you to explore and 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.290
 show the universe that it is a conquest 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.790
 because as we told you until 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.200
 now we never had a product of these 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.180
 characteristics therefore we have 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.620
 everything to gain is to say clients that 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.180
 they habitually consume this type of 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.500
 dual traction 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.420
 production has never had a 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.890
 proposal of this type now we are 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.570
 making a punctual offer with four 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.290
 thousand eight with which we believe that we are going to 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.219
 earn a few clients 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.219
 and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.720
 the four-cylinder engine 150 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.390
 horses variable transmission brakes 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.230
 four-wheel drive suspensions 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:21.590
 independent that's the idea I had 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.870
 but I respect your 4x4 an Argentina 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.370
 yes let's say from all the proposals 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.020
 that there is this product is available 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.030
 with different authorizations and different 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.050
 boxes we believe that for the market 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.750
 Argentinian 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.910
 this was the most appropriate because good 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.670
 it responded to what it consumes on average 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.490
 the 4x4 user of this segment of 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.890
 go up small or medium you can 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.450
 tell us about the bevel motorization the 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.980
 proposal of four thousand eight in 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.010
 Argentina for this launch is only 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.810
 naftera engine perspective 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.300
 bezel in which peugeot is a 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.340
 specialist you could think of 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.120
 book for the future simply 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.430
 leave it for another vehicle than the broad 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.800
 fan that has but I in the future 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.690
 everything is evaluable and what we believe today 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.390
 is that we are covering the demand for 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.850
 this type of clients with the proposal 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.800
 of 3,008 in its hd version and we 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.379
 we have a proposal they say it's not 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.940
 bridge in this segment but I think that 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.259
 with 3,008 we are already doing a good 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.470
 proposal and we are covering that 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.470
 demand 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.570
 time 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.570
 and yes 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.490
 the finish 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.490
 Hello 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.790
 yes 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.770
 and
