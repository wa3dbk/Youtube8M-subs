well I mentioned earlier about

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.830 
well I mentioned earlier about
certification<00:00:54.500> what<00:00:55.190> we<00:00:55.309> do<00:00:55.489> we<00:00:56.000> we<00:00:56.390> review

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
certification what we do we we review

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.569 
certification what we do we we review
games<00:00:57.079> were<00:00:57.230> not<00:00:57.379> interested<00:00:57.649> in<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.370> plat

and they'll know what games to work so

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.380 
and they'll know what games to work so
it's<00:02:09.410> we're<00:02:09.649> working<00:02:10.160> very<00:02:10.190> hard<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:11.360> make

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
it's we're working very hard to make

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.750 
it's we're working very hard to make
stereoscopic<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.530> easy<00:02:12.950> technology<00:02:13.580> for

consumers and of course we're advocating

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.160 
consumers and of course we're advocating
proper<00:02:16.730> programming<00:02:17.239> standards<00:02:18.050> through

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
proper programming standards through

proper programming standards through

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
programming guides and so on now what's

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.720 
programming guides and so on now what's
changed<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.319> 2007<00:02:25.129> I<00:02:25.220> mentioned<00:02:25.610> earlier

point of when when the game developers

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.069 
point of when when the game developers
get<00:04:19.250> involved<00:04:19.759> and<00:04:19.940> more<00:04:20.509> than<00:04:20.659> that<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:20.900> is
