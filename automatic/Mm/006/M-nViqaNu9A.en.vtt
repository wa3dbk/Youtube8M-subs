of<00:01:11.860> feel<00:01:12.159> kind<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.180> reminds<00:01:13.510> me<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.870> new

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230

gridlock I'm in the ambient rain and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
gridlock I'm in the ambient rain and
lightning<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.610> thunder<00:01:18.940> going<00:01:19.180> on<00:01:19.300> in<00:01:19.450> the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
lightning and thunder going on in the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.020 
lightning and thunder going on in the
background<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:20.260> it's<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.440> really<00:01:20.800> dark<00:01:21.190> type<00:01:21.850> of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
background so it's a really dark type of

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.380 
background so it's a really dark type of
feel<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:24.010> is<00:01:24.190> also<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.490> dual<00:01:24.729> sniper<00:01:25.090> map

feel that this is also a dual sniper map
so<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:25.780> can<00:01:26.140> chalk<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.380> up<00:01:26.590> with<00:01:26.860> Azura<00:01:27.220> and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
so you can chalk that up with Azura and

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.980 
so you can chalk that up with Azura and

was originally the torque bow in Gears
of<00:02:03.479> War<00:02:03.570> one<00:02:03.960> see<00:02:04.860> I'm<00:02:04.950> grabbing<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.400> right<00:02:05.580> now

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
of War one see I'm grabbing it right now

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.160 
of War one see I'm grabbing it right now
and<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:07.500> generator<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.819> little<00:02:09.179> thing

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and the generator is that little thing

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.440 
and the generator is that little thing
right<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.649> front<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.979> me<00:02:11.069> there<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:12.150> shoot

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
right in front of me there you shoot

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.210 
right in front of me there you shoot
that<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.720> couple<00:02:13.020> times<00:02:13.170> it'll<00:02:13.620> blow<00:02:13.830> up<00:02:14.010> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
that a couple times it'll blow up and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.100 
that a couple times it'll blow up and
that<00:02:14.340> triggers<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.760> lights<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.510> go<00:02:15.660> out<00:02:15.840> and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
that triggers the lights to go out and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.699 
that triggers the lights to go out and
in<00:02:16.590> certain<00:02:16.770> places<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.400> boom<00:02:18.390> shot<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
in certain places I boom shot and the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.250 
in certain places I boom shot and the
long<00:02:19.920> shots<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:21.030> krill<00:02:21.330> will<00:02:21.510> pop<00:02:21.750> off<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
long shots the krill will pop off and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.400 
long shots the krill will pop off and
attack<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.390> i'm<00:02:24.660> going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.959> show<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.110> here

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
attack so i'm going to show that here

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.520 
attack so i'm going to show that here
momentarily<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:27.480> kind<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.810> part<00:02:28.230> of

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
momentarily but that's kind of part of

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.860 
momentarily but that's kind of part of
this<00:02:29.340> madness<00:02:29.640> what<00:02:29.970> makes<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.269> special<00:02:30.510> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
this madness what makes it special and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.860 
this madness what makes it special and
unique<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.489> guys<00:02:32.610> notice<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.209> symmetry

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
unique now you guys notice the symmetry

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.770 
unique now you guys notice the symmetry
of<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.050> map<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.800> bridges<00:02:35.190> cross<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:36.600> from

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
of this map the bridges cross go from

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.360 
of this map the bridges cross go from
one<00:02:36.930> side<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.350> other<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.160> run

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
one side to the other and you can run

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.070 
one side to the other and you can run
down<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.700> ramps<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.209> get<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> boom<00:02:39.840> shot

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
down the ramps to get to the boom shot

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.170 
down the ramps to get to the boom shot
so<00:02:40.709> there's<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.070> lot<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.459> different<00:02:41.790> pathways

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
so there's a lot of different pathways

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.509 
so there's a lot of different pathways
you<00:02:42.330> can<00:02:42.480> take<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:43.080> think<00:02:43.650> it'll<00:02:43.800> really<00:02:44.160> open

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
you can take I think it'll really open

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.970 
you can take I think it'll really open
it<00:02:44.610> up<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.819> team<00:02:45.030> deathmatch<00:02:45.980> possibly

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
it up the team deathmatch possibly

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.059 
it up the team deathmatch possibly
execution<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.819> I'm<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.380> interested<00:02:49.560> to

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
execution and I'm really interested to

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.400 
execution and I'm really interested to
see<00:02:50.430> how<00:02:50.640> king<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.120> hill<00:02:51.299> plays<00:02:51.660> out<00:02:51.900> now

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
see how king of the hill plays out now

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.650 
see how king of the hill plays out now
shock<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.920> boom<00:02:53.340> shot<00:02:53.579> at<00:02:53.820> mirror<00:02:54.450> there

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
shock that boom shot at mirror there

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.690 
shock that boom shot at mirror there
blew<00:02:55.290> up<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> generator<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.220> then<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.489> krill

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
blew up the generator and then the krill

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.370 
blew up the generator and then the krill
popped<00:02:56.940> out<00:02:57.150> because<00:02:57.570> we<00:02:57.750> lied<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.260> one

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
popped out because we lied to the one

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.050 
popped out because we lied to the one
out<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:58.829> seeing<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.239> pill<00:03:00.540> finishing<00:03:01.140> up<00:03:02.060> and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
out so seeing the pill finishing up and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.400 
out so seeing the pill finishing up and
they're<00:03:03.180> still<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.720> out<00:03:03.930> there<00:03:04.140> trying<00:03:04.380> to

they're still going out there trying to

they're still going out there trying to
kill<00:03:04.620> me

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150

kill me
very<00:03:06.810> interesting<00:03:07.409> concept<00:03:08.010> of

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
very interesting concept of

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.880 
very interesting concept of
environmental<00:03:09.049> hazards<00:03:10.049> obviously<00:03:10.769> it's

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
environmental hazards obviously it's

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.100 
environmental hazards obviously it's
always<00:03:11.129> been<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.459> Gears<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.849> War<00:03:12.110> since

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
always been like a Gears of War since

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.860 
always been like a Gears of War since
gears<00:03:13.349> of<00:03:13.470> world<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.799> guess<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.099> original<00:03:14.870> in

gears of world I guess the original in

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.350 
gears of world I guess the original in
the<00:03:16.019> couch<00:03:16.290> with<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> original<00:03:16.739> maps<00:03:17.189> but<00:03:17.519> DLC

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
the couch with the original maps but DLC

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.690 
the couch with the original maps but DLC
had<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.780> environmental<00:03:19.319> hazards<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:20.549> is

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
had the environmental hazards this is

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.280 
had the environmental hazards this is
the<00:03:20.790> first<00:03:21.030> map<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.510> we<00:03:21.599> really<00:03:21.870> get<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.019> see

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
the first map that we really get to see

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.120 
the first map that we really get to see
it<00:03:22.409> in<00:03:22.590> effect

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.240 

it's<00:03:25.730> going<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.030> be<00:03:26.150> I<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:27.350> know<00:03:27.470> again<00:03:28.100> i'm

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
it's going to be I you know again i'm

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.430 
it's going to be I you know again i'm
not<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.670> big<00:03:29.030> time<00:03:30.160> what<00:03:31.160> our<00:03:31.400> bullet<00:03:31.820> marsh

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
not a big time what our bullet marsh

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.110 
not a big time what our bullet marsh
advocate<00:03:33.440> but<00:03:34.130> it'll<00:03:34.370> be<00:03:34.490> interesting<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:35.030> see

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
advocate but it'll be interesting to see

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.870 
advocate but it'll be interesting to see
how<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.510> plays<00:03:35.630> out<00:03:35.930> I'm<00:03:36.350> really<00:03:37.250> anxious<00:03:37.460> to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
how it plays out I'm really anxious to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.610 
how it plays out I'm really anxious to
see<00:03:38.090> how<00:03:38.240> it<00:03:38.360> plays<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.870> team<00:03:39.230> deathmatch

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
see how it plays and team deathmatch

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.290 
see how it plays and team deathmatch
again<00:03:39.950> just<00:03:40.250> because<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.610> size<00:03:40.910> the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
again just because of the size the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.890 
again just because of the size the
pathways<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.860> dual<00:03:43.340> sniper<00:03:43.900> there's

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
pathways and a dual sniper there's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.930 
pathways and a dual sniper there's
another<00:03:45.140> krill<00:03:45.470> location<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.010> see<00:03:46.220> that's

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
another krill location you see that's

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.300 
another krill location you see that's
right<00:03:47.090> over<00:03:47.270> that<00:03:47.390> sniper<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:48.920> think<00:03:49.040> it'll

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
right over that sniper so I think it'll

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.550 
right over that sniper so I think it'll
play<00:03:49.460> out<00:03:49.490> very<00:03:49.790> interesting<00:03:50.240> and<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:51.320> lot<00:03:51.500> of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
play out very interesting and a lot of

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.800 
play out very interesting and a lot of
people<00:03:51.850> surprisingly<00:03:52.850> like<00:03:53.150> this<00:03:53.330> map<00:03:53.540> and

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
people surprisingly like this map and

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.200 
people surprisingly like this map and
been<00:03:54.650> yearning<00:03:54.920> for<00:03:55.130> word<00:03:55.460> to<00:03:55.610> come<00:03:55.820> make<00:03:56.180> a

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
been yearning for word to come make a

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.010 
been yearning for word to come make a
comeback<00:03:56.800> so<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:57.830> again<00:03:58.730> see<00:03:59.540> how<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.690> plays<00:03:59.780> out
