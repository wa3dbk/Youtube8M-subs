engineering Directorate lighten motion
and<00:00:11.099> I'm<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.550> explain<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.820> little<00:00:11.880> bit

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
and I'm going to explain a little bit

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.580 
and I'm going to explain a little bit
too<00:00:12.300> about<00:00:12.509> our<00:00:12.630> integrating<00:00:13.049> sphere<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.469> how

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
too about our integrating sphere and how

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.980 
too about our integrating sphere and how
we<00:00:13.650> test<00:00:13.920> our<00:00:14.070> light<00:00:14.450> this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:15.630> integrating

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
we test our light this is an integrating

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.340 
we test our light this is an integrating
sphere<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:17.730> inside<00:00:18.539> coating<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.140> is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
sphere the inside coating of this is

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.620 
sphere the inside coating of this is
highly<00:00:19.680> reflective<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.460> what<00:00:21.420> we're<00:00:21.510> going

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
highly reflective and what we're going

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.150 
highly reflective and what we're going
to<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.140> we're<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> take<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> light<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
to do is we're going to take a light and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.710 
to do is we're going to take a light and
we're<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> put<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.150> port<00:00:24.480> over

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
we're going to put it in this port over

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.200 
we're going to put it in this port over
here<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.220> turn<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> light<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> light

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
here and turn the light on and the light

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.470 
here and turn the light on and the light
will<00:00:27.390> shine<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:28.109> around<00:00:29.029> with<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> sphere

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
will shine all around with the sphere

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.330 
will shine all around with the sphere
closed<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.080> all<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> light<00:00:31.590> gets<00:00:31.859> captured

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
closed so all the light gets captured

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.060 
closed so all the light gets captured
inside<00:00:32.669> here<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.680> then<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:34.950> an

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
inside here and then we have an

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.010 
inside here and then we have an
instrument<00:00:35.309> over<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.989> called<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
instrument over here called the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.340 
instrument over here called the
spectrometer<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.430> tiny<00:00:38.579> box<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
spectrometer this little tiny box and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.990 
spectrometer this little tiny box and
through<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> cable<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.070> reads<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.640> amount<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
through a cable it reads the amount of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.860 
through a cable it reads the amount of
light<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:43.200> sees<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:45.690> tell

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
light that it sees and that will tell

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.000 
light that it sees and that will tell
you<00:00:45.960> how<00:00:45.989> bright<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> light<00:00:46.800> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you how bright the light is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
you how bright the light is
it<00:00:47.670> only<00:00:47.820> tells<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.390> relative<00:00:48.780> sense

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it only tells you in a relative sense

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
it only tells you in a relative sense
how<00:00:49.200> bright<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> light<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
how bright the light is you have to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.150 
how bright the light is you have to
calibrate<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> sphere<00:00:52.289> every<00:00:52.620> time<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.949> use

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
calibrate the sphere every time you use

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.939 
calibrate the sphere every time you use
it<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> known<00:00:54.210> source<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.800> this

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
it to a known source so that's what this

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.430 
it to a known source so that's what this
is<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> light<00:00:56.940> bulb<00:00:57.320> calibrated<00:00:58.320> by

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
is this is a light bulb calibrated by

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.630 
is this is a light bulb calibrated by
NIST<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> National<00:00:58.980> Institute<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.579> Standards

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
NIST the National Institute of Standards

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.110 
NIST the National Institute of Standards
and<00:00:59.940> Technology<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.590> specific

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
and Technology to be a very specific

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.090 
and Technology to be a very specific
lumen<00:01:03.120> output<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> is

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
lumen output and so we know what that is

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
lumen output and so we know what that is
so<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.689> first<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> sphere<00:01:08.900> put<00:01:09.900> this

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
so when we first use the sphere put this

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.100 
so when we first use the sphere put this
light<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.850> here<00:01:11.850> turn<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> warm<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
light on here turn it on have to warm it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810 
light on here turn it on have to warm it
up<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.320> about<00:01:13.500> 15<00:01:13.890> minutes<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.400> allow<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
up for about 15 minutes to allow it to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
up for about 15 minutes to allow it to
stabilize<00:01:15.049> we<00:01:16.049> won't<00:01:16.200> turn<00:01:16.320> down<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.680> now

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
stabilize we won't turn down right now

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.010 
stabilize we won't turn down right now
because<00:01:17.040> it'll<00:01:17.189> blind<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> camera<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.750> run

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
because it'll blind the camera so we run

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.940 
because it'll blind the camera so we run
it<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> while<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> light<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.540> all

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
it for a while get the light all all

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
it for a while get the light all all
stable<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.070> balanced<00:01:23.430> close<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.330> sphere<00:01:24.630> up

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
stable and balanced close the sphere up

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
stable and balanced close the sphere up
and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.710> we'll<00:01:25.830> use<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> computer<00:01:26.490> over

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and then we'll use the computer over

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730 
and then we'll use the computer over
here<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.659> spectrometer<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.500> read

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
here and the spectrometer to read

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.450 
here and the spectrometer to read
exactly<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.119> output<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.340> after<00:01:32.340> we

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
exactly what the output is so after we

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.590 
exactly what the output is so after we
use<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.970> bowl<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:35.729> turn<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.090> another<00:01:36.270> bulb

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
use this bowl we turn on another bulb

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.200 
use this bowl we turn on another bulb
called<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> reference<00:01:37.170> bulb<00:01:37.590> inside<00:01:37.920> here

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
called the reference bulb inside here

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
called the reference bulb inside here
and<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.360> bulb<00:01:39.890> has<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.189> known<00:01:41.549> brightness

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and that bulb has a known brightness

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
and that bulb has a known brightness
that's<00:01:42.210> compared<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.990> now<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.290> is

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that's compared to this one now this is

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.020 
that's compared to this one now this is
like<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> 50<00:01:43.950> dollar<00:01:44.040> bulb<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> much

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
like a 50 dollar bulb and this is much

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.600 
like a 50 dollar bulb and this is much
more<00:01:45.210> expensive<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.430> use<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
more expensive so this one we can use a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.569 
more expensive so this one we can use a
lot<00:01:47.850> more<00:01:47.880> often<00:01:48.360> than<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.170> other<00:01:49.579> calibrated

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
lot more often than the other calibrated

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
lot more often than the other calibrated
bulb<00:01:50.759> will<00:01:50.909> wear<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.210> over<00:01:51.240> time<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:52.020> use

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
bulb will wear out over time so we use

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.950 
bulb will wear out over time so we use
this<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.979> turn<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.689> let<00:01:54.689> me<00:01:54.750> turn<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
this one we turn that on let me turn it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.700 
this one we turn that on let me turn it
on<00:01:55.140> with<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> light<00:01:57.020> mounted<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> sphere

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
on with a light mounted in the sphere

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.760 
on with a light mounted in the sphere
that<00:01:58.890> we're<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> read<00:01:59.520> from<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.350> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
that we're going to read from so if you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.980 
that we're going to read from so if you
see<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.490> there's<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.450> bit<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.659> gray

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
see on here there's a little bit of gray

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.990 
see on here there's a little bit of gray
and<00:02:04.049> some<00:02:04.530> black<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.159> different<00:02:05.520> colors<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and some black to different colors and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.490 
and some black to different colors and
that<00:02:06.119> will<00:02:06.299> absorb<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.930> different<00:02:07.259> amount<00:02:07.469> of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that will absorb a different amount of

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.059 
that will absorb a different amount of
light<00:02:08.060> than<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> white<00:02:09.569> surface<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.800> in

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
light than just a white surface so in

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.180 
light than just a white surface so in
order<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.400> take<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> proper

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
order to take a proper

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.100 
order to take a proper
reading<00:02:12.490> we<00:02:12.640> actually<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.510> recalibrate

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
reading we actually have to recalibrate

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.320 
reading we actually have to recalibrate
the<00:02:14.470> sphere<00:02:14.770> every<00:02:15.220> single<00:02:15.550> time<00:02:15.700> we<00:02:15.730> take<00:02:16.150> a

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
the sphere every single time we take a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.090 
the sphere every single time we take a
reading<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.840> different<00:02:17.170> light<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.860> match

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
reading of a different light to match

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.530 
reading of a different light to match
exactly<00:02:18.490> what<00:02:18.760> we're<00:02:18.880> putting<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.210> there<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
exactly what we're putting in there that

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.940 
exactly what we're putting in there that
includes<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.020> change<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.440> color<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.860> if

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
includes if you change the color so if

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.140 
includes if you change the color so if
we<00:02:21.010> have<00:02:21.130> two<00:02:21.280> different<00:02:21.400> color<00:02:21.670> turbans<00:02:22.030> we

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
we have two different color turbans we

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.730 
we have two different color turbans we
recalibrate<00:02:22.780> for<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.020> different<00:02:23.320> angles<00:02:23.560> so

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
recalibrate for the different angles so

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.730 
recalibrate for the different angles so
we<00:02:24.730> close<00:02:24.940> up<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.180> sphere<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:26.260> turn<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.590> the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
we close up the sphere you turn on the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.730 
we close up the sphere you turn on the
other<00:02:26.860> light<00:02:27.570> we<00:02:28.570> do<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> reference<00:02:28.990> scan<00:02:29.470> and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
other light we do a reference scan and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.230 
other light we do a reference scan and
that<00:02:29.920> says<00:02:30.160> okay<00:02:30.490> this<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.820> how<00:02:30.910> much<00:02:31.120> is

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
that says okay this is how much is

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.020 
that says okay this is how much is
reflecting<00:02:31.780> how<00:02:31.900> much<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.230> absorbing<00:02:32.680> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
reflecting how much it's absorbing and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.070 
reflecting how much it's absorbing and
we<00:02:34.030> have<00:02:34.210> an<00:02:34.390> own<00:02:34.630> output<00:02:35.610> into<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.700> box<00:02:37.080> for

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
we have an own output into the box for

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.670 
we have an own output into the box for
that<00:02:38.260> particular<00:02:38.980> device<00:02:39.420> then<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.540> go<00:02:40.690> back

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
that particular device then we go back

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.890 
that particular device then we go back
to<00:02:41.860> here<00:02:42.010> another<00:02:42.250> time<00:02:42.600> set<00:02:43.600> up<00:02:43.690> all<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
to here another time set up all the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.590 
to here another time set up all the
calibrations<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:45.310> all<00:02:45.460> exactly<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.390> way<00:02:46.480> we

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
calibrations it's all exactly the way we

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.280 
calibrations it's all exactly the way we
want<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:47.080> turn<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.830> light<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:49.170> then<00:02:50.170> we

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
want to be turn the light on and then we

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.430 
want to be turn the light on and then we
take<00:02:50.470> readings<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.220> either<00:02:51.610> take<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.820> reading

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
take readings and either take a reading

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.150 
take readings and either take a reading
instantaneously<00:02:53.440> or<00:02:53.560> we'll<00:02:53.770> take<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> reading

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
instantaneously or we'll take a reading

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.860 
instantaneously or we'll take a reading
over<00:02:54.340> time<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.940> determine<00:02:55.090> what<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.570> output

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
over time to determine what the output

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.270 
over time to determine what the output
is<00:02:55.930> going<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.110> be<00:02:56.230> as<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.470> light<00:02:56.740> burns<00:02:56.980> down

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
is going to be as the light burns down

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.180 
is going to be as the light burns down
because<00:02:58.180> whites<00:02:58.540> definitely<00:02:59.080> vary<00:02:59.680> some<00:03:00.010> drop

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
because whites definitely vary some drop

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.590 
because whites definitely vary some drop
a<00:03:00.220> little<00:03:00.580> tiny<00:03:00.730> bit<00:03:00.940> at<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.120> beginning<00:03:01.390> when

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
a little tiny bit at the beginning when

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.020 
a little tiny bit at the beginning when
they<00:03:01.690> heat<00:03:01.810> up<00:03:01.960> and<00:03:02.220> some<00:03:03.220> drop<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.460> lot<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.910> the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
they heat up and some drop a lot is the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.600 
they heat up and some drop a lot is the
battery<00:03:04.300> runs<00:03:04.510> down<00:03:05.100> that's<00:03:06.100> sort<00:03:06.550> of

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
battery runs down that's sort of

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.860 
battery runs down that's sort of
difference<00:03:06.820> between<00:03:07.000> regulation<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.750> on

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
difference between regulation and on

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.490 
difference between regulation and on
Namie<00:03:08.290> right<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:09.010> as<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.000> said<00:03:10.240> earlier<00:03:10.600> the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
Namie right so as I said earlier the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.140 
Namie right so as I said earlier the
reflectivity<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.340> inside<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:12.850> makes<00:03:13.060> a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
reflectivity the inside of this makes a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.940 
reflectivity the inside of this makes a
big<00:03:13.300> difference<00:03:13.630> you're<00:03:14.200> trying<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.530> read<00:03:14.860> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
big difference you're trying to read the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.990 
big difference you're trying to read the
amount<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.160> light<00:03:15.280> that's<00:03:15.430> reflecting<00:03:15.880> off

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
amount of light that's reflecting off

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.960 
amount of light that's reflecting off
here<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:16.270> when<00:03:16.690> we<00:03:16.840> read<00:03:17.459> any<00:03:18.459> kind<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.760> light

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
here so when we read any kind of light

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.260 
here so when we read any kind of light
we<00:03:19.270> make<00:03:19.870> an<00:03:20.020> adapter<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:21.459> fits<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:22.090> light

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
we make an adapter that fits the light

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.880 
we make an adapter that fits the light
that's<00:03:22.510> going<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:22.930> there<00:03:23.050> so<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.290> little<00:03:23.620> light

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
that's going in there so as little light

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.460 
that's going in there so as little light
shows<00:03:24.100> as<00:03:24.280> possible<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:26.080> instance<00:03:26.380> if

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
shows as possible so for instance if

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.040 
shows as possible so for instance if
we're<00:03:26.620> testing<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.980> competitor's<00:03:27.489> light<00:03:28.050> we'll

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
we're testing a competitor's light we'll

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.770 
we're testing a competitor's light we'll
make<00:03:29.260> an<00:03:29.470> adapter<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.100> fit<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.580> light<00:03:30.820> so

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
make an adapter to fit that light so

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.300 
make an adapter to fit that light so
that<00:03:31.810> as<00:03:32.200> little<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.560> light<00:03:32.770> is<00:03:32.890> showing<00:03:33.100> as

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
that as little of light is showing as

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.560 
that as little of light is showing as
possible<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.060> get<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.270> most<00:03:34.390> accurate

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
possible to get the most accurate

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.170 
possible to get the most accurate
reading<00:03:34.959> as<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.739> can<00:03:35.950> see<00:03:36.070> over<00:03:36.220> here<00:03:36.489> we've

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
reading as you can see over here we've

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.960 
reading as you can see over here we've
made<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:38.170> bunch<00:03:38.350> of<00:03:38.410> adapters<00:03:38.800> over<00:03:39.040> time<00:03:39.250> this

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
made a bunch of adapters over time this

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.390 
made a bunch of adapters over time this
is<00:03:40.090> some<00:03:40.270> of<00:03:40.360> them<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:42.010> when<00:03:42.130> we<00:03:42.250> get<00:03:42.370> a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
is some of them so that when we get a

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.650 
is some of them so that when we get a
new<00:03:42.489> light<00:03:42.760> we<00:03:42.880> can<00:03:43.000> see<00:03:43.150> if<00:03:43.269> one<00:03:43.420> of<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.540> ones

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
new light we can see if one of the ones

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.030 
new light we can see if one of the ones
we<00:03:43.750> already<00:03:43.780> have<00:03:43.989> works<00:03:44.320> we<00:03:44.709> don't<00:03:44.800> have<00:03:44.950> to

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
we already have works we don't have to

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.250 
we already have works we don't have to
make<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.190> new<00:03:45.370> one<00:03:45.519> but<00:03:45.790> we<00:03:45.940> do<00:03:46.150> need<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.019> make

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
make a new one but we do need to make

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.110 
make a new one but we do need to make
sure<00:03:47.290> that<00:03:47.470> no<00:03:47.830> light<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.310> leaking<00:03:48.760> out<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:48.910> a

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
sure that no light is leaking out of a

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.479 
sure that no light is leaking out of a
sphere<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:50.140> if<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.440> stuck<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.830> light<00:03:51.100> in<00:03:51.280> there

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
sphere so if I stuck a light in there

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.850 
sphere so if I stuck a light in there
like<00:03:51.820> this<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:53.110> whole<00:03:53.260> bunch<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.530> light<00:03:53.709> was

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
like this and a whole bunch of light was

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.920 
like this and a whole bunch of light was
coming<00:03:54.040> out<00:03:54.340> then<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.239> wouldn't<00:03:55.630> give<00:03:55.720> me<00:03:55.840> an

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
coming out then that wouldn't give me an

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.140 
coming out then that wouldn't give me an
accurate<00:03:56.080> reading<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.459> I've<00:04:00.610> got<00:04:00.760> an<00:04:00.880> urban

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
accurate reading so I've got an urban

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.720 
accurate reading so I've got an urban
five-fifty<00:04:01.720> set<00:04:01.959> up<00:04:02.080> in<00:04:02.230> here<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:03.400> can<00:04:03.550> see

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
five-fifty set up in here you can see

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.820 
five-fifty set up in here you can see
it's<00:04:03.910> just<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.600> front<00:04:04.810> of<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:04.989> showing<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.530> a

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
it's just the front of it showing that a

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.610 
it's just the front of it showing that a
reference<00:04:06.190> scan<00:04:06.519> so<00:04:07.390> we<00:04:07.900> know<00:04:08.050> exactly<00:04:08.500> how

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
reference scan so we know exactly how

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.600 
reference scan so we know exactly how
much<00:04:08.739> light<00:04:08.950> is<00:04:09.040> going<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.250> get<00:04:09.340> absorbed

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
much light is going to get absorbed

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.440 
much light is going to get absorbed
should<00:04:10.360> get<00:04:10.660> an<00:04:10.750> accurate<00:04:11.110> lumen<00:04:11.380> reading

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
should get an accurate lumen reading

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.039 
should get an accurate lumen reading
and<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.700> come<00:04:14.700> over<00:04:14.790> here<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:16.310> this<00:04:17.310> is<00:04:17.519> a

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
and so come over here and this is a

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.319 
and so come over here and this is a
graph<00:04:19.049> showing<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:20.549> different<00:04:20.880> wavelengths

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
graph showing the different wavelengths

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.570 
graph showing the different wavelengths
of<00:04:21.419> light<00:04:21.480> so<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:21.989> blue<00:04:22.230> down<00:04:22.470> here<00:04:22.580> and

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
of light so this is blue down here and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.540 
of light so this is blue down here and
red<00:04:23.790> over<00:04:24.060> here<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.810> how<00:04:25.080> much<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.830> each<00:04:26.130> so

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
red over here and how much of each so

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.150 
red over here and how much of each so
LEDs<00:04:27.450> are<00:04:27.630> primarily<00:04:28.139> blue<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.860> yellow<00:04:29.010> and

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
LEDs are primarily blue and yellow and

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.440 
LEDs are primarily blue and yellow and
those<00:04:29.490> mixed<00:04:29.790> together<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.210> gives<00:04:30.360> you

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
those mixed together that gives you

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.500 
those mixed together that gives you
white<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.550> reason<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.120> important

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
white and the reason this is important

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.990 
white and the reason this is important
is<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:34.260> piece<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.650> gear<00:04:34.889> will<00:04:35.130> adjust<00:04:35.610> the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
is this piece of gear will adjust the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.180 
is this piece of gear will adjust the
output<00:04:36.540> or<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.350> reading<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:37.860> it<00:04:37.950> gets

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
output or the the reading that it gets

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.290 
output or the the reading that it gets
in<00:04:38.690> watts<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:40.800> lumens<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.639> lumens<00:04:42.180> is

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
in watts to lumens and lumens is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.879 
in watts to lumens and lumens is
adjusted<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.900> human<00:04:43.200> eye<00:04:43.290> so<00:04:43.590> we<00:04:43.710> see

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
adjusted to the human eye so we see

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.740 
adjusted to the human eye so we see
yellow<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.370> most<00:04:44.580> we<00:04:45.000> see<00:04:45.210> blue<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.510> little

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
yellow the most we see blue a little

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.290 
yellow the most we see blue a little
tiny<00:04:46.020> bit<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.470> red<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.710> little<00:04:46.979> tiny<00:04:47.160> bit<00:04:47.370> and

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
tiny bit and red a little tiny bit and

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.690 
tiny bit and red a little tiny bit and
so<00:04:48.540> this<00:04:48.780> will<00:04:48.900> adjust<00:04:49.080> for<00:04:50.070> what<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.490> would

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
so this will adjust for what you would

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.270 
so this will adjust for what you would
actually<00:04:51.240> say<00:04:51.479> is<00:04:51.810> brighter<00:04:52.169> or<00:04:52.470> dimmer<00:04:52.590> not

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
actually say is brighter or dimmer not

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.000 
actually say is brighter or dimmer not
what<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.970> just<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.810> power<00:04:55.050> meter<00:04:55.410> would<00:04:55.650> say<00:04:55.860> is

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
what a just a power meter would say is

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.320 
what a just a power meter would say is
brighter<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.370> dimmer<00:04:56.580> which<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:56.970> genuine

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
brighter and dimmer which is genuine

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.770 
brighter and dimmer which is genuine
with<00:04:57.479> this<00:04:57.630> thing<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:58.910> come<00:04:59.910> over<00:04:59.940> here<00:05:00.270> you

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
with this thing so come over here you

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.310 
with this thing so come over here you
can<00:05:00.930> turn<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.200> light<00:05:01.320> on<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:02.630> then<00:05:03.630> take<00:05:04.260> a

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
can turn the light on and then take a

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.950 
can turn the light on and then take a
reading<00:05:04.680> and<00:05:04.889> I<00:05:05.160> can<00:05:05.340> take<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:06.060> urban<00:05:06.540> with<00:05:06.780> or

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
reading and I can take the urban with or

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.840 
reading and I can take the urban with or
without<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.410> slide<00:05:07.620> lights<00:05:07.860> sometimes<00:05:08.460> you

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
without the slide lights sometimes you

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.040 
without the slide lights sometimes you
know<00:05:08.940> it'll<00:05:09.270> give<00:05:09.389> me<00:05:09.479> different<00:05:09.600> readings

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
know it'll give me different readings

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.659 
know it'll give me different readings
with<00:05:10.200> that<00:05:10.380> so<00:05:10.590> just<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.979> front<00:05:11.250> light<00:05:11.460> on

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
with that so just the front light on

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.409 
with that so just the front light on
this<00:05:12.090> one<00:05:12.270> when<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:12.960> first<00:05:13.139> turned<00:05:13.440> on<00:05:14.419> 646

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
this one when it first turned on 646

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.300 
this one when it first turned on 646
limits<00:05:16.310> okay<00:05:17.310> I'll<00:05:17.430> leave<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:17.700> on<00:05:18.110> and

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
limits okay I'll leave that on and

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.790 
limits okay I'll leave that on and
nothing<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.340> happens<00:05:20.669> with<00:05:20.789> LEDs<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.810> that

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
nothing that happens with LEDs is that

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.800 
nothing that happens with LEDs is that
the<00:05:23.130> hotter<00:05:23.430> they<00:05:23.700> get<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.180> dimmer<00:05:24.390> they<00:05:24.600> get

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
the hotter they get the dimmer they get

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.370 
the hotter they get the dimmer they get
and<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:25.289> if<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:25.710> leave<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.130> LED<00:05:26.490> on<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:27.380> you

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
and so if you leave the LED on and you

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.450 
and so if you leave the LED on and you
keep<00:05:28.620> taking<00:05:28.770> readings

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
keep taking readings

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.340 
keep taking readings
it'll<00:05:29.850> get<00:05:29.940> dimmer<00:05:30.240> over<00:05:30.539> time<00:05:30.750> so<00:05:31.020> you'll<00:05:31.200> see

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
it'll get dimmer over time so you'll see

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.540 
it'll get dimmer over time so you'll see
I'll<00:05:31.470> take<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.740> again<00:05:31.950> here<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:32.280> it's<00:05:32.400> it's

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
I'll take it again here and it's it's

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.790 
I'll take it again here and it's it's
625<00:05:33.030> limits<00:05:33.840> that's<00:05:34.050> because<00:05:34.350> it's<00:05:34.530> heating

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
625 limits that's because it's heating

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.340 
625 limits that's because it's heating
up<00:05:34.890> and<00:05:35.150> with<00:05:36.150> a<00:05:36.180> properly<00:05:36.539> designed<00:05:36.900> heatsink

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
up and with a properly designed heatsink

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.350 
up and with a properly designed heatsink
it<00:05:38.130> will<00:05:38.250> get<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.400> little<00:05:38.580> hotter<00:05:38.820> over<00:05:39.090> time

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
it will get a little hotter over time

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.900 
it will get a little hotter over time
over<00:05:40.320> a<00:05:40.350> short<00:05:40.560> period<00:05:40.740> of<00:05:40.830> time<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.250> then<00:05:41.550> it

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
over a short period of time and then it

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.940 
over a short period of time and then it
will<00:05:42.060> stay<00:05:42.270> at<00:05:42.419> a<00:05:42.479> steady<00:05:42.720> temperature<00:05:43.050> now

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
will stay at a steady temperature now

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.820 
will stay at a steady temperature now
these<00:05:44.940> lights<00:05:45.240> are<00:05:45.630> designed<00:05:46.050> for<00:05:46.350> bike<00:05:46.620> use

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
these lights are designed for bike use

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.909 
these lights are designed for bike use
and<00:05:47.130> so<00:05:47.630> they're<00:05:48.630> not<00:05:49.200> designed<00:05:49.560> with<00:05:49.650> a<00:05:49.710> huge

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
and so they're not designed with a huge

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:50.960 
and so they're not designed with a huge
heatsink<00:05:50.340> because<00:05:50.490> you<00:05:50.580> wouldn't<00:05:50.760> want<00:05:50.820> to

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
heatsink because you wouldn't want to

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.240 
heatsink because you wouldn't want to
bike<00:05:51.060> around<00:05:51.180> with<00:05:51.419> that<00:05:51.570> so<00:05:52.229> if<00:05:52.710> we're<00:05:52.979> doing

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
bike around with that so if we're doing

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.880 
bike around with that so if we're doing
a<00:05:53.490> long<00:05:53.729> burn<00:05:54.090> on<00:05:54.479> something<00:05:54.960> we'll<00:05:55.530> turn<00:05:55.830> a

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
a long burn on something we'll turn a

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.310 
a long burn on something we'll turn a
fan<00:05:56.160> on<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.610> that<00:05:57.300> will<00:05:57.479> create<00:05:57.750> moving<00:05:58.169> air

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
fan on and that will create moving air

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.659 
fan on and that will create moving air
just<00:05:58.590> like<00:05:58.680> if<00:05:59.340> you<00:05:59.580> were<00:05:59.700> on<00:05:59.729> a<00:05:59.880> bicycle

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.939 

cool<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:04.819> off<00:06:04.970> so<00:06:05.930> that<00:06:05.960> if<00:06:06.139> we're<00:06:06.319> gonna<00:06:06.740> test

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
cool it off so that if we're gonna test

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.779 
cool it off so that if we're gonna test
something<00:06:07.250> for<00:06:07.699> hour<00:06:08.330> and<00:06:08.509> a<00:06:08.569> half<00:06:09.400> two<00:06:10.400> hours

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
something for hour and a half two hours

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.969 
something for hour and a half two hours
whatever<00:06:11.360> then<00:06:11.630> the<00:06:11.900> bird<00:06:12.080> of<00:06:12.169> time<00:06:12.289> is<00:06:12.500> we

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
whatever then the bird of time is we

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.379 
whatever then the bird of time is we
have<00:06:13.099> moving<00:06:13.370> we're<00:06:13.490> past<00:06:13.729> that<00:06:13.970> so<00:06:14.150> we<00:06:14.270> can

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
have moving we're past that so we can

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.270 
have moving we're past that so we can
get<00:06:14.569> on<00:06:15.050> more<00:06:15.319> accurate<00:06:15.650> reading<00:06:15.889> as<00:06:15.979> to<00:06:16.130> what

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
get on more accurate reading as to what

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.559 
get on more accurate reading as to what
that<00:06:16.460> we<00:06:16.550> do<00:06:16.669> like<00:06:16.849> if<00:06:17.000> you<00:06:17.090> were<00:06:17.180> actually<00:06:17.479> out

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
that we do like if you were actually out

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:22.930 
that we do like if you were actually out
on<00:06:17.599> the<00:06:17.720> bicycle<00:06:19.810> and<00:06:20.810> so<00:06:21.349> we're<00:06:22.069> now<00:06:22.190> way<00:06:22.639> past

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
on the bicycle and so we're now way past

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.360 
on the bicycle and so we're now way past
30<00:06:23.330> seconds<00:06:23.840> which<00:06:24.050> is<00:06:24.259> the<00:06:24.470> limit<00:06:24.770> for<00:06:25.069> what

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
30 seconds which is the limit for what

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.120 
30 seconds which is the limit for what
we<00:06:25.490> call<00:06:25.639> fl1<00:06:26.300> testing<00:06:26.750> so<00:06:27.020> for<00:06:27.319> fl1<00:06:27.710> testing

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
we call fl1 testing so for fl1 testing

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.260 
we call fl1 testing so for fl1 testing
we<00:06:28.250> want<00:06:28.430> to<00:06:28.490> know<00:06:28.580> the<00:06:28.729> number<00:06:28.970> of<00:06:29.090> lumens

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
we want to know the number of lumens

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.540 
we want to know the number of lumens
after<00:06:30.169> 30<00:06:30.410> seconds<00:06:30.740> and<00:06:30.919> what<00:06:31.009> that<00:06:31.130> does<00:06:31.310> is

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
after 30 seconds and what that does is

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.200 
after 30 seconds and what that does is
it<00:06:32.270> cuts<00:06:32.690> out<00:06:32.930> the<00:06:32.960> lights<00:06:33.550> that<00:06:34.550> it<00:06:34.880> cuts<00:06:35.060> out

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
it cuts out the lights that it cuts out

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.550 
it cuts out the lights that it cuts out
the<00:06:35.360> the<00:06:35.659> amount<00:06:35.870> of<00:06:35.930> output<00:06:36.080> you<00:06:36.319> got<00:06:36.440> the

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
the the amount of output you got the

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.469 
the the amount of output you got the
very<00:06:36.770> beginning<00:06:37.280> and<00:06:37.400> that'll<00:06:38.120> tell<00:06:38.300> you<00:06:38.389> if

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
very beginning and that'll tell you if

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.029 
very beginning and that'll tell you if
you<00:06:38.539> have<00:06:38.659> proper<00:06:38.990> heat<00:06:39.110> sink<00:06:39.319> here<00:06:39.440> or<00:06:39.560> not<00:06:39.680> if

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
you have proper heat sink here or not if

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.200 
you have proper heat sink here or not if
you<00:06:40.159> have<00:06:40.190> really<00:06:40.490> bad<00:06:40.580> heat<00:06:40.789> sinking<00:06:41.120> the

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
you have really bad heat sinking the

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.909 
you have really bad heat sinking the
light<00:06:41.360> might<00:06:41.509> start<00:06:41.780> out<00:06:41.840> at<00:06:41.990> 700<00:06:42.470> lumens<00:06:42.560> but

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
light might start out at 700 lumens but

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.159 
light might start out at 700 lumens but
it<00:06:43.009> might<00:06:43.130> be<00:06:43.220> 500<00:06:43.430> lumens<00:06:43.789> really<00:06:44.780> rapidly

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
it might be 500 lumens really rapidly

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.890 
it might be 500 lumens really rapidly
and<00:06:45.490> so<00:06:46.490> how<00:06:46.819> much<00:06:46.940> you<00:06:47.120> cool<00:06:47.300> the<00:06:47.449> LED<00:06:47.750> is

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
and so how much you cool the LED is

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.409 
and so how much you cool the LED is
important<00:06:48.319> so<00:06:48.800> here<00:06:48.979> we're<00:06:49.220> well<00:06:49.759> past<00:06:49.970> 30

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
important so here we're well past 30

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.809 
important so here we're well past 30
seconds<00:06:50.840> and<00:06:50.930> we<00:06:51.050> get<00:06:51.199> 607<00:06:52.159> lumens<00:06:52.490> finish

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
seconds and we get 607 lumens finish

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.580 
seconds and we get 607 lumens finish
line<00:06:53.060> so<00:06:53.300> it's<00:06:53.539> quite<00:06:53.750> a<00:06:53.810> bit<00:06:53.960> higher<00:06:54.319> than<00:06:54.349> the

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
line so it's quite a bit higher than the

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:01.629 
line so it's quite a bit higher than the
rating<00:06:56.440> and<00:06:58.180> we'll<00:06:59.229> take<00:07:00.229> all<00:07:00.440> this<00:07:00.560> data<00:07:00.800> when

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 
rating and we'll take all this data when

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.189 
rating and we'll take all this data when
we're<00:07:01.789> doing<00:07:01.849> research<00:07:02.120> will<00:07:02.659> take<00:07:02.990> all<00:07:03.110> this

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 
we're doing research will take all this

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.740 
we're doing research will take all this
data<00:07:03.409> and<00:07:03.740> figure<00:07:04.699> out<00:07:04.729> an<00:07:04.970> average<00:07:05.120> of<00:07:05.509> like<00:07:05.690> I

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
data and figure out an average of like I

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.020 
data and figure out an average of like I
said<00:07:05.960> three<00:07:06.229> or<00:07:06.530> sometimes<00:07:07.190> many<00:07:07.580> more<00:07:07.789> lights

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
said three or sometimes many more lights

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.730 
said three or sometimes many more lights
to<00:07:08.300> figure<00:07:08.659> out<00:07:08.750> what<00:07:08.870> we<00:07:08.990> can<00:07:09.110> produce<00:07:09.349> over

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
to figure out what we can produce over
