00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.179 

it's<00:03:27.290> really<00:03:27.500> important<00:03:27.859> to<00:03:27.889> us<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.069> our

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
it's really important to us that our

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.699 
it's really important to us that our
gowns<00:03:28.459> are<00:03:28.639> weightless<00:03:29.030> right<00:03:29.299> now<00:03:29.530> I've<00:03:30.530> been

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
gowns are weightless right now I've been

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.720 
gowns are weightless right now I've been
hearing<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.010> more<00:03:31.189> than<00:03:31.280> ever<00:03:31.459> in<00:03:31.639> the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
hearing it more than ever in the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.849 
hearing it more than ever in the
dressing<00:03:32.120> rooms<00:03:32.299> with<00:03:32.480> brides<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:33.109> I<00:03:33.379> think

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
dressing rooms with brides that I think

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:34.660 
dressing rooms with brides that I think
maybe<00:03:33.980> because<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.310> nature<00:03:34.519> of

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
maybe because the nature of

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.160 
maybe because the nature of
ready-to-wear<00:03:35.030> has<00:03:35.269> gotten<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:35.689> much<00:03:35.810> lighter

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
ready-to-wear has gotten so much lighter

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.599 
ready-to-wear has gotten so much lighter
than<00:03:36.349> it<00:03:36.560> used<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.829> be<00:03:36.920> women<00:03:37.189> don't<00:03:37.459> run

than it used to be women don't run

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.360 
than it used to be women don't run

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.040 
I think she should pick a gown that
she's<00:05:34.880> stepping<00:05:35.180> out<00:05:35.420> a<00:05:35.450> bit<00:05:35.690> but<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.900> same

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
she's stepping out a bit but the same

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.140 
she's stepping out a bit but the same
time<00:05:36.260> staying<00:05:36.590> her<00:05:36.710> comfort<00:05:37.160> zone<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:38.090> she

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
time staying her comfort zone so she
