00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.930
 survival that in addition to rast the first 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.189

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.819
 team 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.540
 if you don't have the steam account there is 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:29.550
 worried because it's free to create it on 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.950

 vdf euro is a statue too 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.530
 ok i think they are three great prizes 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.330
 all the others, of course, yes 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.400
 will stand out for having been 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.380
 particularly good though not winning 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.280

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.410
 consolation because we will give it to him 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.430
 what else can I tell you I can tell you 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.239
 that the schedule for this tournament will be 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.010
 what follows there will be three tests the 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.959
 I will tell you the first test immediately and it will be 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.549
 this the walls many of you know 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.920
 what it is we already had 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.880
 done one practically you will be divided into 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.549
 four teams 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.010
 each team will be catapulted and one of 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.810
 these four squares and at the end of 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.510
 some time ten minutes 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.209
 probably the middle walls will disappear 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.709
 and you will have to face those who 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.630
 will succeed to team that will succeed to 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.280
 survive will have won the walls le 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.720
 two more tests because in total there 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.660
 three tests will be the other two tests 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.200
 they are secret and you will discover them by hand 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.319
 after the first when the tournament takes place 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.359
 how to access the tournament very easy 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.569

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.730
 first time you are here from me 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.359

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.410
 from each event then from the example from 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.420
 the wall if then at the end of the walls 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.459
 the winners will find another sign 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.190
 which will then take them to the second of the 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.070
 tests if you have already played on 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.590
