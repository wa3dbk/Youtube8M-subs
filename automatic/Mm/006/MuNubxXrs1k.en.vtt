this<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.710> revived<00:00:05.160> series<00:00:05.520> solar<00:00:06.000> restore

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
this is the revived series solar restore

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.250 
this is the revived series solar restore
panel<00:00:07.470> 360<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.940> solar<00:00:09.540> panel<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.170> an

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
panel 360 it is a solar panel that is an

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.089 
panel 360 it is a solar panel that is an
active<00:00:10.590> charger<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:13.740> when<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.889> get<00:00:14.009> it

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
active charger so when you get it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.740 
active charger so when you get it
outside<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> box<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:15.059> comes<00:00:15.240> with<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
outside of the box it comes with the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.779 
outside of the box it comes with the
solar<00:00:16.379> panel<00:00:17.180> and<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.930> carabiner<00:00:19.789> carabiner

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
solar panel and a carabiner carabiner

solar panel and a carabiner carabiner
one<00:00:20.910> before<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.199> an<00:00:22.320> active<00:00:22.560> charger<00:00:22.949> so

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
one before is it is an active charger so

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.269 
one before is it is an active charger so
if<00:00:23.310> you're<00:00:23.460> out<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.910> hike<00:00:24.740> maybe<00:00:25.740> attach<00:00:26.099> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
a 5 volt maximum output so what you do

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.030 
a 5 volt maximum output so what you do
with<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.199> put<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> direct

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
with this you put it in the direct

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
with this you put it in the direct
sunlight<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.790> you'll<00:01:06.390> notice<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.720> when<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
sunlight and you'll notice that when you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
sunlight and you'll notice that when you
are<00:01:07.320> getting<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.010> blue<00:01:08.460> light<00:01:08.640> will<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.909> on

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
are getting like a blue light will be on

are getting like a blue light will be on
fluorescent<00:01:09.840> lights<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.170> room<00:01:10.229> are

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
fluorescent lights in this room are

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.899 
fluorescent lights in this room are
enough<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> turn<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.670> enough<00:01:11.880> to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
enough to turn it on but not enough to

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450 
enough to turn it on but not enough to
charge<00:01:12.119> anything<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> moment<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:14.280> it's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
charge anything at the moment but it's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.999 
charge anything at the moment but it's
out<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.729> direct<00:01:14.970> sunlight<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.140> 5<00:01:16.650> volts

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
out in direct sunlight will get 5 volts

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
out in direct sunlight will get 5 volts
the<00:01:17.130> output<00:01:17.159> maximum<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.150> 360<00:01:18.810> ma<00:01:19.020> an<00:01:19.170> hour

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the output maximum with 360 ma an hour

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.420 
the output maximum with 360 ma an hour
there's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.340> USB<00:01:21.030> port<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.750> side<00:01:22.369> there<00:01:23.369> is

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
there's a USB port on the side there is

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
there's a USB port on the side there is
no<00:01:23.759> USB<00:01:24.270> cable<00:01:25.200> included<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.950> panel<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
no USB cable included with panel so you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
no USB cable included with panel so you
do<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> provide<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.229> own<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.250> do

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
do have to provide your own all you do

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.030 
do have to provide your own all you do
is<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.790> plug<00:01:30.299> your<00:01:31.049> USB<00:01:31.110> cable<00:01:31.740> into<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> USB

battery the solar restore panel 360 well
I'll<00:01:50.460> put<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.729> 360<00:01:51.329> million<00:01:51.509> hours<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.290> say

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
I'll put it 360 million hours so say

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.980 
I'll put it 360 million hours so say
your<00:01:53.490> phone<00:01:53.729> was<00:01:53.970> at<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> five<00:01:54.360> percent<00:01:54.659> charge

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
your phone was at a five percent charge

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.219 
your phone was at a five percent charge
this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.130> outputting<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> 360<00:01:57.180> take<00:01:57.810> 2100

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
this is outputting a 360 take 2100

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.860 
this is outputting a 360 take 2100
divided

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
divided

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.560 
divided
360<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.650> that's<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.280> approximate<00:02:00.940> hours<00:02:01.300> it
