this<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.420> generic<00:00:06.600> model<00:00:07.170> that<00:00:07.350> comes<00:00:07.620> up

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
this is the generic model that comes up

before<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.189> add<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.030> firmer<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.259> get

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
before you add the more firmer and get

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
before you add the more firmer and get
everything<00:01:37.770> situated<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.210> on

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
everything situated because you have on

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.609 
everything situated because you have on
the<00:01:39.450> trouble<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.310> turn<00:01:41.310> off<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.729> skin<00:01:42.590> before<00:01:43.590> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the trouble I turn off the skin before I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.740 
the trouble I turn off the skin before I
cone<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:46.280> then<00:01:47.280> hit<00:01:47.579> shift<00:01:47.970> hold<00:01:48.479> down

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
cone it and then hit shift hold down

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.960 
cone it and then hit shift hold down
shift<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.290> move<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.729> mesh<00:01:51.380> copy<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:53.250> instant

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
shift and move the mesh copy not instant

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.609 
shift and move the mesh copy not instant
because<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.229> mimic

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
because then it would just mimic

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.200 
because then it would just mimic
everything<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> happens<00:01:56.759> with<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
everything that happens with the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.249 
everything that happens with the
internal<00:01:57.920> now<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:58.979> copied<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.030> clone<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
internal now we copied the clone you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.370 
internal now we copied the clone you
want<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> add<00:02:01.680> an<00:02:01.829> edit<00:02:02.009> poly<00:02:02.490> modifier

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
want to add an edit poly modifier

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.420 
want to add an edit poly modifier
modifier

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
modifier

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.880 
modifier
and<00:02:05.940> then<00:02:06.930> collapse<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.770> stack<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:12.830> now<00:02:13.830> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and then collapse the stack and now you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.430 
and then collapse the stack and now you
can<00:02:14.280> manipulate<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.660> turn<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.050> up<00:02:16.230> your

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
can manipulate it and turn it up your

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.190 
can manipulate it and turn it up your
morph<00:02:16.680> targets<00:02:17.160> now<00:02:18.060> go<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.540> original<00:02:19.020> and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
morph targets now go to the original and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.750 
morph targets now go to the original and
add<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.460> Morpher<00:02:20.940> modifier<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:22.610> put<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
add the Morpher modifier and put the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.620 
add the Morpher modifier and put the
Morpher<00:02:24.180> modifier<00:02:24.210> under<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.350> skin<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
Morpher modifier under the skin in the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.720 
Morpher modifier under the skin in the
stack<00:02:27.930> then<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.980> turn<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> skin<00:02:29.460> on<00:02:29.610> if

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
stack then you can turn the skin on if

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.450 
stack then you can turn the skin on if
you<00:02:29.850> like<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.940> then<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:34.130> manipulate<00:02:35.130> it

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
you like and then you can manipulate it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.010 
you like and then you can manipulate it
