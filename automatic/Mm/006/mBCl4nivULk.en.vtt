okay so what makes us work is just this
couple<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.780> command<00:02:49.230> blocks<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.400> need<00:02:50.730> two

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
couple of command blocks so you need two

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.700 
couple of command blocks so you need two
objectives<00:02:51.540> for<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.080> first<00:02:52.110> objective

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
objectives for this the first objective

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.760 
objectives for this the first objective
is<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.250> need<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:54.020> scoreboard<00:02:55.020> objective<00:02:55.200> that

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
is you need a scoreboard objective that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.910 
is you need a scoreboard objective that
uses<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.580> static<00:02:57.120> dot<00:02:57.300> swim<00:02:57.870> one<00:02:58.290> centimeter

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
uses the static dot swim one centimeter

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.280 
uses the static dot swim one centimeter
again<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.820> just<00:03:00.180> call<00:03:00.330> this<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.870> are<00:03:01.020> called

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
again I just call this the are called

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
again I just call this the are called
add<00:03:01.380> swim<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.830> then<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.370> need<00:03:02.550> another<00:03:02.850> one

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
add swim and then you need another one

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.030 
add swim and then you need another one
called<00:03:03.480> pure<00:03:03.840> twirl<00:03:04.050> purification<00:03:04.860> or

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
called pure twirl purification or

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.590 
called pure twirl purification or
whatever<00:03:05.460> you<00:03:05.640> want<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.850> call<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.480> I've

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
whatever you want to call it but I've

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.300 
whatever you want to call it but I've
got<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.020> purification<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.800> it's<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.040> dummy

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
got the purification and it's a dummy

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.650 
got the purification and it's a dummy
variable<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.000> only<00:03:09.180> those<00:03:09.420> two

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
variable so it's only those two

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.900 
variable so it's only those two
variables<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.620> what<00:03:10.740> I've<00:03:10.830> basically<00:03:11.040> done<00:03:11.610> is

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
variables so what I've basically done is

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.140 
variables so what I've basically done is
the<00:03:12.030> first<00:03:13.220> command<00:03:14.220> block<00:03:14.400> over<00:03:14.670> here<00:03:14.700> test

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the first command block over here test

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.370 
the first command block over here test
for<00:03:15.780> any<00:03:15.930> or<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.380> going<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.620> give<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:18.380> poison

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
for any or is going to give a poison

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.740 
for any or is going to give a poison
effect<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.890> anybody<00:03:20.310> who's<00:03:20.520> within<00:03:21.420> ten

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
effect to anybody who's within ten

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.960 
effect to anybody who's within ten
blocks<00:03:21.990> of<00:03:22.320> those<00:03:22.800> coordinates<00:03:23.550> which<00:03:23.760> is

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
blocks of those coordinates which is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.450 
blocks of those coordinates which is
just<00:03:24.870> look<00:03:25.200> over<00:03:25.380> there<00:03:25.650> which<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.040> center

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
just look over there which is the center

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.780 
just look over there which is the center
of<00:03:26.490> that<00:03:27.350> poisoned<00:03:28.350> well<00:03:28.560> okay<00:03:29.400> it's<00:03:29.550> going<00:03:29.700> to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
of that poisoned well okay it's going to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.330 
of that poisoned well okay it's going to
look<00:03:30.000> for<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.330> minimum<00:03:30.870> swim<00:03:31.230> score<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.710> one<00:03:32.070> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
look for a minimum swim score of one and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.900 
look for a minimum swim score of one and
a<00:03:33.000> purification<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.990> at<00:03:34.170> least<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.590> zero<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.820> if

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
a purification of at least of zero so if

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.880 
a purification of at least of zero so if
I<00:03:36.000> don't<00:03:36.240> have<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.390> purification<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.740> have

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
I don't have a purification and I have

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.490 
I don't have a purification and I have
half<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.520> swim<00:03:38.940> score<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.420> one<00:03:39.690> it's<00:03:40.140> then<00:03:40.320> going

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
half a swim score of one it's then going

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.390 
half a swim score of one it's then going
to<00:03:40.620> give<00:03:40.920> me<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.460> poison<00:03:41.880> effect<00:03:42.320> for<00:03:43.320> one<00:03:43.830> for

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
to give me the poison effect for one for

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.370 
to give me the poison effect for one for
three<00:03:44.580> seconds<00:03:44.940> okay<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:45.810> exactly<00:03:46.110> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
three seconds okay and it's exactly the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.750 
three seconds okay and it's exactly the
same<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.860> next<00:03:47.130> command<00:03:47.400> block<00:03:47.580> which

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
same for the next command block which

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
same for the next command block which
just<00:03:48.000> gives<00:03:48.180> me<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.480> nausea<00:03:49.020> if<00:03:49.200> anybody<00:03:49.860> is

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
just gives me the nausea if anybody is

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.550 
just gives me the nausea if anybody is
within<00:03:50.070> ten<00:03:50.430> blocks<00:03:50.550> of<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.380> center<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.410> that

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
within ten blocks of that center of that

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.590 
within ten blocks of that center of that
pond<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.220> they<00:03:54.020> have<00:03:55.160> a<00:03:56.160> swim<00:03:56.580> score<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.330> one

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
pond and they have a swim score of one

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.230 
pond and they have a swim score of one
okay<00:03:58.310> then<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.550> next<00:03:59.580> thing<00:03:59.880> we're<00:04:00.030> going<00:04:00.150> to

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
okay then the next thing we're going to

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.860 
okay then the next thing we're going to
do<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.510> I'm<00:04:00.690> going<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:01.050> then<00:04:01.170> actually<00:04:01.620> reset

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
do is I'm going to then actually reset

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.040 
do is I'm going to then actually reset
okay

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
okay

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.190 
okay
they<00:04:04.290> swim<00:04:04.620> school<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.070> zero<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.540> every

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
they swim school to zero so that every

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.600 
they swim school to zero so that every
search<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:07.590> just<00:04:07.709> every<00:04:07.890> time<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.070> swim<00:04:08.430> it

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
search it's just every time I swim it

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.610 
search it's just every time I swim it
resets<00:04:09.150> them<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.480> zero<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.959> then<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.350> last

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
resets them to zero and then the last

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.260 
resets them to zero and then the last
one<00:04:10.830> over<00:04:11.100> here<00:04:11.370> you'll<00:04:11.790> see<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.060> it's

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
one over here you'll see that it's

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.420 
one over here you'll see that it's
exactly<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.959> same<00:04:13.140> thing<00:04:13.350> as<00:04:13.500> as<00:04:13.800> this<00:04:14.100> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
exactly the same thing as as this the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.940 
exactly the same thing as as this the
set<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.600> swim<00:04:15.810> score<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.200> 0<00:04:16.410> over<00:04:16.709> here

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
set the swim score to 0 over here

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.300 
set the swim score to 0 over here
except<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.880> now<00:04:18.270> contains<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:19.020> radius<00:04:19.620> minimum

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
except it now contains a radius minimum

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.220 
except it now contains a radius minimum
so<00:04:20.790> I'm<00:04:21.000> only<00:04:21.239> going<00:04:21.480> to<00:04:21.510> check<00:04:21.720> for<00:04:21.750> anybody

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
so I'm only going to check for anybody

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.080 
so I'm only going to check for anybody
who<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.640> at<00:04:23.640> least<00:04:24.420> ten<00:04:24.960> blocks<00:04:25.290> away<00:04:25.500> from<00:04:26.190> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
who is at least ten blocks away from the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.360 
who is at least ten blocks away from the
center<00:04:27.450> of<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.690> pool<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.650> 20<00:04:29.220> blocks

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
center of the pool and that is 20 blocks

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.800 
center of the pool and that is 20 blocks
away<00:04:29.580> for<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.030> center<00:04:30.300> of<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.450> pool<00:04:30.600> so<00:04:30.750> it

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
away for the center of the pool so it

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.480 
away for the center of the pool so it
gives<00:04:30.990> me<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.140> radius<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.620> about<00:04:31.800> 10<00:04:32.280> blocks

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
gives me a radius of about 10 blocks

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.870 
gives me a radius of about 10 blocks
where<00:04:33.330> when<00:04:33.510> anybody<00:04:33.900> actually<00:04:34.080> enters<00:04:34.880> those

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
where when anybody actually enters those

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.820 
where when anybody actually enters those
10<00:04:36.180> blocks<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.660> sets<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.140> from<00:04:37.380> score<00:04:37.680> to

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
10 blocks it sets this from score to

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.439 
10 blocks it sets this from score to
zero<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.310> in<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.790> moment<00:04:39.180> they

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:51.779 
moment they enter this ten block buffer

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.439 
moment they enter this ten block buffer
it'll<00:04:52.110> be<00:04:52.229> removed<00:04:52.589> okay<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.550> then<00:04:53.939> the<00:04:54.330> way

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
block radius of that so you can take

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.719 
block radius of that so you can take
them<00:05:10.589> all<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.740> brick<00:05:11.009> water<00:05:11.400> breathing

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729

anywhere<00:05:14.969> close<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.300> poison<00:05:15.930> water<00:05:16.110> it<00:05:16.439> will

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:16.589 
anywhere close to poison water it will

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.850 
anywhere close to poison water it will
act<00:05:16.770> as<00:05:16.949> an<00:05:17.069> antidote<00:05:17.870> okay<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.560> when<00:05:19.770> it

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
act as an antidote okay so when it

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.739 
act as an antidote okay so when it
actually<00:05:20.009> successfully<00:05:20.819> removes<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.300> it<00:05:21.569> will

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:21.749 
actually successfully removes it it will

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:23.959 
actually successfully removes it it will
then<00:05:21.900> turn<00:05:22.110> on<00:05:22.409> this<00:05:22.650> comparator<00:05:23.249> which<00:05:23.789> will

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
then turn on this comparator which will

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.329 
then turn on this comparator which will
then<00:05:24.120> give<00:05:24.389> me<00:05:24.569> a<00:05:24.599> score<00:05:25.169> of<00:05:25.379> one<00:05:25.949> for

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:26.339 
then give me a score of one for

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.629 
then give me a score of one for
purification<00:05:26.669> which<00:05:27.419> then<00:05:27.659> another<00:05:28.020> Faiz

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
purification which then another Faiz

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.959 
purification which then another Faiz
