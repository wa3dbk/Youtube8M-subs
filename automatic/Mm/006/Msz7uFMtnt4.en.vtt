00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
okay he got back in there I saw some of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.010 
okay he got back in there I saw some of
the<00:02:05.759> bugs<00:02:05.939> pull<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:06.570> okay

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the bugs pull out that's okay

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.109 
the bugs pull out that's okay
the<00:02:07.799> trick<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.580> want<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> catch<00:02:08.970> those

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the trick is you want to catch those

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.160 
the trick is you want to catch those
bugs<00:02:09.420> use<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.370> ice<00:02:11.370> use<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.850> plant<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.989> BO

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
bugs use a ice use that plant up in BO

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.350 
bugs use a ice use that plant up in BO
jar<00:02:13.470> put<00:02:14.280> some<00:02:14.400> holes<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.760> though<00:02:14.910> well

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
jar put some holes in it though well

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.479 
jar put some holes in it though well
this<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.600> doesn't<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.500> then<00:02:16.950> once

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
this one doesn't have it and then once

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.030 
this one doesn't have it and then once
you<00:02:17.610> kappa<00:02:17.790> capture<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.569> bunch<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.900> them<00:02:19.040> and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
you kappa capture a bunch of them and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.670 
you kappa capture a bunch of them and
put<00:02:20.220> them<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.930> freezer<00:02:21.930> for<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.350> minute

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
put them in a freezer for like a minute

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.290 
put them in a freezer for like a minute
actually<00:02:23.340> I'll<00:02:23.580> go<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.850> minute<00:02:24.180> 15

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
actually I'll go like a minute 15

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.540 
actually I'll go like a minute 15
seconds<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.140> then<00:02:25.800> there<00:02:25.980> they're<00:02:26.310> frozen

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
seconds and then there they're frozen

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.630 
seconds and then there they're frozen
put<00:02:27.420> them<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.630> there<00:02:27.780> they<00:02:27.810> come<00:02:28.050> alive<00:02:28.260> and

to figure out how to feed these guys and

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.000 
to figure out how to feed these guys and
this<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:37.000> only<00:03:37.210> way<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.540> works<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.860> works

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010
