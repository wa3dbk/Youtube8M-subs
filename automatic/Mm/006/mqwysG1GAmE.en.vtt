 he 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.540
 rar 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:22.750
 We hold the final goal of World Cup Asia Final Qualified Japan vs. Iraq game 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:27.730
 2 people become to the point in this goal 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.280
 The first was Okazaki who assisted and the second scored a goal 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.310
 It is Maeda 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:37.129
 This goal is- 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:41.200
 I goal was born, starting from the throw-in of Kiba, but it is real is 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:47.170
 Corner kick free kick is not only set play 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.540
 It is this restart from slow-in. Set play is actually more than a goal . 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.190
 It's very likely that it's possible 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:01:00.230
 I think that it can be said that it is the goal that I did not miss the place firmly 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:05.420
 I think this is a pattern I have practiced in the team many times 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:11.000
 Okazaki goes by a player who throws a ball to throw at a throw 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.670
 Okazaki looks back at the position of the defender and checks again and again 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.990
 Involved 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:22.010
 Okazaki uses his own space behind him. 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:27.830
 It is a play that you use the space you created yourself 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.930
 I'm sure that you take the back it is to increase the speed depending on possible space here 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.720
 Komano at the timing 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:40.040
 The ball is thrown in here at the center back and go to the cover 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:44.330
 And, of course, you will be in this box 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.450
 All Iraqi players are of course all defenders are ball watchers 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.260
 I know that comes with this pattern 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.370
 Maeda is already from the beginning 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.670
 When I took a good position according to the timing well 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:03.100
 Okazaki there very well outside 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:09.110
 That I think that tailored to Maeda, but was the only goal Maeda match in accordance with the Maeda 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:14.330
 It can be said, but I was very these three practice but 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.080
 I think that it can be said that it is the goal that the will was united and it was connected well 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.560
 I will 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.860
 Because set-pieces is not only click this fall 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.860
 The real divide the very outcome is that throw-in 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.470
 Because it was only this goal in this Iraq war 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.470
 I can say that it was a very valuable goal 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.190
 pa 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.190
 Hmm
