mine hot stamped initially because I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.690 
mine hot stamped initially because I
wasn't<00:02:54.840> quite<00:02:54.930> sure<00:02:55.049> if<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.500> would<00:02:55.560> even<00:02:55.700> carry

would keep it because at the time I was

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.990 
would keep it because at the time I was
kind<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.819> between<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.900> zippy<00:03:25.970> but<00:03:26.970> I

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
kind of between this and the zippy but I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.699 
kind of between this and the zippy but I
ended<00:03:27.269> up<00:03:27.359> liking<00:03:27.570> this<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.049> more<00:03:28.350> for<00:03:28.590> so

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
ended up liking this one more for so

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.789 
ended up liking this one more for so
many<00:03:28.829> reasons<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.459> opened<00:03:29.850> up<00:03:30.109> as<00:03:31.109> opposed<00:03:31.590> to

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
many reasons it opened up as opposed to

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.130 
many reasons it opened up as opposed to
accordion<00:03:32.340> style<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.390> then<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.660> course<00:03:33.690> also

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
accordion style and then of course also

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.069 
accordion style and then of course also
it<00:03:34.440> holds<00:03:34.859> more<00:03:35.359> spaces<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.600> essentially

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
it holds more spaces so you essentially

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.699 
it holds more spaces so you essentially
have<00:03:37.200> 12<00:03:38.130> card<00:03:38.489> slots<00:03:38.819> here<00:03:39.299> 13<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.470> count

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
have 12 card slots here 13 if you count

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.960 
have 12 card slots here 13 if you count
this<00:03:40.859> picture<00:03:41.280> window<00:03:41.640> 14<00:03:42.420> 15<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.819> then<00:03:44.819> on

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
this picture window 14 15 and then on

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.129 
this picture window 14 15 and then on
the<00:03:45.060> back<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:46.530> course<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:47.250> zipper

like red and my belief like that deep
purple<00:04:27.530> right<00:04:28.530> before<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:28.919> guess<00:04:29.400> they

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
purple right before I guess they

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.670 
purple right before I guess they
discontinued<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:30.780> there<00:04:31.349> are<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.500> few

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
discontinued it so there are a few

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.119 
discontinued it so there are a few
colors<00:04:32.070> out<00:04:32.220> there<00:04:32.280> if<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.789> can<00:04:32.970> find<00:04:33.360> them
