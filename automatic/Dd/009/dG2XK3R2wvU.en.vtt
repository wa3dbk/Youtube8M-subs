snow<00:02:20.160> white<00:02:22.940> well<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.299> snow<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.629> really

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.220 

since<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.970> fluffy<00:02:43.300> snow<00:02:43.510> doesn't<00:02:43.720> pack<00:02:43.990> well

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
since the fluffy snow doesn't pack well

since the fluffy snow doesn't pack well
it<00:02:44.380> was<00:02:44.500> hard<00:02:44.709> making<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.100> snowman<00:02:45.340> too<00:02:47.520> but<00:02:48.520> hey

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:11.809 
it worked
kind<00:02:50.680> of

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.339

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.110 
and you can't forget snow angels that's
actually<00:03:17.709> much<00:03:17.950> easier<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.489> do<00:03:18.610> in<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.819> fluffy

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120
