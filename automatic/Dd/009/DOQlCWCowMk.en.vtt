00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
so on the DR 880 the drum machine is

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.280 
so on the DR 880 the drum machine is
just<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.400> great<00:00:08.880> part<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.540> but<00:00:09.900> there's<00:00:10.080> also

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
just a great part of it but there's also

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.070 
just a great part of it but there's also
a<00:00:10.440> guitar<00:00:10.800> processor<00:00:11.400> built-in<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.509> has<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.690> ton

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
a guitar processor built-in it has a ton

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.780 
a guitar processor built-in it has a ton
of<00:00:13.110> great<00:00:13.500> sounds<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.099> here<00:00:14.309> there's<00:00:14.490> 50

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
of great sounds in here there's 50

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.340 
of great sounds in here there's 50
presets<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.420> are<00:00:15.540> automatically<00:00:16.049> built

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
presets that are automatically built

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.050 
presets that are automatically built
into<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.619> machine<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.160> then<00:00:17.550> there's<00:00:17.730> 50

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
into the machine and then there's 50

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.820 
into the machine and then there's 50
user<00:00:18.300> patch<00:00:18.660> areas<00:00:19.109> as<00:00:19.289> well<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.800> to

save them as your own so let's go

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.730 
save them as your own so let's go
through<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.109> couple<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.439> these<00:00:25.529> different

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
through a couple of these different

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:40.620 
through a couple of these different
guitar<00:00:26.160> patches<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:32.239> a<00:00:33.239> nice<00:00:33.390> clean<00:00:33.570> sound
