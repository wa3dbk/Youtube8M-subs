this spot here when I like to just
loosen<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> soil<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> shovel<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.390> a

little bit to help break things up you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.020 
little bit to help break things up you
don't<00:00:31.380> want<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> soil<00:00:31.949> wet<00:00:32.189> anytime<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.910> work

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030

in the ground you don't want it wet but

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.500 
in the ground you don't want it wet but
moist<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.010> good<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.790> easier<00:00:36.239> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
moist is good because it's easier to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.940 
moist is good because it's easier to
work<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.170> soil<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> here<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.090> just

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950

loosening that up just a little bit you
can<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.110> clay<00:00:43.559> soil<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.579> we

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
can see that it's really clay soil so we

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.729 
can see that it's really clay soil so we
need<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> add<00:00:45.390> some<00:00:45.600> amendments<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.410> and

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
and I always add peat moss to my soil

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.189 
and I always add peat moss to my soil
helps<00:01:01.859> hold<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:03.120> nutrients<00:01:03.809> helps<00:01:04.049> retain

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
helps hold the nutrients helps retain

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.000 
helps hold the nutrients helps retain
water<00:01:04.799> helps<00:01:05.760> loosen<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.390> soil<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.890> I'll

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
water helps loosen up that soil so I'll

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670

little rough around the edges but I love
it<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> good<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> soil<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:22.020> tiller<00:01:22.380> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it so good for the soil and a tiller is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.179 
it so good for the soil and a tiller is
really<00:01:22.950> helpful<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.549> turn<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.210> by<00:01:24.390> hand

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
really helpful you can turn this by hand

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.280 
really helpful you can turn this by hand
but<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> lot<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.580> work<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:27.930> be

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
but it's a lot of work you just be

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.899 
but it's a lot of work you just be
flipping<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.740> upside<00:01:28.890> down<00:01:29.070> several<00:01:29.579> times

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
flipping it upside down several times

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.260 
flipping it upside down several times
but<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:32.700> end<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:34.100> Eva

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
but as you can see you end up with Eva

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.539 
but as you can see you end up with Eva
you<00:01:36.270> end<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.470> big<00:01:37.680> old<00:01:37.890> clumps<00:01:38.369> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you end up with with big old clumps so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
you end up with with big old clumps so
it's<00:01:39.060> nicer<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> tiller<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.200> break

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it's nicer if you have a tiller to break

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.080 
it's nicer if you have a tiller to break
those<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:40.710> otherwise<00:01:41.009> you're<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> have

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
those up otherwise you're going to have

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.289 
those up otherwise you're going to have
more<00:01:42.659> labor<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.590> more<00:01:43.799> exercise<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:45.119> got

more labor but more exercise just got
this<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.659> tiller<00:01:45.960> which<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.290> like

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
this little tiller which I like

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
this little tiller which I like
I've<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.250> raised<00:01:47.490> beds<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> works<00:01:48.930> in

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I've got raised beds and so it works in

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.569 
I've got raised beds and so it works in
that<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> big<00:01:49.740> tiller<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.250> you've<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that but a big tiller if you've got a

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.520 
that but a big tiller if you've got a
big<00:01:50.759> area<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.329> probably<00:01:51.720> better<00:01:52.049> than<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
big area is probably better than one of

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
big area is probably better than one of
these<00:01:52.649> guys<00:01:52.970> we're<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.299> fire<00:01:54.540> this

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
these guys we're just going to fire this

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.030 
these guys we're just going to fire this
dude<00:01:54.990> up

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
dude up

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:09.369 
dude up
I<00:01:57.170> work<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> soil

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.899 

with<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.619> these<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:11.069> want<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.370> let<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:11.550> pull

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
with one of these we want to let it pull

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.649 
with one of these we want to let it pull
forward<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.569> then<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.840> fold<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:14.659> of

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
forward and then we fold that and of

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.690 
forward and then we fold that and of
course<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.080> bigger<00:02:16.260> area<00:02:16.530> you'd<00:02:17.340> go<00:02:17.489> one

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
course in a bigger area you'd go one

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.860 
course in a bigger area you'd go one
direction<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.209> then<00:02:18.299> come<00:02:18.330> back<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.750> other

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
direction and then come back the other

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.559 
direction and then come back the other
way

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.150 

and<00:02:25.569> do<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:25.900> until<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.410> looks<00:02:26.560> really<00:02:26.920> broke

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
and do this until it looks really broke

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.580 
and do this until it looks really broke
up<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.330> see<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.690> our<00:02:28.810> clay<00:02:29.020> clumps<00:02:29.470> are

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
up you can see that our clay clumps are

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.800 
up you can see that our clay clumps are
broke<00:02:29.830> up<00:02:30.069> and<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:30.760> nice<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.000> low<00:02:31.390> me<00:02:31.599> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
broke up and it's nice and low me and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.229 
broke up and it's nice and low me and
now<00:02:32.770> it'll<00:02:33.160> actually<00:02:33.400> be<00:02:33.670> able<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.970> breathe

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
now it'll actually be able to breathe

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.510 
now it'll actually be able to breathe
and<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:35.110> can<00:02:35.260> plant<00:02:35.530> now<00:02:35.830> we<00:02:35.890> can<00:02:36.099> add<00:02:36.250> some

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
and we can plant now we can add some

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.640 
and we can plant now we can add some
amendments<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.330> at<00:02:37.599> this<00:02:37.750> point<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.530> can

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
amendments to this at this point we can

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.680 
amendments to this at this point we can
add<00:02:38.709> some<00:02:38.890> green<00:02:39.160> sand<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:39.970> which<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.660> a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
add some green sand to it which is a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.710 
add some green sand to it which is a
potassium<00:02:41.760> feeds<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.940> overall<00:02:43.330> health<00:02:43.599> of

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
potassium feeds the overall health of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.150 
potassium feeds the overall health of
the<00:02:43.780> plant<00:02:44.080> we<00:02:44.290> could<00:02:44.410> add<00:02:44.530> some<00:02:44.560> soft<00:02:44.950> rock

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
the plant we could add some soft rock

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.089 
the plant we could add some soft rock
phosphate<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.959> then<00:02:47.410> whatever<00:02:47.830> we're

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
phosphate to it and then whatever we're

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.009 
phosphate to it and then whatever we're
planting<00:02:48.370> we<00:02:48.790> can<00:02:48.940> add<00:02:49.120> other<00:02:49.390> stuff<00:02:49.510> later

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
planting we can add other stuff later

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.920 
planting we can add other stuff later
but<00:02:50.560> that's<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.980> good<00:02:51.190> base<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.489> start

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
but that's just a good base to start

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.540 
but that's just a good base to start
your<00:02:52.930> soil<00:02:53.290> ready<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.310> go<00:02:54.489> easy<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.390> that
