00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
then this little on/off switch there we

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.279 
then this little on/off switch there we
go<00:00:49.129> little<00:00:50.129> throttle<00:00:50.670> right<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.030> oh<00:00:51.289> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
go little throttle right here oh and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.560 
go little throttle right here oh and
then<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> handles<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> course<00:00:53.340> kind<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> cool

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
then the handles of course kind of cool

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.090 
then the handles of course kind of cool
how<00:00:54.719> they<00:00:55.190> bolt<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.859> right<00:00:58.859> so

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it that's the the Eco reco m3 the fun

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020 
it that's the the Eco reco m3 the fun
little<00:02:04.200> kickstand<00:02:04.710> pretty<00:02:05.670> impressive

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
little kickstand pretty impressive

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.630 
little kickstand pretty impressive
weighs<00:02:06.960> 34<00:02:07.590> pounds<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.520> you're

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
weighs 34 pounds so you know if you're

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.010 
weighs 34 pounds so you know if you're
carrying<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:09.030> thing<00:02:09.090> around<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.660> handle

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
carrying this thing around the handle

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.130 
carrying this thing around the handle
mount<00:02:10.820> actually<00:02:11.820> let's<00:02:11.970> do<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.300> put<00:02:12.930> this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
mount actually let's do that put this

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.780 
mount actually let's do that put this
down<00:02:13.350> like<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:14.510> see<00:02:15.510> how<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.720> folds<00:02:16.080> down

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
down like that see how it folds down

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.020 
down like that see how it folds down
then<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.090> lift<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.540> up<00:02:18.720> whoop<00:02:19.940> carry<00:02:20.940> it

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
then you just lift it up whoop carry it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.190 
then you just lift it up whoop carry it
around<00:02:23.360> for<00:02:24.360> more<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.020> other
