welcome to our detailed breakdown of the
diana<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.549> ladies<00:00:06.060> d25<00:00:06.899> gene<00:00:07.230> available<00:00:07.770> at

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
diana is a ladies d25 gene available at

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.749 
diana is a ladies d25 gene available at

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.520 

so<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.880> d25<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.110> more<00:00:13.230> high-end

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
so the d25 is one of the more high-end

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.860 
so the d25 is one of the more high-end
and<00:00:13.830> functional<00:00:14.370> genes<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:14.849> riding<00:00:15.150> for

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
and functional genes for riding for

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.990 
and functional genes for riding for
ladies<00:00:16.170> from<00:00:16.440> Diana's<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.130> step<00:00:17.580> down<00:00:17.730> would<00:00:17.910> be

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
ladies from Diana's a step down would be

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.340 
ladies from Diana's a step down would be
something<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> D<00:00:18.630> 19<00:00:19.050> which<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
something like the D 19 which is a

the<00:01:08.670> side<00:01:08.850> let's<00:01:09.180> show<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> line<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> side

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the side let's show the line on the side

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.530 
the side let's show the line on the side
really<00:01:10.110> quickly<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:11.610> also<00:01:11.790> show<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
back so we do have belt loops it's meant

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.789 
back so we do have belt loops it's meant
to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.420> functional<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.200> riding<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.680> it's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
to be functional for riding but it's

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
to be functional for riding but it's
also<00:01:17.009> meant<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.549> good<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:17.970> meant<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
stick out like a sore thumb you know if

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
stick out like a sore thumb you know if
you<00:01:20.790> need<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> match<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.420> rest<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you need it to match the rest of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.539 
you need it to match the rest of
whatever<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.799> wearing<00:01:22.979> whether<00:01:23.310> you're

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
on or off the bike so that's actually
