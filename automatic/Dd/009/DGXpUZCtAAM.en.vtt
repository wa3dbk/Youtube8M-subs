00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
I'll just reverse it from the bottom and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.279 
I'll just reverse it from the bottom and
I'm<00:01:01.309> just<00:01:01.519> confirming<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:02.120> again<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.600> you

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
need to have a backup pin in case if you

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.790 
need to have a backup pin in case if you
forget<00:01:05.150> it<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:05.600> I'm<00:01:05.840> just<00:01:06.050> having<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.500> backup

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
forget it so I'm just having a backup

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.300 
forget it so I'm just having a backup
you<00:01:06.920> know

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
you know

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
zero zero zero zero so it's set so let

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.980 
zero zero zero zero so it's set so let
me<00:01:09.740> quickly<00:01:09.800> show<00:01:10.010> you<00:01:10.160> how<00:01:10.280> it's<00:01:10.610> working<00:01:11.480> so

me quickly show you how it's working so
it's<00:01:12.140> from<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.440> bottom<00:01:12.590> 1<00:01:13.100> 2<00:01:13.280> 3<00:01:13.460> 4<00:01:13.820> 5<00:01:14.090> 5<00:01:14.240> and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
it's from the bottom 1 2 3 4 5 5 and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.450 
it's from the bottom 1 2 3 4 5 5 and
it's<00:01:14.750> working<00:01:15.020> now<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.470> if<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:15.979> try<00:01:16.159> out<00:01:16.189> all

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
it's working now and if you try out all

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.710 
it's working now and if you try out all
the<00:01:16.610> code<00:01:16.790> it<00:01:16.939> won't<00:01:17.150> work<00:01:17.299> because<00:01:17.479> I've

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
the code it won't work because I've

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.520 
the code it won't work because I've
changes<00:01:18.140> already

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
changes already

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.560 
changes already
so<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:19.520> is<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> new<00:01:19.850> code<00:01:20.060> which<00:01:20.180> I'm<00:01:20.360> set<00:01:20.540> up

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
so this is a new code which I'm set up

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.109 
so this is a new code which I'm set up
and<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.350> working<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:22.640> is<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.790> very<00:01:22.970> good

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.789 
and it's working so this is a very good

pretty much low when it comes to

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
benchmark tests on the L 70 duels let me

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.509 
benchmark tests on the L 70 duels let me
see<00:03:02.200> how<00:03:02.319> this<00:03:02.439> device<00:03:02.709> performs<00:03:03.159> when<00:03:03.459> it

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
see how this device performs when it

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.240 
see how this device performs when it
comes<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.909> benchmark<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:05.230> here's<00:03:05.829> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
comes to benchmark so here's the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.089 
comes to benchmark so here's the
benchmark<00:03:07.000> results<00:03:07.449> and<00:03:07.719> I<00:03:08.049> expect<00:03:08.919> that<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
benchmark results and I expect that the

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.599 
benchmark results and I expect that the
device<00:03:09.310> will<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:10.709> getting<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.949> score<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.430> about

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
device will be getting a score of about

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.490 
device will be getting a score of about
twelve<00:03:13.030> thousand<00:03:13.480> second<00:03:13.780> about<00:03:13.989> thirteen

twelve thousand second about thirteen

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.259 
twelve thousand second about thirteen
thousand<00:03:14.980> less<00:03:15.340> than<00:03:15.579> thirteen<00:03:15.879> thousand

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
thousand less than thirteen thousand

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.199 
thousand less than thirteen thousand
which<00:03:16.389> is<00:03:16.739> decent<00:03:17.739> enough<00:03:18.099> I<00:03:18.370> won't<00:03:18.549> say<00:03:18.819> it's

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
which is decent enough I won't say it's

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.240 
which is decent enough I won't say it's
very<00:03:19.719> good<00:03:20.049> but<00:03:20.319> if<00:03:20.439> they<00:03:20.650> sent<00:03:20.889> enough<00:03:21.129> when

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
very good but if they sent enough when

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.759 
very good but if they sent enough when
it<00:03:21.310> comes<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.699> scores<00:03:22.030> but<00:03:22.629> if<00:03:22.719> you<00:03:22.810> have<00:03:22.959> used

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
it comes to scores but if you have used

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.890 
it comes to scores but if you have used
phones<00:03:24.340> like<00:03:24.549> moto<00:03:24.819> Z<00:03:25.090> it's<00:03:25.209> pretty<00:03:25.629> good

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
phones like moto Z it's pretty good
