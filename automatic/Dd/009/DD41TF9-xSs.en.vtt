00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:02.729
 the origin of the barbecue is hidden in 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:04.870
 clubs fogs of history 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.960
 but it is believed that the first began to do 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.469
 barbecue aborigines of the caribbean islands 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.940
 of course then they didn't have an eel grill 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.759
 they fried meat nadym novsk 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.810
 Today, no one will but dig in his 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.949
 garden pit for roasting collection 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:19.710
 faiths 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.060
 in g in g 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.119
 conventional coal production 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.759
 grilling begins with a big crystal 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.310
 drives 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580
 40 kopeks more each 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.690
 them pianist from moscow 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.260
 and then they are sent under the press which 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 stretches the disc big bowl 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.480
 European Union Stalin during the game 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.670
 steel can tear if not 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.830
 sufficiently blurry so every drive 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.340
 generously lubricated 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.440
 before you send a request to r 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.460
 understandably the passage quickly turns into 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.120
 flat piece of steel in a circle bowl 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 in g 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.460
 so the passage looks from behind 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.140
 using mechanical power 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 hammer produces 500 tons of pressure 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.410
 same type of drive use for 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.410
 cap production 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.580
 the operator reviews each 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.740
 breakage and crack detail 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.200
 then she goes to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 passage which is cut off the occasion 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.690
 cuts are thrown into the basket for reuse 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.950
 processing 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.369
 further barbecue 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.840
 spins 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 automatically roller bends lumps 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.040
 after that the bowl is perforated 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.760
 to make vent 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.760
 holes 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.959
 approx now it is the turn of welding 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.019
 weld metal in the bowl 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.730
 connections in which legs will be attached 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.179
 and won 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.179
 one 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.249
 m 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.189
 here pens are drawn up in 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.079
 mounts 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.229
 car turns 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.739
 providing a bowl in automatic welding machines 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.739
 which is welded handles with each 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.249
 parties 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.249
 Yu 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.719
 at another station working on the covers 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:45.859
 barbecue and 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.249
 each is welded handles 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.709
 she will allow the cook to lower the lid so that 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.569
 change the cooking temperature and then 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:53.389
 understand 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.389
 when is it time to turn the burgers 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.879
 barbecue parts are traveling on a suspension 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.879
 conveyor belt washing installation 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.310
 here they essentially give them away with soap and water. 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.310
 then hit the arrow 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.329
 they are sent to the finishing area 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.919
 here they are sprinkled with glass powder 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:32.729
 I'm going to the hot oven 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.759
 840 8 degrees Celsius 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.839
 here the glass was Caspian repent 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.139
 begging for a deal that will protect 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.369
 details as well as communities and five 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.059
 and will last for years 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.330
 m 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.049
 tons 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.049
 2 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.019
 So 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.129
 to then they pass under the lamps here 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.489
 spotlight any defects crafts in 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.209
 which should be a mirror 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.739
 the technician reviewed every detail from all 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.969
 sides of tons 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.459
 to 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.939
 bye now perforation 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.099
 the machine makes the valve of aluminum 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.749
 it simultaneously cuts the shape and 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:24.580
 trademark denmark 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.430
 of the company 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.880
 damper is a useful addition which 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.900
 allows the gate to control the flow 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.900
 air in the grill 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.999
 data on the new palm 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.240
 and the flap is set to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.240
 cover vent 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.180
 and already the consumer makes the final 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.580
 it should take a few minutes 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.530
 before it goes meat
