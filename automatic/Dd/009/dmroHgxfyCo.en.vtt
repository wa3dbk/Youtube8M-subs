00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:23.440
 hello do not know how to do so 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.840
 to do a little less one and 161 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.510
 dogs do I have to start 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.100
 from one of my friends decide what you 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.949
 so you 'll stay in his garage for 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.960
 water to Tunisians then by dint of 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.089
 keep tugging on his wife one day 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.730
 nor did he call me then to Sunday and that 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:44.229
 I was interested in this order on game 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:48.069
 cowardice del tha as well to finish the 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:49.780
 plagiarism that he started there I think 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:51.190
 not just the broom in the framing that 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.079
 really worth on the charles and 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.059
 I try to follow the take for her 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.670
 or you have to win while staying 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.159
 I had suggested to the guiding 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.229
 mechanical at these posts noises if 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:06.190
 she needed 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.960
 get confidence gives the cars there are 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.789
 children that melanie will do better 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.149
 that me for example take the 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.729
 winners of all the pieces keep 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.090
 in gold of the displaced either it helps me 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.969
 a lot 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.880
 but little notes of you who are 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.750
 placed so that we could drama was going 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.750
 find easily 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.020
 there are children who interested me a 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.870
 hot to labeaume said rather has a chariot 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.360
 specifically made in canada to 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.290
 the order at daisy town is another 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.450
 similar but dengue trim and 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.040
 business he does Canadian so that's 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.140
 interesting said pillay was not the 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.610
 same wider audience brings you a 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.370
 other like that in the dungeon he did not 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.140
 as much as I have a show 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.450
 they neglect because without fault 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.250
 result this here i am in canada are 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.380
 a little longer 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.350
 my father ubu really be it done 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.170
 in a way that the chariot he is 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.470
 original hamon really wants minimal 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.470
 this aspect must then it's this guide is 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.920
 young but a push to do the best 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.920
 that I can do 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.600
 when he was at these two steps and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.790
 chariot trends we had found 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.440
 negatives one's hutch cases and 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.040
 then we found one of the pictures 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.040
 original 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.599
 this summer, for sure, we worked 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.049
 on it is to give a life then there 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.720
 except the skin as soldiers were 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:49.920
 Complaints tar then dirt then we 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:53.769
 said that but there are a lot of 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.180
 dyed hair in red worked 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.810
 together but it encourages me too 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.370
 alfred 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.739
 I work night connected from the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.989
 day does that come home car 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.790
 charlot only a night it really 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.650
 I'm interested in pau but the fact that 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.110
 melanie you are here it's something 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.340
 for her in the aftermath then it's 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.739
 something that appreciated because 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.170
 that having put the land then becomes 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.870
 a project like that together that's what 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.709
 I'm interested it's not fair to say that 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.890
 alain beauchamp 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.900
 it is she that the case 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.569
 what I like most about this project if 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.080
 it's really the time that goes with 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.069
 my father 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.550
 and then even aflomb of really 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.780
 applied as well as nothing like 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.510
 to work is the children singing but 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.580
 waiting to hear it's a project of 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.680
 three years we are already an enemy of god 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.230
 to order but kaka reduces the year 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:52.810
 next hope marc lachaud eve 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:54.959
 near the place of the facts and have lived in 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.959
 la France
