00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.980
 cardinal knowledge cardinal signs 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.190
 need to secure and 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.489
 to limit 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.399
 walking around some danger 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.730
 mark danger on the ground well 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.449
 let's save us there was danger 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.430
 here we had a north direction and 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:56.350
 4 characters are not placed here 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.350
 Rob inserted clear and not very 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:06.200
 four signs will be the northern cardinal 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.540
 sign east south west they are all 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.900
 look like a stick or babakin but 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.759
 they are always dion so we had such 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.759
 here 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.759
 badges 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.660
 and some columns they tell 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 jord yellow and black on now 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.820
 let's see how they are right 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.980
 painted 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.530
 on these badges on these boots 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.870
 daily figures are put and we are figures 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.910
 look consists of two triangles and 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.920
 make some combinations of them 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.280
 but let me tell you my way 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.030
 memorizing this combination is northern 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.220
 cardinal mark 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.410
 2 triangles 2 triangles look 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.720
 so here and flocks up you 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.410
 reminds me of a project being raped 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.530
 Christmas trees 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.280
 Well, it is logical to imagine we grow trees 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.290
 bright cardinal mark 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.770
 we will have the opposite arrow down 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:06.479
 looks in childhood I used to paint a palm tree 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.479
 for me that means palm starts 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.479
 the western cardinal mark will be 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.620
 look like two triangles 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.470
 looking each other on spirit on 1000 friend but 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.489
 in the west you like slim women or 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.650
 love time is another option but in the east 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.750
 eastern cardinal mark he will not 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.170
 triangles stand and looking into 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.550
 different sides and up and down on the other 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.750
 I can say that in the east he loves 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.180
 such a big woman 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.850
 Now look at the order but by icons. 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.650
 this is such a way of memorizing means 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.170
 go further in color because the icons have 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.430
 us, they are not very small 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.650
 clearly visible we have the opportunity 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.000
 draw color use colors 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.269
 yellow black each column is divided into 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.269
 three parts 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.300
 and filled according to very simple 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.240
 the rule is filled in black ta 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.010
 the part where it looks cool 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.350
 triangle at the time of action 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.040
 my triangle is filled up 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.380
 here black 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.590
 lighter triangle will also be able to top 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.030
 fill in the following black remaining 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.030
 the place is complemented by a yellow light 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.620
 let's see the eastern cardinal 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.340
 the sign here is a triangle looking 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:35.390
 upstairs and the second one looks down remaining 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.910
 meter is filled with yellow yota 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.530
 cardinal sign he's just importance 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.810
 by the northern cardinal mark y he will 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.069
 filled two thirds below 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:49.010
 black and the top will be 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.500
 painted yellow western cardinal 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.810
 sign he has both triangles will be able to 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.290
 the center, that is, the center will be black 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.860
 square 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.090
 black sector and on the edges that is above 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.090
 below it will be yellow 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.829
 now how to remember how to see these 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.390
 cardinal signs at night they will 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.320
 blink according to the rule 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.310
 clockwise let's do this 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.410
 we will blink white they will 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.930
 help the gray cardinal and the law will 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:33.600
 it will just blink constantly 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:36.150
 time to blink white oriental 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.740
 cardinal mark will blink like on 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.010
 three o'clock hand standing i have three 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.010
 times 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.150
 southern cardinal sign which looks at 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:54.650
 six hours therefore will blink 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:56.970
 6 1 6 times pressed and the next will be the length 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.520
 then again every construction 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:05.539
 repeated western cardinal mark 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.539
 blinks like 9 o'clock that is 9 1 times in 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.810
 how to remember it still start to burn in 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.090
 first 12 hours three hours 6 hours nine 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.520
 hours means it should be no 20 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.090
 blinks constantly this blinks three times 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.430
 6 times and if you see after 6 flashes 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.919
 one long it will be southern 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.810
 cardinal sign if after 6 flashes 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.910
 carp starts all or out of the box 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.150
 flashes on the watch more if 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.460
 nine it was the western cardinal 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.560
 a sign if there were more than 9 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.560
 it will be north paintings on
