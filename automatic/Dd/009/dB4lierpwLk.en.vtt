 doing will cause solid stools 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.470
 the tomato is another inflate is another 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.880
 anti-inflammatory but for men 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.100

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.340
 we go with the onion and we go with the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.440
 onion that has natural antibiotics 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.910
 It has anti-inflammatories and has 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.030
 preventive diseases 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.090
 respiratory and in addition all 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.730
 ingredients are very low calories 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.730
 but now let the peppers 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.400
 peppers is a flavoring is so that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.440
 the soups are passed very well and for 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.800
 last the last ingredient of the soup 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.170
 of cabbage is the celery that is an opening 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.560
 green that helps detoxify the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.830
 organism of metals but it is also the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.420
 salt of the soup and the ingredient 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.560
 majority since it is obviously the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.200
 alcohol but and this is with truth we are going 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.640
 to throw all the tail that inside we are going to 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.640
 stir all the ingredients 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.590
 and then we're going to use water acidity 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.540
 and it's simply to cover 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.920
 is the amount of water and look for 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.910
 example right now they were almost at the level 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.920
 ok with that it's enough now 5 minutes 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.400
 the time is not enough for it to 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.019
 It costs no and the goal is not to leave 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.420
 fully cooked 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:25.459
 the goal is nothing more than stirring 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:30.380
 flavors and have a soup soup 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.540
 Caldosa calientita is even we're going 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.410
 to serve and we will try to see what 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.790
 so we were left 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.000
 and this remember that it is a complement 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.300
 your diet 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.240
