00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.969
 hello to all welcome to this gaming 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.980
 live more dedicated a pro basketball 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.070
 management 2013 and in this case the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.560
 theme is the match mode of this title 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.960
 since it is necessarily at the center of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.100
 gameplay in the center of everything and we will 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.019
 go up we show you a little bit 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.849
 that gives in a match that opposes 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 eats the handle saint vallier 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.050
 saint vallier yes it serves cup game 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.730
 of France in good imposed figure 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.930
 easily normally normally it's 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.520
 not normal that I have a nice team 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.629
 so how's it going? 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.700
 unfolds like last year it's up to 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.800
 say we see the players on it as 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.350
 that's little kids 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.489
 medallions like that we'll say yeah he 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 his body and he still exceeds a 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.100
 little better than last year 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.180
 so if you do not remember how 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.649
 it was happening last year I you 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.940
 invite to go see the gaming live that 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.860
 jump and everywhere it was not 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.610
 always very fluid is good we could see 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.309
 not always the numbers 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.750
 there it remains a little more credible good 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.370
 it's still a little special but good 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.019
 yes because they still have guys who 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.189
 are still super static it's a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.330
 little static then we choose anyway 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.409
 the system so here i'm going to try to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.460
 watch the opponent's defense of 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.729
 the joy that he is a man a half 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.530
 ground 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.119
 I will choose in systems that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.409
 are either predefined or systems 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.939
 that I create from scratch 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.290
 say by choosing the speed of each 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.909
 player in the places displacements 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.439
 the positions I can even do some 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.060
 screens to a given player a moment 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.710
 agree is what I want so I 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 choose my system done as it is a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.049
 thing I saw he was in 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.520
 individual half field i will play 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.290
 for example on my level because he 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.110
 is good pivot 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.220
 go I choose my system I valid 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.689
 so we see what the players are going 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.759
 earth and compared to the defense that that 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.689
 gives knowing that it is obviously necessary 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.770
 are fit for defense otherwise we're going 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.090
 to take a good offer I am allied 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.310
 this system there normally they will do 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.860
 on the next system one on the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.200
 next next game phase 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.570
 obviously also chosen the defense with 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.009
 classic things so areas 3 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.899
 Individual defense any land or 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.579
 half ground one can choose the pressing 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.079
 of each player independently and on 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.479
 who will defend direction of a fort 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.520
 defender leader position to do it 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.229
 defend on / back 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.460
 which is very good, we do what we want 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.719
 in fact it's a bit of woods finally 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.409
 it's because it has a price of 8 15 and 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.429
 his finger 5 strong 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.479
 so it's true that there are some things one 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.760
 little weird in the unfolding of 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.599
 matches as well at the level of fouls - 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.470
 kairn last because it's true that 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.940
 sometimes from last year he had 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.220
 times when we have the ten faults on the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.299
 same action 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.010
 it remains more credible as well at 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.450
 level of faults that stats that's 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.500
 such households in point guard to 10 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.000
 counters in a quarter time 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.140
 yeah that's a bit special acer is 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.980
 much more credible though against the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.120
 unfolding matches we have things 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.980
 weird we are told 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.860
 here everything that happens in Paris because who 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.569
 dribble we'll tell us sometimes the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.180
 back basket and then while the score 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.019
 points do not have credit 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.760
 theologian of scor in this immense 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.560
 talent is the bet on the throws 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.049
 francs there are some concerns actually from 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.340
 times we can have one two or three 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.720
 free throws when we have two in 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.549
 did when the first one is missed the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.489
 second is marked then we will 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.099
 number of points of agreement intervening at 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.390
 place of one and vice versa when the first 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.459
 is successful she second missed in two 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.269
 against zero olivia point too while 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.530
 I understand that everyone 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.310
 did not necessarily have that bug so I 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.140
 a player who has times I will go out 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.480
 we did not necessarily have this bug I 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.579
 had on every game it's a bit 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.709
 frustrating anyway good here is to pray 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.049
 and especially if the match is played in the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.280
 world and time on free throws this 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.930
 who arrives regularly 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.780
 that's it it can be a little 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.240
 problematic of the blow there if you lead 2 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.950
 July 6 point 21 minutes you do that thou 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.810
 do what you do wrong do you hope that 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.400
 magnifying the second and after that we have 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.540
 find classic things so with 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.120
 the shape of each player 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.380
 their tiredness and their morale yeah 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.600
 good knowing that after malo makes the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.569
 fatigue is important to change 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.709
 players so make the substitutions good 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.280
 and that's usually the leave our 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.720
 best kind the longest 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.830
 possible to manage the ditches of the 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.790
 classic we can manage the times ahead 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.340
 so I tried to ask for one 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.300
 day show you if you like knowing 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.800
 that the trend can have several 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.700
 effects because we will be proposing to 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.019
 each time several sentences then 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.580
 frankly I be you I was 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.660
 yelling because 4.4 after 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.130
 four minutes of play against a team 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.420
 lower level it's true it's 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.700
 not terrible are not there I 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.140
 several sentences released you a little 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.820
 a bath I lie good to avoid saying 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.810
 it's seldom easy for me to choose 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.910
 good knowing that it can have a 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.290
 effect either positive or negative or 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.670
 mixed on the morale of the players 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.230
 agree that of course on their 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.230
 performance I 'm not what I'm going 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.650
 m attention we re series pu arrive 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.569
 very quickly 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.310
 Come on let's try to put this on 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.200
 see what it's going to do it's always 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.680
 by month charles koch is not it I'm 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.900
 ask why I'm here 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.050
 good I still lose but good no 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.010
 sir so that's a bit better 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.900
 that last year it's still 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.010
 not perfect we still 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.180
 then I plead to show you anyway 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.250
 a statistics have little to see 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.300
 the evolution of the score knowing that we have 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.370
 weird things for example the score 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.750
 who goes back down is also our incessant 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.010
 otherwise it is part of 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.940
 problems of free throws no it does 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.150
 always weird when we see that when 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.860
 even 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.270
 you amaze me it's not terrible no 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.970
 of a simulation they also have 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.500
 sharp honestly we can simulate 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.450
 the matches if you want this theater 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.590
 since the management part directly not 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.630
 say I do not want to play the match 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.970
 it's my assistant who will take care of it 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.900
 the result is sometimes random but 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.330
 good that can it can help 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.220
 to avoid these worries all the more 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.320
 more than there are times bugs me that 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.960
 will happen at least two-three times that 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.949
 the players it did not move the game did not 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.370
 plant but we can do nothing more 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.419
 does one try to advance the time of 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.160
 do nothing we have to leave the 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.169
 match knowing that when we do that 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.220
 art is the rest of the match and simulate 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.300
 that usually when we leave her and 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.130
 I do not know why but we lose it 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.710
 between his psy problems so this is a 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.419
 little annoying it's a bit frustrating too 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.340
 is that for those who are a 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.500
 little bit starts in the matter it is 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.910
 possible that the changes the 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.220
 tactics everything is done automatically 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.630
 no you have to look for generally 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.560
 it's rather intuitive anyway in the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.650
 as we are clearly explained 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.930
 what is the opponent's defense 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.370
 systems are requested by defense here 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.479
 when we see so we have to try to 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.800
 adapt 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.660
 after we try to change 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.880
 defense from time to time they have 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.199
 collected ask for a continuous downtime 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.880
 no it's the end of the quarter are actually 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.380
 far enough from 80 I'm not even 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.000
 really I learned my knee people 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.810
 look like no as 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.530
 diligent supporter 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:01.130
 So here is a price respect the Meuse 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:03.620
 tobacco reason that's so there are some 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.729
 worry it stays nicer than 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.099
 last year good there are still some 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.870
 work to do if there I know that 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.090
 it's a problem that you pose and 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.710
 also you can not follow the scores 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.180
 other matches yes while we are 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.740
 doing it nicer that he 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.880
 does not have immersion level good it changes 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.830
 not completely gives it already 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.110
 also quote the last day of the 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.990
 regular season and you're eighth 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.310
 or ninth place and that you finally like 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.720
 also depends on the performance of 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.740
 the team that surrounds me with the notion of 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.120
 point a turn that can get into 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.050
 exactly count she has so this point 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.340
 is it a step forward the others 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.599
 matches at the same time the Sylvan bank 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.550
 lautié developers of the game we as 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.110
 why not one of the tracks 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.180
 to improve his title exactly 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.380
 which already is completed suits me 14 on 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.150
 20 that is sold 15 euros 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.110
 not us we are at 15 euros because 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.699
 it was before the release I think it 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.110
 had a robben very well and no 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.039
 nonsense thank you to you anyway it's 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.389
 done by a passionate so that's enough 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:55.699
 interesting 24-17 trio match where aurelien 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.080
 that's good to know the congratulations 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:59.289
 even if I give you a big shot of 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.999
 hand it must be said yes yes it's true 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:04.869
 having watched that gaming has more snow 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:04.869
 very quickly everything
