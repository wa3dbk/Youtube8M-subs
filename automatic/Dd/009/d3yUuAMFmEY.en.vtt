it<00:01:57.390> over<00:01:57.509> our<00:01:57.780> permaculture<00:01:58.229> crops<00:01:58.770> later<00:01:59.070> on

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it over our permaculture crops later on

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.340 
it over our permaculture crops later on
to<00:01:59.640> keep<00:01:59.790> protected<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> cold<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.259> we

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
to keep protected from the cold so we

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.160 
to keep protected from the cold so we
tried<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> lot<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.920> different<00:02:02.040> methods<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.170> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
tried a lot of different methods to to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
tried a lot of different methods to to
do<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:04.770> first<00:02:04.979> tried<00:02:05.430> beating<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.540> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
do this we first tried beating it with a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.869 
do this we first tried beating it with a
rope<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.380> well<00:02:07.710> grab<00:02:08.129> too<00:02:08.399> much<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.759> it

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
rope and that well grab too much of it

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.199 
rope and that well grab too much of it
so<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:09.509> he<00:02:09.569> tried<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.110> tub<00:02:10.349> and

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
so then he tried it in the tub and

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.259 
so then he tried it in the tub and
kind<00:02:12.719> of<00:02:12.870> yielded<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.469> same<00:02:13.680> results<00:02:14.219> not<00:02:14.549> not

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
kind of yielded the same results not not

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.479 
kind of yielded the same results not not
a<00:02:15.299> lot<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.659> really<00:02:15.840> good<00:02:15.959> benefit<00:02:16.500> there<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:17.400> I

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
a lot of really good benefit there and I

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.130 
a lot of really good benefit there and I
think<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.730> problem<00:02:18.030> was<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.510> rope<00:02:18.750> just

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
think the problem was that the rope just

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.459 
think the problem was that the rope just
they<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.769> grabbed<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.340> too<00:02:20.549> much<00:02:20.879> of<00:02:21.469> too

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
they just grabbed it too much of too

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.220 
they just grabbed it too much of too
much<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.859> oats<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.480> all<00:02:24.480> over<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.810> place

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
much of the oats and all over the place

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.599 
much of the oats and all over the place
so<00:02:25.680> we<00:02:26.069> tried<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.310> couple<00:02:26.340> different<00:02:26.790> methods

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
so we tried a couple different methods

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.030 
so we tried a couple different methods
next<00:02:29.609> we<00:02:29.730> try<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:29.969> change<00:02:30.269> beyond<00:02:31.260> kind<00:02:31.859> of<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
next we try to change beyond kind of the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.000 
next we try to change beyond kind of the
same<00:02:32.400> result<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.939> the<00:02:33.000> problem<00:02:33.389> was<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:34.829> oats

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
same result and the problem was the oats

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.970 
same result and the problem was the oats
are<00:02:35.400> heavy<00:02:35.879> but<00:02:36.480> they<00:02:36.689> are<00:02:36.769> super<00:02:37.769> heavy

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
are heavy but they are super heavy

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.509 
are heavy but they are super heavy
compared<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.639> the<00:02:38.730> chaff<00:02:38.969> and<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:40.519> whaling

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
compared to the chaff and so whaling

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.339 
compared to the chaff and so whaling
with<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.969> objects<00:02:42.450> like<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:43.049> didn't

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
with the objects like this just didn't

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.569 
with the objects like this just didn't
seem<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.620> work<00:02:43.799> we<00:02:44.040> didn't<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> wide

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
seem to work we didn't have a wide

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.780 
seem to work we didn't have a wide
enough<00:02:44.700> area<00:02:45.680> flying<00:02:46.680> around<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.370> we<00:02:47.519> tried

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
enough area flying around so we tried

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.750 
enough area flying around so we tried
just<00:02:47.819> running<00:02:48.689> it<00:02:48.780> around<00:02:49.019> inside<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:50.489> this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
just running it around inside in this

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.729 
just running it around inside in this
kind<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.180> work<00:02:51.359> it<00:02:51.989> was<00:02:52.109> also<00:02:52.230> kind<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.530> funny

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
kind of work it was also kind of funny

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.929 
kind of work it was also kind of funny
to<00:02:52.889> note<00:02:53.040> here<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.340> they're<00:02:53.609> all<00:02:53.700> grabbing

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
to note here that they're all grabbing

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.589 
to note here that they're all grabbing
on<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.180> his<00:02:54.329> glove<00:02:54.680> but<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:56.430> still<00:02:56.760> not

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
on to his glove but it's still not

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.530 
on to his glove but it's still not
really<00:02:57.870> good<00:02:58.079> separation<00:02:58.939> so<00:02:59.939> this<00:03:00.180> seemed<00:03:00.419> to

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
really good separation so this seemed to

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.449 
really good separation so this seemed to
be<00:03:00.709> best<00:03:01.709> hand<00:03:02.069> method<00:03:02.329> but<00:03:03.329> again<00:03:04.169> not<00:03:05.159> enough

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
be best hand method but again not enough

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.039 
be best hand method but again not enough
wind<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.909> blow<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.239> off<00:03:07.909> so<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:09.389> next<00:03:09.569> step<00:03:09.810> is

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
wind to blow it off so the next step is

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.589 
wind to blow it off so the next step is
we<00:03:10.230> tried<00:03:10.590> an<00:03:11.040> air<00:03:11.219> compressor<00:03:11.400> I've<00:03:12.299> got<00:03:12.510> my

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
we tried an air compressor I've got my

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.229 
we tried an air compressor I've got my
little<00:03:12.840> pancake<00:03:13.319> air<00:03:13.530> compressor<00:03:14.040> here<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.849> I

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
little pancake air compressor here and I

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.149 
little pancake air compressor here and I
was<00:03:15.359> running<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.750> at<00:03:15.870> 40<00:03:16.199> psi<00:03:16.409> and<00:03:16.889> we<00:03:16.979> just

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
was running it at 40 psi and we just

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:23.000 
was running it at 40 psi and we just
kind<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.370> sprayed<00:03:17.729> it<00:03:17.849> into<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.060> bucket<00:03:22.010> we've

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
kind of sprayed it into the bucket we've

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.930 
kind of sprayed it into the bucket we've
done<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.879> seemed<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.239> work<00:03:24.389> alright<00:03:24.750> although

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
done it seemed to work alright although

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.180 
done it seemed to work alright although
it<00:03:26.940> got<00:03:27.180> chat

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
it got chat

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.740 
it got chat
freaking<00:03:30.190> everywhere<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.720> mean

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
freaking everywhere and I mean

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.380 
freaking everywhere and I mean
everywhere<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:33.310> this<00:03:33.880> seemed<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.210> work<00:03:34.330> pretty

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
everywhere so this seemed to work pretty

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.100 
everywhere so this seemed to work pretty
well<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.980> blew<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.610> chaff<00:03:36.970> out<00:03:37.240> it<00:03:37.570> didn't

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
well it blew the chaff out it didn't

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.620 
well it blew the chaff out it didn't
blow<00:03:38.530> too<00:03:39.100> much<00:03:39.250> of<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.430> grain<00:03:39.640> out<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.480> the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
blow too much of the grain out and the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.660 
blow too much of the grain out and the
bucket<00:03:40.900> sides<00:03:41.560> were<00:03:41.860> high<00:03:42.040> enough<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.490> is<00:03:42.640> a

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
bucket sides were high enough this is a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.060 
bucket sides were high enough this is a
6<00:03:42.970> gallon<00:03:43.120> boring<00:03:43.630> bucket<00:03:43.930> by<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.110> way<00:03:44.290> that

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
6 gallon boring bucket by the way that

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.310 
6 gallon boring bucket by the way that
it<00:03:45.550> seemed<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.880> worked<00:03:46.030> pretty<00:03:46.210> well<00:03:49.320> the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
it seemed it worked pretty well the

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.100 
it seemed it worked pretty well the
problem<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.340> make<00:03:52.210> sure<00:03:52.240> to<00:03:52.630> but<00:03:52.840> make<00:03:53.080> sure

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
problem is make sure to but make sure

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.020 
problem is make sure to but make sure
you<00:03:53.290> can<00:03:53.380> hear<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.340> problem<00:03:54.640> here<00:03:54.850> is

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
you can hear it but the problem here is

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:07.950 
you can hear it but the problem here is
that<00:03:55.920> my<00:03:56.920> pancake<00:03:57.750> compressor<00:03:58.800> didn't<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:07.900> you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
that my pancake compressor didn't so you

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.650 
that my pancake compressor didn't so you
can<00:04:08.140> see<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.590> paper<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:09.460> this<00:04:10.000> is<00:04:10.240> just<00:04:10.480> it's

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
can see the paper and this is just it's

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.170 
can see the paper and this is just it's
just<00:04:10.720> blowing<00:04:11.140> it<00:04:11.230> all<00:04:11.320> over<00:04:11.850> it's<00:04:12.850> working

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
just blowing it all over it's working

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.590 
just blowing it all over it's working
pretty<00:04:13.360> well<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:14.560> unfortunately<00:04:15.360> my<00:04:16.360> little

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
pretty well but unfortunately my little

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.420 
pretty well but unfortunately my little
pancake<00:04:17.080> compressor<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:17.620> didn't<00:04:18.220> have<00:04:18.340> the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
pancake compressor just didn't have the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.550 
pancake compressor just didn't have the
capacity<00:04:18.870> we<00:04:19.870> had<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.200> look<00:04:20.320> for<00:04:20.530> something

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
capacity we had to look for something

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.250 
capacity we had to look for something
with<00:04:20.980> a<00:04:21.010> bit<00:04:21.280> more<00:04:22.140> as<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.740> were<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.840> morale

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
with a bit more as it were so the morale

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.300 
with a bit more as it were so the morale
was<00:04:26.950> a<00:04:27.310> 60<00:04:28.120> gallon<00:04:28.800> 125<00:04:29.800> psi<00:04:31.680> shop<00:04:32.680> compressor

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
was a 60 gallon 125 psi shop compressor

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.610 
was a 60 gallon 125 psi shop compressor
that<00:04:33.970> Pete<00:04:34.240> has<00:04:34.450> first<00:04:35.110> we<00:04:35.230> tried<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.500> with<00:04:35.590> the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
that Pete has first we tried it with the

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.190 
that Pete has first we tried it with the
lid<00:04:35.830> off<00:04:35.980> that<00:04:36.940> was<00:04:37.060> messy<00:04:37.300> as<00:04:37.480> hell<00:04:37.660> but<00:04:37.990> did

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
lid off that was messy as hell but did

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.900 
lid off that was messy as hell but did
but<00:04:38.500> we<00:04:38.590> lost<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.890> lot<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.040> seeds<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:39.610> then<00:04:39.790> we

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
but we lost a lot of seeds so then we

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.460 
but we lost a lot of seeds so then we
tried<00:04:40.090> throwing<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.510> little<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:40.900> using<00:04:41.320> the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
tried throwing the little and using the

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.540 
tried throwing the little and using the
hole<00:04:41.800> in<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.280> top<00:04:42.550> he<00:04:43.540> has<00:04:43.750> a<00:04:44.170> port<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.980> access

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
hole in the top he has a port to access

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.150 
hole in the top he has a port to access
the<00:04:45.880> nozzle<00:04:46.450> threw<00:04:46.750> in<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:47.080> glove<00:04:47.320> as<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.560> seal<00:04:47.860> as

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
the nozzle threw in a glove as a seal as

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.760 
the nozzle threw in a glove as a seal as
long<00:04:48.940> as<00:04:49.060> we<00:04:49.180> didn't<00:04:49.420> make<00:04:49.480> it<00:04:49.540> airtight<00:04:49.840> you

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
long as we didn't make it airtight you

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.470 
long as we didn't make it airtight you
can<00:04:50.890> see<00:04:51.130> how<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.490> kicked<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.880> feet<00:04:52.120> around

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
can see how it kicked the feet around

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.440 
can see how it kicked the feet around
pretty<00:04:52.900> well<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.440> is<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.100> cbiit<00:04:54.670> around<00:04:55.030> it

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
pretty well and is to cbiit around it

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.290 
pretty well and is to cbiit around it
seemed<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.020> do<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.380> job<00:04:59.700> here's<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.880> inside

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
seemed to do the job here's the inside

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.230 
seemed to do the job here's the inside
view<00:05:01.720> now<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.410> as<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:02.650> can<00:05:02.800> see<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.940> sieve

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
view now and as you can see it the sieve

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.450 
view now and as you can see it the sieve
just<00:05:04.270> goes<00:05:04.840> flying<00:05:05.380> all<00:05:05.680> over<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.980> place<00:05:06.220> on

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
just goes flying all over the place on

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.740 
just goes flying all over the place on
there<00:05:06.670> and<00:05:07.890> it's<00:05:08.890> a<00:05:08.950> kind<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.280> a<00:05:09.460> vortex<00:05:10.000> that

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
there and it's a kind of a vortex that

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
there and it's a kind of a vortex that
allows<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:11.320> to<00:05:11.760> be<00:05:12.760> able<00:05:12.940> to<00:05:13.150> beat<00:05:14.140> that<00:05:14.380> seat

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
allows you to be able to beat that seat

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.270 
allows you to be able to beat that seat
up<00:05:15.120> so<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:16.900> seemed<00:05:17.140> to<00:05:17.290> work<00:05:17.380> pretty<00:05:17.440> well<00:05:17.800> as

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
up so this seemed to work pretty well as

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.390 
up so this seemed to work pretty well as
long<00:05:19.000> as<00:05:19.030> we<00:05:19.420> were<00:05:19.540> able<00:05:19.870> to<00:05:19.950> thrash<00:05:20.950> it<00:05:21.160> around

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
long as we were able to thrash it around

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.430 
long as we were able to thrash it around
inside<00:05:22.000> with<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.510> air<00:05:22.630> compressor<00:05:23.140> it<00:05:23.230> works

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
inside with the air compressor it works

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.520 
inside with the air compressor it works
now<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:24.820> only<00:05:25.060> warning<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:25.600> have<00:05:25.810> is<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.260> make

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
now the only warning I have is that make

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.999 
now the only warning I have is that make
sure<00:05:26.800> you've<00:05:27.370> got<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.700> water<00:05:28.140> out<00:05:29.140> of

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
sure you've got the water out of

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.480 
sure you've got the water out of
a<00:05:30.069> compressor<00:05:30.669> that<00:05:31.770> was<00:05:32.770> an<00:05:32.919> issue<00:05:33.039> that<00:05:33.219> I

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
a compressor that was an issue that I

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.969 
a compressor that was an issue that I
ran<00:05:33.729> into<00:05:33.759> was<00:05:34.569> it<00:05:34.869> being<00:05:35.080> too<00:05:35.319> long<00:05:35.529> now<00:05:35.949> you

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
ran into was it being too long now you

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.950 
ran into was it being too long now you
could<00:05:36.219> see<00:05:36.430> how<00:05:36.669> it's<00:05:36.849> just<00:05:36.909> paper<00:05:37.330> II<00:05:37.449> on<00:05:37.659> top

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
could see how it's just paper II on top

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.159 
could see how it's just paper II on top
and<00:05:38.589> if<00:05:38.949> we<00:05:39.069> just<00:05:39.279> lightly<00:05:39.550> blew<00:05:40.029> it<00:05:40.210> away<00:05:40.330> we

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
and if we just lightly blew it away we

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.439 
and if we just lightly blew it away we
could<00:05:41.379> blow<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.770> beat<00:05:42.279> up<00:05:42.460> chat<00:05:42.759> that<00:05:43.029> chaff

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
could blow the beat up chat that chaff

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.980 
could blow the beat up chat that chaff
out<00:05:43.719> of<00:05:43.869> there<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.469> it<00:05:44.649> did<00:05:45.279> pretty<00:05:45.520> well<00:05:45.639> um<00:05:46.240> I

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
out of there and it did pretty well um I

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.820 
out of there and it did pretty well um I
found<00:05:47.379> pretty<00:05:47.680> pretty<00:05:48.610> good<00:05:48.759> results<00:05:49.240> in

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
found pretty pretty good results in

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.320 
found pretty pretty good results in
putting<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.919> lid<00:05:51.039> on<00:05:51.069> blowing<00:05:51.879> around<00:05:51.999> for

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
putting the lid on blowing around for

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.089 
putting the lid on blowing around for
about<00:05:52.449> five<00:05:52.689> or<00:05:52.809> ten<00:05:52.960> minutes<00:05:52.990> taking<00:05:53.860> it<00:05:53.979> off

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
about five or ten minutes taking it off

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.429 
about five or ten minutes taking it off
blowing<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:54.729> chaff<00:05:54.939> out<00:05:55.199> repeating<00:05:56.199> it<00:05:56.319> to

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
blowing the chaff out repeating it to

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.129 
blowing the chaff out repeating it to
get<00:05:56.559> that<00:05:56.710> stubborn<00:05:57.069> chaff<00:05:57.460> out<00:05:57.669> of<00:05:57.819> the<00:05:57.879> way

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
get that stubborn chaff out of the way

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.200 
get that stubborn chaff out of the way
blowing<00:05:59.139> the<00:05:59.229> remainder<00:05:59.619> off<00:05:59.849> we<00:06:00.849> had<00:06:00.999> pretty

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
blowing the remainder off we had pretty

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.839 
blowing the remainder off we had pretty
pretty<00:06:01.869> clear<00:06:02.139> coverage<00:06:02.529> of<00:06:02.620> that<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:03.069> thought

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
pretty clear coverage of that I thought

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:13.450 
pretty clear coverage of that I thought
it<00:06:03.969> worked<00:06:04.120> it<00:06:04.839> worked<00:06:04.930> pretty<00:06:05.139> well

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.760 

so<00:06:14.300> after<00:06:14.570> all<00:06:14.600> that<00:06:14.960> this<00:06:15.230> is<00:06:15.290> what<00:06:15.620> we've

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
so after all that this is what we've

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.410 
so after all that this is what we've
gotten<00:06:16.280> done<00:06:16.520> so<00:06:16.550> far<00:06:17.090> this<00:06:17.180> is<00:06:17.300> about<00:06:17.630> a

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
gotten done so far this is about a

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.440 
gotten done so far this is about a
little<00:06:20.420> less<00:06:21.400> Tamara<00:06:22.400> can<00:06:22.550> up<00:06:22.670> a<00:06:22.850> little<00:06:23.270> less

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
little less Tamara can up a little less

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.050 
little less Tamara can up a little less
than<00:06:23.660> a<00:06:23.780> quarter<00:06:24.140> of<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:24.590> field<00:06:25.060> that'll

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
than a quarter of the field that'll
