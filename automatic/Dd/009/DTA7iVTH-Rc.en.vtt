in that some janiga
well<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.430> also<00:03:54.760> okay<00:03:55.450> shortstop<00:03:56.190> shortstop

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
well and also okay shortstop shortstop

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.490 
well and also okay shortstop shortstop
it's<00:03:57.520> very<00:03:57.730> useful<00:03:58.000> again<00:03:58.570> because<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.320> has

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
it's very useful again because it has

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.170 
it's very useful again because it has
all<00:04:00.100> pellets<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.590> 36<00:04:02.590> our<00:04:02.770> first<00:04:03.610> six<00:04:03.880> mo

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
all pellets and 36 our first six mo

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.760 
all pellets and 36 our first six mo

on<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.340> web<00:04:06.520> etc<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.570> it's<00:04:08.350> very<00:04:08.590> useful<00:04:08.790> as

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
on the web etc and it's very useful as

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.560 
on the web etc and it's very useful as
once<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:11.140> shoot<00:04:11.770> it<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.640> shoots<00:04:12.940> dead<00:04:13.390> are

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
little dot the little dot will always

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.290 
little dot the little dot will always
hit<00:04:21.970> every<00:04:22.720> single<00:04:22.990> time<00:04:23.250> but<00:04:24.250> also<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.790> shoots

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
hit every single time but also it shoots

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.140

another few other power research a bit
more<00:04:32.310> so<00:04:33.310> it's<00:04:33.520> very<00:04:33.640> useful<00:04:33.910> especially<00:04:34.210> with

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
more so it's very useful especially with

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.590 
more so it's very useful especially with
the<00:04:34.870> mad<00:04:35.620> milk<00:04:35.920> as<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.580> hits<00:04:36.790> several<00:04:37.330> times

especially at the court it's not bad a
medium<00:04:40.510> damage<00:04:41.140> very<00:04:41.890> good<00:04:42.100> in<00:04:42.250> short<00:04:42.610> you<00:04:43.600> can

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
medium damage very good in short you can

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
medium damage very good in short you can
damage<00:04:44.080> long<00:04:44.440> medium<00:04:44.890> range<00:04:46.140> get<00:04:47.140> him<00:04:47.320> to

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
damage long medium range get him to

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.210 
damage long medium range get him to
short<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.910> range<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.690> very<00:04:49.720> good<00:04:50.140> far<00:04:50.860> away

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
short that range is very good far away

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.790 
short that range is very good far away
it's<00:04:51.730> not<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.120> bad<00:04:52.300> actually<00:04:53.020> see<00:04:53.440> if<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.620> knew

it doesn't really do there's not really
that<00:05:12.010> great<00:05:12.430> it's<00:05:13.000> just<00:05:13.210> it's<00:05:13.840> more<00:05:13.900> of<00:05:14.110> a

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
that great it's just it's more of a

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.030 
that great it's just it's more of a
comical<00:05:14.650> humor<00:05:15.310> I<00:05:15.340> guess<00:05:15.460> as<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:17.260> just<00:05:17.560> is

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
comical humor I guess as it just is

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.370 
comical humor I guess as it just is
