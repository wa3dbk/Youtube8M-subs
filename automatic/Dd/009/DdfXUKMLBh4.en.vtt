00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.590
 Oh, what's up, people, I'm a footprint, me 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.200
 I'm going to teach how to tune in football 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.849
 on the tablets of the engine for three 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.150
 the first since choosing the second 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.460
 mission of the campaign in the second actor 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.080
 the second admission and well I have passed 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.970
 this fast camera to make it more 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.039
 I cut everything and there you go to see what there is 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.099
 what to do 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.739
 place next to that man the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.960
 Black is dead and at the same time 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:30.140
 change weapon press on the crosshead 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.210
 right so that when you leave the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.469
 tablet so you can keep the tablet in the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.089
 hand and do not go 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.949
 in this way you can do the trick 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.890
 to do it from the good map so that it 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.270
 opposes but that if you do so well that 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.370
 they shake hands 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.780
 then the next thing would be to jump over 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.480
 the barrels these methane jumps by 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.710
 there is like an invisible platform 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.150
 then you have to place on top of 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.220
 her and keep moving forward to lante this 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.070
 It can take a little time to catch him 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.590
 trick but good at the end it ends up coming out 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.300
 we expected it is quite easy and nothing 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.160
 strips for water keep moving forward 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.820
 and now you are going to see in the video of everything 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.030
 the tour as it's pretty easy what 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.860
 only that good the first time can 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.450
 take a bit of confusion to me 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.880
 cost two or three times you learn what's 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.700
 memory but I tell you constant easy 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.960
 if you look at it for the video of the first and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.640
 nothing here has happened a little too 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.230
 fast camera so that more is done 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.210
 I cut everything 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.590
 and having burned with those involved today 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.050
 I explain to you while the road passes 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.670
 well this is a little bit for is a book of 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.490
 game 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.689
 in which you are going to put the matches of 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.290
 football that appear on televisions 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.850
 from here the mission is in the tablet 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.060
 where it looks like enough 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.290
 Of course it's a pretty interesting mistake 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.690
 that's why, rather than as a trick, there were 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.119
 a bug as an interesting fact of the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.789
 game and nothing they have to throw for 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.990
 the ravine and you're walking underneath 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.509
 from the map 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.979
 and then on, you already go out by the way 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.200
 final you will see how the allies will arrive 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.540
 next to you when the map see if 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.570
 quite weird and nothing now here what 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.539
 I would have to do is re-activate him 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.860
 the helicopter is from the tablet and when 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.750
 come out then you'll see 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.080
 there you will see the coast I challenge you again I think 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.640
 that was and not taiz there are a couple of people 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.920
 you go out I think with the right cross 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.990
 also right now I do not remember and I 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.000
 you put in that box and there 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.890
 they see it and finally you tune in 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.440
 soccer from the tablet 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.860
 an interesting thing is a 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.930
 bullshit but it 's okay to always know 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.600
 this kind of game stuff I do not know 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.400
 If they do it, those of the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.410
 developers or if they are books 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.790
 I just do not know 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.490
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.040
 the ally that crosses the map the solo of 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.780
 tip to tip and nothing I hope you have 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.770
 liked to remember to give like favorites to 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.020
 the videos that you want to help me and 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.390
 subscribe to not lose more tricks or 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.590
 ships like this more interesting and nothing 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.710
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.710
 next
