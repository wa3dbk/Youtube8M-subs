 Sounds are a Seat Ibiza's forehead 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:23.359

 130 hp and 310 minutes of maximum torque 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.120
 make out of the field says a little fight 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.980
 the din-standard spurt from 0 to 100 km / h at a time still done 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.190
 a few years absolutely not this will lead the crisis 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.050
 88 customers 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.050
 the fair

 it has hurriedly that he asked luckily even if negative acceleration 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.720
 we also only need to get five grams out of 100 grams to reach 38 degrees 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 unfortunately, the commitment of Kostheimer 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.880
 in slalom, the Spain Polo is the hint understeer Count 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 Lifting legs is the result of the division 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.760
 the suspension tuning 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.930
 the threshold evasion maneuver 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.670
 say goodbye to it providers with the usual 60 days 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.160
 easily for Nicolas g 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.520
 that with the second run with a good 70 things directly the driving stability 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 accomplished 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.070
 Picture and fatigue is the routine on the wet circular track to the day 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.060
 dismissed in the same team

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.890
 only by provocative roads on the steering wheel and handbrake it is possible 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.360
 to get into trouble at all 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.299
 with a maximum of 52 07 Kallenhardt Reichsbahn speed

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.959
 the compact Ibiza and the consumption of matching together 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.989
 for the most part that is a merit of the turbo diesel 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.249
 mightiest 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.329
