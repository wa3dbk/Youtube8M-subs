 For that he goes to start documents x 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.689
 games forming simulator 2013 then searched 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:35.610
 the game xml file is mostly whole 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 now and enter true stores that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.969
 whole and we'll see you soon 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 and the butterfly welcomes us too 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.510
 already in the game 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.260
