to greatest 0.77% and three over four

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.500 
to greatest 0.77% and three over four
notice<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.340> first<00:00:20.640> number<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
notice that the first number is a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.310 
notice that the first number is a
decimal<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:23.010> second<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> percent<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
decimal the second one is a percent and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.500 
decimal the second one is a percent and
the<00:00:25.920> last<00:00:26.160> number<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.750> fraction<00:00:29.029> to<00:00:30.029> compare

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the last number is a fraction to compare

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.299 
the last number is a fraction to compare
them<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.590> should<00:00:31.800> make<00:00:32.070> them<00:00:32.540> comparable

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
them we should make them comparable

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.450 
them we should make them comparable
let's<00:00:35.309> change<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.230> decimals<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
let's change all of them to decimals the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.850 
let's change all of them to decimals the
first<00:00:38.700> number<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.239> already<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.930> decimal<00:00:40.590> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
first number is already a decimal so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.869 
first number is already a decimal so
let's<00:00:41.100> change<00:00:41.370> seven<00:00:41.879> percent<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> decimal

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
let's change seven percent to a decimal

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.090 
let's change seven percent to a decimal
seven<00:00:44.879> percent<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.050> same<00:00:46.079> thing<00:00:46.649> with

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
seven percent is the same thing with

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.220 
seven percent is the same thing with
seven<00:00:47.969> divided<00:00:48.420> by<00:00:48.890> 100<00:00:50.690> which<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:52.050> be

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
seven divided by 100 which can be

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.850 
seven divided by 100 which can be
written<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.789> decimal<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.289> following

quotient 0.75 now to compare the three

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.630 
quotient 0.75 now to compare the three
numbers<00:01:31.280> let's<00:01:32.280> place<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.479> decimals<00:01:34.640> under

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
numbers let's place the decimals under

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.270 
numbers let's place the decimals under
each<00:01:36.210> other<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:39.180> point<00:01:39.540> should<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.650> under

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
each other and the point should be under

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.639 
each other and the point should be under
the<00:01:41.310> point<00:01:45.409> 0.75<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> last<00:01:47.180> number<00:01:48.649> now

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the point 0.75 is the last number now

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.109 
the point 0.75 is the last number now
notice<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.729> aligned<00:01:52.250> as<00:01:53.250> zero<00:01:53.700> for

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
notice how they are aligned as zero for

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.840 
notice how they are aligned as zero for
the<00:01:54.299> hundred<00:01:55.290> space<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:58.130> compared<00:01:59.130> from<00:01:59.430> left

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the hundred space and compared from left

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.380 
the hundred space and compared from left
to<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.950> notice<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.520> second<00:02:03.000> number

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
to right notice that the second number

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.980 
to right notice that the second number
has<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.170> lowest<00:02:04.380> value<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> tenth<00:02:05.990> place

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
has the lowest value for the tenth place

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.820 
has the lowest value for the tenth place
value<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.459> zero<00:02:09.000> point<00:02:09.300> zero<00:02:09.509> seven<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
value so zero point zero seven is the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.420 
value so zero point zero seven is the
smallest<00:02:11.430> number

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
smallest number

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.930 
smallest number
now<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:14.790> we<00:02:15.060> compare<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.810> hundredth<00:02:16.700> split<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
now if we compare the hundredth split a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.960 
now if we compare the hundredth split a
place<00:02:18.240> value<00:02:18.600> we<00:02:19.200> notice<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.730> first

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
place value we notice that the first

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.500 
place value we notice that the first
number<00:02:21.330> zero<00:02:21.990> point<00:02:22.350> 70<00:02:23.310> or<00:02:23.460> zero<00:02:23.730> point<00:02:23.970> seven

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
number zero point 70 or zero point seven

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.620 
number zero point 70 or zero point seven
is<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.260> second<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.210> that<00:02:27.210> leaves<00:02:27.480> us<00:02:27.780> with

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
is the second and that leaves us with

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.730 
is the second and that leaves us with
0.75<00:02:30.630> being<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.590> greatest<00:02:31.980> now<00:02:33.230> let's<00:02:34.230> notice

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
0.75 being the greatest now let's notice

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.540 
0.75 being the greatest now let's notice
that<00:02:34.980> zero<00:02:35.400> point<00:02:35.970> zero<00:02:36.270> seven<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.550> exactly

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
that zero point zero seven is exactly

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.210 
that zero point zero seven is exactly
seven<00:02:39.210> percent<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.400> zero<00:02:41.400> point<00:02:41.700> seven<00:02:42.360> is

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
seven percent and zero point seven is

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.250 
seven percent and zero point seven is
0.7<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.840> finally<00:02:46.670> 0.75<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:48.000> three<00:02:48.690> over<00:02:49.020> four

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
0.7 and finally 0.75 is three over four

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.820 
0.7 and finally 0.75 is three over four
we<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.400> now<00:02:50.670> ordered<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:52.260> three<00:02:52.530> numbers

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
we have now ordered the three numbers

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.060 
we have now ordered the three numbers
