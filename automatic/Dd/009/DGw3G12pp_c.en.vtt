this<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.600> make<00:02:25.750> sense<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.320> thing<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.710> that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
this can make sense the thing is that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.670 
this can make sense the thing is that
I've<00:02:27.310> just<00:02:27.580> looked<00:02:28.000> at<00:02:28.150> them<00:02:28.300> during<00:02:29.080> numbered

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
I've just looked at them during numbered

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.950 
I've just looked at them during numbered
so<00:02:30.160> you've<00:02:30.460> got<00:02:30.490> clean<00:02:31.120> which<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.480> number<00:02:31.630> one

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
so you've got clean which is number one

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.640 
so you've got clean which is number one
shave<00:02:32.830> gel<00:02:33.190> number<00:02:33.880> two<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.420> don't<00:02:35.320> know<00:02:35.470> what

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
shave gel number two I don't know what

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.410 
shave gel number two I don't know what
number<00:02:35.920> three<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.640> number<00:02:36.940> four<00:02:36.970> is

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
number three is but number four is

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.250 
number three is but number four is
reverse<00:02:37.960> so<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.970> would<00:02:40.180> have<00:02:40.210> been<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.720> guess

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
reverse so it would have been I guess

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.080 
reverse so it would have been I guess
more<00:02:41.620> interesting<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.280> get<00:02:42.490> also<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.000> the
