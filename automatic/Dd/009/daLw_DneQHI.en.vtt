 what's going on you do not think that 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.700
 it's impossible to customize mixed race 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.830

 mixed lines these are two lines to high 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.560
 level of service in the heart of 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.329
 agglomeration with a frequency of 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.400

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.080
 advance towards the bottom of the bhns and finally 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.640
 children under 6 years old 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.780
 accompanied by an adult traveling 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.570
 free history 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.460
 the little is not so good the inauguration 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.950
 made good practice 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.520
 it's done now travelers what 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.260
 The travellers 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.060
 yeah but I still do not believe that 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.740
 I do that figuration months for 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.940
 this episode I was collect the opinion 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.830
 first travelers who used 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.490
 betis since commissioning 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.570
 look at the half-breed that's good it's very 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.610
 comfortable 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.200
 we arrive very quickly in ten minutes 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.720
 was in town for me it's really 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.080
 very very good not better I have not better 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.120
 to do 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.280
 he stops in front of my house I am 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.580
 also by going back there I am very 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.530
 well served it is true that it is 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.370
 will say it serves a lot of game and we 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.750
 go very fast 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.250
 and here it will say and since we calculate 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.290
 circulation everything is a priority for 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.200
 pressed him it's an audience there are some 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.979
 often she has only tcrm 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.530
 before and it goes faster and it's 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.780
 friendly baby you drop at woippy 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.850
 where must be at the foot of ronan labar 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.530
 you recognize your races which I 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.370
 think it's very good it's 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.169
 really a comfort 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.760
 I think it's already 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.440
 price question it does not go much 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.090
 cheaper than keeping it in town 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.040
 bitter over ten years we and that's fine 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.560
 conceived the very confused interest of the base 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.600
 it's practical it gives a note of 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.990
 modernism is very good modernism 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:08.250
 with empire style architecture of 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.600
 way a little it was the result it's 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.070
 true that it is very comfortable 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.380
 it's nice to take a half-breed 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.870
 frankly it's a little problem I 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.120
 thought service minutes comes every 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.169
 site it poses a small problem formerly by 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.620
 compared to that but otherwise it's very 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.120
 convenient 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.580
 well we suffered for three years from 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.680
 works 1 obviously but hey need them 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.039
 bear good Ben was stirred happy 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.460
 to have it 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:33.030
 so that's saying these three 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.440
 overall positive 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.640
