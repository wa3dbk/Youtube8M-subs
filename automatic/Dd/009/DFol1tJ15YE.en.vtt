that<00:01:35.479> it's<00:01:36.290> a<00:01:36.530> little<00:01:36.890> bit<00:01:37.040> thick<00:01:37.600> than<00:01:38.600> some

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
that it's a little bit thick than some

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.100 
that it's a little bit thick than some
of<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.350> other<00:01:39.640> name-brand<00:01:40.640> gel<00:01:41.509> polishes

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
that I've used and the next thing these

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.380 
that I've used and the next thing these
bottles<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:48.140> gel<00:01:48.470> polish<00:01:48.950> even<00:01:49.940> their<00:01:50.090> other

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
bottles of gel polish even their other

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.469
