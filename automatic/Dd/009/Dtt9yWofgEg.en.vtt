00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.400
 good today in this new video I'm going to 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.560
 explain them another way to draw the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.230
 character face end of work of 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.900
 adventures that will be the same another very way 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.400
 simple but with another expression 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.500
 facial 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.800
 we would start by drawing as always 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.800
 face 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.550
 we would do 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.789
 A) Yes 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.789
 we will draw all eyes 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.270
 the other one to the height with the other side the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:55.220
 mouth in this case will be 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:00.430
 well and two daughters 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.430
 will be thus a prey 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.930
 they are longer prizes and the other in the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.930
 other side 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.500
 so we would also do black 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.900
 now we would shape the head as 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.900
 always a straight line 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.009
 in this way on the other side equal the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.009
 straight line the form is already 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:39.830
 we join them and in the bottom part the same 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.370
 well and we would join and this would be another 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.230
 the faces of the end of the hour character 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.970
 of adventures 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.300
 I hope you liked it 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.850
 It makes it easy to make them the faces that I'm going 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.210
 teaching and we would see each other in my next 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.210
 videos
