using windshield wipers one pro of this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.360 
using windshield wipers one pro of this
is<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.420> they're<00:00:45.809> slow<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.680> they<00:00:47.039> don't<00:00:47.219> give

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
is that they're slow so they don't give

here<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> mechanical<00:01:03.090> screwdriver<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.409> we

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
here is a mechanical screwdriver that we

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
here is a mechanical screwdriver that we
bought<00:01:04.799> at<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> flea<00:01:05.280> market<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> couple

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
so we attached a C battery holder and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
so we attached a C battery holder and
I'll<00:01:15.299> put<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.720> rechargeable<00:01:16.560> C<00:01:16.799> batteries

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I'll put some rechargeable C batteries

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
I'll put some rechargeable C batteries
in<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.530> then<00:01:19.530> take<00:01:23.630> some<00:01:24.630> very<00:01:25.020> simple

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
in there and then take some very simple

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.670 
in there and then take some very simple
parts<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.750> slide<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:30.320> then<00:01:31.320> make

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
parts and slide it on in and then make

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.030

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
as you see it is going slowly just at

00:01:37.910 --> 00:03:06.600 
as you see it is going slowly just at
the<00:01:38.030> right<00:01:38.210> speed
