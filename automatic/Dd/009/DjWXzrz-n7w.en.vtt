00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
in this video I'm going to just show one

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.780 
in this video I'm going to just show one
example<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:06.120> how<00:00:07.069> electronic<00:00:08.069> device<00:00:08.580> is

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
example of how electronic device is

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.660 
example of how electronic device is
placed<00:00:09.150> near<00:00:10.020> your<00:00:10.350> GPS<00:00:11.070> can<00:00:11.460> negatively

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
placed near your GPS can negatively

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.900 
placed near your GPS can negatively
affect<00:00:12.059> its<00:00:12.870> position<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.429> case<00:00:14.700> what

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
affect its position so in this case what

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.900 
affect its position so in this case what
I<00:00:14.940> have<00:00:15.120> here<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.509> my<00:00:16.279> trusty<00:00:17.279> 3d<00:00:17.550> or<00:00:17.640> quad

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
I have here is my trusty 3d or quad

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
can see I've got my mission planner here

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.690 
can see I've got my mission planner here
and<00:00:28.079> the<00:00:28.619> important<00:00:29.009> thing<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.369> number

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
and the important thing is this number

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.269 
and the important thing is this number
right<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:29.880> which<00:00:30.419> is<00:00:30.450> the<00:00:30.750> GPS<00:00:30.960> hdall<00:00:31.559> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
right here which is the GPS hdall so

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.740 
right here which is the GPS hdall so
right<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.890> 1.5<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:35.370> 105<00:00:35.850> 3<00:00:36.179> which<00:00:36.629> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
right now it's at 1.5 for 105 3 which is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.619 
right now it's at 1.5 for 105 3 which is
a<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:36.989> good<00:00:37.050> position<00:00:37.850> anything<00:00:38.850> above<00:00:39.120> 2<00:00:39.449> is

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
a very good position anything above 2 is

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.049 
a very good position anything above 2 is
generally<00:00:40.019> bad<00:00:40.460> then<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.609> have<00:00:41.789> is<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.030> have

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
generally bad then what I have is I have

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.740 
generally bad then what I have is I have
a<00:00:42.179> secondary<00:00:43.219> APM<00:00:44.219> 2.0<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.629> is

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
a secondary APM 2.0 and this is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.090 
a secondary APM 2.0 and this is
connected<00:00:45.989> up<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:48.589> prototype<00:00:49.589> sensor<00:00:49.949> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
connected up to a prototype sensor that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.040 
connected up to a prototype sensor that
I've<00:00:50.190> got<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:50.609> something<00:00:51.510> similar<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.019> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
I've got here something similar to a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.270 
I've got here something similar to a
sonar<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:55.050> there's<00:00:55.949> no<00:00:56.070> actual

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
sonar and it is there's no actual

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.130 
sonar and it is there's no actual
physical<00:00:56.460> connection<00:00:57.269> between<00:00:57.449> these<00:00:57.960> two

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
physical connection between these two

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.660 
physical connection between these two
except<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> course<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.309> both<00:00:59.429> plugged

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
except that of course that both plugged

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
except that of course that both plugged
into<00:00:59.789> my<00:01:00.170> they're<00:01:01.170> both<00:01:01.289> being<00:01:01.499> powered<00:01:01.920> by

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
into my they're both being powered by

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.210 
into my they're both being powered by
USB<00:01:03.050> and<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.470> those<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:04.980> USB<00:01:06.049> lines<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.320> both

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
USB and and those two USB lines are both

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.690 
USB and and those two USB lines are both
plugged<00:01:08.460> into<00:01:08.579> the<00:01:08.670> same<00:01:08.790> computer<00:01:10.700> anyway

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
plugged into the same computer anyway

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.090 
plugged into the same computer anyway
I'm<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> go<00:01:12.479> ahead<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.950> plug<00:01:13.950> in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I'm now going to go ahead and plug in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.249 
I'm now going to go ahead and plug in
the<00:01:14.250> second<00:01:14.579> APM<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.600> gonna<00:01:15.720> fire<00:01:16.049> up

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the second APM which is gonna fire up

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.370 
the second APM which is gonna fire up
this<00:01:16.610> this<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.329> prototype<00:01:18.600> sensor<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
this this this prototype sensor and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.719 
this this this prototype sensor and
we'll<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.829> look<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.159> happens<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
we'll have a look what happens to the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.130 
we'll have a look what happens to the
GPS<00:01:21.149> h-dog<00:01:25.909> it's<00:01:26.909> plugged<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
GPS h-dog it's plugged in and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
GPS h-dog it's plugged in and
immediately<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.590> see<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> GPS<00:01:29.159> h-dog<00:01:29.880> jumped

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
immediately to see the GPS h-dog jumped

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.840 
immediately to see the GPS h-dog jumped
and<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.110> actually<00:01:31.320> lost<00:01:31.649> GPS<00:01:32.159> lock<00:01:32.369> over<00:01:32.640> here

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and it actually lost GPS lock over here

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.410 
and it actually lost GPS lock over here
I<00:01:33.950> just<00:01:34.950> unplug<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> sensor<00:01:38.060> down<00:01:39.060> comes<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
I just unplug the sensor down comes the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.270 
I just unplug the sensor down comes the
H<00:01:39.600> stop<00:01:39.869> back<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.770> 1.6<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> clearly

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
H stop back to 1.6 this is clearly

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:54.050 
H stop back to 1.6 this is clearly
basically<00:01:44.280> GPS<00:01:44.640> jamming<00:01:52.039> you<00:01:53.039> go<00:01:53.219> lost<00:01:53.670> ups

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
basically GPS jamming you go lost ups

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.200 
basically GPS jamming you go lost ups
lock

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.900 

unplug<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:59.270> comes<00:02:00.270> right<00:02:00.510> back<00:02:00.690> again
