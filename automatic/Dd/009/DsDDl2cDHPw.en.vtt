00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi my name is Lena or dull and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.580
 I would like to tell today's video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.340
 you about your five most beloved 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.019
 detectives but this is kiev i adore 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.450
 childhood when in the country just for hours 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.730
 sitting and reading Agatha Christie have been 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 sisters a huge number of books and who 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.850
 then no read one book we immediately 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.369
 changed to faster faster faster 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.710
 as much as possible to read over the summer 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.480
 and by detective I am still extremely 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.300
 I cherish their pleasure 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 read with absolutely all sorts of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.480
 detectives to such that such 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 legal detectives 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.370
 bloody horrible detectives like 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.559
 trailers and just all sorts of funny 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 children's detectives, too, sometimes so 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.300
 it happens to me it's time to drink 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.649
 who have my favorite detectives despite 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.149
 the fact that this top equally strong 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.700
 I love all authors and works 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.730
 which I will now name first 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.320
 arthur conan doyle his sherlock holmes sherlock 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.670
 Oms cause me just wild 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.649
 quivering feelings because it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.070
 laid was one of the first such in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.289
 which I read as a child to me wildly 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.609
 liked and even now with 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.270
 pleasure courts are varied 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.030
 indigenization 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.100
 sherlock holmes i love soviet 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.290
 shellac but also love a lot and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.799
 modern body and tina film adaptation 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.020
 though sometimes I get the feeling that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.880
 the creators of the series just wanted to create 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.420
 some new detective therefore had to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.619
 justify the creation of a new series 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.650
 adaptation of works of arthur conan 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.659
 doyle in the second place gets agate 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.340
 Christie with almost everyone and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.170
 works with at least those 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.119
 which I read but older 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.220
 my favorite is the orient express 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.619
 killing roger and the edge yes and and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.340
 met the mirror circle for them this i 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.400
 also adore 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.680
 according to my British film adaptation of novels 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.180
 agate christie 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.850
 especially those where the role of poirot plays 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.119
 belgian in my actor david land 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.130
 turn after all my favorite 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.020
 John Grisch gets the third place 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.810
 also with those works of him which 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.460
 I already read my favorite on 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.040
 the moment is the case 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.409
 american women i'm just a mad fan of him 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.149
 works 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.159
 just mad fan of the adaptation of julie 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.170
 Roberts by your publishing house I will reconsider 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.360
 this film is just billions of times I can 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.549
 revise it still all the same 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.049
 billions of times and most likely I will 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.580
 do it all the rest 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:21.530
 life beyond that this facet is firm and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.840
 the last juror if you haven't read 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.940
 Works hard krishna read 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.319
 or if read advise me can 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.620
 be i will discover anything else 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.690
 new on fourth place is James 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.459
 patterson is also an american writer 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.890
 of detectives with the exchange of American corn 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.269
 an asset which I really like a series of books 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.700
 called women's club by 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.709
 homicide investigation 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.170
 these books have also been filmed 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.079
 in the cinema and in the body format I am very 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.040
 like the old old movie about the first 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.610
 books from the series 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.959
 and also in my 2009 came out 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.879
 American TV series really closed it 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.859
 after the first season but since then I 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.590
 I will continue to review this season 3 times 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.200
 because I really like and 5 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.599
 exceptional place falls norwegian 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.790
 the writer would have whose books and opened for 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.250
 yourself just recently after going out 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.250
 movie bounty hunter 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.560
 This is one of one and a half books by this author. 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.630
 which I read well I hope that 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.609
 I will continue to open my new ones 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.069
 works because as I recently 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.569
 I realized I love Scandinavian 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.700
 detectives because the authors write 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.470
 incredibly interesting and film on it 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.359
 take off so incredibly interesting a 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.400
 screen version Kafka we notice it already 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.590
 play a big role in my case 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.260
 shaping my opinion work 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.760
 hi i look a little different than 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.319
 the beginning of this video is because the camera 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.480
 the kenda of reasons decided the ending in its not 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.540
 write it and understood it all only in 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.000
 end editing process and how 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.650
 usually talked about the fact that Elena 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.090

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.350

 comments which thread and glad urns and 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.010
 works because every month I 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.050
 I decided using the site random.org to choose 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.670
 one book to read 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.490
 get out of your literary comfort 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.080

 outlook please recommend 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.040

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.500
 I will read exactly what they recommended. 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.640
