00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.870 
parameters pH is at six point six
ammonia<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:28.429> either<00:00:29.750> 2.25<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> point<00:00:31.880> thirty

ammonia is at either 2.25 a point thirty
somewhere<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.480> range<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:35.399> nitrite<00:00:36.739> was

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
somewhere in that range the nitrite was

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.459 
somewhere in that range the nitrite was
a<00:00:37.770> zero<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> nitrate<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:39.899> zero<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469

what<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.109> top<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> tank<00:00:58.680> threat

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
what that is on top of the tank threat

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.880 
what that is on top of the tank threat
right<00:00:59.129> there<00:01:00.350> let's<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:01.739> real

close and we'll just see the wave

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:12.620 
close and we'll just see the wave
pattern<00:01:03.780> say<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> Manya

I say remember we getting the 305 hooked

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.780 
I say remember we getting the 305 hooked
up<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.640> that's<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> outflow<00:01:21.119> into

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
up on here that's the outflow into

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.080 
up on here that's the outflow into
looking<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> manual<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:26.090> remember

months<00:02:45.630> but<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.930> can<00:02:46.049> get<00:02:46.140> away<00:02:46.230> with<00:02:46.380> six

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
months but I can get away with six

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.620 
months but I can get away with six
months<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:47.130> know<00:02:47.510> interchanging<00:02:48.510> them

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
months you know interchanging them

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.550 
months you know interchanging them
during<00:02:49.170> those<00:02:49.320> four<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:49.829> six<00:02:50.160> months<00:02:50.459> they're

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
during those four and six months they're

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.349 
during those four and six months they're
you<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.590> keep<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.070> with<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.280> seedings<00:02:53.670> of

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
you know keep up with the seedings of

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.569 
you know keep up with the seedings of
the<00:02:54.600> bacteria<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.440> they<00:02:55.470> don't<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.980> know<00:02:56.100> grow

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.970 

new<00:02:59.579> you<00:02:59.820> know<00:02:59.910> he'll<00:03:00.180> have<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.410> way<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.440> growing

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
new you know he'll have a way of growing

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.020 
new you know he'll have a way of growing
new<00:03:04.700> so

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.390

let's see it said here on the clear bags
every<00:03:12.030> six<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.300> eight<00:03:12.390> weeks<00:03:12.540> appeared<00:03:13.050> on

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
every six to eight weeks appeared on

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.310 
every six to eight weeks appeared on
depending<00:03:14.700> on<00:03:14.820> your<00:03:15.240> aquarium<00:03:15.660> conditions

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320

growth look at that look at that I say
there's<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.100> other<00:03:32.160> two<00:03:32.370> pieces<00:03:32.550> of

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
there's the other two pieces of

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.820 
there's the other two pieces of
driftwood<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.420> said<00:03:34.080> I<00:03:34.110> can't<00:03:34.440> get<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.620> third

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
driftwood I said I can't get the third

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.810 
driftwood I said I can't get the third
one<00:03:34.860> sink<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.300> we're<00:03:36.450> gonna<00:03:36.600> have<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.670> see<00:03:38.670> what

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
one sink so we're gonna have to see what

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.449 
one sink so we're gonna have to see what
happens<00:03:39.320> next<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.500> got<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.770> one<00:03:40.920> laying<00:03:41.100> you

I<00:04:40.650> was<00:04:40.740> reading<00:04:40.979> on<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.669> form<00:04:42.290> saying<00:04:43.290> with

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
I was reading on a form saying with

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.070 
I was reading on a form saying with
brighter<00:04:43.770> lights<00:04:44.100> on<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.550> print<00:04:45.080> crippled

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
brighter lights on the print crippled

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.860 
brighter lights on the print crippled
Indies<00:04:46.350> or<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.650> bronze<00:04:47.040> crypts<00:04:47.479> they<00:04:48.479> tend<00:04:48.810> to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
Indies or the bronze crypts they tend to

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.570 
Indies or the bronze crypts they tend to
grow<00:04:49.050> out<00:04:49.260> outward<00:04:49.830> on<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:51.350> substrate

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
grow out outward on the substrate

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.280 
grow out outward on the substrate
instead<00:04:53.580> of<00:04:53.669> growing<00:04:53.820> upward<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.990> we'll<00:04:55.140> see

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
instead of growing upward so we'll see

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.520 
instead of growing upward so we'll see
what<00:04:55.410> happens<00:04:55.440> for<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:57.050> when<00:04:58.050> we<00:04:58.110> put<00:04:58.320> some

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
what happens for that when we put some

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.280 
what happens for that when we put some
baby<00:04:58.979> dwarf<00:04:59.370> tears<00:04:59.729> in<00:05:00.090> here<00:05:00.300> as<00:05:00.419> well<00:05:00.600> and

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
baby dwarf tears in here as well and
