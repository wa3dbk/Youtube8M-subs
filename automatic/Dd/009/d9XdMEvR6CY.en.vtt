00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
to die in this gameplay which is why I

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.449 
to die in this gameplay which is why I
call<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.640> an<00:03:25.000> attempt<00:03:25.959> there's<00:03:26.799> me<00:03:27.040> using<00:03:27.340> that

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
call it an attempt there's me using that

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.420 
call it an attempt there's me using that
USP<00:03:28.150> 45<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:29.470> that's<00:03:29.709> why<00:03:29.830> this<00:03:29.890> is<00:03:30.010> called<00:03:30.220> an

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
USP 45 so that's why this is called an

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.050 
USP 45 so that's why this is called an
attempt<00:03:30.940> because<00:03:31.480> I'm<00:03:31.720> not<00:03:31.959> allowed<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.260> die

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
attempt because I'm not allowed to die

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.610 
attempt because I'm not allowed to die
and<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.329> game<00:03:34.510> gets<00:03:34.720> pretty<00:03:34.959> ramped<00:03:35.320> up<00:03:35.410> and

it<00:06:18.600> might<00:06:19.380> turn<00:06:19.650> tragic<00:06:20.280> in<00:06:20.490> a<00:06:20.730> couple<00:06:21.120> of

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
it might turn tragic in a couple of

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.140 
it might turn tragic in a couple of
minutes<00:06:21.450> it<00:06:21.810> might<00:06:22.640> but<00:06:23.640> there<00:06:23.790> is<00:06:23.880> an<00:06:24.000> enemy

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
minutes it might but there is an enemy

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.480 
minutes it might but there is an enemy
trying<00:06:24.510> to<00:06:24.600> sneak<00:06:24.810> up<00:06:24.960> on<00:06:25.110> me<00:06:25.290> right<00:06:25.470> now<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:25.950> I

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
trying to sneak up on me right now and I

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
get up to go and kill him and I probably

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.140 
get up to go and kill him and I probably
would<00:06:28.650> have<00:06:28.710> got<00:06:28.830> that<00:06:28.950> throw<00:06:29.190> knife<00:06:29.400> but<00:06:29.730> my
