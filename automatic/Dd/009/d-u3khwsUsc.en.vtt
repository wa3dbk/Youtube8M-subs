00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.840
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.720
NARRATOR: WHILE THEIR MAY BE
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE IMPACT

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.600
OF DIFFERENT FAMILY FORMS ON
CHILDREN, THERE IS WIDESPREAD

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.240
AGREEMENT AMONG MOST EXPERTS
THAT FAMILIES CONTINUE TO PLAY

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.320
A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE LIVES
OF THEIR MEMBERS.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.190
AND THERE'S SOME COMPELLING
EVIDENCE THAT FAMILIES

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.190
CONTINUE TO LOVE THEIR CHILDREN
PRETTY WELL AND

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.750
INVEST IN THEM AS
BEST THEY CAN.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.680
AND CHILDREN AREN'T GOING
TO GET THAT AT SCHOOL.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.310
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET
THAT FROM TEACHERS.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.220
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
GET IT AT WORK.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.450
FAMILIES DO THAT DAY
IN AND DAY OUT

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.170
INTIMATE KIND OF STUFF.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.410
I WOULD SAY THAT FAMILIES ARE
DOING BETTER THAN THE MEDIA

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.030
MIGHT PORTRAY, GIVEN THE BROAD
DIVERSITY A FAMILY FORMS AND

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.730
ALL OF THE ECONOMIC AND
SOCIAL CHANGES OF

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.450
THE LAST TWO DECADES.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.380
THERE'S A POPULAR MYTH THAT THE
AMERICAN FAMILY IS FALLING

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.680
APART, IT'S IN DECLINE, IT'S
A VANISHED SPECIES.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.350
AND ACTUALLY I THINK THE
FAMILY'S HERE TO STAY,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.570
ALTHOUGH IT'S TRANSFORMING
ITSELF IN MANY WAYS THAT FIT

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.760
THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIMES.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.540
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHETHER
THE FAMILY IS IN DECLINE, I

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.400
THINK OFTEN THEY'RE THINKING
ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF THE

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.430
FUNCTIONS THAT THE FAMILY
PERHAPS ONCE SERVED NO LONGER

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.840
BEING MET BY THE FAMILY UNIT.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.280
AND SO ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD
CERTAINLY BE CARE OF

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.630
YOUNG CHILDREN THAT WOULD BE
INCREASINGLY TAKING PLACE

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.780
OUTSIDE OF THE FAMILY NOW, AS
WOMEN ARE NO LONGER STAYING AT

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.680
HOME IN THE SAME NUMBERS.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.300
SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT THE
FAMILY HAS BECOME A BIT

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.755
OBSOLETE IN THE EYES
OF CHILDREN.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:34.210
THAT CHILDREN LOOK AT PARENT
AS A BIT OLD FASHIONED AND

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.280
START LOOKING TO OTHER MEDIA AND
OTHER MODELS FOR GUIDANCE.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.390
AND UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE
THERE'S LESS PARENT-CHILD

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.830
INTERACTIONS WITH THE ONE
WORKING AND CHILDREN INVOLVED

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.740
IN SO MANY RECREATIONAL
ACTIVITIES, THAT PROBABLY HAS

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.750
A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE WELL
BEING OF CHILDREN AND PROBABLY

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.580
AFFECTS THEM THROUGHOUT
THEIR LIVES.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.270
THE NEED OF CHILDREN TO HAVE
PARENTS THERE MONITORING AND

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.830
ENGAGING THEM HAS
NOT GONE AWAY.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.500
IT'S JUST THAT PARENTS HAVE
LESS TIME AND ENERGY TO DO

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.630
WHAT THEY'VE TRADITIONALLY
DONE.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.400
MOST CHILDREN NOW RECEIVE
THEIR EDUCATION

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.710
OUTSIDE OF THE FAMILY.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.860
CARE FOR THE ELDERLY IS
INCREASINGLY HAPPENING OUTSIDE

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.620
THE FAMILY.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.690
SO THE FAMILY, IN
THAT SENSE, HAS

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.130
LOST MANY OF ITS FUNCTIONS.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.210
BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE, IT STILL
OCCUPIES A CENTRAL ROLE IN

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.630
THEIR LIVES.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.070
FAMILIES ARE ALWAYS CHANGING.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.940
THERE ARE MANY INDICATORS THAT
SHOW THAT FAMILIES ARE NO

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.170
WORSE OFF, THAT PEOPLE SPEND NO
LESS TIME WITH THEIR KIDS

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.360
THAN THEY USED TO.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.530
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE IS AN
EVOLVING FAMILY SYSTEM THAT

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.290
MEETS THE DEMANDS OF PEOPLE.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.360
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LACK OF
FIT BETWEEN SOME OF OUR

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.000
NOSTALGIC IDEALS AND
THE PRACTICES OF

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.340
EVERYDAY FAMILY LIFE.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.050
BUT BY AND LARGE, WE'RE DOING
THE SAME KIND OF CHANGING THAT

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.200
FAMILIES HAVE ALWAYS DONE.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.423
THOSE CHANGES GENERALLY REFLECT
SIMILAR SHIFTS TAKING

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:51.594
PLACE IN SOCIETY OVERALL.

00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:55.690
FAMILIES ARE ALWAYS RELATED TO
THE ECONOMY, THE POLITICS, THE

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.840
CULTURE OF THE SOCIETY.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.150
SO IN OTHER WORDS, IF A SOCIETY
IS PREDICATED ON A

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.340
CERTAIN KIND OF SUBSISTENCE
PRACTICE, THAT'S GOING TO

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.400
SHAPE WHAT FAMILIES ARE LIKE.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.770
IN HERDING SOCIETIES, YOUNG
PEOPLE GO OUT WHEN THEY'RE 10

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.420
OR 12 YEARS OLD, AND THEY HANG
OUT WITH THE SHEEP OR THE

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.130
GOATS OR WHATEVER
THEY'RE HERDING.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.220
THAT PRODUCES A KIND OF A
LOOSE BOND BETWEEN THE

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.660
PREADOLESCENTS AND
THEIR PARENTS.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.370
IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES,
WE TEND TO KEEP

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.190
KIDS IN SCHOOL LONGER.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.530
AND THEN COLLEGE IS THAT POINT
WHERE THEY MIGHT BREAK, OR

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.290
AFTER COLLEGE, DEPENDING
ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.360
IN AGRARIAN SOCIETIES, WE PUT
PEOPLE TO WORK AND HAVE LOTS

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.920
OF KIDS AND STRUCTURE LARGE
FAMILIES AND PUT THEM ALL

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.360
TOGETHER IN ONE ROOM.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.970
THE MAIN POINT IS THE
FAMILIES ARE NOT

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.370
SEPARATE FROM THE SOCIETY.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.080
FAMILIES AND THE ECONOMY
AND THE POLITY ARE

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.080
ALL WRAPPED UP TOGETHER.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.440
NARRATOR: JUST AS MANY SOCIETIES
HAVE UNDERGONE

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.250
TREMENDOUS CHANGE OVER THE PAST
TWO CENTURIES, SO, TOO,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.030
HAS THE FAMILY.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.900
AND GET THE FUNDAMENTAL ESSENCE
OF THIS VENERABLE

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.410
INSTITUTION SOMEHOW ENDURES.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.860
I THINK THE FAMILY IS JUST
FUNDAMENTAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.680
THE SPECIES.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.175
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME STABLE
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO RAISE

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:05.592
A VULNERABLE NEWBORN AND PROTECT
THEM BIOLOGICALLY AND

00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:07.286
TO RAISE THEM SOCIOLOGICALLY.

00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:10.770
SO I DON'T THINK THE FAMILY
WILL CHANGE VERY MUCH.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.515
I THINK WE'VE PROBABLY REACHED
THE PEAK OF DIVORCE RATES.

00:04:15.515 --> 00:04:19.300
I THINK THEY'LL PROBABLY LEVEL
OUT, MAYBE EVEN CONTINUE TO GO

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.430
DOWN BECAUSE I THINK AS THE
NORMS OF FAMILY STRUCTURE

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.550
CHANGE, MEN AND WOMEN
WILL BE MORE EQUAL.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.094
AND SO THAT BIG SOURCE OF
TENSION THAT'S ALWAYS EXISTED

00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:32.140
IN THE FAMILY WILL BE MITIGATED
DRAMATICALLY.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.380
WOMEN'S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION
IN THE LABOR

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.530
MARKET IS UNLIKELY TO UNDERMINE
MARRIAGE TO THE

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.940
EXTENT THAT MY OWN RESEARCH
AND THE RESEARCH OF OTHERS

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.800
SUGGESTS THAT, IN FACT, HAVING
A STABLE JOB, GOOD EARNINGS

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.480
ACTUALLY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH
AN INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.040
MARRIAGE, NOT A REDUCTION
IN MARRIAGE.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.800
AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT
PEOPLE HAD BEEN CONCERNED

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.330
ABOUT WAS THAT THESE
IMPROVEMENTS IN WOMEN STANDING

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.320
THE LABOR MARKET WERE SOMEHOW
A THREAT TO THE FAMILY.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.100
AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE FOR
THAT IS PRETTY WEAK.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.540
IF ANYTHING, I THINK IT GOES THE
OTHER WAY, THAT PROBABLY

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.810
THE BEST PREDICTOR OF
FAMILY STABILITY IS

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.590
THIS ECONOMIC STABILITY.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.370
AND PEOPLE, WHEN THEY DO GET
DIVORCED OR WANT TO GET

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.950
REMARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN
AGAIN, THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.820
TREND, I DON'T THINK THAT'S
GOING TO CHANGE.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.409
BECAUSE THESE ARE FUNDAMENTAL
TO OUR SPECIES.

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.904
WE DIDN'T SURVIVE AS A SPECIES
WITHOUT THE FAMILY.

00:05:15.904 --> 00:05:19.300
THE FAMILY HAD TO BE INVENTED
BY HUMANS TO ASSURE THE

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.270
REPRODUCTION OF SPECIES.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.040
SO IT'S PROBABLY GOT SOME
BIOLOGICAL BASIS.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.678
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WIPED AWAY
BY CHANGING THE SOCIAL

00:05:25.678 --> 00:05:29.140
AND CULTURAL CONDITIONS.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.090
OUR FAMILY IS INCREDIBLY
DIVERSE, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.026
CULTURE, IN TERMS OF
GENDER IDENTITY, IN

00:05:35.026 --> 00:05:37.210
TERMS OF AGE AND REGION.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.170
LUNA HAS SIX GRANDMOTHERS
(LAUGHS) AND THREE

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.510
GRANDFATHERS FROM BLOOD FAMILY,
FROM ADOPTIVE FAMILY,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.700
FROM OUR DONOR'S MOTHER
AND FATHER ARE

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.460
INVOLVED IN THE FAMILY.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.660
SO WE HAVE REALLY BOTH
EXPERIENCED THE RICHNESS OF

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.240
OUR BIOLOGICAL FAMILIES AND
REALLY CALLED THEM IN AND

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.140
WELCOMED THEM INTO OUR FAMILY.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.294
AT THE SAME TIME AS WE HAVE AN
INCREDIBLY LOVING, CONNECTED,

00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:09.764
COMMITTED, SUPPORTIVE GROUP
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT

00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:12.735
BIOLOGICALLY CONNECTED THAT WE
CONSIDER FAMILY AND THAT ARE

00:06:12.735 --> 00:06:15.355
DOING CHILD CARE, AND THAT WERE
PART OF OUR BIRTH, AND

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:18.260
THAT HAVE, YOU KNOW, NURTURED
US AND KEPT US

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.220
ALIVE IN A LOT OF WAYS.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.860
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE IN
A REALLY INCREDIBLE TIME IN

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.641
HISTORY, IN TERMS OF FAMILY,
BECAUSE THE DEFINITION OF

00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:27.966
FAMILY IS SHIFTING VERY,
VERY PROFOUNDLY.

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:33.210
AND, YOU KNOW, THE MOM, DAD, TWO
KIDS, DOG, WHATEVER IS A

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.870
TINY MINORITY OF REALLY
WHAT FAMILIES ARE.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.610
WE ARE A FAMILY JUST LIKE
EVERY-- LIKE OUR MOTHERS AND

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.570
FATHERS WERE FAMILIES.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.813
YOU KNOW, WE'RE FAMILIES LIKE
OUR NEIGHBORS ARE FAMILIES.

00:06:42.813 --> 00:06:46.150
AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER, WE CARE
FOR EACH OTHER, WE GO

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.370
THROUGH MAJOR SICKNESS AND
MAJOR ISSUES IN HEALTH.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.800
AND WE DO ALL THE THINGS
THAT MARRIED PEOPLE DO.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.830
AND, YOU KNOW, FOR US,
WE'RE VERY NORMAL.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.680
WE ARE A FAMILY.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.280
