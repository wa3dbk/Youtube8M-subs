00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 so greet you friends again on 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.450
 channel michael h and offer you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.510
 a quick look at the attacks on my base 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.420
 and how did she help me rise 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.519
 cups with 3 in profiles 1 in just 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.260
 the day of the attack is nothing 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.119
 special is not why I them 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.619
 specify in the accelerated mode to enter 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.810
 first attack just 23 percent 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.779
 it turned out to carry my base with these 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.910
 barbarians with seventh bows and so the second 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.529
 attack on my base we look that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.750
 opponent super opponent decided to go 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.300
 fence and no problem and break your 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.690
 sixth bombers and opens free 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.260
 access to my vault and giants 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 giants will get like this one exactly 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.420
 from from an attack which after all he decided 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.910
 go through the fence but that's okay 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.579
 on mistakes we learn therefore after this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.620
 I improved the attacks a little 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.719
 rebuilt base more such moments not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.000
 it will be so easy to bomb the fence with 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.829
 angle either side left or right not 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.879
 it will work out because maybe I will deliver 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.710
 closer crossbows 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 You see pretty far away 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.580
 and do not reach do not reach to buber and drywall 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.170
 in running with with their pouches so 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.970
 after improving my base in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.189
 in principle no one else wanted 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.759
 attack the sides of the fence with you bombers 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.619
 and so on, they wanted to attack only with 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.930
 the other side of the fence where i have it in 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.750
 one row where the maximum increase is dx 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.640
 and thought that no problem with giants under 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.740
 files barbarians and bows will be able to take 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.799
 50 percent but statistics show 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.680
 that 80 percent of the attacks were unsuccessful 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.560
 only 20 of them turned out to take from me 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 just a few cups 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.579
 Yes, while I lose some resources but 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.040
 resource in it to be honest 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.259
 equal because the base on for for 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.720
 raising cups are they for saving 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.450
 resources and so you see attacking even with 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.549
 the witch of the first left but not his 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.130
 it will turn out to spread the base even by 50 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.200
 percent and take the stars queen 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.720
 witches and bows sang and everything was 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.670
 used but only 30 all right 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.860
 32 percent 33 34 34 percent with him 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.970
 Pugacheva take her lost thirty one 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.530
 cup next so you see 9 games 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.640
 catulla barbarians and bows 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.470
 again attack and not from that side 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.810
 carries on and the building thinks they are there 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.040
 very much and it will turn out to fill at least 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.230
 50 percent but no again no again 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.980
 my base saves me and adds not 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.049
 just bite so 46 percent a bit to him 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.540
 just a little bit left but again not 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.390
 then I didn’t have enough army 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.220
 well, okay or just my vf So 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.500
 dragging 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.510
 a lot of such bases where one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.310
 fence back row flower fence with 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.310
 the maldives never understood these you 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.040
 it turns out that there is in this some 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.530
 certain meaning and here we look still 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.130
 one so you see your own with sticks 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.579
 giants but do not reach they die and 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.799
 again 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.530
 and so it was 40 percent loss again 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.980
 cups from the enemy but I add 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.350
 I want to show you another turn in the form of 9 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.530
 Valkyries of the first level, many giants 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.389
 bombers bows of may 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.120
 pretty serious army just one 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:21.760
 sang health you see pretty yet 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.980
 not bad there overthrow the giants next 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.930
 video I already put traps there when 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.269
 they are from the gun 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.280
 100 giants will spread the following 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.010
 video you'll see it on repeat 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.769
 Valkyries have died 38 percent of the instructions you 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.040
 running off we get 41 percent but still 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:44.260
 useless -20 purchase but aries plus our 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:48.730
 eye and food to 4 giants 7 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.069
 fought many barbarians many bows blog 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.329
 you see in a row at all releases so 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:04:01.060
 32 33 34 37 40 42 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:02.920
 percent 44 45 percent and all again 45 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.760
 percent and no longer take 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.409
 my base is not able to take understandable 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.060
 the main thing is my base 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:14.349
 attract not very experienced opponents 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.750
 and therefore it turns out all the same at the base 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.579
 defend such attacks here of course 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.949
 more serious opponents for whom 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.139
 no problem making a couple 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.919
 raids giants smash this whole dev 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.960
 in a hurry 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.090
 but you yourself do not always understand 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.800
 comes across the opponent who is suitable 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.860
 army for this basic self someone 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.870
 the bows or the barbarian sometimes did n’t even have time 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.150
 enough that in drag so the last 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.419
 fight let's see the last one 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.729
 last on the right for 7 giants and 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.599
 he just has a little more 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.520
 ten you theme barbarians and bows 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.500
 clan to the trunk of me and consists of bows 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.070
 Mostly distance some magicians nothing to see 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.650
 akim was thrown raid he managed 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.390
 another decided not to use 45 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.400
 46 percent and everything on this attack was 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.950
 finished and plus I am also annoyed 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.060
 number of cups and so are friends with 3 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.520
 crystal league 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.390
 I got into the first in just one day 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.670
 and directed parts of 238 cups only on 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.660
 the configuration of your bank on it all 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.660
 dear friends all bye
