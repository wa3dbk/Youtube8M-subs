00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
onto this a weird block thing when

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.270 
onto this a weird block thing when
there's<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.510> end<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.900> those<00:02:41.080> things<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.920> go

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280
