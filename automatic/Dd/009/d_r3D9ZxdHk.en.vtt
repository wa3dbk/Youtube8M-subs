00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
you know a lot of people ask me why the

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.880 
you know a lot of people ask me why the
law<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.149> attraction<00:00:03.319> doesn't<00:00:04.319> work<00:00:04.620> for<00:00:04.770> them

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
law of attraction doesn't work for them

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.780 
law of attraction doesn't work for them
and<00:00:05.270> I've<00:00:06.270> been<00:00:06.509> studying<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.350> now<00:00:07.799> with

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
and I've been studying this now with

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.700 
and I've been studying this now with
Jerry<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.450> Esther<00:00:09.540> Hicks<00:00:09.840> for<00:00:10.170> example<00:00:10.559> who

Jerry and Esther Hicks for example who
really<00:00:11.070> introduced<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.610> idea<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.059> law<00:00:12.300> of

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
really introduced the idea of law of

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.210 
really introduced the idea of law of
attraction<00:00:13.040> since<00:00:14.389> 1996<00:00:15.800> prior<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.190> I

attraction since 1996 prior to that I
was<00:00:17.580> really<00:00:17.940> engaged<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:19.310> Earl<00:00:20.310> nightingale's

was really engaged in Earl nightingale's
conversation<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.800> strangest<00:00:23.189> secret

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
conversation of the strangest secret

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.400 
conversation of the strangest secret
which<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.240> basically<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.930> become<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.380> you

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
which is basically you become what you

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.460 
which is basically you become what you
think<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.289> know<00:00:28.380> I've

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
think about and so you know I've

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.439 
think about and so you know I've
investigated<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.429> lot<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.880> only<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.269> my

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
investigated this a lot not only in my

experimentation but I've also

experimentation but I've also
investigated<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.450> thousands<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
investigated it with thousands and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.930 
investigated it with thousands and
thousands<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.770> other<00:00:37.890> coaching<00:00:38.579> clients

that I want this I keep getting that and
usually<00:00:51.539> what<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.110> want<00:00:52.350> this

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
usually what it is is I want this

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.410 
usually what it is is I want this
success<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> keep<00:00:53.489> getting<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.820> failure

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
success and I keep getting this failure

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450 
success and I keep getting this failure
I<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.260> success<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> keep<00:00:56.100> dropping

I want this success and I keep dropping
the<00:00:56.550> ball<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.059> say<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> want<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.590> I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the ball I say I want this but then I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.609 
the ball I say I want this but then I
fall<00:00:59.160> apart<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:00.079> it<00:01:01.079> comes<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.219> probably

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
fall apart and it comes down to probably

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.260 
fall apart and it comes down to probably
for<00:01:04.619> me<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> most<00:01:05.430> breakthrough

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
for me one of the most breakthrough

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.170 
for me one of the most breakthrough
ideas<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.950> I've<00:01:08.250> come<00:01:08.580> across<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
ideas that that I've come across and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.640 
ideas that that I've come across and
it's<00:01:09.270> something<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> lot

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it's something that I want to do a lot

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.039 
it's something that I want to do a lot
of<00:01:10.680> work<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.430> over<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.479> next<00:01:12.900> two

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
of work with you on over this next two

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.120 
of work with you on over this next two
years<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.380> we're<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> work<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:13.890> each

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
years that we're going to work with each

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.810 
years that we're going to work with each
other<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:15.420> called<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> fundamental

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
other and it's called the fundamental

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
other and it's called the fundamental
misperception<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> consider<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.619> years<00:01:20.400> ago

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
misperception so consider this years ago

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.230 
misperception so consider this years ago
you<00:01:21.840> accepted<00:01:22.830> false<00:01:23.220> conclusions<00:01:24.090> as

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
you accepted false conclusions as

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.929 
you accepted false conclusions as
correct<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> began<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> live<00:01:26.759> your

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
correct and then you began to live your

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.969 
correct and then you began to live your
life<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.390> those<00:01:27.720> warped<00:01:28.140> ideas<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.799> your

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
life as if those warped ideas about your

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.940 
life as if those warped ideas about your
potential<00:01:29.310> were<00:01:29.549> true<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:31.170> completely

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
potential were true and you completely

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.840 
potential were true and you completely
killed<00:01:32.640> off<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:34.280> experiment<00:01:35.280> called<00:01:35.579> life

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
killed off the experiment called life

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.219 
killed off the experiment called life
and<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.570> started<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> live<00:01:37.380> within<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
and you started to live within a

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.420 
and you started to live within a
hallucinating<00:01:40.229> set<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.860> boundaries

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
hallucinating set of boundaries

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.359 
hallucinating set of boundaries
boundaries<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.390> even<00:01:42.509> exist<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.369> now

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
boundaries that don't even exist and now

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.539 
boundaries that don't even exist and now
what<00:01:44.640> happens<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.290> only<00:01:46.770> manifest

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
what happens is you will only manifest

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.609 
what happens is you will only manifest
and<00:01:48.090> create<00:01:48.119> within<00:01:48.720> those<00:01:48.990> boundaries<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and create within those boundaries and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.950 
and create within those boundaries and
so<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:50.670> goals<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> dreams<00:01:51.149> are<00:01:51.390> outside<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
so your goals and dreams are outside of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.410 
so your goals and dreams are outside of
the<00:01:52.020> boundary<00:01:52.460> but<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.790> keep<00:01:54.030> coming<00:01:54.360> up

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the boundary but you keep coming up

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.870 
the boundary but you keep coming up
against<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.960> lid<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.710> invisible<00:01:56.399> barrier

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
against this lid this invisible barrier

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.130 
against this lid this invisible barrier
and<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> invisible<00:01:57.750> barrier<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.350> a

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
and the invisible barrier is a

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.410 
and the invisible barrier is a
foundational<00:02:01.159> belief<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:03.090> about

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
foundational belief that you have about

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.670 
foundational belief that you have about
yourself

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
yourself

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
yourself
that<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.580> not<00:02:05.790> true<00:02:06.350> fundamental

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
that is not true fundamental

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.440 
that is not true fundamental
misperception<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.850> must<00:02:09.000> perceive<00:02:09.270> the

misperception you must perceive the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.630 
misperception you must perceive the
world<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.050> my<00:02:10.770> fundamental<00:02:11.340> misperception

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
world so my fundamental misperception

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
in the past in not knowing this the more

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.870 
in the past in not knowing this the more
that<00:02:19.200> I've<00:02:19.320> tried<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> be<00:02:20.220> something<00:02:20.580> right
