so<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> begin<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.920> took<00:00:38.280> two<00:00:38.579> lolly<00:00:38.820> sticks

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
so to begin with I took two lolly sticks

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.530 
so to begin with I took two lolly sticks
and<00:00:39.510> four<00:00:39.870> pegs<00:00:40.700> two<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> pegs<00:00:42.180> were<00:00:42.360> then

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and four pegs two of the pegs were then

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.080 
and four pegs two of the pegs were then
taken<00:00:42.840> apart<00:00:45.379> then<00:00:46.379> using<00:00:46.890> hot<00:00:47.160> glue<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.670> stuck

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
taken apart then using hot glue I stuck

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.790 
taken apart then using hot glue I stuck
together<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.600> pegs<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> lolly<00:00:49.440> stick

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
together the pegs and the lolly stick

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.869 
together the pegs and the lolly stick
into<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.340> simple<00:00:50.850> frame<00:00:51.180> shape<00:00:52.670> once<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
into this simple frame shape once I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.510 
into this simple frame shape once I
built<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> these<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.110> then<00:00:55.379> got<00:00:55.680> myself<00:00:55.890> two

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
built two of these I then got myself two

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
built two of these I then got myself two
more<00:00:56.760> lolly<00:00:56.969> sticks<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.660> chop<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.170> down<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
more lolly sticks and chop them down to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.260 
more lolly sticks and chop them down to
around<00:00:58.739> two<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> half<00:00:59.579> inches<00:01:02.030> using<00:01:03.030> more

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
around two and a half inches using more

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.539 
around two and a half inches using more
hot<00:01:03.510> glue<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.260> use<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> two<00:01:04.860> lolly<00:01:05.159> sticks

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
hot glue I then use the two lolly sticks

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.429 
hot glue I then use the two lolly sticks
to<00:01:05.850> secure<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.299> two<00:01:06.450> frames<00:01:06.780> together<00:01:07.020> as

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
to secure the two frames together as

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
to secure the two frames together as
shown

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.720 

I<00:01:12.230> decided<00:01:13.230> to<00:01:13.440> add<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:13.890> more<00:01:14.070> lolly<00:01:14.340> sticks

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
I decided to add two more lolly sticks

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.850 
I decided to add two more lolly sticks
underneath<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.660> to<00:01:15.990> add<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.440> extra

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
underneath just to add for extra

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.740 
underneath just to add for extra
stability<00:01:20.300> there<00:01:21.300> we<00:01:21.510> go<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:23.240> then<00:01:24.240> chop<00:01:24.510> down

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
stability there we go I then chop down

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.780 
stability there we go I then chop down
an<00:01:24.990> unused<00:01:25.320> pencil<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.100> about<00:01:26.310> two<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.760> half

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.150 
an unused pencil to about two and a half
inches<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.840> glued<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> into<00:01:28.470> place<00:01:28.710> at<00:01:29.010> the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
inches then glued it into place at the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.010 
inches then glued it into place at the
top<00:01:29.370> of<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.580> frame<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.300> so<00:01:32.630> that's<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> base

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
top of the frame like so that's the base

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.200 
top of the frame like so that's the base
complete<00:01:34.500> next<00:01:35.220> thing<00:01:35.370> to<00:01:35.520> make<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.910> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
complete next thing to make is the

complete next thing to make is the
launching<00:01:36.690> arm<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.640> found<00:01:38.640> myself<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.210> large

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
launching arm I found myself a large

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.660 
launching arm I found myself a large
leftover<00:01:40.200> lolly<00:01:40.350> stick<00:01:40.710> from<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.130> past<00:01:41.370> project

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
leftover lolly stick from a past project

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.640

and<00:01:42.210> chopped<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.720> down<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.140> about<00:01:43.290> three

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
and chopped it down to about three

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.370 
and chopped it down to about three
inches<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.450> then<00:01:45.450> attached<00:01:45.750> two<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.260> these

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
inches and then attached two of these

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.560 
inches and then attached two of these
metal<00:01:46.890> picture<00:01:47.340> frame<00:01:47.550> hangers<00:01:48.000> underneath

like so make sure you leave a little
space<00:01:58.020> underneath<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.740> hooks<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.550> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
space underneath the hooks so the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.050 
space underneath the hooks so the
elastic<00:02:00.120> band<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.630> fit<00:02:00.840> round<00:02:01.080> later<00:02:02.060> using

nail<00:02:35.079> through<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> gaps<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.159> the<00:02:36.489> pegs<00:02:36.730> and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
nail through the gaps in the pegs and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.949 
nail through the gaps in the pegs and
slotted<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.719> arm<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.230> between<00:02:38.680> like<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:42.959> once

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
slotted the arm in between like so once

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.409 
slotted the arm in between like so once
that<00:02:44.169> was<00:02:44.349> done<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.769> used<00:02:45.129> hot<00:02:45.400> glue<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.939> secure

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:46.419 
that was done I used hot glue to secure

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:52.470 
that was done I used hot glue to secure
the<00:02:46.540> nail<00:02:46.689> in<00:02:46.989> place<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:50.760> decided<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.969> wrap<00:02:52.180> some

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
the nail in place I decided to wrap some

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.479 
the nail in place I decided to wrap some
rubber<00:02:52.870> bands<00:02:53.139> around<00:02:53.439> the<00:02:53.799> base<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.310> arm

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
rubber bands around the base of the arm

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.009 
rubber bands around the base of the arm
just<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.120> give<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.359> a<00:02:55.449> little<00:02:55.629> extra<00:02:56.230> strength

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.839 

to<00:03:02.019> get<00:03:02.199> a<00:03:02.230> high<00:03:02.469> trajectory<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:03.370> added<00:03:03.760> a

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
to get a high trajectory I added a

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:10.229 
to get a high trajectory I added a
spring<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.510> arm<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:09.579> spring<00:03:09.939> should

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
spring to the arm the spring should

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.179 
spring to the arm the spring should
catch<00:03:10.510> on<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.930> upper<00:03:11.260> beam<00:03:11.469> causing<00:03:12.099> the

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
catch on the upper beam causing the

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.459 
catch on the upper beam causing the
projectile<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:13.060> fly<00:03:13.269> upwards<00:03:13.840> instead<00:03:14.139> of

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
projectile to fly upwards instead of

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.689 
projectile to fly upwards instead of
straight<00:03:14.799> across<00:03:15.099> I<00:03:16.590> then<00:03:17.590> created<00:03:17.949> a<00:03:18.219> simple

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
straight across I then created a simple

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.759 
straight across I then created a simple
pin<00:03:18.939> release<00:03:19.239> by<00:03:19.689> bending<00:03:19.959> some<00:03:20.349> picture

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
pin release by bending some picture

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.249 
pin release by bending some picture
hooks<00:03:20.979> around<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.609> bottom<00:03:21.909> of<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.150> frame<00:03:22.449> I

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:25.259 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.170 

simply<00:03:26.259> crafted<00:03:26.829> a<00:03:26.919> pin<00:03:27.159> by<00:03:27.519> bending<00:03:27.939> a

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
simply crafted a pin by bending a

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.349 
simply crafted a pin by bending a
paperclip<00:03:29.459> now<00:03:30.459> it's<00:03:30.609> time<00:03:30.879> to<00:03:31.030> attach<00:03:31.329> the

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
paperclip now it's time to attach the

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.760 
paperclip now it's time to attach the
rubber<00:03:31.689> band

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:44.000
