was always a ginormous case it must have

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.760 
was always a ginormous case it must have
been<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.569> big<00:02:03.720> challenge<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.349> get<00:02:04.560> this

been a big challenge you to get this

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.929 
been a big challenge you to get this
product<00:02:05.069> where<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.399> wanted<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.789> be

product where you wanted it to be
absolutely<00:02:06.720> in<00:02:07.079> fact<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.409> spent<00:02:07.649> over<00:02:07.829> two

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
absolutely in fact we spent over two

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.770 
absolutely in fact we spent over two
million<00:02:08.250> dollars<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.910> development<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
million dollars in development on the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.509 
million dollars in development on the
case<00:02:10.049> over<00:02:10.349> two<00:02:10.739> years<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:13.069> 1,500<00:02:14.069> pages<00:02:14.250> of

case over two years and 1,500 pages of
patent<00:02:14.760> application<00:02:15.329> so<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.810> 25

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
patent application so we have 25

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.650 
patent application so we have 25
patterns<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.370> filed<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.569> of

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
patterns that we filed on this one of

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.089 
patterns that we filed on this one of
the<00:02:18.720> most<00:02:18.900> significant<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.530> what<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.799> call<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
the most significant is what we call the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.309 
the most significant is what we call the
double<00:02:20.430> latch<00:02:20.579> which<00:02:21.390> actually<00:02:21.630> allows<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
double latch which actually allows it to

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.440 
double latch which actually allows it to
clamp<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> entire<00:02:23.190> overing<00:02:23.670> around<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.209> on

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
clamp the entire overing around like on

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.809 
clamp the entire overing around like on
the<00:02:24.690> inside<00:02:24.829> and<00:02:25.829> its<00:02:25.980> really<00:02:26.220> novel<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.730> no

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
the inside and its really novel and no

one's ever taken that approach before

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.110 
one's ever taken that approach before
it's<00:02:28.470> always<00:02:28.680> been<00:02:28.859> this<00:02:28.980> big<00:02:29.280> thick<00:02:29.790> beans

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
it's always been this big thick beans

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
and yes lamps and hinges like armor

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.479 
and yes lamps and hinges like armor
exactly<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.900> we've<00:02:34.200> passed<00:02:35.040> all<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.250> mil

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489

the ground so if you want to
I<00:02:38.660> love<00:02:39.350> this<00:02:39.440> test<00:02:39.940> actually<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:41.180> common<00:02:41.540> thing

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
I love this test actually a common thing

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.150 
I love this test actually a common thing
which<00:02:41.840> happens<00:02:42.050> you've<00:02:42.470> been<00:02:42.590> talking<00:02:42.920> on<00:02:43.010> the

which happens you've been talking on the
phone<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.700> then<00:02:44.690> you'll<00:02:45.020> be<00:02:45.050> distracted<00:02:45.650> or

phone and then you'll be distracted or
bump<00:02:46.010> into<00:02:46.250> something<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.870> takes<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.200> nice<00:02:48.350> big

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620

bump into something it takes a nice big
job<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:48.920> usually<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.370> would<00:02:49.460> crack<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.910> half

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
job and usually it would crack in half

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
job and usually it would crack in half
both<00:02:50.390> sides<00:02:50.630> are<00:02:50.780> glass

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.870 

because<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.800> lifeproof<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.370> absorbs<00:02:56.790> the
