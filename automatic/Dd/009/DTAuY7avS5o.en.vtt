these on another post but this was just

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.260 
these on another post but this was just
to<00:05:24.740> see<00:05:24.860> how<00:05:24.950> it<00:05:24.980> deals<00:05:25.220> with<00:05:25.370> lots<00:05:25.640> of<00:05:25.760> text<00:05:26.090> in

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
to see how it deals with lots of text in

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.150 
to see how it deals with lots of text in
macro<00:05:26.600> mode<00:05:26.720> or<00:05:27.230> close<00:05:27.410> up<00:05:27.590> mode<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:27.980> as<00:05:28.070> you

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
can see it does pretty well and the

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.060 
can see it does pretty well and the
only<00:05:32.630> problem<00:05:32.870> focusing<00:05:33.410> sometimes<00:05:33.860> is

quality and as I mentioned in that video

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.290 
quality and as I mentioned in that video
is<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:54.950> fact<00:05:55.130> that<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.400> Lumia<00:05:55.640> 720<00:05:56.030> one

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
is the fact that the Lumia 720 one

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.360 
is the fact that the Lumia 720 one
filming<00:05:56.660> in<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.230> Lumia<00:05:57.890> 521<00:05:58.610> filming<00:05:59.210> in<00:05:59.300> 720p

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.130 
filming in the Lumia 521 filming in 720p
actually<00:06:01.370> has<00:06:01.970> some<00:06:02.270> stuttering<00:06:02.750> and<00:06:02.870> dropped

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
actually has some stuttering and dropped

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.080 
actually has some stuttering and dropped
frames<00:06:03.500> and<00:06:03.830> audio<00:06:04.250> cuts<00:06:04.490> out<00:06:04.610> and<00:06:04.850> I<00:06:04.880> found

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
frames and audio cuts out and I found

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.760 
frames and audio cuts out and I found
that<00:06:05.180> really<00:06:05.240> disappointing<00:06:05.960> I<00:06:06.080> mean<00:06:06.230> the

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
that really disappointing I mean the

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.430 
that really disappointing I mean the
video<00:06:07.040> looked<00:06:08.030> ok<00:06:08.300> in<00:06:08.420> terms<00:06:08.630> of<00:06:08.690> colors<00:06:08.990> but

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
video looked ok in terms of colors but

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.070 
video looked ok in terms of colors but
the<00:06:09.650> actual<00:06:10.190> processing<00:06:10.910> or<00:06:11.150> recording

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
the actual processing or recording

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.980 
the actual processing or recording
process<00:06:12.620> wasn't<00:06:12.980> really<00:06:13.340> that<00:06:13.940> impressive<00:06:14.510> I

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
process wasn't really that impressive I

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.110 
process wasn't really that impressive I
think<00:06:15.500> it<00:06:15.560> was<00:06:15.620> probably<00:06:15.800> due<00:06:16.160> to<00:06:16.190> a<00:06:16.550> lack<00:06:17.060> of

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
think it was probably due to a lack of

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.020 
think it was probably due to a lack of
RAM<00:06:17.600> lack<00:06:18.020> of<00:06:18.400> processor<00:06:19.400> i'm<00:06:19.550> not<00:06:19.730> sure<00:06:19.910> what

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
RAM lack of processor i'm not sure what

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.550 
RAM lack of processor i'm not sure what
it<00:06:20.150> was<00:06:20.270> but<00:06:20.540> I<00:06:21.080> found<00:06:21.410> that<00:06:21.500> really

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
it was but I found that really

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.740 
it was but I found that really
disturbing<00:06:22.130> and<00:06:22.640> that<00:06:23.150> would<00:06:23.300> be<00:06:23.420> my<00:06:23.540> only

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
disturbing and that would be my only

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.680 
disturbing and that would be my only
complaint<00:06:24.440> about<00:06:24.680> Lumia<00:06:25.190> 520<00:06:25.640> and<00:06:25.790> I<00:06:26.540> guess

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
complaint about Lumia 520 and I guess

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.390 
complaint about Lumia 520 and I guess
that's<00:06:26.930> me<00:06:27.380> wrapping<00:06:27.710> it<00:06:27.830> up<00:06:27.890> I'd<00:06:28.100> have<00:06:28.220> to<00:06:28.310> say

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
that's me wrapping it up I'd have to say

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.300 
that's me wrapping it up I'd have to say
Lumia<00:06:28.730> 520<00:06:29.150> is<00:06:29.210> a<00:06:29.270> great<00:06:29.540> device<00:06:29.690> and<00:06:30.310> even
