00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.599 
hey guys what's up it's Jarek uber in
this<00:00:03.480> video<00:00:03.780> we've<00:00:04.049> got<00:00:04.200> an<00:00:04.259> unboxing<00:00:04.589> from<00:00:05.130> HK

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
this video we've got an unboxing from HK

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:19.580 
this video we've got an unboxing from HK
now<00:00:05.790> store<00:00:16.640> so<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.240> package<00:00:18.720> should<00:00:19.380> be

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
now store so in this package should be

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.929 
now store so in this package should be
the<00:00:19.800> ice<00:00:20.130> blue<00:00:20.670> 4<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.449> Fisher<00:00:21.840> cube<00:00:22.109> um<00:00:22.760> it<00:00:23.760> was

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the ice blue 4 for Fisher cube um it was

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.790 
the ice blue 4 for Fisher cube um it was
limited<00:00:24.269> edition<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.900> decided<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
limited edition and I decided that I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.519 
limited edition and I decided that I
should<00:00:26.310> get<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> for<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.029> reason<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:30.529> there

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
should get it for that reason so there

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.940 
should get it for that reason so there
it<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.830> that's<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
it is that's it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.180 

Calvin's<00:00:35.520> puzzle<00:00:36.030> business<00:00:36.329> card<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.190> here

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
Calvin's puzzle business card and here

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.760 
Calvin's puzzle business card and here
it<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.570> exactly<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.140> same<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it is so this is exactly the same as the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.470 
it is so this is exactly the same as the
former<00:00:41.100> for<00:00:41.250> Fisher<00:00:41.520> cube<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.120> an<00:00:42.270> ice

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
former for Fisher cube it's just an ice

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.920 
former for Fisher cube it's just an ice
blue<00:00:42.809> version<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.860> ice<00:00:44.340> Ras<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.239> transparent

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
blue version the ice Ras is transparent

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.619 
blue version the ice Ras is transparent
blue<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.710> transparent<00:00:47.280> purple<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.940> didn't<00:00:48.510> get

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
blue the transparent purple I didn't get

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.950

just open this up okay there it is how

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.709 
just open this up okay there it is how
that's<00:00:56.370> seen<00:00:56.489> any<00:00:56.699> other<00:00:56.730> videos<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.480> yet

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
that's seen any other videos on this yet

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.099 
that's seen any other videos on this yet
I<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.649> seen<00:00:58.920> some<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.109> transparent

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
I have seen some on the transparent

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.930 
I have seen some on the transparent
purple<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> looks<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:01.949> close<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.489> black

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
purple and looks really close to black

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.090 
purple and looks really close to black
this<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:04.170> does<00:01:04.379> look<00:01:04.650> blue<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.920> see

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
this really does look blue you can see

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
this really does look blue you can see
that<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.900> transparent<00:01:09.900> blue<00:01:10.049> which<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that it is transparent blue which is

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.710 
that it is transparent blue which is
really<00:01:10.650> cool<00:01:11.060> there's<00:01:12.060> only<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.299> hundred<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
really cool there's only a hundred of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.899 
really cool there's only a hundred of
these<00:01:12.840> ever<00:01:13.110> made<00:01:13.500> which<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:13.950> awesome<00:01:14.820> um<00:01:15.560> I

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
these ever made which is awesome um I

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.160 
these ever made which is awesome um I
guess<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.180> plastic<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.810> slightly

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
guess that the plastic is slightly

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
guess that the plastic is slightly
different<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.920> puzzle<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.369> guess<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.729> what

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
different on this puzzle I guess is what

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
different on this puzzle I guess is what
it's<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.630> I've<00:01:21.720> been<00:01:21.750> told<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
it's what I've been told and so it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.190 
it's what I've been told and so it
should<00:01:23.640> feel<00:01:23.820> slightly<00:01:24.150> different<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.049> let's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
should feel slightly different so let's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.090 
should feel slightly different so let's
just<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.439> first<00:01:25.680> turns<00:01:32.150> umm<00:01:33.590> now<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.860> actually

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
just do first turns umm now it actually

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.300 
just do first turns umm now it actually
feels<00:01:35.490> exactly<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.180> same<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.860> regular<00:01:37.860> Oh

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
feels exactly the same as a regular Oh

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.460 
feels exactly the same as a regular Oh
soo<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.360> can't<00:01:39.689> feel<00:01:39.900> any<00:01:40.079> difference

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
soo I actually can't feel any difference

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.569 
soo I actually can't feel any difference
in<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:43.530> actually<00:01:43.829> feels<00:01:44.009> exactly<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
in this it actually feels exactly the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.090 
in this it actually feels exactly the
same<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.869> transparent<00:01:46.799> blue

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
same I think it's just transparent blue

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.730 
same I think it's just transparent blue
so<00:01:47.490> all<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:49.100> turns<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.369> nice<00:01:50.520> though<00:01:50.759> I

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
so all it is turns really nice though I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.490 
so all it is turns really nice though I
can't<00:01:52.740> solve<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.149> snug<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.180> hard<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
can't solve this snug that hard it's the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.370 
can't solve this snug that hard it's the
same<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.829> 404<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.540> this<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.750> oh<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.140> this

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
same as a 404 really this one oh my this

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.350 
same as a 404 really this one oh my this
one<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.829> much<00:01:59.159> looser<00:01:59.640> than<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> other<00:02:00.240> one

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
one is much looser than the other one

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.289 
one is much looser than the other one
that's<00:02:00.869> probably<00:02:01.140> why<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.320> turns<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.710> good

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
that's probably why it turns so good

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.069 
that's probably why it turns so good
hopefully<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> won't<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.570> any<00:02:03.719> popping

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
hopefully I won't have any popping

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.770 
hopefully I won't have any popping
problems<00:02:04.729> but<00:02:05.729> I'm<00:02:06.030> probably<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
problems but I'm probably just going to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.960 
problems but I'm probably just going to
be<00:02:06.840> solving<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.229> couple<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.500> times

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
be solving this a couple of times

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.749 
be solving this a couple of times
um

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
um

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.390 
um
so<00:02:11.569> yeah<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.140> really<00:02:12.650> cool<00:02:12.830> puzzle<00:02:13.069> it

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
so yeah this is a really cool puzzle it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.030 
so yeah this is a really cool puzzle it
looks<00:02:13.580> really<00:02:13.970> nice<00:02:14.709> change<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.860> color

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
looks really nice change the color

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.610 
looks really nice change the color
scheme<00:02:16.430> but<00:02:17.420> yeah<00:02:17.569> I<00:02:17.870> really<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.319> how<00:02:18.470> this

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
scheme but yeah I really like how this

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.899 
scheme but yeah I really like how this
looks<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.190> looks<00:02:19.370> awesome

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
looks it looks awesome

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.119 
looks it looks awesome
but<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.390> don't<00:02:20.599> know<00:02:20.750> what<00:02:21.560> more<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.769> can<00:02:21.980> really

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.380 
say on this I mean it's really just the
same<00:02:23.989> thing<00:02:24.049> as<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.580> former<00:02:25.580> Fisher<00:02:26.000> Cube<00:02:26.239> it's

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
same thing as a former Fisher Cube it's

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.380 
same thing as a former Fisher Cube it's
just<00:02:26.629> transparent<00:02:27.500> blue<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:28.459> looks<00:02:28.489> really

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
just transparent blue it looks really

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.199 
just transparent blue it looks really
cool<00:02:30.160> it's<00:02:31.160> going<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.340> solve<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.640> same<00:02:31.819> way<00:02:32.000> I

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
cool it's going to solve the same way I

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.729 
cool it's going to solve the same way I
guess<00:02:32.629> what<00:02:32.750> I'll<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:32.870> do<00:02:33.110> now<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.470> just

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
guess what I'll just do now is just

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.680 
guess what I'll just do now is just
scramble<00:02:34.129> it<00:02:34.160> up<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.330> can<00:02:35.420> see<00:02:35.599> what

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
scramble it up just so you can see what

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:44.979 
scramble it up just so you can see what
it<00:02:35.780> looks<00:02:35.900> like<00:02:36.019> all<00:02:36.290> mixed<00:02:36.650> up<00:02:43.629> okay<00:02:44.629> so<00:02:44.690> there

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
it looks like all mixed up okay so there

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.229 
it looks like all mixed up okay so there
we<00:02:45.019> go<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.440> cube<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.769> all<00:02:45.890> scrambled<00:02:46.340> up<00:02:46.489> it

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
we go the cube is all scrambled up it

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.059 
we go the cube is all scrambled up it
looks<00:02:47.450> really<00:02:47.780> cool<00:02:47.989> with<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.470> transparent

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069

looks really cool with the transparent
Ness<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.489> see<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.900> looks<00:02:50.900> really<00:02:51.049> awesome

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
Ness you can see it looks really awesome

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
so that's about it for the ice blue for

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.259 
so that's about it for the ice blue for
