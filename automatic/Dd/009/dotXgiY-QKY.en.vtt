metal belt here that couples this
rotation<00:00:18.050> to<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.710> elbow<00:00:20.420> and<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.439> point

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
rotation to the elbow and at that point

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.160 
rotation to the elbow and at that point
as<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.039> digital<00:00:23.250> encoder<00:00:23.760> that's<00:00:24.689> messed<00:00:25.019> with

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
as a digital encoder that's messed with

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.429 
as a digital encoder that's messed with
the<00:00:25.350> gear<00:00:25.789> to<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> ring<00:00:27.090> here<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:28.050> meshes<00:00:28.260> that

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the gear to a ring here that meshes that

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.659 
the gear to a ring here that meshes that
that<00:00:28.890> angular<00:00:29.250> rotation<00:00:31.189> this<00:00:32.189> gear<00:00:32.550> is

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
that angular rotation this gear is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.850 
that angular rotation this gear is
actually<00:00:32.850> two<00:00:33.329> plate<00:00:33.660> gears<00:00:33.989> coupled

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
actually two plate gears coupled

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.560 
actually two plate gears coupled
together<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> spring<00:00:35.760> spring-loaded

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
together with the spring spring-loaded

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.810 
together with the spring spring-loaded
to<00:00:36.870> help<00:00:37.050> prevent<00:00:37.260> backlash<00:00:37.770> alright<00:00:38.640> now<00:00:38.760> we

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
to help prevent backlash alright now we

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.670 
to help prevent backlash alright now we
can<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> arm<00:00:39.510> move<00:00:40.430> when<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.550> rotated

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
can see the arm move when it's rotated

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.110 
can see the arm move when it's rotated
you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> metal<00:00:44.190> felt<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.760> rolling

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
you can see the metal felt just rolling

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.529 
you can see the metal felt just rolling
along<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.600> ring<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.000> go<00:00:48.059> back<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> other<00:00:48.329> way

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
along a ring and go back the other way

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.100 
along a ring and go back the other way
now<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:50.030> notice<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.120> all<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> cables<00:00:51.750> are

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
now I notice that all the cables are

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.770 
now I notice that all the cables are
just<00:00:52.440> fed<00:00:52.920> through<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:53.430> twist<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
just fed through and they twist as the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360 
just fed through and they twist as the
rotation<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> limited<00:00:55.770> between<00:00:55.890> arranged

slip rings are required and as the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.349 
slip rings are required and as the
shoulder<00:01:01.949> rotates<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> metal

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
