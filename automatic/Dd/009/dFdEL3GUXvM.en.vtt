00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
see this calibrate by the steering ready

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.389 
see this calibrate by the steering ready
like<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> yes<00:00:46.200> please<00:00:46.530> trigger<00:00:47.190> the

like that and yes please trigger the
first<00:00:47.640> time<00:00:50.120> but<00:00:51.120> normally<00:00:51.860> it<00:00:52.860> won't<00:00:53.070> work

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
first time but normally it won't work

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.240 
first time but normally it won't work
and<00:00:54.149> your<00:00:54.420> steering<00:00:54.750> won't<00:00:54.989> work<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and your steering won't work you got a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
and your steering won't work you got a
there's<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> safety<00:00:57.480> feature<00:00:57.629> where<00:00:57.960> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
there's a safety feature where you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.130 
there's a safety feature where you
squeeze<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.859> let<00:00:59.640> go<00:00:59.879> steer<00:01:00.600> left

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
squeeze it all the way let go steer left

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.609 
squeeze it all the way let go steer left
and<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.629> another<00:01:04.500> thing

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and right then you can so another thing

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.840 
and right then you can so another thing
I<00:01:04.890> suggest<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.409> boats<00:01:07.650> talk<00:01:08.130> with

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
I suggest you do is the boats talk with

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.560 
I suggest you do is the boats talk with
the<00:01:09.030> um<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.900> has<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.700> metal<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.420> metal

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the um it has the the metal the metal

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
the um it has the the metal the metal
shaft<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:14.479> it's<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.080> outward<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
shaft right here it's on the outward the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.289 
shaft right here it's on the outward the
outward<00:01:17.490> side<00:01:17.880> focus<00:01:18.810> focus<00:01:19.909> on<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> outward

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
outward side focus focus on the outward

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.679 
outward side focus focus on the outward
outward<00:01:22.140> hold<00:01:22.830> right<00:01:25.490> right<00:01:26.490> around<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.479> on

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
outward hold right right around there on

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.520 
outward hold right right around there on
the<00:01:27.810> outside<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.670> second<00:01:30.570> hole<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the outside on the second hole and that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.100 
the outside on the second hole and that
gives<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> very<00:01:32.100> short<00:01:32.189> steering<00:01:33.090> not<00:01:33.720> too

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
gives you a very short steering not too

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.640 
gives you a very short steering not too
good

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
good

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.560 
good
I<00:01:34.700> moved<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.970> rod<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> inner<00:01:37.670> first<00:01:38.670> hole

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I moved the rod and the inner first hole

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
I moved the rod and the inner first hole
and<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.710> should<00:01:40.920> give<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.460> wide<00:01:41.670> enough

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and that should give you the wide enough

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.060 
and that should give you the wide enough
radius<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.909> mean<00:01:44.909> not<00:01:45.090> wide<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:46.259> tight<00:01:46.770> turn<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
radius I mean not wide a tight turn a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460 
radius I mean not wide a tight turn a
tighter<00:01:47.490> turn<00:01:47.729> which<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> lot<00:01:49.020> better<00:01:49.170> for

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
tighter turn which is a lot better for

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.450 
tighter turn which is a lot better for
this<00:01:49.530> boat<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> does<00:01:50.280> turn<00:01:50.520> wide<00:01:52.460> not

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this boat because it does turn wide not

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.770 
this boat because it does turn wide not
only<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.149> also<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.869> might<00:01:55.020> want<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:56.780> you

and run it into a corner keep it in a

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.640 
and run it into a corner keep it in a
nice<00:02:31.930> corner<00:02:32.380> like<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.959> run<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.530> if

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
nice corner like this and run it and if

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.380 
nice corner like this and run it and if
it<00:02:35.830> stays<00:02:36.069> straight<00:02:36.459> for<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.819> good<00:02:36.970> amount<00:02:37.209> of

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
it stays straight for a good amount of

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:47.930 
it stays straight for a good amount of
time<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:39.550> mine

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.050 

I<00:02:47.970> know<00:02:49.370> off<00:02:50.370> adjustment<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:52.650> want<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.070> do<00:02:53.220> is

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
I know off adjustment you want to do is

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.960 
I know off adjustment you want to do is
flip<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.690> up<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.400> that's<00:02:56.400> your<00:02:56.580> throttle

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
flip it up and that's your throttle

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.700
