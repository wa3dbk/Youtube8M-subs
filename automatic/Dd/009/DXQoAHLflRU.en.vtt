00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.319 
rang up a seven and I was like nope back
there<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:25.010> sign<00:03:25.190> said<00:03:25.400> 60<00:03:25.790> she<00:03:25.850> overrode<00:03:26.180> it

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
there the sign said 60 she overrode it

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.840 
there the sign said 60 she overrode it
and<00:03:26.569> and<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.190> think<00:03:28.280> that's<00:03:28.519> a<00:03:28.579> great<00:03:28.670> deal

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
and and so I think that's a great deal

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.250 
and and so I think that's a great deal
six<00:03:29.060> bucks<00:03:29.299> for<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.510> brand<00:03:29.690> new<00:03:29.780> dress<00:03:30.049> I'm

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
six bucks for a brand new dress I'm

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.629 
six bucks for a brand new dress I'm
probably<00:03:30.410> just<00:03:30.590> gonna<00:03:30.739> put<00:03:31.069> it<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.250> her<00:03:31.340> easter

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.160 
probably just gonna put it in her easter
basket<00:03:32.500> um<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:34.280> then<00:03:34.639> my<00:03:35.030> total<00:03:35.389> came<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.660> like

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
basket um and then my total came to like

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.250 
basket um and then my total came to like
thirty<00:03:37.209> dollars<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.840> won't<00:03:39.139> say

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
thirty dollars and I won't say

ninety-four<00:03:39.709> cents<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.340> seems<00:03:40.549> weird

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
ninety-four cents but that seems weird

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.699 
ninety-four cents but that seems weird
