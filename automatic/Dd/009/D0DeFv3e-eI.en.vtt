to go there and I said you know I've

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.020 
to go there and I said you know I've
never<00:00:13.290> tried<00:00:13.590> out<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.799> corporate<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.340> EOC<00:00:14.820> I

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
never tried out the corporate in EOC I

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.240 
never tried out the corporate in EOC I
don't<00:00:15.509> really<00:00:15.690> know<00:00:15.870> what<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.710> don't

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
don't really know what it's like I don't

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.800 
don't really know what it's like I don't
know<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.760> worth<00:00:17.910> doing<00:00:17.940> or<00:00:18.359> good<00:00:18.539> money

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
know if it's worth doing or good money

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.220 
know if it's worth doing or good money
so<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.619> figured<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.070> might<00:00:20.220> as<00:00:20.279> well<00:00:20.520> try<00:00:20.730> it

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
so I figured I might as well try it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.019 
so I figured I might as well try it
initially<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> went<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.740> royal<00:00:22.980> d'hide<00:00:23.490> because

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
initially I went in royal d'hide because

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.640 
initially I went in royal d'hide because
i<00:00:24.300> was<00:00:24.480> experiencing<00:00:25.050> some<00:00:25.260> network

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
i was experiencing some network

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.800 
i was experiencing some network
connection<00:00:26.279> issues<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.910> after<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> while<00:00:27.750> i

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
connection issues but after a while i

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.689 
connection issues but after a while i
switched<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> gay<00:00:28.560> no<00:00:28.619> because<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.580> has

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
switched to gay no because it has

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.359 
switched to gay no because it has
slightly<00:00:30.000> better<00:00:30.300> defense<00:00:30.980> just<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
slightly better defense just for the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
slightly better defense just for the
corporal<00:00:32.730> beast<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.780> worked<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.079> pretty

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
corporal beast so that worked out pretty

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.110 
corporal beast so that worked out pretty
well<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.739> also<00:00:35.100> i<00:00:35.250> found<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> nice<00:00:35.940> beer

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
well and also i found out as a nice beer

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
well and also i found out as a nice beer

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and a half i really didn't make anything

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.670 
and a half i really didn't make anything
at<00:02:03.180> all<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.780> i<00:02:03.810> wasn't<00:02:04.110> getting<00:02:04.320> any

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680

at all just because i wasn't getting any
drops<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.850> that's<00:02:06.030> how<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.210> goes<00:02:06.509> sometimes

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
drops but that's how it goes sometimes

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.559

you<00:04:37.699> can<00:04:37.939> get<00:04:38.090> about<00:04:38.300> 15<00:04:38.779> kills<00:04:39.020> an<00:04:39.199> hour<00:04:39.319> when

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
you can get about 15 kills an hour when

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.830 
you can get about 15 kills an hour when
you<00:04:40.189> do<00:04:40.340> oh<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.610> is<00:04:40.729> much<00:04:40.939> slower<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.659> of

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
you do oh it is much slower and of

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.089 
you do oh it is much slower and of
course<00:04:42.050> when<00:04:42.169> you<00:04:42.259> have<00:04:42.379> for<00:04:42.560> men<00:04:42.710> it's<00:04:42.860> a<00:04:42.949> bit

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
course when you have for men it's a bit

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.760 
course when you have for men it's a bit
faster<00:04:43.520> but<00:04:44.150> anyway<00:04:44.840> yeah<00:04:45.169> this<00:04:45.439> is<00:04:45.590> all<00:04:45.740> I

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
faster but anyway yeah this is all I

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.980 
faster but anyway yeah this is all I
made<00:04:46.069> it's<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.729> little<00:04:47.120> under<00:04:47.389> 2<00:04:47.569> million<00:04:47.779> our

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
made it's a little under 2 million our

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.010 
made it's a little under 2 million our
as<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:49.099> said<00:04:49.430> earlier<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.819> got<00:04:49.939> literally<00:04:50.659> five

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
as I said earlier I got literally five

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.379 
as I said earlier I got literally five
mil<00:04:51.349> of<00:04:51.529> this<00:04:52.069> in<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.400> first<00:04:52.550> two<00:04:52.819> hours<00:04:52.999> in

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
mil of this in the first two hours in

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.709 
mil of this in the first two hours in
the<00:04:53.539> last<00:04:53.689> hour<00:04:53.900> I<00:04:54.080> got<00:04:54.889> absolutely<00:04:55.400> nothing

the last hour I got absolutely nothing

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:58.629 
the last hour I got absolutely nothing
so<00:04:56.719> I<00:04:56.749> was<00:04:57.110> thinking<00:04:57.169> it<00:04:57.590> was<00:04:57.710> closer<00:04:58.129> to<00:04:58.279> three

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
didn't get drops in the last hour but

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.110 
didn't get drops in the last hour but
anyway<00:05:02.659> yeah<00:05:03.319> I<00:05:03.349> got<00:05:03.680> five<00:05:03.979> point<00:05:04.340> seven<00:05:04.759> mil
