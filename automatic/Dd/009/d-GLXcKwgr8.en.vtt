00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
tips we're going to talk about we

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.179 
tips we're going to talk about we
already<00:00:28.140> talked<00:00:28.349> about<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.650> problem<00:00:29.010> we've

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
already talked about the problem we've

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.890 
already talked about the problem we've
solidified<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.359> now<00:00:30.449> let's<00:00:30.599> look<00:00:30.750> at

solidified that but now let's look at

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.560 
solidified that but now let's look at
tips<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.320> prevent<00:00:31.550> cheering<00:00:32.550> loss<00:00:32.759> Yvonne

it's<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.870> about<00:00:34.140> noise<00:00:34.410> volume<00:00:34.980> control

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
it's all about noise volume control

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.060 
it's all about noise volume control
volume<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> main<00:00:36.719> factor<00:00:37.260> here<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
volume is really the main factor here so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
volume is really the main factor here so
there<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.340> various<00:00:38.370> strategies<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.239> control

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
there are various strategies to control

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.810 
there are various strategies to control
that<00:00:39.809> volume<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.129> simply<00:00:41.460> turn<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that volume one is to simply turn it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.360 
that volume one is to simply turn it
down<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.840> when<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.200> are<00:00:43.260> typically<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.309> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
down know when you are typically in a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.979 
down know when you are typically in a
noisy<00:00:44.760> environment<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:45.300> turn<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.660> turn<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
noisy environment we turn to turn the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.590 
noisy environment we turn to turn the
volume<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.559> when<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.550> transition<00:00:48.180> into<00:00:48.239> quiet

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
volume up when we transition into quiet

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.209 
volume up when we transition into quiet
environment<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.410> should<00:00:49.620> bring<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.829> volume

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
environment we should bring that volume

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.910 
environment we should bring that volume
back<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.140> transition<00:00:52.649> into<00:00:52.680> an

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
back down if we transition into an

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.170 
back down if we transition into an
environment<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.640> other<00:00:53.850> people

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
environment there are other people

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
environment there are other people
speaking<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.780> can't<00:00:55.260> hear<00:00:55.649> them<00:00:55.800> talking

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
speaking if we can't hear them talking

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.209 
speaking if we can't hear them talking
over<00:00:56.489> our<00:00:56.670> iPod<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.780> too<00:00:58.079> loud<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:59.010> show

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
over our iPod that's too loud I can show

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.490 
over our iPod that's too loud I can show
you<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.000> great<00:01:00.149> rule<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.629> thumb<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you that's a great rule of thumb but I

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.130 
you that's a great rule of thumb but I
find<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.949> even<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:03.059> can't<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.899> hear

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
find that even if I can't if I hear

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.080 
find that even if I can't if I hear
someone<00:01:04.350> else<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.799> want<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> tune<00:01:05.189> them<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
someone else I want to tune them out so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
someone else I want to tune them out so
I<00:01:06.119> raise<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> volume<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.320> that's<00:01:07.500> not

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
I raise up the volume and that's not

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.590 
I raise up the volume and that's not
what<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> should<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.490> definitely<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.360> i<00:01:09.390> mean

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
what you should do definitely not i mean

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420 
what you should do definitely not i mean
that's<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.229> factors<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.650> causes

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that's one of the factors that causes

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.039 
that's one of the factors that causes
more<00:01:11.640> impairment<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.240> hearing<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> face

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
more impairment of hearing in the face

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.780 
more impairment of hearing in the face
of<00:01:13.080> other<00:01:13.380> noise<00:01:13.650> whether<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> car

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of other noise whether it's in a car

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.640 
of other noise whether it's in a car
driving<00:01:15.210> around<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> ipod<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.409> the

driving around and the ipod is in the
car<00:01:16.890> noise<00:01:17.220> causing<00:01:17.640> problems<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.479> people

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
car noise causing problems so people

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
car noise causing problems so people
tend<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> turn<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> ipod<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.369> you're

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
tend to turn the ipod on or when you're

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.830 
tend to turn the ipod on or when you're
in<00:01:20.640> an<00:01:20.700> environment<00:01:20.729> where<00:01:21.299> other<00:01:21.479> people<00:01:21.540> are

in an environment where other people are
speaking<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.470> causes<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> greater<00:01:24.119> risk<00:01:24.479> for

speaking it causes the greater risk for

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.359 
speaking it causes the greater risk for
hearing<00:01:25.080> loss<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.710> keep<00:01:25.890> turning<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
hearing loss when we keep turning that

hearing loss when we keep turning that
volume<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.479> talk<00:01:27.659> about<00:01:27.720> limiting

majority of cases are hearing loss is
due<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.030> noise<00:03:52.450> exposure<00:03:52.810> there<00:03:53.470> are<00:03:53.560> other

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
due to noise exposure there are other

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.129 
due to noise exposure there are other
factors<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.549> our<00:03:54.730> genes<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.450> environmental

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
factors like our genes and environmental

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.830 
factors like our genes and environmental
noise<00:03:56.260> we<00:03:56.470> can't<00:03:56.680> do<00:03:56.859> much<00:03:57.040> about<00:03:57.069> but<00:03:58.060> when<00:03:58.660> it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
noise we can't do much about but when it

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.990 
noise we can't do much about but when it
comes<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.230> control<00:03:59.620> with<00:03:59.799> iPods<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.670> things

comes to control with iPods and things

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.150 
comes to control with iPods and things
like<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.239> we<00:04:01.900> can<00:04:02.139> prevent<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:02.769> that's

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
like that we can prevent it and that's

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.789 
like that we can prevent it and that's
the<00:04:03.310> sad<00:04:03.549> part<00:04:03.600> hearing<00:04:04.600> loss<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:05.200> going<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.680> be

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
the sad part hearing loss is going to be

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.740 
the sad part hearing loss is going to be
a<00:04:05.829> major<00:04:06.040> problem<00:04:06.370> for<00:04:06.819> our<00:04:06.880> society<00:04:07.480> if<00:04:07.630> we

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
a major problem for our society if we

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.720 
a major problem for our society if we
don't<00:04:07.959> bring<00:04:08.200> this<00:04:08.380> on<00:04:08.590> your<00:04:08.739> control<00:04:09.130> you
