hopefully<00:01:05.640> minecraft<00:01:06.090> thinks<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.570> way<00:01:06.720> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
hopefully minecraft thinks of a way to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.020 
hopefully minecraft thinks of a way to
tweak<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.710> maybe<00:01:08.340> even<00:01:08.549> bucket<00:01:08.880> should

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
tweak this maybe even bucket should

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.750 
tweak this maybe even bucket should
consider<00:01:09.330> making<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.750> default<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:11.100> op<00:01:11.460> to

chests now if you do use a silk touch
pick<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.140> think<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.650> pretty<00:01:16.770> obvious<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
pick I think it's pretty obvious that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.910 
pick I think it's pretty obvious that
the<00:01:17.460> chest<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:17.970> drop<00:01:18.590> another<00:01:19.590> new<00:01:19.799> addition

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the chest will drop another new addition

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
is the fact that TNT will now pretty

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.950 
is the fact that TNT will now pretty
much<00:01:23.250> blow<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> side<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.390> top<00:01:24.600> it

you what i mean by that so if we like

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.850 
you what i mean by that so if we like
this<00:01:33.360> tnt<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> pretty<00:01:34.409> much<00:01:34.500> stand<00:01:34.770> in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
this tnt here and pretty much stand in

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.580 
this tnt here and pretty much stand in
the<00:01:34.920> middle<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> since<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.729> an<00:01:35.820> entity

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
the middle of it since it's an entity

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.510 
the middle of it since it's an entity
just<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> old<00:01:37.950> versions<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.400> Minecraft

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
just like the old versions of Minecraft

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.969 
just like the old versions of Minecraft
it'll<00:01:39.450> blow<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> sky-high<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:40.860> that's

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it'll blow a sky-high so I think that's

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.350 
it'll blow a sky-high so I think that's
pretty<00:01:41.070> cool<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> good<00:01:41.850> touch<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.210> glad

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
pretty cool it's a good touch I'm glad

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
pretty cool it's a good touch I'm glad
they<00:01:42.450> brought<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.780> back<00:01:43.040> now<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.250> sure

they brought that back now I'm not sure

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
they brought that back now I'm not sure
if<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.450> server<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.810> I'm<00:01:45.869> hosting

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
if it's the the server that I'm hosting

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.960 
if it's the the server that I'm hosting

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
but the TNT does look a little glitchy

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.810 
but the TNT does look a little glitchy
when<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.329> light<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.600> fire<00:01:49.490> yeah<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.759> a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
when you light it on fire yeah just a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.480 
when you light it on fire yeah just a
little<00:01:50.939> bit<00:01:51.380> now<00:01:52.380> dinner<00:01:52.649> bones<00:01:52.890> said<00:01:53.220> he<00:01:53.369> was

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
little bit now dinner bones said he was

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.550 
little bit now dinner bones said he was
working<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> piston<00:01:54.149> glitches<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.810> far<00:01:55.409> as

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
working on the piston glitches as far as

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.870 
working on the piston glitches as far as
if<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.770> stand<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.219> front<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
if you stand right in front of one and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.899 
if you stand right in front of one and
activate<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.780> should<00:01:58.020> push<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.759> but<00:01:59.759> it's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
activate it it should push you but it's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.260 
activate it it should push you but it's
not<00:02:00.030> fixed<00:02:00.329> yet<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.259> tell<00:02:02.270> hopefully

when<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.479> does<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.750> fixed<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.350> probably

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
when it does get fixed we can probably

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
when it does get fixed we can probably
have<00:02:04.740> zipper<00:02:05.009> elevators<00:02:05.460> all<00:02:05.670> over<00:02:05.969> again<00:02:06.180> and
