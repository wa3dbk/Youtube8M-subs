00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
of course there's always the risk of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.149 
of course there's always the risk of
getting<00:01:09.299> smited<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.890> kind<00:01:11.070> of

getting smited but you can kind of

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
getting smited but you can kind of
mitigate<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.670> by<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.970> having<00:01:12.270> enough

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
mitigate that by just having enough

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.240 
mitigate that by just having enough
prior<00:01:12.869> pots<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.470> worst<00:01:13.710> case<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.189> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
prior pots and worst case so now you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.940 
prior pots and worst case so now you
just<00:01:14.369> let<00:01:14.700> yourself<00:01:15.030> die<00:01:15.560> while<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> protect

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
just let yourself die while you protect

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.640 
just let yourself die while you protect
items<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.990> we'll<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.409> deep

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
kind of combine them with sharks to eat

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.680 
kind of combine them with sharks to eat
a<00:03:30.930> little<00:03:31.080> bit<00:03:31.230> faster<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:32.299> amulet<00:03:33.299> of<00:03:33.330> glory<00:03:33.600> is

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
a little bit faster a amulet of glory is

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.240 
a little bit faster a amulet of glory is
great<00:03:33.930> because<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.230> can<00:03:34.350> teleport<00:03:34.920> from<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
great because you can teleport from the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.699 
great because you can teleport from the
30<00:03:35.459> wilderness<00:03:35.970> or<00:03:36.120> below<00:03:36.390> as<00:03:36.959> opposed<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.410> 20

ring<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:38.010> life<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.340> also<00:03:38.519> good<00:03:38.790> i<00:03:38.820> think<00:03:39.090> it

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
ring of life is also good i think it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.020 
ring of life is also good i think it
does<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.480> same<00:03:39.510> thing<00:03:40.190> if<00:03:41.190> you're<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.850> you're

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
does the same thing if you're if you're

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.789 
does the same thing if you're if you're

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
30 wilderness are below it will teleport

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.210 
30 wilderness are below it will teleport
you<00:03:44.010> when<00:03:44.250> you're<00:03:44.370> almost<00:03:44.519> dying<00:03:45.110> if<00:03:46.110> if<00:03:46.980> its

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
you when you're almost dying if if its

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.069 
you when you're almost dying if if its
twenty<00:03:47.430> or<00:03:47.700> below<00:03:47.910> i'll<00:03:48.150> stand<00:03:48.480> corrected<00:03:48.959> on

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
twenty or below i'll stand corrected on

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.720 
twenty or below i'll stand corrected on
that<00:03:49.470> but<00:03:49.620> i'm<00:03:49.680> pretty<00:03:49.829> sure<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.160> does<00:03:50.340> work<00:03:50.579> up

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
that but i'm pretty sure it does work up

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.970 
that but i'm pretty sure it does work up
to<00:03:50.760> 30<00:03:51.150> um<00:03:51.570> but<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.410> always<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.650> good<00:03:52.799> thing<00:03:52.860> to

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
to 30 um but it's always a good thing to

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.310 
to 30 um but it's always a good thing to
have<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.940> can<00:03:54.120> use<00:03:54.239> any<00:03:54.420> combat<00:03:54.870> style<00:03:55.230> you

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
have you can use any combat style you

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.930 
have you can use any combat style you
want<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.829> see<00:03:55.980> like<00:03:56.130> in<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:56.430> setup<00:03:56.670> i'm

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
want is to see like in this setup i'm

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.990 
want is to see like in this setup i'm
using<00:03:57.299> melee<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.530> ranged<00:03:58.730> i<00:03:59.730> would<00:03:59.850> probably

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
using melee and ranged i would probably

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.600 
using melee and ranged i would probably
actually<00:04:00.269> just<00:04:00.600> skip<00:04:00.840> out<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.049> the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
actually just skip out on the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.949 
actually just skip out on the
accumulator<00:04:02.610> just<00:04:03.000> because<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.510> team<00:04:03.720> Kate

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
accumulator just because the team Kate

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.289 
accumulator just because the team Kate
but<00:04:04.620> range<00:04:05.160> with<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.400> magic<00:04:05.760> short<00:04:05.970> bow<00:04:06.120> or

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
but range with the magic short bow or

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.530 
but range with the magic short bow or
something<00:04:06.510> like<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.630> is<00:04:06.870> very<00:04:07.049> good<00:04:07.140> as<00:04:07.470> well

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
something like that is very good as well

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.180 
something like that is very good as well
so<00:04:09.540> we'll<00:04:10.260> probably<00:04:10.500> be<00:04:10.680> going<00:04:10.890> deep

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
so we'll probably be going deep

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.420 
so we'll probably be going deep
wilderness<00:04:11.930> if<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.290> go<00:04:13.440> here<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.950> edge<00:04:14.070> to

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
chat so it'll be like okay attack that

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.480 
chat so it'll be like okay attack that
noob<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:38.960> then<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.560> guys<00:04:39.710> will<00:04:39.980> know<00:04:40.190> who<00:04:40.400> to

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
noob and then you guys will know who to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.520 
noob and then you guys will know who to
attack<00:04:40.790> like<00:04:41.389> I<00:04:41.419> said<00:04:41.600> I've<00:04:41.810> never<00:04:41.930> hosted<00:04:42.169> one

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
attack like I said I've never hosted one

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.780 
attack like I said I've never hosted one
of<00:04:42.620> these<00:04:42.710> before<00:04:42.860> so<00:04:43.310> it's<00:04:43.460> going<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.669> be<00:04:43.760> a

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
of these before so it's going to be a

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.480 
of these before so it's going to be a
little<00:04:43.970> bit<00:04:44.150> of<00:04:44.270> an<00:04:44.389> experiment<00:04:44.960> but<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:46.010> think

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
little bit of an experiment but I think

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.550 
little bit of an experiment but I think
it<00:04:46.550> should<00:04:46.669> be<00:04:46.730> a<00:04:46.820> lot<00:04:46.910> of<00:04:47.030> fun<00:04:47.200> anyway<00:04:48.200> so<00:04:48.260> i'll

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
it should be a lot of fun anyway so i'll

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.860 
it should be a lot of fun anyway so i'll
be<00:04:48.710> getting<00:04:48.919> 99<00:04:49.610> magic<00:04:50.270> probably<00:04:50.660> around<00:04:50.750> a

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
be getting 99 magic probably around a

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.230 
be getting 99 magic probably around a
half<00:04:51.110> hour<00:04:51.320> before<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.860> event<00:04:52.100> just<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.820> do<00:04:53.090> it

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
half hour before the event just to do it

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.510 
half hour before the event just to do it
first<00:04:53.480> at<00:04:54.200> probably<00:04:54.650> around<00:04:54.740> three<00:04:55.070> thirty<00:04:55.310> if

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
first at probably around three thirty if

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.340 
first at probably around three thirty if
you<00:04:55.610> guys<00:04:55.760> want<00:04:56.030> to<00:04:56.090> predict<00:04:56.570> participate<00:04:57.260> in
