Z<00:00:19.730> we're<00:00:20.730> covering<00:00:20.970> three<00:00:21.210> crucial<00:00:21.449> steps<00:00:21.840> in

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
Z we're covering three crucial steps in

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.109 
Z we're covering three crucial steps in
its<00:00:22.140> video<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.830> first<00:00:23.070> step<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.670> create<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
its video the first step is to create a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.090 
its video the first step is to create a
gamer<00:00:24.420> profile<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.320> me<00:00:25.470> gain<00:00:25.740> profile

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
gamer profile this is me gain profile

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.939 
gamer profile this is me gain profile
with<00:00:26.699> correct<00:00:27.000> settings<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:28.380> second<00:00:28.650> step<00:00:28.800> is

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
with correct settings the second step is

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.179 
with correct settings the second step is
to<00:00:28.980> program<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.519> buns<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.590> lastly<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.920> start

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
to program the buns and lastly we start

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.410 
to program the buns and lastly we start

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
make sure that the gain profile is

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.250 
make sure that the gain profile is
pointing<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> right<00:01:14.820> executable<00:01:15.510> test

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
pointing to the right executable test

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.219 
pointing to the right executable test
manager<00:01:16.710> sees<00:01:17.280> exactly<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:18.229> executable

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
manager sees exactly which executable

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.770 
manager sees exactly which executable
edits<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.320> case<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.740> bf4<00:01:23.369> e<00:01:23.610> dot<00:01:24.509> exe
