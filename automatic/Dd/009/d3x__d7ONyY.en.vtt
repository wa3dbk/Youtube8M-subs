00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.180
 one of the controversial issues in 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.250
 last dates has been the ciclovía in 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.410
 first stay cyclists feel 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.719
 that their rights are not respected that 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.670
 motorists do not respect it, not the 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.529
 they care and on the other hand 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.230
 motorists say that spending on 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.080
 the bike path simply is not feasible 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.340
 I was not made to tepic this is the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.320
 report that the unai team today 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.720
 television line has you going to 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.430
 see the project of the bike path over 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.590
 the avenue mexico and the boulevard tepic 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.750
 xalisco apparently has not paid off 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.969
 that was expected because there is a nuisance 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.280
 constantly by cyclists 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.870
 who in many cases are not 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.399
 respected today is a shared lane 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.350
 I feel it is a good project only 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.309
 that is not well planned because it is in 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.049
 an area in which there would be 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.699
 I think cars park and that's not 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.960
 he should be fine hear what it means 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.909
 for you to park in this 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.979
 space a lack of respect more than 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.780
 nothing inhibits that this area 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.969
 for cyclists and football players 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.100
 have motorists respect for their 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.170
 part state that there are no places in 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.570
 where to park and feel 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.850
 invaded to take a lane though 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.549
 many recognize that they are parking 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.549
 It's wrong but they have no other 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.049
 What are you doing here? 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.700
 sir is for a person I think 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.369
 right that the bike path is here 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.229
 could the other place if I would put it in 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.630
 another place too and I would also put 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.289
 in another place I also nobody likes it 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.570
 hand there I would not know how to say I think that 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.040
 so that all this there are places 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.020
 there are no parks there 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.080
 the investment in this objective was 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.000
 almost 4 million pesos however 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.560
 there were voices that disagreed on 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.690
 the development of this alternative way 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.090
 as is the case of javier naya beard 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.590
 alderman by the ecologist green party 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.960
 in the current capital administration 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.590
 who claims that the idea would have been 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.780
 better on the avenue allende 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.650
 unfortunately you do not have that good 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.410
 education to take the step 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.360
 that the main step is first those 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.240
 pedestrians and secondly the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.750
 cyclists that is not being met as 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.750
 better also the area where the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.820
 ciclovía is not ideal because they are areas 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.650
 of a lot of traffic since I started the 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.520
 theme of the ciclovía 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.590
 I proposed in my proposal was 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.330
 We make all the beyond could 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.790
 have an excellent bike path for the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.740
 going because there are four lanes there if 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.200
 we force them to no longer park in a 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.340
 in one of those lanes and there 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.770
 we could have this a bike path 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.120
 quite long on his part johnny see 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.640
 secretaries of public works of 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.200
 city ​​council affirms that tepic 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.540
 It is a city that meets the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.600
 conditions to be able to develop this 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.600
 project in shape however recognizes 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.850
 that there is resistance but a lot of interest and 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.310
 that the placement of this route is for a 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.410
 point in convergence we decided to give 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.730
 together with the cycling groups and the 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.430
 citizens 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.560
 do this work on this avenue in 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.860
 particular because it is a point of interest 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.930
 it is a very important road crosses from side 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.330
 next to the center of tepic the cities 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.879
 grow is to endow the infrastructure 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.910
 necessary we have seen it 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.489
 there is even resistance but a lot 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.920
 interest as the time it started in the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.390
 crude the crosses of one and one that the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.220
 true that people never had them 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.370
 known but after they are 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.409
 informed they were told what it was about 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.780
 and what if they knew the truth that 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.690
 even on streets that are no longer between 1 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.120
 and 1 people are careful to stand 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.489
 to avoid an accident if what is 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.890
 true is that the regulation of this way 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.620
 in particular so far it has not 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.569
 been approved by the town council and therefore 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.359
 the agents belonging to the police 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.819
 road only make suggestions to the 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.980
 motorists and cyclists although it is 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.769
 complicated because in tepic you have the 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.260
 bad habit of parking online 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.750
 yellow good this lane is 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.690
 exclusively for the cyclist the same 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.880
 regulation is marked by the two bicycles 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.789
 they should walk on their extreme right 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.400
 and they give with their properly also 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.830
 protected with his safety helmet 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.729
 only bicycles and public service 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.010
 of public service nothing else has its 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:31.530
 access to climb and descend 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.710
 passage preferably carry the 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.760
 bicycle preference in time 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.310
 exclusively for cyclists are not 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.460
 for tricycles, skateboards and scooters 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.190
 nor strollers except that some 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.580
 organization or someone request a 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.500
 event of some cyclist compassion will 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.020
 they would allow it is in that aspect but 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.240
 just as it was regulated it must be 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.510
 ie only cyclists vehicles 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.840
 two wheels do not tricycle a motorcycle 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.849
 no scooters no gentlemen who are pushing 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.430
 The cart by eder sellers is 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.770
 exclusively for the cyclist 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.990
 they hold us a little bit in what comes out 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.090
 the regulation to be able to apply what 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.430
 that are the motorists who have their 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.590
 preferred lane for them and also 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.140
 recommend that they use their helmet 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.640
 security on your part and take out of the 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.250
 cyclist and belonging to the collective 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.370
 tepic by bike shows his posture in front 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.770
 to this situation it is clear to park 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.020
 on Mexico Avenue is something that is not 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:35.520
 it must happen but it happens and nobody says anything 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.820
 remember that avenue of mexico by 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.430
 the two sides can not be parked 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.190
 and you know and can contact him or 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.140
 contact everyone that that seems like a 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.050
 public parking everywhere 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.630
 and nobody either the authorities or the 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.220
 citizens we say something because because it 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.200
 has made a tradition has made a 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.600
 custom that this rum is wrong and 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.880
 so what do you think if we are removing 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.530
 those cars that should not be there and 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.180
 we are sharing the lane because no 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.420
 it is taking away no one is being 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.000
 then sharing myself I like 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.250
 the idea that it's something 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.510
 shared so that to encourage that 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.460
 dialogue that we have always searched for 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.380
 because we do not seek confrontation 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.360
 we look for a dialogue and I think what 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.940
 we are achieving the answers are 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.550
 found valid and respectable according to 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.900
