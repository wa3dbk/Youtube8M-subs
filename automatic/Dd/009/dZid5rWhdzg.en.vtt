00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 and welcome people , welcome more videos 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.509
 daniel place a great friday all 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.509
 and let's start to reduce interest 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.980
 We started with the gun and it gives me lots of 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.779
 passive action tools 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.090
 this weapon increases the speed of 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.279
 movement and has a light trigger and the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.440
 Radar stays active while you watch 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.210
 with this area the positive sides of this 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.000
 area is the following channel has a good 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.980
 cadence and ethics is very high because 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.080
 the debater 42 generally having 27 to 30 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.870
 November is very good and she has 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.460
 the higher the reload speed of the game 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.220
 speaking then the positive points she 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.430
 has an excellent rate 42 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.070
 other batters have type 3027 one thing 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.720
 so then compared to them is a type 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.790
 much higher it has the greater 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.100
 loading speed available in game 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.840
 then we should use a tank from another 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.149
 item that further increases the need for 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.220
 recharge of the beater spindle that it has 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.869
 notion of good very fast she has not 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.700
 great stability but a little bit 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.520
 playing with it already often with this 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.930
 cadence and hers and it is something that gives 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.180
 to quietly control your 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.220
 liabilities is something positive and negative at 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.369
 same time to think that it is 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.450
 directly the pv because the serve in pv 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.369
 I do not think abdo to see the radar and such 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.790
 I already talked about this with other items 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.350
 also in pv pp is very useful because 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.150
 here the rights will always knowing that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.280
 Your friends and batter's gonna want to. 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.100
 get kind of long distance say 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.470
 so you want to get the guys 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.840
 in there passing by and such 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.340
 then if an enemy comes to you there by 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.930
 Your side will know everything. 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.240
 able to move around better up to 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.549
 better to turn the day buying face 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.890
 behind the goal kill the guy and such 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.140
 so pro pv pp is very important more 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.780
 pro pv leaves much to be desired and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.939
 You can leave one side calls will indicate 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.070
 that their impact really 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.509
 down to other scouts face 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.149
 really it makes a lot of difference 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.670
 because you are accustomed and protective of a 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.060
 big impact to play knoc beck 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.670
 such amac the beck is also all 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.890
 I could attack the bank away with him 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.810
 maybe that's not how long it takes 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.760
 little closer is an item with and at 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.590
 at the same time it is not unique 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.050
 the exotic debaters you have in the game 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.930
 for now then for the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.090
 the senators get the tip to buy it 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.810
 there is in my opinion guy has a son of 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.340
 batter side bangs it explodes 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.050
 opponent if headshot and at the same time 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.050
 chantilly city time increases 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.640
 recharge rate is a very important sector 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.730
 well I do not remember his name now 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.740
 there but take a look there and if it is 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.030
 to analyze when they put the episode has 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.270
 who see that he will take the opportunity 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.280
 to put others and then it is always 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.310
 important to analyze well the weapons 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.860
 choose to put and in your 7 and type 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.290
 a gauntlet and named from the ruin of their 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.780
 passive are heavy ammunition appears with 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.540
 more frequency contains more bullets in 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.360
 each apparition deals damage with the attack 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.000
 melee reduces the waiting time of the 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.290
 grenade and higher speed recharge with 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.150
 special weapons 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.250
 it comes with 98 possible forces 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.530
 work very well together to cause 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.700
 damage to melee reduce time 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.560
 waiting for the grenade is something very 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.820
 for an item that comes with power 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.160
 and swap more heavy ammunition and she gives you 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.470
 more bullets every time troops from there 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.840
 guys doubles the amount of bullet then 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.640
 ousted out a machine gun as the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.070
 For example thunder is a great 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.260
 quito machine gun goes practically 60 and 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.900
 bullet for her to have arrived where she thinks 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.550
 very fuck and greater speed of Ricardo 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.500
 Special guilherme also combines a lot 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.360
 well and 7 for those who like to play more 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.150
 offensive and maybe he has some 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.090
 time of the game in a non-weekly type in the 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.730
 third that you can not pretend giving 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.230
 because you die with a rhythm myllyla and 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.780
 comes close to Cairo for punch 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.209
 in it there to reduce the time of the grenade 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.250
 and dies then is not very useful but 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.730
 General is expensive but he can also stop 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.950
 think you can switch between 11 and 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.900
 My opinion is a great item for you. 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.660
 tan I highly recommend using this maneuver 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.580
 and remembering heavy pavel ammo and 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.859
 more quantity each time troops well 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.270
 best in pv is from pp and now it needs neither 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.910
 comment something like this 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.540
 and who of Randers illinois acre O 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.870
 fire 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.380
 he comes with 94 discipline to his 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.910
 maximum and between 1 130 per indiscipline 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.880
 their liabilities are increases of 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.490
 throwing distance from the grenade to the weapon 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.300
 No additional firing by one 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.580
 and more super peace energy by grenades 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.830
 is an item that all possible of it 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.639
 work very well with each other in my 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.919
 opinion and opinion of zico 99.9 per 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.419
 cent of the players the best is a good one for 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.639
 be used with the first class of the 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.410
 ranking because it is about possible to 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.660
 because it has more discipline than 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.370
 then depute to drop more grenade and 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.889
 of will have an increase of the distance 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.500
 grenade and will gain more super energy 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.120
 by low with grenades and IstoÃ‰ but 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.430
 Benedict is going to have a shot, said ronaldo. 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.259
 It's going to take four shots in your surprise. 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.060
 and it was something that would achieve a lot 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.190
 I really need to give a little one 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.840
 slightly longer distance in the purchase of 4 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.949
 the second class which is a more 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.500
 close and such 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.599
 so all possible work very 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.630
 well the latter possible it is also a 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.550
 add shot the guy is very light fuck 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.280
 who has an additional shot at his super is 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.289
 so good at pv while at pv pt at 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.449
 event can put that pass there that 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.470
 gives explode the bug gives more years than 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.729
 are around but on pv pp almost always 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.550
 type a regional shot results in a 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.190
 burn more because it's a map shot o 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.039
 Face understands arcane is his name and 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.680
 obsidian mind as it comes with type 66 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.539
 maximum effort there up to 1 77 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.060
 we get next increase the 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:00.370
 throwing distance of super grenade 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.360
 increased energy obtained by killing two 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.219
 rooms of darkness and bass as a new 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.469
 reduce the waiting time of your next 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.210
 new pump is a is fully focused 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:12.280
 Arcane First Class This Grips 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.360
 lows as the super vassals of the 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.340
 shit really guy kind loads a lot 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.180
 fast and I'm super energy card tu 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.069
 think it will in some missions to the moon type 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.750
 Croton where he had hell to power 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.490
 to use in the supercar will practically 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.310
 use all the time is connected 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.380
 the first class of the arcane and to do 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.419
 to emissions that have enough but there is a 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.580
 truce in my opinion a great ball 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:40.449
 is an exotic few of the best until 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.789
 even though it is not for us the darkness 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.340
 because she's really going to race 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.860
 as something faster but of course everything 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.540
 rest is focused to kill you the deliveries 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.610
 can generate a lot then 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.680
 do not waste a passive so it's good 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.020
 have it so you can switch between others 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.910
 that you like to use and also marking 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.010
 it always has an incredible variety of 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.560
 skills him in his items 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.480
 exotic and then lots of choice to use 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.110
 so you have to see a lot of your style 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.690
 game 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.640
 The time to buy the item or not use 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.860
 brought back heavy-duty ammunition again 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.210
 then all the coins of these 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.460
 and for those who are thinking of buying a 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.920
 Titan New I Bought A Great Episode 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.900
 there because the item may come to 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.550
 You do not have to spend your coins. 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.100
 so I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.320
