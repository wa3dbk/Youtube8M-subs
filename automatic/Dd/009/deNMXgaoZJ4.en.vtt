00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 the spotted coat and its crosses 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.740
 Now yes genetics explains that 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.750
 Different paths allow 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.550
 stained animals 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.620
 we must first understand that 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.199
 hereditary characteristics are 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.410
 transmitted through the genes that can 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.970
 be dominant or recessive the way 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.789
 biano is dominant 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.710
 there is no biannual way in animals 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.269
 of solid hair in the capital ot table 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.030
 today is dominant and the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.219
 low to recessive when the load 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 genetics carries an indicated genius 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.930
 we call a heterozygote now if the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.800
 individual carrying two dominant genes 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.500
 is known as the goto guarantee musician 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.250
 biano product so that there is a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.699
 tubal individual the father to mother one of them 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.710
 carlos alberto has sectoral scholar 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.719
 fur topic explains that when 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.030
 crossing a tubal 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.660
 homozygous with the animal of any 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.760
 coat will surely be born a product 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.340
 bian 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.390
 when the crossing is made between 29 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.290
 the chances are also heterozygous 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.710
 significant 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.450
 if the two are Gothic hetero, you do not have a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 other dominant genius you do not have 75% 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.440
 chance to be a tubal 25% chance 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.900
 from seattle biano August 11 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.710
 that is, they have the two dominant genes and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.270
 25% of the solid carries the gene 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.990
 animal that is not a problem 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.490
 already if the crossing was of 1 tubiano 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.600
 heterozygote and an animal with solid hair 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 the chance drops to 50% in the case of sheep 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.720
 and dredged is more difficult to predict 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.700
 crossing result 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.870
 not necessarily countries need 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.330
 be heard 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.930
 that is to say there may be a government that 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.690
 carries only the gem it manifests itself in the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:09.390
 product he is a carrier 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:13.170
 This is based on the theory that the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.090
 the beginning of lime defends Carlos 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.150
 Alberto emphasizes that in the case of 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.650
 sheep even the authors of envy 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.480
 on some issues 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:29.489
 one thing is sure the virus as sewage 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.120
 dies with the disease called lethal white 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.920
 here is a disease that gives atresia 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.489
 bowel which is a 13 and have a sign that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.860
 part of a singular fine has received the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.410
 see the mogi goto moro then all 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.660
 governments are Gothic hetero 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.090
 Carlos Alberto explains that when crossing 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.900
 two workers the chances of producing a 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.620
 animal with the same coat is 50% 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.470
 but attention this crossing brings 25% of 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.200
 risk that the foal is born with this disease 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.269
 therefore the ideal is to cross the animal the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.450
 solid earl sailboat 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.209
 in this case the creator also has 50% 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.790
 chance to produce a foal came but not 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.340
 there is a risk that he may have 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.340
 in the case of dredging the logic is the same
