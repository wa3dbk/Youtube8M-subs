00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.980
 hi everyone so today we 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.049
 finds herself for a new small 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.279
 video discovery so this video is going to get 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.779
 unfold in three parts so first 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.820
 part I just did you 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.230
 so presented the crafter is theirs 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.340
 second part so I'll go you go 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.540
 simply be able to see a 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.980
 demonstration of their movies and in 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.720
 fishing action and in the last 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.769
 part as usual you can 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.539
 see so an age where their son but in 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.500
 a pool so today we are 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.390
 really very happy about you 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.860
 introduce this little French crafter so 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.120
 it's about m aircraft that in addition 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.800
 really lives towards us so the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.690
 side of narbonne and at the level of lure 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.190
 so this is the mrc tic mosquito 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.809
 to stigmatize so the very big 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.760
 particularity of this lure actually 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.379
 it was a ch'ti gbagbo armed with a 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.489
 texan hook so I'm still going 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.440
 directly so you talk about 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.820
 specifications of them so that's when 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.140
 that it is ten centimeters for 15 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.920
 grams and so at the price level so 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.210
 it's 10 euros 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.260
 so I'll go back now 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.000
 so the time more closely for you 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.840
 can see how it looks so 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.309
 when I wanted to say first 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.170
 particularity so it's a soft stigma 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.190
 so obviously you can just the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.050
 twist in every way there is no 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.190
 concerns about the material to know 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.600
 separately the matter in their soup 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.460
 it's more of a mix between 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.509
 flexible and hard so on that side there 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.680
 is really happening also at the level of the 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.539
 their second resistance 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.440
 particularity so this is the texan motion 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.450
 which is simply going to make you 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.649
 allow to go anywhere and so 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.759
 then at the level of balancing and 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.380
 pain sore to know that there is a 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.750
 little lead here is so a little lead 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.679
 here too, which I did not tell you 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.630
 they actually simply sold 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.890
 mount simply so mounted with 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.000
 the texan hook is therefore leaded 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.679
 directly there is no problem the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.880
 their actually is sold like that so 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.800
 now at the level of colors like 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.149
 to sell it in front of me I have 4 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.170
 so there was really some color 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.830
 whose care with a color of your choice 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.179
 two-tone 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.349
 so be aware that if you ever have 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.099
 really a particular request that 

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:38.270
 really wanted a color in 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.349
 do not hesitate to ask him 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.940
 he can just do it to you 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.869
 on request and at the finish 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.369
 me as you could see it's 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.660
 really great finished well it's more 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.830
 really the little reminder of the eyes in front of 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.060
 which will just make you 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.739
 allow even long-distance jorat 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.360
 50 60 m or simply to be able to see 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.530
 your silhouette with each animation seen 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.509
 that they are small holographic that 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.619
 really sees herself from far away so 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.580
 now at the fish level if he 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.509
 and so you have to know that since it's a 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.890
 stigma it's okay that's it 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.300
 simply to all types of cards as well 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.800
 what is likely to rise on 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.420
 ch'ti bike so pike perch 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.289
 of the bass black bass so that's it 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 really no worry of the moment that 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.289
 it's a predator that can ride on 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.060
 a wade style you can use 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.679
 this lure then has it at the level of 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.000
 the animation you doubt it will be everything 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.860
 just the same animation as on a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.420
 classic stigma whose casting is hard 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.530
 so that 's walking the dog 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.580
 very small shots in the can and to 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.690
 every little bit in the vote goes their 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.050
 from right to left and do this 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.940
 famous 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.780
 10 wake so just before actually 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.010
 switch to benefits and 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.600
 disadvantages simply in fact if 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.800
 you never like this lure and so that 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.120
 you want to buy some actually I you 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.160
 will put in the description on the video 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.970
 so the facebook link of m aircraft 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.590
 so is it simply if they wanted 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.820
 to make an order it is enough for you 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.660
 send them a little private message on 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.980
 his Facebook 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.120
 so for the benefits and the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.260
 disadvantages so first benefit 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.850
 it's really actually the concept of 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.280
 actually does them to have made a 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.840
 stigma eventful in texan so he goes 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.490
 simply did you allow yourself 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.510
 to really move anywhere so 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.770
 that's if you 're really a big guy 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.210
 herbaria called the feast of 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.040
 green bean you throw it throw you 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.360
 your just thank you 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.100
 can pass without hanging 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.240
 second big advantage so it's okay 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.680
 really be actually swimming theirs 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.090
 so you will see losing the last 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.190
 part of their swimming really great 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.330
 and so the last benefit that too 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.440
 who really bluffed us with the debt 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.880
 it's really the distance to throw 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.350
 simply in fact it's one of 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.090
 theirs that we own that launches 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.740
 really the farthest to be seen that 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.150
 theirs is really very aerodynamic 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.660
 theirs really starts a distance 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.310
 crazy 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.450
 at the level of the disadvantages frankly 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.590
 I do not really see that one 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.930
 found directly for the second and 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.790
 the third part oh well go it's 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.200
 party we will put the mr stick home 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.670
 mr kraft to the test 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.250
 so as you see in front of me there is 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.110
 really a herbarium really really 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.230
 very thick we will never go to another 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.850
 thing with texan lures so the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.630
 particularity of it stastics 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.470
 beit in texan up very soft he launches 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:42.650
 very well that playing very up 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:45.680
 in the herbarium the tacc it comes alive very 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.090
 very good flight king of the dogs and hop 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.950
 in the herbarium decor and me you go 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.320
 with any other stupid type with 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.090
 guts it's unpayable your lure 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.120
 it will not be fished is the same at the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.290
 out of the herbarium boom theirs is 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.290
 very very naughty 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.310
 m
