 best-selling books in your niche 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.969
 market or in your specialty you 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.980
 you imagine how the perception of 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.739
 the people if it were announced that 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.169

 what happens in your environment and in your 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.729
 frame of reference I would be thinking 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.949
 the people who would be thinking your 

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:29.949
 partners your friends your potentials 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.749

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.809
 a conversation about a topic of a 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.910
 book that you have written to all 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.000
 writers are also considered a 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.980
 authority do you think there are more ways to 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.800
 take advantage of the fact that you are 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.870
 writer and that you are also on the list 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.480
 of the best sellers in your niche 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.179
 market you think would be worth entering 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.000
 in a 21-day process to accelerate 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.650
 your success through this process 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.990
 writers know that you also 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.030
 experts call my name is edgardo 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.020
 Brunette and I'm here to share you 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.489
 a story 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.010
 five years ago when I entered the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.770
 network marketing industry I already 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.810
 he was a journalist he was celebrating 25 years 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.670
 by profession but I had never written a 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.320
 book at that time follow the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.229
 indications that one of my mentors gave 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.619
 and I wrote this unhappy book with the 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.050
 mediocrity a book of 50 pages but 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.360
 these 50 pages made me enter 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.710
 through the big door in the industry and 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.899
 in the company in which I was 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.940
 working because people were referring to 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.160
 me not only by my name but 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.619
 also because of my profession and because it was 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.540
 writer of books at that time not 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.660
 there was the technology that exists today 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.259
 to become a best seller in 21 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.940
 days imagine how powerful this is 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.860
 two stories that call me a lot 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.600
 the attention in the bible there is a 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.910
 parable that perhaps you have heard the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.619
 parable of the talents and there is another very 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.530
 similar that is called the parable of the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.810
 mines in the parable of the talents 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.180
 says he left the master and gave him money 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.750
 the talents was equivalent to the salary of a 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.120
 year 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.070
 I leave it to one I leave 10 to the other 5 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.020
 the other I leave 1 and maybe you've heard 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.470
 the story that when the return to 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.050
 ask for accounts the 10 had done 10 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.080
 more I had 20 the 5 had won 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.490
 5 more already had their talents the ones 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.010
 resources that he had given him he had 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.370
 duplicated and there was one that did nothing 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.440
 with talent but he hid it 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.750
 there is another parable very similar 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.780
 called the parable of the mines in this 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.150
 case they were left with 10 mines five mines and 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.560
 a mine what is the difference that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.350
 although the results were the same 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.420
 the one who had ten doubled the one 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.120
 had five also doubled it and the one that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.940
 had one hid him these are not you 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.489
 gave more resources to this was given admin 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.050
 administration about cities what is the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.630
 difference that one was given resources 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.360
 and these others were given influence 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.310
 about the cities for me every person 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.650
 who has a leadership is a person of 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.140
 influence that can also be 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.480
 turn into administrative resources or 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.280
 financially so I have to already 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.530
 whether you have a financial influence 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.840
 or an influence on people 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.270
 you should take advantage if you have a gift 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.340
 or a talent to write people 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.800
 successful does that manage well the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.350
 resources and manages its influence well 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.480
 if you have a specialty if you 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.520
 You have a message to share if you 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.680
 you have something in your mind or in your heart 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.470
 what would you like to share what can you 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.739
 do through a book like I tell you 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.959
 There is now technology systems 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.060
 so you do not worry about being a 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.980
 writer many times when we think 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.959
 that is a writer we think of a 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.820
 machine write on a computer a 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.860
 dark room and hours and hours 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.350
 endless I want to tell you that 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.269
 we have a system for you 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.610
 book is finished in the first 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.269

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.080
 in seven days your book is ready and 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.819
 other days the other fourteen are going to 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.010
 devote to prepare the whole strategy of 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.440
 marketing and launching so that 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.600
 within 21 days you can be a 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.510
 authority that is throwing to the world 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.360
 whole a new book in digital version 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.610
 or in a printed version I can 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.790
 show so many examples of person 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.430
 is that they have left the anonymity and have 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.580
 placed in the positions of more 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.620
 influence through that through 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.560
 a book people do not care if it's 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.840
 a 50 page book of 200 pages the 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.910
 people will give you the courage because you've 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.220
 had the time the dedication in the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.580
 discipline to administer it to be able to 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.650
 produce a book the problem is that in 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.080
 place most people are 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.120
 thinking that they can not write no 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.550
