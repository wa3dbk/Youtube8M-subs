00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.050 
and before my workout today is a rest
day<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.689> carbohydrates<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.890> am<00:01:55.950> taking<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.880> much

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
day so carbohydrates I am taking so much

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.260 
day so carbohydrates I am taking so much
I<00:01:57.329> mean<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.530> carbohydrates<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.460> amount<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
I mean the carbohydrates the amount of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.850 
I mean the carbohydrates the amount of
carbohydrate<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.840> I'm<00:02:01.140> taking<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.649> very

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
carbohydrate that I'm taking is very

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.030 
carbohydrate that I'm taking is very
less<00:02:02.009> today<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.270> working<00:02:03.630> days

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
less today but on the working days

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.840 
less today but on the working days
training<00:02:05.040> days<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> will<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.490> little<00:02:05.729> bit

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
training days it will be little bit

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.639 
training days it will be little bit
higher<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> protein<00:02:07.170> will<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.439> same

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
higher but the protein will be same

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.270 
higher but the protein will be same
throughout<00:02:07.979> their<00:02:08.310> transformations

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
throughout their transformations

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.370 
throughout their transformations
lots<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.119> protein<00:02:10.330> here<00:02:10.660> I'm<00:02:10.840> getting<00:02:11.020> around

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
lots of protein here I'm getting around

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.980 
lots of protein here I'm getting around
40<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.830> 45<00:02:12.280> or<00:02:12.670> maybe<00:02:12.970> 50<00:02:13.270> grams<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.690> protein

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
40 to 45 or maybe 50 grams of protein

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.950 
40 to 45 or maybe 50 grams of protein
for<00:02:14.170> each<00:02:14.290> meal<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.490> 13<00:02:15.850> egg<00:02:15.970> whites<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.510> brown

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
for each meal so 13 egg whites and brown

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.520 
for each meal so 13 egg whites and brown
rice<00:02:16.990> I'll<00:02:17.560> get<00:02:17.740> around<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.460> think<00:02:19.240> maybe<00:02:19.530> 25

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
rice I'll get around I think maybe 25

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.040 
rice I'll get around I think maybe 25
grams<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:21.010> carbohydrates<00:02:21.670> here<00:02:21.880> I'm<00:02:22.720> not<00:02:23.020> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
grams of carbohydrates here I'm not a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.450 
grams of carbohydrates here I'm not a
person<00:02:23.320> who<00:02:23.500> like<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.770> cut<00:02:24.160> too<00:02:24.430> much

carbohydrates<00:02:25.300> when<00:02:25.480> I'm<00:02:25.660> dieting<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.090> so

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
carbohydrates when I'm dieting so so

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.570 
carbohydrates when I'm dieting so so
that<00:02:28.270> I<00:02:28.300> don't<00:02:28.450> lose<00:02:28.900> much<00:02:29.380> muscle<00:02:29.709> guys<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.310> I

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
that I don't lose much muscle guys but I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.090 
that I don't lose much muscle guys but I
can't<00:02:31.209> get<00:02:31.420> more<00:02:31.660> than<00:02:31.930> around<00:02:32.200> 50<00:02:32.709> grams<00:02:32.920> of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
can't get more than around 50 grams of

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.500 
can't get more than around 50 grams of
protein<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.580> believe<00:02:33.880> me<00:02:34.000> that's<00:02:34.180> it's<00:02:34.330> very

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
protein I believe me that's it's very

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.080 
protein I believe me that's it's very
tough<00:02:34.750> for<00:02:34.780> me<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.260> can't<00:02:36.190> eat<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.550> lot<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.970> I've
