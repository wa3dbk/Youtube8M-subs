00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
hold it on this would have been a lot

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.030

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.320 
easier if I actually had a jigsaw at
hand<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:17.670> an<00:02:17.760> actual<00:02:19.040> hole<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.280> did<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.090> hole

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
hand or an actual hole I did have a hole

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330 
hand or an actual hole I did have a hole
saw<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:22.050> as<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.500> tell<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.740> didn't<00:02:23.160> have

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
saw just as you can tell I didn't have

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.720 
saw just as you can tell I didn't have
the<00:02:24.200> one<00:02:25.200> size<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.070> needed<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.580> actually

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the one size that I needed to actually

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.910 
the one size that I needed to actually
fit<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.330> actual<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:27.900> one<00:02:28.080> big<00:02:28.320> hole<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.620> be

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
fit the actual for one big hole and be

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.190 
fit the actual for one big hole and be
done<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:29.910> had<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.210> do<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.420> flower<00:02:30.690> effect

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
done that I had to do the flower effect

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.980 
done that I had to do the flower effect
which<00:02:31.550> as<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.820> tell<00:02:32.940> tricky<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.870> see

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
which as you can tell tricky you can see

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.600 
which as you can tell tricky you can see
on<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.500> I'm<00:02:34.590> kind<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.070> off<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> little<00:02:35.430> bit

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
on this one I'm kind of off a little bit

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.400 
on this one I'm kind of off a little bit
but<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.300> whole<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.860> good<00:02:37.950> thing

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
but it's a whole so that's a good thing

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.150 
but it's a whole so that's a good thing
again<00:02:40.410> there's<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.950> switch<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:43.160> actually

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
again there's the switch and actually

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.500 
again there's the switch and actually
let's<00:02:44.580> uh<00:02:44.820> try<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.900> out<00:02:46.080> real<00:02:46.290> quick<00:02:47.300> okay<00:02:48.300> well

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
let's uh try it out real quick okay well

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.650 
let's uh try it out real quick okay well
tell<00:02:49.380> them<00:02:49.440> we'll<00:02:49.560> flip<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.100> on<00:02:50.190> here<00:02:50.660> and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
tell them we'll flip it on here and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.840 
tell them we'll flip it on here and
we'll<00:02:51.870> come<00:02:52.020> back<00:02:52.050> over<00:02:52.440> here<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.860> as<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:53.730> can

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
we'll come back over here and as you can

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.300 
we'll come back over here and as you can
tell<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.240> is<00:02:54.360> running<00:02:54.830> just<00:02:55.830> make<00:02:55.980> sure<00:02:56.010> I'll

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
tell it is running just make sure I'll

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.480 
tell it is running just make sure I'll
flip<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.790> off<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.300> Cletus<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.810> stop<00:02:59.060> stop

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
flip it off so you Cletus and stop stop

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.010 
flip it off so you Cletus and stop stop
so<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.640> does<00:03:02.820> work<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.270> way<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.510> can<00:03:03.720> keep<00:03:03.870> it

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
so it does work this way I can keep it

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.479 
so it does work this way I can keep it
plugged<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:05.030> yet<00:03:06.440> keep<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.890> know<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.280> yet

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
plugged in yet keep it you know but yet

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.479 
plugged in yet keep it you know but yet
still<00:03:08.780> I'm<00:03:09.780> not<00:03:09.930> using<00:03:10.170> my<00:03:10.320> laptop<00:03:10.470> where<00:03:11.310> my

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
tops turned off I can turn it off save

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.880 
tops turned off I can turn it off save
power<00:03:13.820> now<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:16.440> next<00:03:16.920> thing<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
power now the next thing is is the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.520 
power now the next thing is is the
laptop<00:03:20.459> itself<00:03:20.750> as<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.050> can<00:03:22.170> see<00:03:22.290> where<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
laptop itself as you can see where the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.350 
laptop itself as you can see where the
fan<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.250> usually<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.760> comment<00:03:24.300> on

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
fan is this is usually the comment on

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.140 
fan is this is usually the comment on
laptops<00:03:24.810> that's<00:03:25.080> going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.820> left

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
laptops that's going to be on the left

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.199 
laptops that's going to be on the left
side<00:03:27.470> on<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.500> upper<00:03:28.830> left<00:03:29.040> side<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:30.000> that's

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
side on the upper left side so that's

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.890

and here you have a laptop actually

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.350 
and here you have a laptop actually
sitting<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.220> top<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:49.580> well<00:03:50.580> should

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
sitting on top of it and well should

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.830 
sitting on top of it and well should
remember<00:03:51.510> would<00:03:51.720> give<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:51.989> try<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:53.840> I'll

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
remember would give it a try and I'll

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
because that was my main problem why I

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.809 
because that was my main problem why I
even<00:03:58.470> made<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.890> thing<00:03:59.129> was<00:03:59.310> because<00:03:59.610> my

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
even made the thing was because my

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.059 
even made the thing was because my
laptop<00:04:00.330> was<00:04:00.690> not<00:04:01.019> staying<00:04:01.349> cool<00:04:01.560> enough<00:04:01.860> on

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
laptop was not staying cool enough on

laptop was not staying cool enough on
the<00:04:02.340> fan<00:04:02.550> itself<00:04:02.730> because<00:04:03.599> of<00:04:03.900> mainly<00:04:04.530> poor

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
the fan itself because of mainly poor

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.930 
the fan itself because of mainly poor
design<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.540> most<00:04:06.540> laptops<00:04:06.870> these<00:04:07.440> days<00:04:07.940> so

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
design of most laptops these days so

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.539 
design of most laptops these days so
let's<00:04:09.720> all<00:04:10.380> let<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.069> know<00:04:11.190> if<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.370> works
