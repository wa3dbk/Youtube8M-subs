going to talk about playing zones on the
quads<00:00:10.349> oh<00:00:19.039> we<00:00:20.039> start<00:00:20.310> with<00:00:20.430> our<00:00:20.520> basic<00:00:20.730> hand

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
quads oh we start with our basic hand

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.750 
quads oh we start with our basic hand
position<00:00:22.070> there<00:00:23.070> should<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
position there should be it's just a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.370 
position there should be it's just a
slight<00:00:24.150> downward<00:00:24.449> angle<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> sticks

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
slight downward angle with the sticks

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.189 
slight downward angle with the sticks
from<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.279> wrist<00:00:26.720> to<00:00:27.720> make<00:00:27.869> sure<00:00:28.019> we're

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
from the wrist to make sure we're

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.660 
from the wrist to make sure we're
looking<00:00:28.500> good<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.460> we're<00:00:29.580> not

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
looking good and that when we're not

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.519 
looking good and that when we're not
playing<00:00:30.000> better<00:00:30.300> mouths<00:00:31.109> don't

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
playing better mouths don't

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.319 
playing better mouths don't
come<00:00:31.859> back<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> air<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
come back up in the air right so just a

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.770 
come back up in the air right so just a
slight<00:00:33.570> downward<00:00:33.840> angle<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:35.010> actual<00:00:35.340> playing

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
slight downward angle the actual playing

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.959 
slight downward angle the actual playing
positions<00:00:36.780> where<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.590> play<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> zones<00:00:38.640> of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
positions where you play on the zones of

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.530 
positions where you play on the zones of
the<00:00:39.480> drum<00:00:39.660> head<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.989> about<00:00:40.530> an<00:00:40.649> inch<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:41.040> two

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
the drum head is about an inch or two

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.770 
the drum head is about an inch or two
right<00:00:42.540> away<00:00:43.170> from<00:00:43.230> every<00:00:43.829> rim<00:00:44.539> okay

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
right away from every rim okay

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.729 
right away from every rim okay
and<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> relationship<00:00:47.579> between<00:00:48.739> every

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and if the relationship between every

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
and if the relationship between every
playing<00:00:50.039> zone<00:00:50.280> check<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.300> out

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
playing zone check this out

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.779 
playing zone check this out
is<00:00:52.430> actually<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> straight<00:00:53.850> line<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.860> right<00:00:56.640> now

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
is actually a straight line so right now

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.189 
is actually a straight line so right now
my<00:00:57.000> sticks<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> straight<00:00:57.840> line<00:00:57.870> but

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
my sticks are in a straight line but

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.439 
my sticks are in a straight line but
they're<00:00:58.289> intersecting<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.879> about<00:01:00.180> an<00:01:00.300> inch

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
they're intersecting with about an inch

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.119 
they're intersecting with about an inch
or<00:01:00.600> two<00:01:00.750> away<00:01:00.870> from<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> rim<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.620> every<00:01:01.829> drunk

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
or two away from the rim of every drunk

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.579 
or two away from the rim of every drunk
so<00:01:02.820> even<00:01:03.210> though<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.690> drums<00:01:03.960> are<00:01:04.140> kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> set

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so even though the drums are kind of set

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.570 
so even though the drums are kind of set
up<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> semicircle<00:01:05.760> arc<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:07.890> should<00:01:08.070> still

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
up in the semicircle arc we should still

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240 
up in the semicircle arc we should still
think<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> playing<00:01:09.330> zones<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.860> straight

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
think of the playing zones as a straight

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.250 
think of the playing zones as a straight
line<00:01:11.490> don't<00:01:12.060> let<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> shape<00:01:12.510> fool<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
line don't let the shape fool you of the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.340 
line don't let the shape fool you of the
drums<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> watch<00:01:14.820> even<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.479> move<00:01:15.750> from<00:01:16.049> drum

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
drums so watch even as I move from drum

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.640 
drums so watch even as I move from drum
1<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.979> drum<00:01:17.220> 3

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.210 

my<00:01:24.650> hand<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.010> moving<00:01:25.190> out<00:01:25.700> not<00:01:26.690> back<00:01:27.220> same

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
my hand is moving out not back same

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:37.150 
my hand is moving out not back same
thing<00:01:28.250> on<00:01:28.580> two<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:28.850> four<00:01:34.840> right<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.080> now<00:01:36.770> that

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
thing on two to four right and now that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.340 
thing on two to four right and now that
will<00:01:37.340> continue<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.910> be<00:01:38.000> true<00:01:38.270> if<00:01:38.960> we<00:01:39.140> place

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
will continue to be true if we place

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.790 
will continue to be true if we place
great<00:01:39.530> or<00:01:42.850> crossovers<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.330> goal<00:01:44.660> although<00:01:45.170> I

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
great or crossovers the goal although I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.100 
great or crossovers the goal although I
will<00:01:46.310> admit<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:46.850> not<00:01:46.970> always<00:01:47.540> going<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.020> be

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
will admit it's not always going to be

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.170 
will admit it's not always going to be
true<00:01:48.380> if<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:48.650> get<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.860> way<00:01:49.310> faster<00:01:49.850> way<00:01:49.970> harder

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
true if you get to way faster way harder

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.760 
true if you get to way faster way harder
like<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.510> you<00:01:50.630> won't<00:01:50.810> be<00:01:50.960> able<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.200> be<00:01:51.290> exact

like that you won't be able to be exact

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.590 
like that you won't be able to be exact
about<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.610> straight<00:01:52.850> line<00:01:53.030> that<00:01:53.479> should

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
about the straight line that should

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.500 
about the straight line that should
always<00:01:53.780> be<00:01:53.960> your<00:01:54.290> goal<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:55.160> come<00:01:55.370> back<00:01:55.550> to<00:01:55.820> so
