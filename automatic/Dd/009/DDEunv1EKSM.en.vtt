 Book of Haggai Chapter 1 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.300
 Hag 1: 1 In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.390
 the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.579
 of Judah, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying: 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.620
 Hag 1: 2 Thus says the LORD of hosts, saying, This people saith, He hath not come 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.410
 even the time, the time that the house of Jehovah will be rebuilt. 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.070
 Hag 1: 3 Then the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai, saying, 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.660
 Hag 1: 4 Is it for you time, for you, to dwell in your paneled houses, 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.770
 and this house is deserted? Hag 1: 5 For thus says the LORD of the 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.239
 Armies: Meditate well on your ways. Hag 1: 6 You sow much, and gather little; 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.709
 you eat, and you are not satisfied; you drink, and you are not satisfied; you dress, and do not get warmed up; 

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:15.229
 and he who works for wages receives his wages in broken bag. 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.109
 Hag 1: 7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Meditate on your ways. 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.270
 Hag 1: 8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will put my will in it, 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.509
 and I will be glorified, Jehovah has said. Hag 1: 9 You seek much, and you find little; Y 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.459
 you lock up at home, and I'll dissipate it in a breath. Why? says the LORD of hosts. 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:42.310
 Because my house is deserted, and each one of you runs to his own house. 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.389
 Hag 1:10 That is why the rain stopped over the heavens, and the earth stopped its 

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:50.649
 fruits Hag 1:11 And I called the drought on this earth, 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.189
 and on the mountains, on the wheat, on the wine, on the oil, on everything that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.109
 the earth produces, over men and over beasts, and over all handiwork. 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:07.469
 Hag 1:12 And Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel heard, and Joshua the son of Jozadak, the high priest, 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.510
 and all the rest of the people, the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of the prophet Haggai, 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.000
 as Jehovah his God had sent him; and the people feared before the Lord. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.040
 Hag 1:13 Then Haggai, the messenger of the Lord, spoke at the word of the LORD to the people, saying, 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.620
 I am with you, says Jehovah. Hag 1:14 And Jehovah stirred the spirit 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.280
 of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.689
 Josadac, high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people; and they came and worked 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.590
 in the house of the LORD of hosts, his God, 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.590
 Hag 1:15 on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius. 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.150
 Chapter 2 Hag 2: 1 In the seventh month, at twenty-one 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.379
 On the days of the month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai, saying: 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:03.120
 Hag 2: 2 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jozadak, 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.900
 high priest, and the rest of the people, saying: Hag 2: 3 Who is left among you 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.579
 who has seen this house in its first glory, and how do you see it now? Is not she like nothing 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.930
 in front of your eyes? Hag 2: 4 For now, Zerubbabel, strive, 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.849
 says the LORD; Strive also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, high priest; and cobrad 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.579
 courage, all you people of the earth, says Jehovah, and work; because I am with you, 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.719
 says the LORD of hosts. Hag 2: 5 According to the covenant that I made with you 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.620
 When you came out of Egypt, so my Spirit will be among you, do not fear. 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.109
 Hag 2: 6 For thus saith the LORD of hosts: Little by little I will shake the heavens 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.700
 and the earth, the sea and the dry land; Hag 2: 7 And I will shake all the nations, 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.579
 and the Desire of all nations will come; and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.439
 of the armies. Hag 2: 8 Mine is silver, and mine is gold, 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.969
 says the LORD of hosts. Hag 2: 9 The last glory of this house will be 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.590
 greater than the first, saith the Lord of hosts; and I will give peace in this place, 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.430
 says the LORD of hosts. Hag 2:10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.090
 In the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai, saying: 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.340
 Hag 2:11 Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Ask now the priests about 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.740
 the law, saying: Hag 2:12 If anyone bears sanctified meat 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.569
 in the skirt of her clothes, and with the flight of her she will touch bread, or food, or wine, or oil, 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:39.050
 or any other food, will it be sanctified? And the priests answered and said: No. 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.340
 Hag 2:13 And Haggai said, If a unclean one because of a dead body toucheth any thing of these, 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.169
 Will it be unclean? And the priests answered, and said, It shall be unclean. 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.599
 Hag 2:14 And Haggai answered and said, So is this people and these people before me saying 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.210
 Jehovah; and likewise all the work of their hands; and everything that is offered here is unclean. 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.800
 Hag 2:15 Now, then, meditate in your heart from this day forward, before you put 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.000
 stone on stone in the temple of Jehovah. Hag 2:16 Before these things happened, 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.440
 they came to the heap of twenty efas, and there were ten; they came to the winepress to get fifty 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.300
 pitchers, and there were twenty. Hag 2:17 I struck you with east wind, with mildew 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.629
 and with hail in all the work of your hands; But you did not convert to me, says the Lord. 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.889
 Hag 2:18 Meditate, therefore, in your heart, from this day forward, from the day 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.319
 twenty-four of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was laid; 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.259
 meditate, then, in your heart. Hag 2:19 Is not the seed still in the 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:49.300
 barn? Neither the vine, nor the fig tree, nor the pomegranate, nor the olive tree has flourished yet; 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.919
 but from this day I will bless you. Hag 2:20 Second word came from Jehovah 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.199
 to Haggai, on the twenty-fourth day of the same month, saying: 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.050
 Hag 2:21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.819
 land; Hag 2:22 and I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.610
 and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; I will upset the cars and those who 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.229
 in them they go up, and the horses and their riders will come down, each one by the sword of 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.569
 his brother. Hag 2:23 In that day, says the LORD of the 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.259
 armies, I will take you, O Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, says the Lord, and 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.860
 I will put you as a sealing ring; for I chose you, says the LORD of hosts.
