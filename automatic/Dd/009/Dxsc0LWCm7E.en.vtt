00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.290 

hello<00:00:00.630> I<00:00:00.989> wanted<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:01.979> buy<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.159> combination<00:00:03.120> lock

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hello I wanted to buy a combination lock

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.059 
hello I wanted to buy a combination lock
where<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.629> could<00:00:03.810> set<00:00:03.990> my<00:00:04.140> own<00:00:04.259> combinations

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
where I could set my own combinations

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.010 
where I could set my own combinations
but<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.819> seemed<00:00:06.000> like<00:00:06.180> every<00:00:06.480> luck<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:06.839> was

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
but it seemed like every luck I was

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.470 
but it seemed like every luck I was
looking<00:00:07.379> at<00:00:07.560> that<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.580> could<00:00:08.730> do<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.179> there

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
looking at that you could do that there

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.360 
looking at that you could do that there
was<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> YouTube<00:00:10.290> video<00:00:10.500> showing<00:00:10.980> how<00:00:11.309> you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
was a YouTube video showing how you

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.669 
was a YouTube video showing how you
could<00:00:11.639> stick<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> little<00:00:12.179> shim<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.440> where

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
could stick a little shim in to where

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.000 
could stick a little shim in to where
the<00:00:14.330> numbers<00:00:15.330> are<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.870> open<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.619> up<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the numbers are and open it up in a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.950 
the numbers are and open it up in a
couple<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.400> seconds<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:18.539> one<00:00:18.779> you're<00:00:18.930> not

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
couple of seconds this one you're not

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.750 
couple of seconds this one you're not
supposed<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:19.590> able<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.770> shim<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.490> one

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
supposed to be able to shim this one

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.870 
supposed to be able to shim this one
it's<00:00:21.270> anti<00:00:21.779> shim<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.680> these<00:00:23.369> are<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> whole

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
it's anti shim and these are the whole

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.849 
it's anti shim and these are the whole
new<00:00:24.060> design<00:00:24.240> there's<00:00:24.720> only<00:00:24.930> four<00:00:25.410> different

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
new design there's only four different

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.849 
new design there's only four different
movements<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.840> there's<00:00:28.289> no<00:00:28.439> limit<00:00:28.830> to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
movements on it but there's no limit to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.320 
movements on it but there's no limit to
how<00:00:28.980> many<00:00:29.099> different<00:00:29.580> movements<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> could

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
how many different movements you could

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.910 
how many different movements you could
have<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.809> ten<00:00:34.050> movements<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
have so if you have ten movements that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.920 
have so if you have ten movements that
would<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> mill<00:00:35.880> over<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> million<00:00:36.540> different

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
would be a mill over a million different

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
would be a mill over a million different
combinations<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.070> had<00:00:38.190> 15<00:00:38.670> movements

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
combinations if you had 15 movements

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060 
combinations if you had 15 movements
that'd<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.140> over<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> billion<00:00:40.920> different

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
that'd be over a billion different

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
that'd be over a billion different
combinations<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.059> could<00:00:42.239> use<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.570> few<00:00:42.840> or<00:00:43.050> as

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
combinations you could use as few or as

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.110 
combinations you could use as few or as
many<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.710> want<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.160> I'll<00:00:44.640> show<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.910> how

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
easy it is to do a a 10:1 you have to

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.500 
easy it is to do a a 10:1 you have to
hit<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> twice<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.829> clear<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> memory<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
hit it twice to clear the memory this is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.990 
hit it twice to clear the memory this is
a<00:00:51.539> 10:1<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.649> three<00:00:52.980> seconds

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.150

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
you open it back up and then you put in
your<00:01:20.780> combination<00:01:21.780> we'll<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.229> around

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
your combination we'll just go around

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.700 
your combination we'll just go around
the<00:01:22.619> world<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> make<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.159> easy<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:24.210> right<00:01:25.049> down

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
fact you can do this combination in the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.490 
fact you can do this combination in the
dark<00:01:58.979> which<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.290> easy<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.619> do<00:02:01.860> and
