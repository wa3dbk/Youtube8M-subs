we're<00:05:09.400> gonna<00:05:09.490> see<00:05:09.910> how<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.300> I've<00:05:10.930> tested

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
we're gonna see how that is I've tested

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.890 
we're gonna see how that is I've tested
this<00:05:11.620> before<00:05:12.070> on<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.520> HTC<00:05:12.820> ship-launched<00:05:13.510> in

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
this before on the HTC ship-launched in

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.530 
this before on the HTC ship-launched in
London<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.590> it<00:05:15.580> wasn't<00:05:15.790> that<00:05:15.910> good<00:05:16.210> but<00:05:16.270> I'm

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
London and it wasn't that good but I'm

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.000 
London and it wasn't that good but I'm
really<00:05:16.750> hoping<00:05:16.990> that<00:05:17.140> they've<00:05:17.350> improved<00:05:17.620> that

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
really hoping that they've improved that

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.650

or<00:05:18.550> that<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:18.880> could<00:05:19.060> get<00:05:19.150> used<00:05:19.390> to<00:05:19.510> it<00:05:19.570> because

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
or that I could get used to it because

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.280 
or that I could get used to it because
it's<00:05:19.900> very<00:05:20.140> important<00:05:20.740> for<00:05:20.920> two-handed<00:05:21.820> mode

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
it's very important for two-handed mode

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.360 
it's very important for two-handed mode
