without<00:00:28.500> Harry<00:00:29.279> Potter<00:00:29.580> my<00:00:29.939> life<00:00:30.119> would<00:00:30.300> be

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
without Harry Potter my life would be

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.080 
without Harry Potter my life would be
one<00:00:30.900> hundred<00:00:31.260> percent<00:00:31.650> different<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:35.090> don't

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
one hundred percent different so I don't

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.510 
one hundred percent different so I don't
know<00:00:36.239> where<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.079> start<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:38.129> i<00:00:38.190> guess<00:00:38.309> i<00:00:38.399> can

focused<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:38.070> something<00:03:38.280> positive<00:03:38.940> when<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.480> had

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
focused on something positive when I had

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.880 
focused on something positive when I had
nothing<00:03:40.110> else<00:03:40.200> positive<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:40.890> focus<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.459> and

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
nothing else positive to focus on and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.300 
nothing else positive to focus on and
you<00:03:43.890> know<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.190> gave<00:03:44.370> me<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.670> escaped<00:03:45.090> and

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
you know it gave me that I escaped and

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.270 
you know it gave me that I escaped and
that's<00:03:47.310> what<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.670> needed<00:03:47.910> most<00:03:48.360> time<00:03:49.310> um<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:53.040> if

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
that's what I needed most time um so if

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.050 
that's what I needed most time um so if
it<00:03:53.700> wasn't<00:03:54.000> for<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.560> I'm<00:03:55.560> not<00:03:55.920> sure<00:03:56.220> if<00:03:56.940> I

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
it wasn't for that I'm not sure if I

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.340 
it wasn't for that I'm not sure if I
would<00:03:57.150> be<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.420> same<00:03:57.570> person<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.930> am<00:03:58.080> right<00:03:58.230> now
