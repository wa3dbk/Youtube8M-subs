00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
inside you are going to sew a straight

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:56.300 
inside you are going to sew a straight
line<00:01:41.369> across<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.630> top<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:43.790> your<00:01:44.790> piece

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.270 

after<00:01:57.310> you've<00:01:57.460> sewn<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.820> straight<00:01:58.240> line<00:01:59.280> you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
after you've sewn that straight line you

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.730 
after you've sewn that straight line you
want<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.670> turn<00:02:01.000> your<00:02:01.210> piece<00:02:01.420> right<00:02:02.410> side<00:02:02.710> out

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
want to turn your piece right side out

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.490 
want to turn your piece right side out
so<00:02:03.460> flip<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.940> around<00:02:04.090> now<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.080> should<00:02:05.320> have<00:02:05.350> a

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
so flip it around now you should have a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.520 
so flip it around now you should have a
seam<00:02:05.830> right<00:02:06.040> here<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.480> are<00:02:07.900> simply<00:02:08.350> going

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
seam right here now you are simply going

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:21.620 
seam right here now you are simply going
to<00:02:08.649> sew<00:02:09.040> another<00:02:09.369> straight<00:02:09.790> line<00:02:10.030> on<00:02:10.390> top

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.800 

so<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:22.350> have<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> very<00:02:22.950> long<00:02:23.310> rectangle<00:02:24.000> but

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
so now we have a very long rectangle but
