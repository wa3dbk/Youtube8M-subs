with<00:04:33.669> sims<00:04:34.780> 3<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.310> if<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.490> does<00:04:37.789> end<00:04:38.120> up

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
with sims 3 and if it does end up

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.420 
with sims 3 and if it does end up
working<00:04:38.840> really<00:04:39.200> well<00:04:39.320> with<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.950> might<00:04:40.280> be

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.279 
um I making it I think it I mean any
headset<00:06:12.119> really<00:06:12.569> is<00:06:12.659> a<00:06:12.689> good<00:06:12.869> investment<00:06:12.959> for

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
headset really is a good investment for

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.409 
headset really is a good investment for
me<00:06:13.439> because<00:06:13.589> I<00:06:13.649> don't<00:06:13.799> have<00:06:13.889> one<00:06:14.039> so<00:06:14.339> I<00:06:14.639> think

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
me because I don't have one so I think
