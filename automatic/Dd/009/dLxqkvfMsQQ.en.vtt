thing but it's actually an antique got a
speed<00:01:41.390> gauge<00:01:41.630> here<00:01:41.870> top<00:01:42.320> speed<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.590> 30

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
speed gauge here top speed of 30

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.470 
speed gauge here top speed of 30
kilometers<00:01:43.280> an<00:01:43.370> hour<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:43.820> asked<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.150> guy<00:01:44.300> why

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
kilometers an hour I asked the guy why

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.120 
kilometers an hour I asked the guy why
and<00:01:44.690> he<00:01:44.750> said<00:01:44.870> it<00:01:44.930> was<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.050> law<00:01:45.260> at<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.590> time<00:01:45.620> 20

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
and he said it was a law at the time 20

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.250 
and he said it was a law at the time 20
years<00:01:46.340> ago<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:47.060> wasn't<00:01:47.240> allowed<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:48.170> know

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
years ago it wasn't allowed to you know

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.250 
years ago it wasn't allowed to you know
it's<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.500> 50<00:01:48.800> cc<00:01:49.100> engine<00:01:49.130> two-stroke<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:50.260> I'm

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
it's a 50 cc engine two-stroke so I'm

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.720 
it's a 50 cc engine two-stroke so I'm
guessing<00:01:51.650> it<00:01:51.770> can<00:01:51.920> surpass<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.610> could

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
guessing it can surpass it could

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.430 
guessing it can surpass it could
probably<00:01:53.030> be<00:01:53.240> tweaked<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.690> go<00:01:53.810> sixty<00:01:54.320> or

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
probably be tweaked to go sixty or

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.030 
probably be tweaked to go sixty or
seventy<00:01:54.620> even<00:01:55.070> but<00:01:55.820> yeah<00:01:56.270> it's<00:01:56.800> limited<00:01:57.800> at

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
seventy even but yeah it's limited at

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:07.080 
seventy even but yeah it's limited at
thirty<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:59.030> here's<00:01:59.660> a<00:01:59.720> fuel<00:01:59.960> gauge<00:01:59.990> down

there's a fuel gauge

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.540 
there's a fuel gauge
you<00:02:08.840> got<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.959> speed<00:02:09.349> gauge<00:02:09.560> fuel<00:02:09.979> gauge<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.429> got

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
you got a speed gauge fuel gauge you got

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.089
