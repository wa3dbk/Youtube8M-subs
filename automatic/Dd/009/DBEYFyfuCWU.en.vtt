00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
about the importance and have many times

silver and i want for clarification
purposes<00:00:31.340> 22<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.969> define<00:00:33.420> what

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
purposes 22 for you to define what

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.639 
purposes 22 for you to define what
percentage<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.430> silver<00:00:35.850> should<00:00:36.420> be

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
percentage of that silver should be

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.900 
percentage of that silver should be
coins<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:38.040> bars<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:39.030> wafers<00:00:39.800> versus<00:00:40.910> silver

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
coins or bars or wafers versus silver

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.650 
coins or bars or wafers versus silver
mining<00:00:42.239> stocks<00:00:43.040> versus<00:00:44.040> paper<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.180> says<00:00:45.450> you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
mining stocks versus paper that says you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
mining stocks versus paper that says you
own<00:00:45.870> silver<00:00:46.500> somewhere<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.340> somebody's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
own silver somewhere but somebody's

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.450 
own silver somewhere but somebody's
keeping<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.329> safely<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.100> think

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
keeping it safely for you and I think

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
keeping it safely for you and I think
that's<00:00:50.640> probably<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.270> least<00:00:51.480> desirable<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
that's probably the least desirable of

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.350 
that's probably the least desirable of
the<00:00:52.770> three<00:00:53.010> options<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.940> isn't<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the three options for you isn't it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.000 
the three options for you isn't it
absolutely<00:00:55.020> correct<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.770> know<00:00:55.860> there

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
absolutely correct and you know there

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
absolutely correct and you know there
isn't<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.460> size<00:00:56.789> fits<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.629> an<00:00:57.809> absolute

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
isn't one size fits all or an absolute

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.869 
isn't one size fits all or an absolute
perfect<00:00:58.680> answer<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
perfect answer because it's a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.660 
perfect answer because it's a
case-by-case<00:01:00.329> individual<00:01:01.230> basis<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
case-by-case individual basis but the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.450 
case-by-case individual basis but the
print<00:01:03.239> main<00:01:03.480> principles<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.290> very<00:01:04.439> sound<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
print main principles are very sound you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.039 
print main principles are very sound you
should<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.330> precious<00:01:06.750> metals

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
should have your precious metals

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
should have your precious metals
portfolio<00:01:07.710> starting<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.549> real<00:01:08.760> metal<00:01:09.030> first

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
portfolio starting with real metal first

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120 
portfolio starting with real metal first
metal<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.860> go

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
metal that you can actually you know go

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.190 
metal that you can actually you know go
touch<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.670> margin<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.960> yours

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
touch on margin that you know is yours

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.410 
touch on margin that you know is yours
and<00:01:13.560> once<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.189> established<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> really

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and once that's established and I really

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.910 
and once that's established and I really
like<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.930> into<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.350> mining<00:01:16.710> shares

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
like to go into the mining shares

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
like to go into the mining shares
because<00:01:17.220> that's<00:01:17.520> where<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:17.880> leverage

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
because that's where you get leverage

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.210 
because that's where you get leverage
and<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:19.020> time<00:01:19.259> around<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.130> this

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and this time around I think in this

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.740 
and this time around I think in this
bull<00:01:20.460> cycle<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.090> were<00:01:21.180> probably<00:01:21.390> halfway

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
bull cycle that were probably halfway

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.539 
bull cycle that were probably halfway
through<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.470> we've<00:01:22.590> got<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.740> long<00:01:23.040> ways<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
through it then we've got a long ways to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.880 
through it then we've got a long ways to
go<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:24.270> least<00:01:24.360> two<00:01:24.840> years<00:01:25.020> maybe<00:01:25.290> five<00:01:25.470> maybe

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
go at least two years maybe five maybe

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.280 
go at least two years maybe five maybe
even<00:01:26.040> longer<00:01:26.420> there's<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.900> day<00:01:28.140> in

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
even longer there's going to be a day in

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.210 
even longer there's going to be a day in
my<00:01:28.439> view<00:01:28.680> where<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.100> very

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
my view where is going to be very

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
my view where is going to be very
difficult<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> metal<00:01:30.479> we've<00:01:30.900> already

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
difficult to get the metal we've already

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.260 
difficult to get the metal we've already
seen<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.100> fact<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> last<00:01:32.880> summer

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
seen that it's a fact that last summer

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.390 
seen that it's a fact that last summer
so<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.409> very<00:01:34.439> difficult<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.220> physical

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
so it was very difficult to get physical

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300 
so it was very difficult to get physical
silver<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.150> gold<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.170> saw<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> very<00:01:37.680> big

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
silver and gold and you saw a very big

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
silver and gold and you saw a very big
discrepancy<00:01:39.060> between<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.540> paper<00:01:39.840> price<00:01:40.200> on

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
discrepancy between the paper price on

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
discrepancy between the paper price on
the<00:01:40.500> futures<00:01:40.890> exchange<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> comex<00:01:42.030> in

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the futures exchange and the comex in

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.639 
the futures exchange and the comex in
the<00:01:42.360> United<00:01:42.689> States<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> actually

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the United States and what you actually

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
the United States and what you actually
had<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> pay<00:01:44.220> its<00:01:44.340> coin<00:01:44.610> dealer<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.090> obtain<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
had to pay its coin dealer to obtain it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.660 
had to pay its coin dealer to obtain it
I<00:01:45.780> think<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.740> precursor<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:47.430> we're

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
I think that's a precursor to what we're

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
I think that's a precursor to what we're
going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> future<00:01:48.530> because<00:01:49.530> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
going to see in the future because of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.170 
going to see in the future because of
that<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.399> didn't<00:01:50.579> see<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:50.850> mining

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
that I think I didn't see these mining

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.780 
that I think I didn't see these mining
shares<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.409> well<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.829> time<00:01:52.890> because

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
shares really do well this time because

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.240 
shares really do well this time because
people<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> can't<00:01:54.810> get<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.380> physical<00:01:55.860> metal

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
people that can't get the physical metal

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.770 
people that can't get the physical metal
are<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.090> next<00:01:57.270> best<00:01:57.540> thing

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
are going to go to the next best thing

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.300 
are going to go to the next best thing
and<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> mining<00:01:58.649> chairs<00:01:58.920> now<00:01:59.159> would

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and that's the mining chairs now would

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
and that's the mining chairs now would
this<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.640> all<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.149> miners<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.930> small<00:02:01.229> caps

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this be all the miners the small caps

this be all the miners the small caps

right across the full mining spectrum at

the end of the cycle will be everybody
okay<00:02:07.920> right<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.550> where<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:08.879> are<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> side

okay right now where we are the side

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.490 
okay right now where we are the side
you<00:02:09.580> wanna<00:02:09.730> be<00:02:09.850> extremely<00:02:10.630> selective<00:02:10.900> and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
you wanna be extremely selective and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.410 
you wanna be extremely selective and
I've<00:02:11.620> been<00:02:11.830> very<00:02:12.040> selective<00:02:12.670> all<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.090> way<00:02:13.240> up

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
I've been very selective all the way up

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.960 
I've been very selective all the way up
I<00:02:13.720> like<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.320> put<00:02:14.530> serious<00:02:15.070> money<00:02:15.340> into<00:02:15.580> serious

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
I like to put serious money into serious

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.490 
I like to put serious money into serious
company<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.780> put<00:02:16.930> speculative

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
company and I like to put speculative

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.110 
company and I like to put speculative
money<00:02:17.740> in<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> speculative<00:02:18.430> companies<00:02:18.910> and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
money in the speculative companies and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.030 
money in the speculative companies and
that's<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.870> best<00:02:20.050> way<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> play<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.860> mean

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
that's the best way to play it I mean

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.400 
that's the best way to play it I mean
some<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.550> my<00:02:22.150> peer<00:02:22.420> group<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.780> said<00:02:22.960> well<00:02:23.140> a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
some of my peer group and said well a

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.410 
some of my peer group and said well a
small<00:02:23.890> company<00:02:24.370> can<00:02:24.520> grow<00:02:24.550> faster<00:02:25.120> than<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.270> big

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
small company can grow faster than a big

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.630 
small company can grow faster than a big
company<00:02:25.780> that's<00:02:26.020> true<00:02:26.290> or<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.680> know<00:02:27.190> how<00:02:27.430> many

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
company that's true or you know how many

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.790 
company that's true or you know how many
like<00:02:28.120> buying<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.720> egg<00:02:28.810> corn<00:02:29.140> versus<00:02:29.530> an<00:02:29.650> oak

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
like buying the egg corn versus an oak

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.830 
like buying the egg corn versus an oak
tree<00:02:29.830> but<00:02:30.190> they<00:02:30.310> don't<00:02:30.760> finish<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.300> analogy

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
tree but they don't finish the analogy

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.360 
tree but they don't finish the analogy
because<00:02:32.260> if<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.440> look<00:02:32.590> at<00:02:32.710> an<00:02:32.800> oak<00:02:32.950> tree<00:02:32.980> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
because if you look at an oak tree you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.770 
because if you look at an oak tree you
see<00:02:33.520> how<00:02:33.640> many<00:02:33.820> acorns<00:02:34.150> are<00:02:34.390> underneath<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
see how many acorns are underneath the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.260 
see how many acorns are underneath the
one<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.260> then<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.160> stop<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.640> really<00:02:37.030> think

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
one and then you stop to really think

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.480 
one and then you stop to really think
through<00:02:37.420> how<00:02:38.230> many<00:02:38.470> become<00:02:38.800> oak<00:02:38.980> trees<00:02:39.250> that's

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
through how many become oak trees that's

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.160 
through how many become oak trees that's
a<00:02:39.640> good<00:02:39.880> analogy<00:02:40.150> for<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.660> junior<00:02:40.990> mining

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
a good analogy for the junior mining

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.530 
a good analogy for the junior mining
sector<00:02:41.710> oh<00:02:41.770> there's<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.160> ton<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.610> acorns<00:02:43.240> that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
sector oh there's a ton of acorns that

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.920 
sector oh there's a ton of acorns that
very<00:02:44.080> very<00:02:44.200> few<00:02:44.970> become<00:02:45.970> an<00:02:46.090> oak<00:02:46.240> tree<00:02:46.270> so

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
very very few become an oak tree so

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.600 
very very few become an oak tree so
that's<00:02:47.140> still<00:02:47.350> high<00:02:47.500> risk<00:02:47.770> yeah<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.400> if<00:02:48.490> you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
that's still high risk yeah so if you

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.580 
that's still high risk yeah so if you
can<00:02:48.760> buy<00:02:48.880> an<00:02:49.090> oak<00:02:49.240> tree<00:02:49.270> that's<00:02:49.780> in<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> growth

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
can buy an oak tree that's in the growth

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.920 
can buy an oak tree that's in the growth
curve<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:51.520> know<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:51.910> an<00:02:52.030> oak<00:02:52.210> tree<00:02:52.240> so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
curve you know it's an oak tree so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.660 
curve you know it's an oak tree so
that's<00:02:53.110> like<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.320> mid-tier<00:02:53.860> company<00:02:54.370> or<00:02:54.490> maybe

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
that's like a mid-tier company or maybe

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.070 
that's like a mid-tier company or maybe
a<00:02:54.790> top<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.210> your<00:02:55.300> company<00:02:55.690> that's<00:02:55.870> going<00:02:55.960> to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
a top to your company that's going to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.260 
a top to your company that's going to
grow<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.980> got<00:02:57.130> almost<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.580> sure<00:02:57.760> thing<00:02:58.030> as<00:02:58.240> long

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
grow you got almost a sure thing as long

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.240 
grow you got almost a sure thing as long
as<00:02:58.540> we're<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.900> bull<00:02:59.080> market<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.740> that's

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
as we're in a bull market and that's

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.580 
as we're in a bull market and that's
what<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.430> teach<00:03:00.520> so<00:03:00.990> but<00:03:01.990> there's<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.380> much<00:03:02.530> more

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
what I teach so but there's so much more

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.920 
what I teach so but there's so much more
money<00:03:03.280> that's<00:03:03.700> available<00:03:03.850> through<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.690> paper

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
money that's available through the paper

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.450 
money that's available through the paper
market<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.890> don't<00:03:06.100> want<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.370> be

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
market so I don't want to be

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.880 
market so I don't want to be
disingenuous<00:03:06.850> in<00:03:07.330> any<00:03:07.480> way<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:08.620> can

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
disingenuous in any way you can

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.710 
disingenuous in any way you can
definitely<00:03:09.790> start<00:03:10.270> with<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.510> precious

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
definitely start with the precious

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.110 
definitely start with the precious
metals<00:03:11.200> I'd<00:03:11.560> say<00:03:11.920> for<00:03:12.220> most<00:03:12.370> people<00:03:12.760> my<00:03:13.090> age

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
metals I'd say for most people my age

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.960 
metals I'd say for most people my age
category<00:03:13.960> pushing<00:03:14.410> towards<00:03:14.680> 60<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.790> should

on<00:06:49.900> paper<00:06:50.139> at<00:06:50.380> one<00:06:50.410> time<00:06:50.560> there's<00:06:51.310> got<00:06:51.520> to<00:06:51.610> be<00:06:51.639> a

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:51.730 
on paper at one time there's got to be a

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.250 
on paper at one time there's got to be a
motive<00:06:52.060> behind<00:06:52.210> that<00:06:52.600> so<00:06:52.720> I<00:06:52.750> think<00:06:52.810> it's<00:06:53.020> very

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
motive behind that so I think it's very

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260 
motive behind that so I think it's very
clear<00:06:53.680> for<00:06:54.250> the<00:06:54.340> record<00:06:54.460> but<00:06:54.730> I<00:06:54.760> also<00:06:54.910> want<00:06:55.150> to

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
clear for the record but I also want to

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.400 
clear for the record but I also want to
be<00:06:55.330> clear<00:06:55.540> that's<00:06:55.630> not<00:06:55.780> just<00:06:56.110> the<00:06:56.139> gold<00:06:56.380> and

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
be clear that's not just the gold and

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.900 
be clear that's not just the gold and
silver<00:06:56.710> markets<00:06:57.100> right<00:06:57.280> I<00:06:57.490> mean<00:06:57.760> it's

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
silver markets right I mean it's

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.280 
silver markets right I mean it's
basically<00:06:58.060> pervasive<00:06:58.870> throughout<00:06:59.020> the
