free<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> big<00:00:46.559> surprise<00:00:47.039> for

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
free which was a big surprise for

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.000 
free which was a big surprise for
everyone<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.510> nip<00:00:49.260> went<00:00:49.500> through<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.890> was

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
everyone and nip went through that was

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.540 
everyone and nip went through that was
expected<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.530> luminosity<00:00:52.530> luminosity<00:00:52.770> was

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
expected and luminosity luminosity was

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.569 
expected and luminosity luminosity was
probably<00:00:53.960> it<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.079> braver<00:00:55.320> between<00:00:55.770> Mouse<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
probably it was braver between Mouse and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.729 
probably it was braver between Mouse and
luminosity<00:00:56.850> bet<00:00:57.360> Mouse<00:00:57.840> ended<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.379> losing<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
luminosity bet Mouse ended up losing a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.430 
luminosity bet Mouse ended up losing a
game<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.489> flipside<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.420> close<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.989> then

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
game to flipside really close and then

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.070 
game to flipside really close and then
flipside<00:01:01.949> almost<00:01:02.370> beat<00:01:02.550> luma<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.080> luminosity

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
flipside almost beat luma not luminosity

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.310 
flipside almost beat luma not luminosity
so<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.439> was<00:01:04.589> crazy<00:01:05.129> place<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.820> well<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.390> Group

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
so that was crazy place as well so Group

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.060

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.160 
in but I didn't and I select the TSM
over<00:01:52.079> MV<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.649> an<00:01:52.890> MV<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:54.960> really

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
over MV and an MV one so I was really

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530 
over MV and an MV one so I was really
worried<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.680> point<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:56.880> fnatic

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
worried at that point but then fnatic

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.030 
worried at that point but then fnatic
pulled<00:01:57.750> through<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.469> Phonak<00:01:58.770> pulled

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
pulled through and then Phonak pulled

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.709 
pulled through and then Phonak pulled
through<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> final<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.060> even<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.479> that

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
through in the final but even if that

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.289 
through in the final but even if that
was<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> case<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.490> wouldn't<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.790> wouldn't<00:02:03.149> have

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
was the case I wouldn't I wouldn't have

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.170 
was the case I wouldn't I wouldn't have
got<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> actual<00:02:03.810> gold<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.729> now<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.790> go<00:02:05.969> look

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
got the actual gold so now we go look

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.479 
got the actual gold so now we go look
over<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> player<00:02:06.869> pick'em<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.280> what
