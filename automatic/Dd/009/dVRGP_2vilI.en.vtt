have<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.489> fancy<00:02:22.910> S<00:02:23.299> shape<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:25.549> next<00:02:25.849> step<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.360> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
have a fancy S shape the next step is to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.100 
have a fancy S shape the next step is to
grab<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.959> hold<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.680> Center<00:02:28.579> loop<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.420> just

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
grab a hold of that Center loop and just

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.460 
grab a hold of that Center loop and just
give<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.440> gentle<00:02:30.890> pull<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.629> that<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.930> pull<00:02:33.230> that

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
give a gentle pull so that you pull that

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.839 
give a gentle pull so that you pull that
spiral<00:02:34.220> out<00:02:34.459> into<00:02:34.879> a<00:02:34.930> cone<00:02:35.930> shape<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.739> do<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
spiral out into a cone shape and do the

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.360 
spiral out into a cone shape and do the
same<00:02:38.150> for<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.780> other<00:02:38.959> spiral<00:02:39.440> pulling<00:02:40.220> them

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
same for the other spiral pulling them

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:50.550 
same for the other spiral pulling them
both<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.260> same<00:02:42.620> side

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.559 

and<00:02:50.650> then<00:02:51.599> fold<00:02:52.599> that<00:02:52.780> whole<00:02:53.170> thing<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.709> half

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
and then fold that whole thing in half

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.360 
and then fold that whole thing in half
and<00:02:55.569> now<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.810> see<00:02:56.200> how<00:02:56.349> easy<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.739> is<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:57.190> make

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
and now you see how easy it is to make

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.750 
and now you see how easy it is to make
the<00:02:57.520> cage<00:02:57.790> for<00:02:58.180> your<00:02:58.300> beat<00:02:58.540> at<00:02:59.410> this<00:02:59.650> point<00:03:00.010> you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
the cage for your beat at this point you

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.320 
the cage for your beat at this point you
can<00:03:01.090> pop<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.810> open<00:03:02.580> sliding<00:03:03.580> your<00:03:03.910> bead<00:03:04.060> now

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
can pop that open sliding your bead now

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.229 
can pop that open sliding your bead now
where<00:03:04.480> these<00:03:04.630> are<00:03:04.810> oval<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.530> flat<00:03:06.239> round

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
where these are oval and flat round

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.330 
where these are oval and flat round
beads<00:03:07.569> really<00:03:07.840> are<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.200> best<00:03:08.349> ones<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.830> start

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
beads really are the best ones to start

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.190 
beads really are the best ones to start
with<00:03:09.550> if<00:03:09.940> you've<00:03:10.180> never<00:03:10.420> worked<00:03:10.660> with<00:03:10.900> wire

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
with if you've never worked with wire

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.559 
with if you've never worked with wire
before<00:03:11.500> I'd<00:03:11.800> recommend<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.370> but<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.420> could

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
before I'd recommend that but you could

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.360 
before I'd recommend that but you could
just<00:03:13.599> take<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.959> little<00:03:14.170> time<00:03:14.530> like<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:14.890> said<00:03:15.010> did

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
just take a little time like I said did

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.870 
just take a little time like I said did
soft<00:03:15.730> wire<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.360> great<00:03:16.690> because<00:03:17.140> it's<00:03:18.099> softest

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
soft wire is great because it's softest

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.270 
soft wire is great because it's softest
and<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.450> can<00:03:19.690> manipulate<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.830> with<00:03:21.069> your

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
and you can manipulate it with your

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.699 
and you can manipulate it with your
fingers<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.239> want<00:03:22.540> those<00:03:22.870> loops<00:03:23.500> that

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
fingers and you want those loops that

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.490 
fingers and you want those loops that
you<00:03:23.769> started<00:03:24.340> with<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.819> line<00:03:25.060> up<00:03:25.360> with<00:03:25.720> the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
you started with to line up with the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.030 
you started with to line up with the
holes<00:03:26.739> in<00:03:27.130> your<00:03:27.340> bead<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:29.590> repeat

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
holes in your bead and so just repeat
