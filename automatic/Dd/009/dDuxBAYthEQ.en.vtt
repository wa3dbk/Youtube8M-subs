00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370

thought<00:02:54.510> there<00:02:54.690> was<00:02:54.780> potential<00:02:55.260> for<00:02:55.290> an

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
thought there was potential for an

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.400 
thought there was potential for an
incredibly<00:02:55.920> strong<00:02:56.400> woman<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.380> think

fascinating and I love working on her

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.020 
fascinating and I love working on her
her<00:03:11.040> storyline<00:03:15.590> when<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.680> got<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.950> role<00:03:17.130> did

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
her storyline when you got the role did

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.090

you<00:03:18.180> study<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.110> 1918<00:03:19.829> seven<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:21.769> didn't<00:03:22.769> study

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
you study the 1918 seven I didn't study

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.130 
you study the 1918 seven I didn't study
it<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.790> looked<00:03:24.720> at<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:26.299> think<00:03:27.299> my<00:03:27.450> whole<00:03:27.810> thing

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
it I looked at it I think my whole thing

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.509 
it I looked at it I think my whole thing
is<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.880> understand<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.989> underlying

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
is to understand the underlying

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.559 
is to understand the underlying
metaphors<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.790> something

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
metaphors of something

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.750 
metaphors of something
and<00:03:33.659> then<00:03:34.230> look<00:03:34.709> at<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.040> material<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.640> we

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and then look at the material that we

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.699 
and then look at the material that we
have<00:03:35.939> because<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.359> it's<00:03:36.840> very<00:03:37.170> different<00:03:37.439> I

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
have because it's it's very different I

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.110 
have because it's it's very different I
think<00:03:38.540> although<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:39.749> have<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> lot<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.290> little

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
think although we have a lot of little

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.030 
think although we have a lot of little
tributes<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.299> homages<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:43.260> more<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.859> more

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.259 
question I didn't really study it but I
looked<00:03:52.590> at<00:03:52.709> one<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.400> things<00:03:53.609> I<00:03:53.730> asked

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
looked at one of the things I asked

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.470 
looked at one of the things I asked
Kelly<00:03:54.540> was<00:03:54.810> how<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.560> show<00:03:56.489> is<00:03:56.519> changed<00:03:57.389> or

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
Kelly was how the show is changed or

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.629 
Kelly was how the show is changed or
evolved<00:03:58.019> not<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.590> much<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.709> character<00:03:59.219> but<00:03:59.459> in

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
evolved not so much a character but in

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.399 
evolved not so much a character but in
terms<00:03:59.849> of<00:03:59.969> just<00:04:00.239> how<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.540> group<00:04:00.959> has<00:04:01.079> gone<00:04:01.290> to

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
terms of just how the group has gone to

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.409 
terms of just how the group has gone to
trauma<00:04:01.620> things<00:04:01.829> so<00:04:02.010> in<00:04:02.069> your<00:04:02.129> mind<00:04:02.189> how<00:04:03.150> has

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
trauma things so in your mind how has

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.629 
trauma things so in your mind how has
that<00:04:03.450> show<00:04:04.319> change<00:04:04.620> at<00:04:04.950> school<00:04:05.189> I<00:04:05.280> think<00:04:05.370> it's

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
that show change at school I think it's

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.240 
that show change at school I think it's
the<00:04:05.730> first<00:04:05.879> season<00:04:06.269> of<00:04:06.299> thing<00:04:06.950> trying<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.040> find

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
than Heather remains them I mean it does

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.660 
than Heather remains them I mean it does
Katherine<00:06:25.470> want<00:06:25.740> her<00:06:25.890> sister<00:06:26.220> to<00:06:26.310> remain<00:06:26.550> in

the dark obviously ultimately no but for

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.550 
the dark obviously ultimately no but for
everyone's<00:06:30.330> safety<00:06:30.630> which<00:06:31.050> is<00:06:31.080> Katherine's
