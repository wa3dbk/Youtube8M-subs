00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.500
 terrorists before meeting big

 Sevens Russia deliberately frustrated meeting 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.129

 disruption of the Minsk agreements on their 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.470

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.120
 so-called food 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.190

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.900
 food consumer goods in 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.330
 occupied areas of Donetsk and 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.550
 Lugansk region should not bus it 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.070

 order to fulfill the Minsk Agreement and 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.630
