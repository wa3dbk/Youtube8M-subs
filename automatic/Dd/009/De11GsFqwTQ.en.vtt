00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 good afternoon dear viewers and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.370
 my channel followers are with you like 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.319
 always a clash of ivan and this channel and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.660
 windows windows phone and tell today 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.610
 about how to use micro sd card on 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.990
 your windows smartphone 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.109
 phone 8.1 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.750
 and so first a little background 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.289
 in that windows phone 7 7 and a half 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.600
 7 8 there was no support for micro sd card it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.609
 was a big problem the first time this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.310
 the function was implemented it touched 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.949
 added windows phone 8 but there she is 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.750
 was somewhat limited and if i 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.489
 I'm not confusing the windows phone 8 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.850
 initially it was impossible to install 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.230
 application on micro sd card could be 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.309
 download photos of music there 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.320
 some other files but 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.570
 application installation not supported 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.570
 installing applications on sd card 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.510
 windows phone 8.1 appeared and now 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.370
 support for micro sd card is implemented as 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.370
 same as on other platforms and 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.440
 just works just fine now 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.879
 I'll tell you about this a little more 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.619
 all the latest news from the camp 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.220
 microsoft you will find in our group 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.500
 in contact with 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.510
 microsoft information we tell 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.920
 good news 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 its not a long time 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.020
 it was possible to test this 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.110
 feature since all the flagships but 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.540
 most lumia flagships on windows 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.220
 phones do not have micro sd support 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.799
 now in my hands acer liquid mt 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.920
 s120 is low cost devices here 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.020
 sd card support and so what you need 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.810
 let's say you have a smartphone which 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.900
 Supports micro riding setup 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.460
 bathe card volume varies from 32 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.170
 gigabytes up to one hundred twenty eight gigabytes 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.369
 This is the volume supported by micro sd card 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.360
 Which card does your device support? 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.799
 need to watch the specifications and so but 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.820
 it is advisable to buy the maximum amount 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.250
 for your device 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.040
 speed class is desirable I choose 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 I think 10 because these cards are not worth 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.899
 so expensive quality they have kataev 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.820
 seriously higher and so you need you 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.369
 put the main application card 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.350
 which you will use it will be 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.000
 of course memory control and in this 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.330
 application you can control how 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.660
 internal memory of the device 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.540
 so and sd-card and what is on it 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.720
 this content is categorized 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.120
 application system games music video 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.890
 podcasts and so on in the app 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.470
 memory control you can immediately specify 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.080
 what content and where will be stored 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.330
 look we can specify a place for 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.870
 new music videos and podcasts now 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.420
 I am worth 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.480
 sd card you can choose between sd 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.980
 card and internal phone storage 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.830
 You can also specify and save 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.700
 new photos on sd card either in 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.340
 the phone I have repeatedly encountered 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.170
 these on android devices and personally i 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.300
 always keep photos in memory 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.860
 phone 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.290
 then you can specify where 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.680
 you can install new applications 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.720
 specify 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.220
 sd card is also very cool then 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.110
 convenient as I said this background 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.940
 windows phone 8.1 appeared 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.730
 you can install without problems 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.920
 application on sd card and even if you 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.600
 enough budget device which 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.380
 let's say 4 or 8 gigabytes of built-in 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.510
 of memory 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.090
 you can buy a micro memory card 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.519
 sd 32 gigabytes and install even 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.190
 heavy resource-intensive games and applications 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.040
 which take up a lot of memory and 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.709
 you will not have any problems well and 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.440
 the rest of the settings about what 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.380
 put the micro go setting up once 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.950
 what to do you can feel 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.900
 yourself happy let's say you have little 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.000
 there is little memory left on the phone 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.489
 See the following situation you can 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.530
 transfer the application from the phoneâ€™s memory 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.489
 on micro sd card 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.709
 let it be for example csoft pusher 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.170
 fail in the app and what we see 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.239
 we can remove the application can 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.400
 estimate how much takes place how much 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.300
 memory takes its data and we can 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.300
 move to sd card 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.190
 porting an application takes some 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.830
 time after this application from memory 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.180
 phones disappears and appears on from 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.500
 neckline does not affect his 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.540
 career performance on those 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.270
 the positions that I tested it 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.729
 no effect on speed and in 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.630
 I did not notice the launch of any problems with 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.940
 by this 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.940
 let's see here it is 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.300
 if you have a card do not hold 10 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.610
 class problems then you just will not see but 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.600
 in general, everything still works and everything 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.790
 very cool as I understood not all 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.860
 applications can be installed and 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.650
 transferred to micro sd card 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.230
 The fact is that the application developer 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.630
 decides whether his application can 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.820
 work on micro sd card 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.980
 whether it can be transferred there or not 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.020
 maybe everything will depend on it 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.780
 directly from the developer himself 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.040
 how he optimizes and how he 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.930
 implements its application 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.460
 so if you are suddenly faced with the fact that 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.920
 the application on the memory card is not 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.230
 tolerated does not work then do not be scared 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.090
 so it goes, of course, after that 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.100
 how do you put a micro memory card 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.480
 go your smartphone you will need 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.070
 some file manager 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.840
 you can use standard 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.170
 application files which i have once 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.700
 told this branded application from 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.590
 microsoft besides you can search 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.160
 store some other file 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.620
 manager 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.050
 good to eat now has become quite a lot 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.060
 they appear and this kind of application 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.150
 can show you the physical structure 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.110
 directories and files on your card or in 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.360
 phone memory 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.850
 let's show now how the installation is going 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.770
 new applications let's find 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:53.270
 something new interesting not 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.100
 even new and interesting 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.030
 just install some 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.800
 new application 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.290
 let me remind you that now in my settings 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.490
 worth downloading and installing 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.950
 applications to the memory card 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.980
 look at how much this is true and whether 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.280
 this is actually so application 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.280
 established 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.310
 it works starts now let's 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.040
 let's see where it is established with us 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.020
 and yes she stopped at the memory card 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.420
 those. see what the situation is doing 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.520
 necessary settings only once you 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.920
 get working correctly and 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.450
 correctly configured system and so 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.580
 way if your smartphone supports 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.320
 installation of micro sd memory cards 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.600
 then no problems with disk 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.640
 space you will not have bought 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.860
 raschel card and available memory 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.840
 and enjoy in general everything is enough 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.630
 great everything works i really want to 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.160
 in the next its flagships in lumia 950 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.650
 950 xl 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.790
 microsoft implemented card support 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.120
 micro sd memory 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:55.940
 it is very convenient it is very useful i 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.160
 I hope we will see it all with you 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.140
 it was vakhrushev ivan it was my story about 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.330
 using micro sd memory cards on 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.860
 windows phone smartphone put likes
