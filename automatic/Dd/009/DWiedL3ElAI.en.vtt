00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.720 
special I mean half the demons are
actually<00:03:20.859> killed<00:03:21.129> in<00:03:21.280> pretty<00:03:21.489> much<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.609> same

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
actually killed in pretty much the same

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.170 
actually killed in pretty much the same
way<00:03:22.269> it's<00:03:22.540> really<00:03:22.870> not<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:24.190> interesting<00:03:24.879> but

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
way it's really not that interesting but

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.050 
way it's really not that interesting but
I<00:03:26.069> mean<00:03:27.069> yeah<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.609> is<00:03:27.730> pretty<00:03:27.849> repetitive

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
I mean yeah it is pretty repetitive

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.610 
I mean yeah it is pretty repetitive
their<00:03:28.480> bracelets<00:03:28.840> went<00:03:29.109> from<00:03:29.200> demon<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.590> demon

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
their bracelets went from demon to demon

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.740 
their bracelets went from demon to demon
killing<00:03:30.340> them<00:03:30.489> getting<00:03:30.879> a<00:03:31.030> body<00:03:31.329> part<00:03:31.569> each

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
killing them getting a body part each

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.629 
killing them getting a body part each
time<00:03:31.959> he<00:03:32.019> kills<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.319> demon<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.709> body<00:03:32.920> part<00:03:33.220> his

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
time he kills a demon a body part his

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.020 
time he kills a demon a body part his
real<00:03:33.909> body<00:03:34.120> part<00:03:34.389> grows<00:03:34.629> because<00:03:34.930> he<00:03:35.109> has<00:03:36.030> fake

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
real body part grows because he has fake

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.250 
real body part grows because he has fake
ones<00:03:38.040> put<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.129> there<00:03:39.280> by<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.489> doctor

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
ones put in there by the doctor

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.539 
ones put in there by the doctor
so<00:03:41.260> you're<00:03:41.439> just<00:03:41.470> basically<00:03:41.799> watching<00:03:42.280> him<00:03:42.400> go

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
so you're just basically watching him go

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.099 
so you're just basically watching him go
through<00:03:42.819> and<00:03:43.000> collecting<00:03:43.389> his<00:03:43.480> body<00:03:43.720> parts

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
through and collecting his body parts

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.229 
through and collecting his body parts
and<00:03:44.650> he<00:03:44.799> already<00:03:44.919> starts<00:03:45.370> off<00:03:45.519> with<00:03:45.699> sixteen

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
and he already starts off with sixteen

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.640 
and he already starts off with sixteen
body<00:03:46.540> parts<00:03:46.930> so<00:03:47.079> you<00:03:47.109> don't<00:03:47.349> have<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.530> go

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
body parts so you don't have to go

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.990 
body parts so you don't have to go
through<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.859> whole<00:03:48.010> thing<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.489> they<00:03:48.849> don't

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
through the whole thing and they don't

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.550 
through the whole thing and they don't
even<00:03:49.090> finish<00:03:49.389> you<00:03:49.660> know<00:03:49.750> they<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.319> get<00:03:50.410> like

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
even finish you know they you get like

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.280 
even finish you know they you get like
ten<00:03:50.889> or<00:03:51.040> so<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:52.510> story<00:03:52.810> kind<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.109> just
