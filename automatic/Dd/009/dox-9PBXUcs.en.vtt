00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.430 
it take to submit a spec script for TV
well<00:00:12.090> first<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.420> all<00:00:12.450> you've<00:00:12.929> got<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.320> a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
well first of all you've got to have a

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.269 
well first of all you've got to have a
really<00:00:13.950> good<00:00:14.160> spec<00:00:14.519> script<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:16.560> lot<00:00:17.160> of

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
really good spec script and a lot of

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.980 
really good spec script and a lot of
writers<00:00:17.520> think<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:20.820> big<00:00:21.119> obstacle

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
writers think is that the big obstacle

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.620 
writers think is that the big obstacle
is<00:00:22.580> sending<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> script<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.510> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
is sending the script in and that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.599 
is sending the script in and that
certainly<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.199> an<00:00:25.350> obstacle<00:00:25.710> because<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.340> do

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
certainly is an obstacle because you do

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.820 
certainly is an obstacle because you do
need<00:00:26.849> an<00:00:26.970> agent<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.170> through<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.680> door

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
need an agent to get it through the door

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.049 
need an agent to get it through the door
to<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.789> somebody<00:00:30.150> look<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.800> but<00:00:31.800> by<00:00:32.579> far

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
to have somebody look at it but by far

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.049 
to have somebody look at it but by far
the<00:00:33.270> bigger<00:00:33.480> obstacle<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.460> writers<00:00:35.460> face<00:00:35.760> is

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the bigger obstacle that writers face is

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.389 
the bigger obstacle that writers face is
writing<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.020> spec<00:00:37.410> script<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.950> good<00:00:38.250> enough

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
writing a spec script that's good enough

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.780 
writing a spec script that's good enough
to<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.969> sent<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> first<00:00:40.050> place<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
to be sent in in the first place and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.940 
to be sent in in the first place and
this<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.149> where<00:00:42.510> learning<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> craft<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
this is where learning the craft is so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.549 
this is where learning the craft is so
important<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.820> we're<00:00:45.780> writing<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.260> spec

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
important and we're writing a spec

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.180 
important and we're writing a spec
script<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> particular<00:00:47.969> show<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
script of a particular show and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.779 
script of a particular show and
executing<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.300> important

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
executing it really well is so important

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.360 
executing it really well is so important
keep<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.940> mind<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.649> send<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.070> spec

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
keep in mind that when you send a spec

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.450 
keep in mind that when you send a spec
script<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.379> it<00:00:58.379> will<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.800> read<00:00:59.129> by<00:00:59.399> someone<00:00:59.460> of

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
script in it will be read by someone of

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.910 
script in it will be read by someone of
where<00:01:02.460> whatever<00:01:03.210> shows<00:01:03.750> they<00:01:04.049> send<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> spec

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
where whatever shows they send the spec

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.030 
where whatever shows they send the spec
script<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:06.570> will<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.840> read<00:01:07.229> by<00:01:07.439> somebody<00:01:07.770> on

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
script to it will be read by somebody on

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.359 
script to it will be read by somebody on
that<00:01:08.250> show<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.799> what<00:01:10.799> they're<00:01:10.979> looking<00:01:11.159> for

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that show and what they're looking for

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.050 
that show and what they're looking for
is<00:01:12.270> did<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.140> execute<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.250> way<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.760> show<00:01:15.030> is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is did you execute the way this show is

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
is did you execute the way this show is
done<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:15.750> each<00:01:16.049> show<00:01:16.320> has<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> very

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
done because each show has a very

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.969 
done because each show has a very
specific<00:01:17.729> set<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.390> rules<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.799> these

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
specific set of rules so we do these

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.520 
specific set of rules so we do these
things<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.700> don't<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:21.150> those<00:01:21.330> things<00:01:21.530> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
things and we don't do those things and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.749 
things and we don't do those things and
if<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.070> don't<00:01:23.310> know<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:25.680> make<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
if you don't know that and you make the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.990 
if you don't know that and you make the
mistake<00:01:27.590> for<00:01:28.590> example<00:01:29.009> some<00:01:29.189> shows<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.850> not

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
mistake for example some shows do not

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.929 
mistake for example some shows do not
have<00:01:30.210> cliffhangers<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.960> won't<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.939> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
have cliffhangers they won't do that and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.819 
have cliffhangers they won't do that and
if<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.750> write<00:01:33.930> cliffhangers<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.710> your

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
if you write cliffhangers in your

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.719 
if you write cliffhangers in your
episode<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:37.229> want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:38.040> can

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
episode it's out they want to see can

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.780 
episode it's out they want to see can
you<00:01:38.759> write<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.990> show<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:41.340> remember

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
you write this show because remember

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.120 
you write this show because remember
that<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:42.540> very<00:01:42.869> challenging<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.890> writer

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that that's very challenging for writer

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.249 
that that's very challenging for writer
