I'll<00:01:35.570> clone<00:01:35.870> at<00:01:36.020> once<00:01:36.260> and<00:01:37.190> now<00:01:37.370> we<00:01:37.430> should

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
I'll clone at once and now we should

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.500 
I'll clone at once and now we should
have<00:01:37.790> a<00:01:37.850> pretty<00:01:38.000> decent<00:01:38.450> obstacle<00:01:38.930> course<00:01:40.510> get

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
have a pretty decent obstacle course get

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.470 
have a pretty decent obstacle course get
down

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.960

you guys want to hear a joke so a rabbit
walks<00:01:52.180> into<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.540> bar

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.870 

God<00:01:57.780> even<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.860> felt<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:04.640> gotta<00:02:05.640> say

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
God even I felt that one I gotta say

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.620 
God even I felt that one I gotta say
Robert<00:02:06.270> he<00:02:06.479> would<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.720> terrible<00:02:07.290> at<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.590> limo

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
Robert he would be terrible at the limo

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.940 
Robert he would be terrible at the limo
so<00:02:09.630> those<00:02:09.780> are<00:02:09.959> some<00:02:09.990> of<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> latest<00:02:10.470> features

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
so those are some of the latest features

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.070 
so those are some of the latest features
in<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.220> overgrowth<00:02:11.640> alphas<00:02:12.120> remember

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
in the overgrowth alphas remember

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.420 
in the overgrowth alphas remember
they're<00:02:13.230> still<00:02:13.500> very<00:02:13.709> much<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> work<00:02:14.130> in

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
they're still very much a work in

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.100 
they're still very much a work in
progress<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.150> don't<00:02:15.330> expect<00:02:15.480> them<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.959> look

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
progress so don't expect them to look

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
progress so don't expect them to look
perfect<00:02:16.319> yet<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.950> also<00:02:17.400> keep<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.730> mind<00:02:17.790> that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
perfect yet and also keep in mind that

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.610 
perfect yet and also keep in mind that
almost<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> movement<00:02:19.260> code<00:02:19.440> is

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
almost all of the movement code is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.350 
almost all of the movement code is
exposed<00:02:20.069> externally<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.940> scripting

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
exposed externally in the scripting

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.210 
exposed externally in the scripting
layer<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.140> if<00:02:22.290> you're<00:02:22.380> hardcore<00:02:22.680> there's<00:02:23.130> no

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
layer so if you're hardcore there's no

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.710 
layer so if you're hardcore there's no
reason<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.580> can't<00:02:23.850> go<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.480> start

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
reason you can't go in there and start

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.390 
reason you can't go in there and start
