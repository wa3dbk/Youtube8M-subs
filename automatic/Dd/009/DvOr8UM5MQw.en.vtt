00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.150

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:10.030

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.110
 of the conca that kicked well 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.230
 [Music] 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.840
 then I come back he corrective in a 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.420
 concealer brush and will mark a 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.210
 little more than the part that I came with 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.990
 shade then only protection from 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.270
 marking so it gets more cute is a 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.560
 thing and the way I 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.980
 I wanted some 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.980
 [Music] 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.300
 if you do not want you do not need 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.730
 doing this part is only if you want to 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.730
 with the car well marked undefined 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.780
 [Music] 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.360
 he had in the glue again is the shadow 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.900
 clear from the beginning of it has a 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.709
 umbrella clear nice cool pretty 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.080
 and will give a cool looking light and 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:46.060
 I'm tapping on the failed chip. 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.650
 to fix better shade again comes with 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.880
 a brown shadow now to do this 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.130
 gradient and looks pretty good 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.130
 [Music] 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.080
 and I'm mixing 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.670
 With the lapse brush you will get a shadow 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.670
 dark brown again and now I'm going to score 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.700
 more with my conca to give again 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:28.720
 more definition makes a little 20 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.610
 upper eyelashes to fuse with a 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.489
 eyeliner conversation with liner 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.290
 from having passed a 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.870
 little eyeliner and now I'm going 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.609
 smoke a little to not be so 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.250
 marked eyeliner wants it to stay 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.250
 that they a line along with black 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.500
 [Music] 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.180
 this same way but if you do not 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.639
 want you do not need you can see 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.060
 with eyeliner and make kitty that 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.060
 you want 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.269
 it disappears 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.290
 with the same eyeliner I can now 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.870
 we have the upper eyelashes and 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.290
 inferior 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:22.620
 scoring well both in the water line 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:25.020
 How much under the kids to stay? 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.420
 with well marked oil well or black 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.820
 when you record very closely 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.540
 we do not have much sense of where 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.540
 camera is catching 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.170
 Hey 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.779
 [Music] 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.840
 then I get a brown shadow again 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.790
 and blow away this part of the black along with 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.220
 your shadow power gives a 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.220
 The most beautiful effect is the make 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.170
 It was a lot of people that you liked 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.630
 This tutorial was quick, but it's just 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.090
 for you to have an idea that is godmother 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.550

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.510
