00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.840 
for I honestly think the ace was a
better<00:03:16.989> looking<00:03:17.380> shoot<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.489> just<00:03:18.640> didn't

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
better looking shoot and just didn't

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.670 
better looking shoot and just didn't
come<00:03:19.000> up<00:03:19.030> with<00:03:19.270> enough<00:03:19.989> color<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.470> but

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
come up with enough color is but

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.289 
come up with enough color is but
the<00:03:20.770> LeBron<00:03:21.100> eyes<00:03:21.370> are<00:03:21.580> dropping<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:22.090> all
