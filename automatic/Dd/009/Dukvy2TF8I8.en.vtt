a3 how I want these ideas to be
implemented<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> game<00:00:48.510> why<00:00:49.350> they're<00:00:49.590> not

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800

going<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:00.989> implemented<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.739> or<00:03:01.860> fair

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
going to be implemented in one or fair

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.370 
going to be implemented in one or fair
three<00:03:02.400> from<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.880> information<00:03:03.390> leak<00:03:03.570> they

three from this information leak they
said<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.860> there<00:03:05.040> was<00:03:05.190> going<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.550> be<00:03:05.730> two

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
said that there was going to be two

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.170 
said that there was going to be two
perks<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.110> sort<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.410> split<00:03:07.709> up<00:03:07.920> ghosts<00:03:08.430> one

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
perks that sort of split up ghosts one

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.540 
perks that sort of split up ghosts one
which<00:03:09.390> separated<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.080> from<00:03:10.110> UAV<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.010> one

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
which separated you from UAV and one

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.130 
which separated you from UAV and one
separated<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.360> from<00:03:12.390> kill<00:03:12.720> Street<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.080> you

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
separated you from kill Street so you

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.229 
separated you from kill Street so you
weren't<00:03:13.410> immune<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.890> both<00:03:14.070> at<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.730> same<00:03:14.940> time

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
weren't immune to both at the same time

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.240 
weren't immune to both at the same time
the<00:03:15.750> likelihood<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.200> they<00:03:16.470> didn't<00:03:16.709> implement

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the likelihood is they didn't implement

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.860 
the likelihood is they didn't implement
these<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.519> two<00:03:17.730> different<00:03:17.910> perks<00:03:18.269> slots<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
these in two different perks slots and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.720 
these in two different perks slots and
so<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.560> couldn't<00:03:19.799> use<00:03:19.950> them<00:03:20.070> both<00:03:20.190> oh<00:03:20.430> sorry

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
so you couldn't use them both oh sorry

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.400 
so you couldn't use them both oh sorry
in<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.940> same<00:03:21.150> perks<00:03:21.420> up<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.019> couldn't<00:03:22.260> use

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
in the same perks up so you couldn't use

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.100 
in the same perks up so you couldn't use
them<00:03:22.590> at<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.739> same<00:03:22.860> time<00:03:23.540> now<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.570> do<00:03:24.690> not<00:03:24.930> want

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
them at the same time now I do not want

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.960 
them at the same time now I do not want
to<00:03:25.200> see<00:03:25.350> ghosts<00:03:25.650> if<00:03:25.920> if<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.459> perk<00:03:26.760> system

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
to see ghosts if if this perk system

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.940 
to see ghosts if if this perk system
isn't<00:03:27.570> going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.900> happen<00:03:28.049> then<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.739> want

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
isn't going to happen then I want

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.860 
isn't going to happen then I want
something<00:03:29.400> similar<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.180> idea<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.750> be

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
something similar to this idea to be

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.750 
something similar to this idea to be
implemented<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.470> modern<00:03:31.650> warfare<00:03:31.799> 3<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.579> make

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
implemented in modern warfare 3 to make

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.640 
implemented in modern warfare 3 to make
it<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.690> gameplay<00:03:33.900> isn't<00:03:34.290> slowed

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
it so that the gameplay isn't slowed

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.220 
it so that the gameplay isn't slowed
down<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:36.450> something<00:03:36.900> such<00:03:37.200> as

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
down and so that if something such as

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.660 
down and so that if something such as
calling<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.549> UAVs<00:03:39.120> or<00:03:40.049> calling<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:41.310> think

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
calling in to UAVs or calling in I think

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.100 
calling in to UAVs or calling in I think
I<00:03:41.880> think<00:03:42.090> calling<00:03:42.299> into<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> bee's<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.900> good

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
I think calling into a bee's is a good

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.340 
I think calling into a bee's is a good
idea

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
idea

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.860 
idea
so<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.860> calling<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> UAVs<00:03:45.239> even<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
so that calling in to a UAVs even if the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.810 
so that calling in to a UAVs even if the
person<00:03:46.079> is<00:03:46.290> using<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.709> ghost<00:03:47.040> equivalent<00:03:47.610> perk

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
person is using a ghost equivalent perk

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.970 
person is using a ghost equivalent perk
means<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.079> cancels<00:03:49.560> out<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.739> fact<00:03:49.950> that

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
means that it cancels out the fact that

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.490 
means that it cancels out the fact that
they're<00:03:50.160> using<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.790> height<00:03:51.720> or<00:03:51.959> hiding<00:03:52.350> from

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
they're using the height or hiding from

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.370 
they're using the height or hiding from
the<00:03:52.680> UAV<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.730> then<00:03:53.880> makes<00:03:54.150> some<00:03:54.380> visible

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
the UAV and it then makes some visible

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.259 
the UAV and it then makes some visible
to<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.560> UAV<00:03:55.799> users<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.489> know<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:56.790> one<00:03:57.060> won't

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
to the UAV users you know so one won't

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.520 
to the UAV users you know so one won't
do<00:03:57.360> anything<00:03:57.540> but<00:03:57.750> two<00:03:57.930> will<00:03:58.049> show<00:03:58.200> them<00:03:58.350> up<00:03:58.410> on

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
do anything but two will show them up on

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.680 
do anything but two will show them up on
the<00:03:58.620> map<00:03:58.829> so<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.670> think<00:03:59.760> that's<00:04:00.030> my<00:04:00.120> my<00:04:00.630> two

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
the map so I think that's my my two

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.300 
the map so I think that's my my two
cents<00:04:01.019> towards<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.890> it'd<00:04:02.190> be

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
cents towards that and it'd be

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.500 
cents towards that and it'd be
interesting<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.850> see<00:04:02.970> if<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.120> guys<00:04:03.299> think

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
interesting to see if you guys think

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.000 
interesting to see if you guys think
goes<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.810> cheap<00:04:04.079> perk<00:04:04.320> or<00:04:04.590> if<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.769> think

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
goes to the cheap perk or if you think

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.940 
goes to the cheap perk or if you think
is<00:04:05.459> perfect<00:04:06.390> genuine<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.620> part<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:07.890> the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
is perfect genuine and is part of the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.970 
is perfect genuine and is part of the
game<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.660> now<00:04:09.660> new<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.200> be<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.440> hate<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.799> new

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
game and now new to be I hate a new

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.620 
game and now new to be I hate a new
tubing<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.519> don't<00:04:11.760> think<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.000> has<00:04:12.090> any<00:04:12.239> place<00:04:12.480> in

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
tubing I don't think it has any place in

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.750 
tubing I don't think it has any place in
cool<00:04:12.810> juicy<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.380> it's<00:04:14.010> been<00:04:14.190> confirmed<00:04:14.549> in

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
cool juicy and it's been confirmed in

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.740 
cool juicy and it's been confirmed in
modern<00:04:14.940> warfare<00:04:15.060> 3

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
modern warfare 3

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.449 
modern warfare 3
4:02<00:04:16.200> said<00:04:16.530> they've<00:04:16.650> implemented<00:04:17.070> at<00:04:17.340> this

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
4:02 said they've implemented at this

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.099 
4:02 said they've implemented at this
time<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:17.970> game<00:04:18.090> in<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.690> correct<00:04:19.019> manner

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
time in the game in a correct manner

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.810 
time in the game in a correct manner
which<00:04:19.470> means<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.890> it's<00:04:20.039> not<00:04:20.100> annoying<00:04:20.549> it's

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
which means that it's not annoying it's

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.339 
which means that it's not annoying it's
going<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.060> hopefully<00:04:21.269> be<00:04:21.510> done<00:04:21.780> in<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.019> good<00:04:22.200> way

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
going to hopefully be done in a good way

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.659 
going to hopefully be done in a good way
this<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.950> how<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.099> think<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.520> should<00:04:23.640> be

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
this is how I think it should be

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.310 
this is how I think it should be
implemented<00:04:24.240> basically<00:04:24.660> they're<00:04:24.840> keeping<00:04:25.169> in

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
implemented basically they're keeping in

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.719 
implemented basically they're keeping in
game<00:04:25.590> for<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:25.860> reason<00:04:26.250> this<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.370> why<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.610> think

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
game for this reason this is why I think

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.990 
game for this reason this is why I think
they're<00:04:26.970> justifying<00:04:27.479> it

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
they're justifying it

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.780 
they're justifying it
in<00:04:28.330> all<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.750> cool<00:04:28.930> duty<00:04:29.200> games<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:30.190> stop

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
in all the cool duty games to stop

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.490 
in all the cool duty games to stop
camping<00:04:31.150> basically<00:04:31.630> if<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.110> see<00:04:32.140> someone

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
camping basically if you see someone

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.050 
camping basically if you see someone
camping<00:04:32.800> in<00:04:32.890> a<00:04:32.980> room<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.700> you've<00:04:33.820> got<00:04:33.940> no

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
camping in a room and you've got no

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.700 
camping in a room and you've got no
grenades<00:04:34.270> you've<00:04:34.720> only<00:04:34.810> got<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.020> gun<00:04:35.230> there's

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
grenades you've only got a gun there's

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.780 
grenades you've only got a gun there's
no<00:04:35.890> way<00:04:36.010> you're<00:04:36.130> gonna<00:04:36.220> be<00:04:36.310> able<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.520> get<00:04:36.640> them

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
no way you're gonna be able to get them

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.030 
no way you're gonna be able to get them
out<00:04:36.880> of<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.180> corner<00:04:37.480> if<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:38.590> can't<00:04:38.860> shoot

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
out of that corner if you can't shoot

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.650 
out of that corner if you can't shoot
through<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.310> wall<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:40.150> noob<00:04:40.330> tube<00:04:40.570> is

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
through the wall and the noob tube is

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.050 
through the wall and the noob tube is
there<00:04:40.900> then<00:04:41.260> implemented<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.280> shoot<00:04:42.610> into

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
there then implemented to shoot into

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.690 
there then implemented to shoot into
that<00:04:43.240> really<00:04:43.900> annoying<00:04:44.200> spot<00:04:44.560> and<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.520> get

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
that really annoying spot and to get

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.430 
that really annoying spot and to get
them<00:04:45.820> out<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.120> camping<00:04:46.540> position<00:04:46.960> now
