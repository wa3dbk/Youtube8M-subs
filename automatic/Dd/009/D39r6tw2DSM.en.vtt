00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
compared to the the iPod Nano an older
generation<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.260> here's<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> iPod<00:00:43.980> Touch

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

current generation you can see it's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.510 
current generation you can see it's
actually<00:00:46.410> smaller<00:00:46.800> than<00:00:47.070> both<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> I'd

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
actually smaller than both and I'd

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.889 
actually smaller than both and I'd
really<00:00:47.789> say<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.210> more<00:00:48.329> comparable<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899

the iPod shuffle even though it's about
half<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> price<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:53.370> actually<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:53.850> higher

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
half the price it's actually more higher

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.310 
half the price it's actually more higher
capacity<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.840> half<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.199> price

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
capacity and half the price
