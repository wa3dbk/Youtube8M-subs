00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.130
 ah 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.340
 today in the channel how is it done we are going to 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.890
 prepare a nougat ice cream 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.660
 let's move on to the recipe then let's go 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.030
 to need the following ingredients 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.910
 first of all we will use cream 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.970
 liquid to mount it with the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.460
 machine milk sugar and nougat in my case 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.050
 I have cream nougat but if you 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.990
 can access a nougat bar 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.119
 normal soft or just cut it the 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.040
 nougat bar in half and the 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.230
 dissolve with a little milk and the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.690
 they use 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.790
 ok let's first prepare the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.700
 whipped cream put it into the kneader 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.559
 and we will set an average speed and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.540
 we let him go riding 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.940
 important to watch because in any 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.460
 moment we can cut and would pass 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.670
 be butter let's mix the three 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.620
 remaining ingredients the milk the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 sugar and nougat 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.420
 and this we will pass it down 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.890
 with some rods we can 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.250
 beat until everything is so 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.250
 homogeneous 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.659
 then we will pass it to a saucepan and 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.960
 we will pass it to a medium fire 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.870
 we will use a wooden spoon where 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.770
 we will make movements slowly 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.320
 and when they spend a few minutes the nougat or 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.570
 the mass that we are using start at 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.050
 express yourself and when you start 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.260
 to boil then we turned it off 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.790
 fire and we set our our pot 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.790
 of the heat source 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.020
 and we can help with a bowl with a 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.770
 little water to cool us faster 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.659
 then we go around 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.659
 and then we passed it to a bowl 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.650
 and now it would only take away from us 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.099
 mix the whipped cream 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.299
 with the dough that we have achieved and this 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.299
 we will do it with enveloping movements 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.220
 so as not to lose the air that the cream has 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.739
 and so we will have one more ice cream 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.739
 spongy and tastier 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.060
 let's cool the dough for it the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.450
 same bowl with the water we add a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.460
 little ice and we'll leave it 6th and a few 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.280
 minutes 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.280
 and then we put it in the refrigerator 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.180
 we already have the prepared side what 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.099
 we will put in a bowl and then what 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.349
 we will put in the freezer and what 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.400
 We will have a few hours to go to 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:07.629
 ripen the ice cream 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.379
 then we can place it and we can 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.360
 add a bit of almond shavings 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.060
 crushed this will give you a taste 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.540
 great but this we will put it 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.540
 over 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.319
 then here we already have the degree 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.300
 prepared is ours the result and 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.990
 I will also show you the ingredients 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.990
 see you soon
