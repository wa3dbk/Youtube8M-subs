00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.309
 and well then with a million now later what 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.930

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.000
 calling the police but hey it does not happen 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.910

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.260
 is a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.470
 I repeat it for the umpteenth time it's a vast 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.320
 da but good is fast now I teach you 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.060
 how fast can it be and look is 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.100
 here you can see it more or less good 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.080
 some of us will not notice it much but others 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.390
 that you're in a car crap 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.729
 well you will notice a little no then good 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.530
 there's a little bit of relaxation but good 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.590
 I care a lot because I already have the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.580
 bugatti veyron parked in the house worth 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.710
 and the truth is that it happens a little to me 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 lining that this bugatti came to ruin 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.810
 not so good then look 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.329
 Well, I got everything up here a little 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.450
 driving extremely we went through 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.990
 here in the middle perfect and good we 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.149
 we take to see 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.000
 to see then we put here the map that 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.250
 we go to the airport then to take a 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.080
 airplane like this 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.270
 and well look everything I show you here 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.650
 bugatti saw on the internet not the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.250

 from the east one million turkeys are blown 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.479
 valuable is a crap worth is a scam 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.850
 since good you can not have there for free 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.350
 and you just have to escape nothing 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.020
 two seconds of the police because there will be 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.640
 in some subnormal by there is a background 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.110
 calling the police but well there 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.330

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.680
 I do not care to spoil it actually 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.890
 well I will try to break it a little bit 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.030
 purpose is worth giving me the odd 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.760

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.830

 I was saying to give me a small one a little 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.720
 so good that it does not happen much 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.069
 ok and let's go to the airport and I hope 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.220
 here is not going 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.210
 to see 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.060
 well I play it here 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.640
 dodging that car and also like 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.640
 you can check is a car and good 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.320
 Well I just dodge that in a way 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.750
 very peculiar and how I could check in 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.950
 two - second conversation can 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.610
 say and less about 34 times I do not know by 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.040
 what comes out alone but it's good 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.270
 this place is the airport state I have 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.900
 bought so I have to stop 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.790
 get in 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.920
 I had to strain with the truck 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.080
 above is a real pain in the ass and 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.600
 enzymatic part of the police so 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.310
 Well let's see if they open me man 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.200
 as they will not open me here I have a 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.090
 tremendous respect 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.810
 is a letter just appeared there from the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.010
 nothing 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.840
 the one who has moved in the good canton 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.790
 I will have already been the best but to me nothing 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.709
 is this store that is that cardboard 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.819
 that just appeared from nowhere but 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.129
 well let's go get some 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.620
 has the odd one that is worth the game 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.629
 but it's a little bit a bit 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.860
 if the airport is one of the best 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.069
 sites as long as you do not pursue 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.989
 police to run a little here with the 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.580
 car worth come to me the game with the 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.709
 private plane because good once I 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.680

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.790

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.940

 veyron is 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.890
 better than when they gave it to me when 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.750

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.950

 valuable seen turtles faster but 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.270
 good is the speed they have put 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.770
 here in the game 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.420
 more or less compare the size look at 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.160

 and well, I have forms and forms of 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.489
 explore how it was worth the way it had 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:19.429
 It makes light a bit, well, as it says
