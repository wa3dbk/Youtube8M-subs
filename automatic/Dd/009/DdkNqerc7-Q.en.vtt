back to the gameplay and as you guys can

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.210 
back to the gameplay and as you guys can
see<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.870> dragon<00:00:56.260> came<00:00:56.620> out<00:00:56.799> of<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:56.920> clan<00:00:57.100> castle

see a dragon came out of the clan castle
and<00:00:57.790> that<00:00:58.629> is<00:00:58.809> one<00:00:59.019> of<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.140> hardest<00:00:59.440> things<00:00:59.890> to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
and that is one of the hardest things to

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.119 
and that is one of the hardest things to
deal<00:01:00.220> with<00:01:00.280> using<00:01:01.089> barbarians<00:01:01.570> in<00:01:01.659> archery

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
deal with using barbarians in archery

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.859 
deal with using barbarians in archery
it's<00:01:03.129> pretty<00:01:03.309> much<00:01:03.460> like<00:01:03.519> another<00:01:04.000> hero<00:01:04.629> that

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
it's pretty much like another hero that

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.410 
it's pretty much like another hero that
you<00:01:04.930> have<00:01:05.049> to<00:01:05.140> worry<00:01:05.320> about<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.790> you<00:01:06.940> can't

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
you have to worry about and you can't

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.690 
you have to worry about and you can't
let<00:01:07.840> your<00:01:07.990> troops<00:01:08.530> get<00:01:08.740> bunched<00:01:09.040> up<00:01:09.250> because

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
let your troops get bunched up because

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.440 
let your troops get bunched up because
the<00:01:10.270> dragon<00:01:10.690> does<00:01:10.869> splash<00:01:11.140> damage<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.820> this<00:01:13.299> is

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
the dragon does splash damage so this is

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.630 
the dragon does splash damage so this is
only<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.720> couple<00:01:13.930> of<00:01:14.110> seconds<00:01:14.619> but<00:01:14.799> it<00:01:15.460> honestly

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
only a couple of seconds but it honestly

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.469 
only a couple of seconds but it honestly
felt<00:01:16.030> like<00:01:16.240> an<00:01:16.360> hour<00:01:16.479> because<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.850> seemed<00:01:19.240> like

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
felt like an hour because it seemed like

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.300 
felt like an hour because it seemed like
I<00:01:19.720> was<00:01:19.840> having<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.320> lot<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.470> trouble<00:01:20.890> taking<00:01:21.100> out

I was having a lot of trouble taking out

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.800 
I was having a lot of trouble taking out
the<00:01:21.430> heroes<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.060> then<00:01:22.240> there<00:01:22.390> was<00:01:22.479> still<00:01:22.750> a

the heroes and then there was still a
dragon<00:01:23.260> letter<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.490> anyways<00:01:24.820> we<00:01:25.180> took<00:01:25.360> care

Champions League people don't need if

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.319 
Champions League people don't need if
their<00:01:32.140> resources<00:01:32.799> because<00:01:33.340> you've<00:01:34.149> already

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
their resources because you've already

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.029 
their resources because you've already
gem<00:01:34.689> their<00:01:34.869> bases<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:35.469> they<00:01:35.590> have<00:01:35.710> nothing

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
archers so that they could take the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.210 
archers so that they could take the
damage<00:01:48.390> while<00:01:48.659> my<00:01:48.810> archer<00:01:49.140> Queen<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:50.130> the
