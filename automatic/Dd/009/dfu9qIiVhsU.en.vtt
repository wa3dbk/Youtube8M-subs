00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.959
 the year 1962 was probably that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.560
 most important in the company history of 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.360
 Opel 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.280
 because then this car was the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.910
 public presented the opel 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.370
 cadet a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.160
 53 years have passed since then 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.349
 describe the year 2015 and this one 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.089
 is the eleventh generation of opels 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.740
 compact class since the end of 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.140
 nineties better than the couple 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.560
 is known 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.849
 the astra is the compact class i 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.949
 would actually say we are the 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.360
 astra company we are still running short 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.750
 25 percent of all sales of the opel 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.910
 and the book wood in the compact class 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.800
 that's why it's very relevant and natural 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.850
 the one vehicle that makes the turnaround 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.559
 should allow 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.290
 because it's great profitability 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.269
 the new generation is to serve us 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.550
 the rüsselsheimer differs 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.769
 fundamentally from the predecessor not only in 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.670
 puncto design but also in the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.710
 architecture 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.590
 it was primarily about the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.629
 internal dimensions to improve because we completely 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.670
 clearly heard from the market 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.190
 that that was not satisfactory and 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.869
 at the same time the external dimensions are too 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.060
 then you reduce that over 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.220
 optimization for the example of the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.990
 front seats reject that 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.700
 rear seatbacks of the front seat so the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.470
 the rear one can make you thinner 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.970
 we have the passengers differently in the car 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.800
 but we also stayed in 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.530
 So everyone cut a technical cut 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.600
 The body of the raw body looks right where you are 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.520
 can improve around the cuts so small 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.259
 as possible to grow from it to 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.450
 for example, the overview to the front behind 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.030
 and the side gets better with one 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.680
 length of four meters 37 is the astra 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.600
 just under five inches shorter than that 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.340
 This not only improves the predecessor 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.880
 turning circle and the space requirement in the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.130
 parking lot 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.079
 It also saves a lot of weight alone 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.890
 the body shell has 77 kilograms 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.560
 slimmed 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.450
 Overall, the new astra is up to 200 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.159
 kilograms lighter than its predecessor 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.140
 but neither the security nor more 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.880
 space in the interior was reduced in the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.380
 on the contrary, the passengers on the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.780
 back seat have three and a half centimeters 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.649
 more freedom of knees in this class one 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.750
 whole lot 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.909
 In addition to the weight was especially in 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.450
 interior something else reduced 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.920
 with the new astra we have the whole 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.440
 middle area of ​​the center console 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.269
 completely tidied up much more intuitive 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.980
 made a lot easier to use 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.570
 we have the elements right there 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.790
 set where you should go we have you 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.440
 rehearsed and that makes the thing very 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.989
 intuitive for the customer whose 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.549
 get on board right away where everyone 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.079
 elements are and can be 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.359
 operate accordingly 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.870
 in the new infotainment system opel 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.790
 his connectivity 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.950
 Monster in the astra with the car 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.720
 not only in case of emergency help calls but 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.730
 where you also around the clock with 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.769
 A call center can talk to yourself 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.540
 eg to program the navigation to 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.580
 For all customers, they also often 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.500
 in the dark on the way are presented 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.579
 opel for the first time in the compact class 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.019
 LED Matrix Light The new Astra is coming 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.519
 this year to the dealers 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.170
 there are two motors 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.170
 gasoline and a diesel for choice
