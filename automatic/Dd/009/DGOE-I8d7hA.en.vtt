pick winners these the opportunity to
get<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:42.270> think<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:42.780> these<00:00:42.930> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
get and I think of all these you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.779 
get and I think of all these you
probably<00:00:43.350> better<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.370> middle

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
probably better go on for this middle

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.270 
probably better go on for this middle
one<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.110> don't<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
one because you don't you don't have to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.950 
one because you don't you don't have to
put<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.820> fact<00:00:48.149> sell<00:00:48.329> players<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.719> easily

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
put it in fact sell players are easily

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
put it in fact sell players are easily
get<00:00:49.379> enough<00:00:50.160> money<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> place<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
get enough money to get the place you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
get enough money to get the place you
need<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> win<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:52.559> players<00:00:52.890> are

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
need to win it and I think players are

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
need to win it and I think players are
pretty<00:00:53.550> having<00:00:53.910> maybe<00:00:54.390> second<00:00:54.780> place<00:00:54.989> third

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
pretty having maybe second place third

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.139 
pretty having maybe second place third
place<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.590> achievable<00:00:56.340> unlike<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.879> doing

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
place is achievable unlike you doing
