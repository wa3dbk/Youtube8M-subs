00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.899 
thought into every modification if I had
to<00:01:21.840> pick<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.289> I'd<00:01:22.799> say<00:01:23.069> it<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.399> my<00:01:23.579> exhaust

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
to pick one I'd say it was my exhaust

because<00:01:24.329> that<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:24.920> started<00:01:25.920> my

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
because that was what really started my

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.069 
because that was what really started my
interest<00:01:26.819> in<00:01:27.029> the<00:01:27.119> car<00:01:27.329> what<00:01:27.599> really<00:01:27.810> pushed

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
interest in the car what really pushed

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.489 
interest in the car what really pushed
me<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.289> further<00:01:28.859> modify<00:01:29.639> it<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:31.049> exhaust

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:31.499 
me to further modify it and the exhaust

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:33.199 
me to further modify it and the exhaust
gave<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.889> that<00:01:32.009> rumbly<00:01:32.459> sound<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:32.880> gave<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:33.209 
gave it that rumbly sound which gave it

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:34.249 
gave it that rumbly sound which gave it
the<00:01:33.240> name<00:01:33.419> Rumble<00:01:33.779> wagon

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
