00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
less space now you'll notice this is a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.050 
less space now you'll notice this is a

excel<00:01:51.659> VAT<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.260> that's<00:01:52.890> because<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:54.030> can

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
excel VAT and that's because you can

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.880

you<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:08.040> see<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.700> drain<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.510> bath

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
you can see that the drain for the bath

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.420 
you can see that the drain for the bath
is<00:03:09.990> located<00:03:10.560> right<00:03:10.710> on<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.920> front<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.340> the

for<00:03:14.190> draining<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:15.060> bath<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.600> keeping<00:03:15.990> it

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
for draining the bath and keeping it

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.720 
for draining the bath and keeping it
clean<00:03:16.380> by<00:03:16.590> replacing<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.280> water<00:03:17.460> on<00:03:17.700> a

software<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.290> very<00:03:28.410> easy<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.950> program<00:03:29.280> and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
software is very easy to program and

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.910 
software is very easy to program and
basically<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.360> have<00:03:30.540> three<00:03:30.570> settings<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
basically you have three settings the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.960 
basically you have three settings the
temperature<00:03:32.520> of<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.390> bath<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:35.550> can<00:03:35.730> set

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
temperature of the bath and you can set

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.699 
temperature of the bath and you can set
that<00:03:36.150> dependent<00:03:36.690> upon<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.140> solvent<00:03:37.560> that

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
that dependent upon the solvent that

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.790 
that dependent upon the solvent that
you're<00:03:37.890> evaporating<00:03:39.350> forty<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.470> fifty

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
you're evaporating forty to fifty

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.100 
you're evaporating forty to fifty
degrees<00:03:41.160> would<00:03:41.400> be<00:03:41.459> typical<00:03:42.030> for

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
degrees would be typical for

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.190 
degrees would be typical for
dichloromethane<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:45.360> time<00:03:45.660> for<00:03:45.930> evaporation

in<00:03:46.860> this<00:03:47.010> case<00:03:47.220> we<00:03:47.459> have<00:03:47.580> one<00:03:47.850> minute<00:03:48.060> set

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
in this case we have one minute set

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.729 
in this case we have one minute set
because<00:03:48.840> we<00:03:48.989> want<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.230> see<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.560> end<00:03:49.770> and<00:03:51.739> the
