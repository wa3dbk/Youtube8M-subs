nothing changed not the flash power was
on<00:05:23.089> Quora<00:05:23.479> everything<00:05:24.379> was<00:05:24.529> in<00:05:24.680> manual<00:05:25.099> the

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:25.279 
on Quora everything was in manual the

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.679 
on Quora everything was in manual the
only<00:05:25.520> thing<00:05:25.669> i<00:05:25.729> did<00:05:25.879> was<00:05:25.999> the<00:05:26.149> shutter<00:05:26.360> speed

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:26.689 
only thing i did was the shutter speed

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.899 
only thing i did was the shutter speed
and<00:05:26.930> can<00:05:27.499> you<00:05:27.589> see<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.099> difference<00:05:28.129> in<00:05:28.759> the

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
and can you see the difference in the

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.469 
and can you see the difference in the
image<00:05:29.149> how<00:05:29.599> much<00:05:29.960> power<00:05:30.259> it's<00:05:30.860> lost<00:05:31.159> by<00:05:32.089> just

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
image how much power it's lost by just

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.629 
image how much power it's lost by just
up<00:05:32.719> in<00:05:33.020> that<00:05:33.169> shuttle<00:05:33.439> speed<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.979> 500<00:05:34.490> of<00:05:34.580> a

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.519 
up in that shuttle speed to 500 of a
second<00:05:34.999> so<00:05:35.509> remember<00:05:35.810> this<00:05:36.080> when<00:05:36.289> you<00:05:36.379> do<00:05:36.499> a

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:36.529 
second so remember this when you do a

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.839 
second so remember this when you do a
nice<00:05:36.740> beat<00:05:37.039> sink<00:05:38.589> okay<00:05:39.589> so<00:05:40.129> I've<00:05:40.370> just<00:05:40.580> shot

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
that and all I did was change me short

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.139 
that and all I did was change me short

speed on ambien see it from 250th to 400
which<00:05:47.300> is<00:05:47.449> two<00:05:47.659> thirds<00:05:47.899> of<00:05:48.110> a<00:05:48.199> stop<00:05:48.469> higher<00:05:49.189> and

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
which is two thirds of a stop higher and

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.489 
which is two thirds of a stop higher and
that's<00:05:50.240> all<00:05:50.419> I've<00:05:50.569> done<00:05:50.749> you'll<00:05:51.050> see<00:05:51.259> that<00:05:51.379> on

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:51.499 
that's all I've done you'll see that on

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.189 
that's all I've done you'll see that on
the<00:05:51.560> pc<00:05:51.949> now<00:05:52.430> what<00:05:52.669> I'm<00:05:52.789> going<00:05:52.879> to<00:05:52.939> do<00:05:53.199> for

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
the pc now what I'm going to do for

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.839 
the pc now what I'm going to do for
those<00:05:54.349> two<00:05:54.649> thirds<00:05:54.949> of<00:05:55.099> a<00:05:55.219> stop<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.520> I've

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
those two thirds of a stop that I've

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.760 
those two thirds of a stop that I've
adjusted<00:05:56.060> the<00:05:56.449> shooter<00:05:56.930> I'm<00:05:57.080> now<00:05:57.499> going<00:05:57.709> to

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
adjusted the shooter I'm now going to

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.549 
adjusted the shooter I'm now going to
start<00:05:58.009> manually<00:05:58.610> turning<00:05:59.059> the<00:05:59.149> flash<00:05:59.360> up<00:05:59.599> to

00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:00.559 
start manually turning the flash up to

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:04.059 
start manually turning the flash up to
try<00:06:00.919> and<00:06:01.309> get<00:06:01.879> me<00:06:02.149> exposure<00:06:02.659> to<00:06:03.529> look<00:06:03.709> like<00:06:03.919> the

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
try and get me exposure to look like the

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.350 
try and get me exposure to look like the
250th<00:06:04.610> of<00:06:04.789> a<00:06:04.849> second<00:06:05.240> and<00:06:06.849> I'm<00:06:07.849> guessing<00:06:08.089> that

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
250th of a second and I'm guessing that

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.679 
250th of a second and I'm guessing that
I'm<00:06:08.569> gonna<00:06:08.629> go<00:06:08.839> from<00:06:09.110> 16th<00:06:09.740> to<00:06:10.059> one<00:06:11.059> click<00:06:11.419> to

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:11.689 
I'm gonna go from 16th to one click to

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.170 
I'm gonna go from 16th to one click to
click<00:06:11.990> three<00:06:12.289> clicks<00:06:12.589> is<00:06:12.770> one<00:06:12.949> full<00:06:13.249> stop<00:06:13.490> far

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
click three clicks is one full stop far

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.820 
click three clicks is one full stop far
click<00:06:14.419> five<00:06:14.659> click<00:06:14.959> six<00:06:15.259> klicks<00:06:15.469> I'm<00:06:15.589> gonna<00:06:15.709> go

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
click five click six klicks I'm gonna go

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.309 
click five click six klicks I'm gonna go
up<00:06:15.889> to<00:06:16.069> full<00:06:16.430> stops<00:06:16.819> I'm<00:06:17.059> now<00:06:17.479> a<00:06:17.509> quarter<00:06:18.110> power

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
up to full stops I'm now a quarter power

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:24.560 
up to full stops I'm now a quarter power
on<00:06:18.529> the<00:06:18.649> flash

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.100 

I'm<00:06:25.570> still<00:06:26.260> not<00:06:26.530> up<00:06:26.740> enough<00:06:27.480> so<00:06:28.480> I'll<00:06:28.810> get<00:06:28.990> rid

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
I'm still not up enough so I'll get rid

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.480 
I'm still not up enough so I'll get rid
of<00:06:29.200> that<00:06:29.380> I'm<00:06:29.560> going<00:06:29.740> to<00:06:29.800> go<00:06:29.920> up<00:06:30.010> another<00:06:30.220> two

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
of that I'm going to go up another two

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:40.650 
of that I'm going to go up another two
thirds<00:06:30.820> of<00:06:31.000> a<00:06:31.090> stop<00:06:38.370> so<00:06:39.370> there's<00:06:39.910> you<00:06:40.060> to<00:06:40.210> 50th

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
thirds of a stop so there's you to 50th

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.340 
thirds of a stop so there's you to 50th
of<00:06:40.840> a<00:06:40.960> second<00:06:41.350> and<00:06:41.560> then<00:06:42.550> there<00:06:43.210> is<00:06:43.240> yeah<00:06:44.080> I'll

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
of a second and then there is yeah I'll

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.620 
of a second and then there is yeah I'll
just<00:06:44.380> press<00:06:44.680> the<00:06:44.830> C<00:06:45.010> key<00:06:45.310> so<00:06:46.000> the<00:06:46.240> one<00:06:46.360> on<00:06:46.510> the

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
just press the C key so the one on the

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.140 
just press the C key so the one on the
left<00:06:46.870> is<00:06:47.110> the<00:06:47.350> 250th<00:06:47.950> of<00:06:48.130> a<00:06:48.220> second<00:06:48.580> the<00:06:48.970> one<00:06:49.120> on

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
left is the 250th of a second the one on

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.600 
left is the 250th of a second the one on
the<00:06:49.360> right<00:06:49.390> is<00:06:49.570> 400<00:06:50.350> of<00:06:50.440> a<00:06:50.530> second<00:06:50.920> and<00:06:51.370> can<00:06:51.580> you

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
the right is 400 of a second and can you

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.400 
the right is 400 of a second and can you
see<00:06:51.850> the<00:06:52.030> brightness<00:06:52.270> is<00:06:52.570> about<00:06:52.840> the<00:06:52.990> same<00:06:53.170> is

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
see the brightness is about the same is

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.890 
see the brightness is about the same is
not<00:06:53.440> perfect<00:06:54.100> but<00:06:54.190> it's<00:06:54.250> near<00:06:54.550> enough<00:06:54.820> and<00:06:55.060> you

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
not perfect but it's near enough and you

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.460 
not perfect but it's near enough and you
can<00:06:56.080> see<00:06:56.290> to<00:06:56.620> get<00:06:56.800> that<00:06:57.100> flash<00:06:57.910> at<00:06:58.600> 500<00:06:59.320> of<00:06:59.380> a

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470 
can see to get that flash at 500 of a

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.950 
can see to get that flash at 500 of a
second<00:06:59.860> after<00:07:00.070> 10<00:07:00.550> up<00:07:00.790> nearly<00:07:01.030> three<00:07:01.540> full

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
second after 10 up nearly three full

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.010 
second after 10 up nearly three full
stops<00:07:02.440> to<00:07:03.220> get<00:07:03.400> the<00:07:03.580> same<00:07:03.820> exposure<00:07:04.330> so<00:07:04.930> you

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
stops to get the same exposure so you

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.860 
stops to get the same exposure so you
can<00:07:05.170> see<00:07:05.410> how<00:07:05.970> using<00:07:06.970> I<00:07:07.090> speed<00:07:07.390> sync<00:07:07.660> is<00:07:07.840> a

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
can see how using I speed sync is a

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.990 
can see how using I speed sync is a
fantastic<00:07:08.320> feature<00:07:08.800> that<00:07:09.400> it<00:07:09.520> will<00:07:09.610> proper

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
fantastic feature that it will proper

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.120 
fantastic feature that it will proper
your<00:07:10.360> plane<00:07:10.600> when<00:07:11.200> it<00:07:11.230> comes<00:07:11.530> to<00:07:11.770> need<00:07:11.920> in

your plane when it comes to need in
power<00:07:12.340> I<00:07:12.610> mean<00:07:12.910> three<00:07:13.270> full<00:07:13.540> stops<00:07:13.900> and<00:07:14.200> I<00:07:14.290> only

power I mean three full stops and I only

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.220 
power I mean three full stops and I only
went<00:07:14.650> up<00:07:14.830> two-thirds<00:07:15.520> of<00:07:15.790> a<00:07:15.880> stop<00:07:16.120> sign<00:07:16.660> even<00:07:17.140> a

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.230 
went up two-thirds of a stop sign even a

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.080 
went up two-thirds of a stop sign even a
third<00:07:17.470> of<00:07:17.710> a<00:07:17.800> stop<00:07:18.010> on<00:07:18.160> the<00:07:18.310> shutter<00:07:18.520> speed<00:07:18.850> I

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090 
third of a stop on the shutter speed I

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.930 
third of a stop on the shutter speed I
would<00:07:19.420> have<00:07:19.510> had<00:07:19.660> to<00:07:19.780> go<00:07:19.930> a<00:07:20.040> five-run<00:07:21.040> sada<00:07:21.310> in

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
would have had to go a five-run sada in

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.380 
would have had to go a five-run sada in

even a full stop on the shutter speed it

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.510 
even a full stop on the shutter speed it
was<00:07:25.540> just<00:07:25.780> two<00:07:26.110> thirds<00:07:26.410> of<00:07:26.680> a<00:07:26.800> stop<00:07:27.010> if<00:07:27.310> I'd

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 
was just two thirds of a stop if I'd

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.000 
was just two thirds of a stop if I'd
gone<00:07:27.730> to<00:07:27.790> 500<00:07:28.660> of<00:07:28.780> a<00:07:28.840> second<00:07:29.230> you<00:07:29.620> can<00:07:29.830> imagine

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.010 
gone to 500 of a second you can imagine

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.650 
gone to 500 of a second you can imagine
how<00:07:30.250> dark<00:07:30.640> that<00:07:30.820> this<00:07:31.030> picture<00:07:31.270> will<00:07:31.540> have

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660 
how dark that this picture will have

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.150 
how dark that this picture will have
been<00:07:31.810> and<00:07:32.080> I<00:07:32.260> probably<00:07:32.440> have<00:07:32.650> to<00:07:32.680> go<00:07:32.830> up<00:07:32.920> three

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.160 
been and I probably have to go up three

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.030 
been and I probably have to go up three
and<00:07:33.280> our<00:07:33.430> stops<00:07:34.230> anyway<00:07:35.230> i<00:07:35.440> hope<00:07:35.560> this<00:07:35.740> video
