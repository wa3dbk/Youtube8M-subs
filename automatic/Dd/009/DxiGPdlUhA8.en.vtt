00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.890
 good for all kids of such problems 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.410
 here and video also speaks to you and I am here 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.500
 to bring you the video on how you can 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.110
 call a hack and strike on call of 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.430
 of goss then I state that this thing 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.680
 a game made with bots for 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 simplify everything so let's start with the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.470
 first meter and the first method is that 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.300
 to complete the directives there 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.460
 will be assigned during the mode 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.590
 strike zone is in the structure map 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.519
 and these directives can be 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:46.019
 various including kill some enemies with 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:48.720
 their weapons or with the secondary ones 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.080
 or with other types of challenges that 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.970
 these will be assigned to us and finished 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.470
 challenges we will be given a 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.220
 supply and with this 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.290
 measure 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.750
 we could get the kehm out 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.880
 strike then it is actually certain that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.210
 will be released in the third fourth attempt then 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.219
 the first two directives very much 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.289
 probably nothing will come out of the 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:20.130
 cash but will allow us to find some 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:22.609
 objects including for example the ms dog 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.210
 from helicopter guard or other 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:28.920
 so I tell you that the first directives 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.689
 you will not need to find it cam trek 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 another advice I give you is that 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.770
 totally unlocked directives will come 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.600
 accumulated by the team so if the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 his friend will for example take place 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.439
 I would have two to2 directives 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.869
 possibility than the third directive 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.240
 I could make a mistake, you can do a lot 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.369
 probably be able to unlock the cam 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.770
 strike and so it could happen too 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.649
 the others so maybe one does all the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.409
 directives up to the third the fourth e 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.939
 the other character he finds himself doing 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.009
 the last directive for the kehm che 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.229
 of course it does not say what reward will 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.030
 will be given but will be random will receive the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.179
 Kehm 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:10.679
 having said that there is a second method to 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:14.250
 then make it cam strike and that's like everyone else 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.620
 they know how to do it with the 25 killings in a row 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.010
 this is much more complicated because it is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.530
 more difficult to do because 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.540
 the enemies is much easier to die is 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.860
 much easier to be spent 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.200
 windward from friends but of course yes 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.030
 be a good team good support 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.829
 you can still bring the camst 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.629
 completes 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.180
 obviously I advise you to go to 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.360
 group and these here in your group 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.450
 everyone should have it 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.269
 pisa as it is called the cancaro 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.680
 satellite that will allow you to find 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.540
 the enemies 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.299
 obviously more in squares networks in 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.799
 series ie the first will succeed as a 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.040
 radar brought to ii will be a 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.659
 satcom connection and third dots 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.579
 they will become white and the blaze will 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.230
 will update more frequently and at 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.470
 fourth there will be a kind of bitch 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.269
 up that will help you a lot because you 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.579
 he will say where all the enemies are and nobody 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.190
 will escape 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.510
 obviously this needs to be done 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.810
 in a certain amount of time because later 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.329
 about 40 50 seconds apcom comes yes 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.680
 self-destructs and therefore there is to be redone 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.810
 all over again so I recommend you 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.730
 support only by having the sitecom 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.099
 unlock with inflexible then every 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.379
 precision you will have sat com this is said 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.480
 I want to talk to you for the last minute 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:38.359
 of the fact that I became an admin of 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.489
 such problems ie this community e 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.650
 obviously I talked to the album in 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.500
 general the main one and has me 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.720
 allowed to become a part of 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.430
 this of this channel and to be able to 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.349
 to help 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.949
 obviously the other people who are here 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.690
 and I think we will go much further must 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.069
 wait for a good regime of course 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.889
 bring my videos 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.819
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.470
 taking away the fact that I did it with i 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.569
 bot because I wanted to do something 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.150
 fast enough I didn't want to scold 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.709
 given that I'm still at level 12 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.329
 online I would not have unlocked the weapons 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.060
 necessary to be able to make a cannula 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.609
 quite good and I do n't even have the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.109
 weapons so I tried a little all 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.909
 weapons and I saw flights were those 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.849
 generally stronger I found that 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:28.880
 this one was minton r5 and very strong 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.630
 with the silencer charger to the priests 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.500
 drilling 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.000
 so I obviously took this one 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.120
 has his choices there each has its 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.280
 tastes may be well with him 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.570
 the vespers or with the tar 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.820
 obviously it will be very strong and therefore the 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.260
 video is about to end now I invite you to 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.780

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.010
 also I invite you to pass for mine 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.770
 channel that will be in description i the 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.480
 italian bolt I will bring videos on cod 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.250
 and obviously there are already other videos 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.860
 very funny including a series on 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.980
 zombie made challenge in which you 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.040
 challenge another member of this 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.710
 community to make challenges in zombies and 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.710
 of course there are my video here is the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.350
 burst of the cams in this map 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.590
 instruction destroys everything and vi 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.970
 I remember to tell you about the last 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.440
 supplies that will come out 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.940
 only the recto therefore there is not 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.800
 wait until there are no other mafias 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.590
 only in this because finding it that 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.030
 the dynamism of the map will take place ie 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.260
 it will be destroyed so I call you again 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.940
 at cia not nice I like to register 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.740
