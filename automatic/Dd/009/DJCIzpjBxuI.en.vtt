safety for the city of Long Beach one of
the<00:00:13.830> things<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.309> most<00:00:14.549> fascinated<00:00:15.480> my

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the things that most fascinated my

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.599 
the things that most fascinated my
students<00:00:16.170> was<00:00:16.350> teaching<00:00:16.800> them<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> ability

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
students was teaching them the ability

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.830 
students was teaching them the ability
to<00:00:17.640> predict<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> weather

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
to predict the weather

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.650 
to predict the weather
just<00:00:19.109> by<00:00:19.289> looking<00:00:19.529> at<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> clouds<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.660> thought

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
just by looking at the clouds I thought

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.120 
just by looking at the clouds I thought
I'd<00:00:21.810> make<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.199> little<00:00:22.439> multimedia

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
I'd make this little multimedia

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
I'd make this little multimedia
presentation<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.539> learn<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.080> skill

let's<00:01:39.380> talk<00:01:39.650> first<00:01:39.980> about<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.370> cold<00:01:40.700> front

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
let's talk first about a cold front

let's talk first about a cold front
since<00:01:41.690> if<00:01:41.840> you're<00:01:41.990> out<00:01:42.110> at<00:01:42.260> sea<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.980> more

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
since if you're out at sea it's the more

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.520 
since if you're out at sea it's the more
dangerous<00:01:43.730> of<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.000> two<00:01:44.230> the<00:01:45.230> first
