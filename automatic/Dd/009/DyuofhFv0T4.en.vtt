far with this I'm not saying it's a bad
game<00:00:21.150> I'm<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.510> saying<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:21.990> 2k<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.430> is

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
game I'm not saying it's 2k but it is

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.730 
game I'm not saying it's 2k but it is
what<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.119> NBA<00:00:24.390> live<00:00:24.600> look<00:00:25.080> from<00:00:25.320> where

what it is is NBA live look from where

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.589 
what it is is NBA live look from where
they've<00:00:25.920> gone<00:00:26.099> from<00:00:26.160> two<00:00:26.730> years<00:00:26.939> ago<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.420> now

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
they've gone from two years ago so now

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.359 
they've gone from two years ago so now
is<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:27.960> remarkable<00:00:28.230> where<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.130> were<00:00:29.250> our

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is pretty remarkable where they were our

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.710 
is pretty remarkable where they were our
two<00:00:29.519> years<00:00:29.730> ago<00:00:29.849> was<00:00:30.029> actually<00:00:30.330> embarrassed

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
two years ago was actually embarrassed

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.120 
two years ago was actually embarrassed
you<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.170> should<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.439> never<00:00:31.800> been

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you know so it should have never been

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.209 
you know so it should have never been
that<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.700> should<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.149> never<00:00:33.390> gone<00:00:33.750> there<00:00:34.219> but

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that it should have never gone there but

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.180 
that it should have never gone there but
yeah<00:00:35.520> graphically<00:00:36.239> by<00:00:36.480> itself<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.770> game<00:00:37.950> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
yeah graphically by itself the game is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
yeah graphically by itself the game is
just<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.700> leaps<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.210> above<00:00:39.540> NBA<00:00:40.410> live<00:00:40.649> 14

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
just like leaps and above NBA live 14

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770 
just like leaps and above NBA live 14
and<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.579> looking<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:42.149> better<00:00:42.180> than<00:00:42.570> NBA

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
and it's looking way better than NBA

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.510 
and it's looking way better than NBA
like<00:00:43.170> 15<00:00:44.300> gameplay<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.600> still<00:00:45.930> quite<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:47.129> fair

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
like 15 gameplay is still quite not fair

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.229 
like 15 gameplay is still quite not fair
now<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.690> say<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:49.920> boy<00:00:50.100> well<00:00:51.059> not

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
now what I can say is as my boy well not

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.299 
now what I can say is as my boy well not
my<00:00:51.360> boy<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.050> George<00:00:52.800> Bush<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.160> say

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
my boy but as you George Bush would say

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
my boy but as you George Bush would say
there's<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> lot<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> strategic<00:00:54.480> involved<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
there's a lot of strategic involved and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.240 
there's a lot of strategic involved and
what<00:00:55.440> more<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.739> ask<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
what more can you ask for in a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.110 
what more can you ask for in a
simulation<00:00:56.699> sports<00:00:57.629> game<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.500> strategy

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
simulation sports game is some strategy

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.880 
simulation sports game is some strategy
there's<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.180> lot<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.449> basketball<00:01:00.750> strategy<00:01:01.469> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
there's a lot of basketball strategy you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
there's a lot of basketball strategy you
don't<00:01:02.100> necessarily<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.969> use<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.600> found

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
don't necessarily have to use it I found

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.690 
don't necessarily have to use it I found
it<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.019> too<00:01:04.290> easy<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.920> boil<00:01:05.519> your

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it a little too easy to just boil your

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.250 
it a little too easy to just boil your
way<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> basket<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.659> whatever<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.110> that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
way to the basket or whatever so that

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.480 
way to the basket or whatever so that
could<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.010> kind<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> stuff<00:01:08.369> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
could be you know that kind of stuff is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
could be you know that kind of stuff is
tunable<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.659> there's<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.200> basketball

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
tunable but there's a lot of basketball

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.859 
tunable but there's a lot of basketball
going<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> game<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.270> always

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
going on in the game and that's always

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
going on in the game and that's always
good<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.850> good

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
good to see now do I think it's as good

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.270 
good to see now do I think it's as good
as<00:01:15.180> 2k<00:01:15.600> absolutely<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.530> i<00:01:16.590> don't<00:01:16.860> i<00:01:17.130> don't

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.679 
did like is that I do think that this
game<00:01:39.329> has<00:01:39.479> over<00:01:39.930> 2k<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:41.210> 2k<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
game has over 2k and 2k can be to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
game has over 2k and 2k can be to
animation<00:01:43.380> heavy<00:01:43.829> because<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.430> animations

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
animation heavy because the animations

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.719 
animation heavy because the animations
are<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.240> good<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:46.500> times<00:01:47.189> they<00:01:47.310> extend<00:01:47.640> for

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
are so good they times they extend for

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.490 
are so good they times they extend for
too<00:01:47.820> long<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.210> being<00:01:48.689> well<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.899> breaks<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.380> out

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
too long and being well I breaks you out

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.020 
too long and being well I breaks you out
of<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.680> animation<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.340> you'll<00:01:50.490> never<00:01:50.880> feel

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
of your animation so you'll never feel

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.789 
of your animation so you'll never feel
like<00:01:51.180> you're<00:01:51.240> stuck<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:52.229> feel

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
like you're stuck and you actually feel

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.100 
like you're stuck and you actually feel
like<00:01:52.860> you're<00:01:53.070> playing<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.610> game<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.780> have

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
like you're playing a game and you have

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.050 
like you're playing a game and you have
control<00:01:55.560> over<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:56.369> those<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.640> things

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
control over it now those are things

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.690 
control over it now those are things
that<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.299> feel<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.689> NBA<00:01:58.020> Live<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that I feel like NBA Live can do to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.090 
that I feel like NBA Live can do to
actually<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:01.020> somebody<00:02:01.320> saying<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.890> just

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
actually have somebody saying I just

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.130 
actually have somebody saying I just
won't<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.340> crazy<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.820> say<00:02:02.969> yo<00:02:03.450> man<00:02:03.659> look<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:03.960> I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
won't be crazy to say yo man look up I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.670 
won't be crazy to say yo man look up I
prefer<00:02:04.409> NBA<00:02:04.829> Live<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.939> might<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:06.619> quite<00:02:07.619> be

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
prefer NBA Live it might not quite be

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.550 
prefer NBA Live it might not quite be
bare<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.670> yet<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.780> closing<00:02:10.470> in

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
bare there yet but it is closing in

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.930 
bare there yet but it is closing in
where<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.830> say<00:02:10.950> yo<00:02:11.129> man<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.370> prefer<00:02:11.700> NBA

where you can say yo man I prefer NBA

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.800 
where you can say yo man I prefer NBA
live<00:02:12.150> over<00:02:12.420> 2k

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
live over 2k

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.570 
live over 2k
because<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.440> gave<00:02:13.920> me<00:02:14.040> stretching<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:14.400> these

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
because you gave me stretching out these

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.120 
because you gave me stretching out these
animations<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.300> lose<00:02:15.750> control<00:02:15.870> NBA<00:02:16.709> Live<00:02:16.950> is

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
animations I lose control NBA Live is

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.510 
animations I lose control NBA Live is
free<00:02:17.340> flowing<00:02:18.080> but<00:02:19.080> NBA<00:02:19.349> life<00:02:19.590> feels<00:02:20.099> more

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
free flowing but NBA life feels more

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.550 
free flowing but NBA life feels more
like<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.730> video<00:02:20.970> game<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.480> 2k<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.870> guess<00:02:22.380> it's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
like a video game in 2k I guess it's

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.410 
like a video game in 2k I guess it's
hard<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.860> explain<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.459> don't<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> call<00:02:24.390> it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
hard to explain I don't want to call it

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.229 
hard to explain I don't want to call it
rkt<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.709> feels<00:02:25.950> more<00:02:26.370> like<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.880> video<00:02:27.090> game

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
rkt but it feels more like a video game

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.600 
rkt but it feels more like a video game
into<00:02:27.690> k<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.930> k<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.739> realistic<00:02:29.250> at<00:02:29.370> times

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
into k to k can be so realistic at times

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.120 
into k to k can be so realistic at times
it<00:02:29.880> just<00:02:30.120> takes<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> control<00:02:31.620> right<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.099> of

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
it just takes the control right out of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.120 
it just takes the control right out of
your<00:02:32.340> hand<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.750> be<00:02:34.019> alive<00:02:34.290> what<00:02:34.769> else<00:02:34.920> did<00:02:35.099> I

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
your hand and be alive what else did I

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.680 
your hand and be alive what else did I
like<00:02:35.370> about<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.670> there<00:02:35.910> was<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.030> lot<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.300> on<00:02:36.630> i

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
like about it there was a lot going on i

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.900 
like about it there was a lot going on i

do you know what I give him kudos for

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.449 
do you know what I give him kudos for
not<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> series<00:02:40.620> after<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:41.010> debacle

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
not can in the series after the debacle

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.970 
not can in the series after the debacle
that<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:41.910> 14<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.630> sticking<00:02:43.530> with<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.860> because

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that was 14 and sticking with it because

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.100 
that was 14 and sticking with it because
now<00:02:44.220> they<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.550> product<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.959> could

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
now they have a product that you could

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.630 
now they have a product that you could
tell<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:46.380> gonna<00:02:46.500> get<00:02:46.620> better<00:02:46.799> year<00:02:47.430> by<00:02:47.610> year

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
tell it's gonna get better year by year

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.820 
tell it's gonna get better year by year
and<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.180> does<00:02:48.480> seem<00:02:48.900> like<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.650> thing

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
and it does seem like this is the thing

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.340 
and it does seem like this is the thing
it<00:02:50.160> does<00:02:50.580> seem<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.819> their<00:02:51.090> main<00:02:51.390> strategy<00:02:52.110> is

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
it does seem like their main strategy is

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.590 
it does seem like their main strategy is
focused<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:53.040> trying<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.730> actually<00:02:53.910> stimulate

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
focused on trying to actually stimulate

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.229 
focused on trying to actually stimulate
the<00:02:54.720> game<00:02:55.130> strategy-wise<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.580> think<00:02:57.060> that's

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
the game strategy-wise I think that's

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.600 
the game strategy-wise I think that's
just<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.599> good<00:02:57.780> move<00:02:58.049> man<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.680> extra<00:02:59.220> gimmicks

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
just a good move man all extra gimmicks

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.039 
just a good move man all extra gimmicks
they<00:02:59.760> get<00:02:59.910> worried<00:03:00.120> about<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.569> but<00:03:00.780> as<00:03:00.900> far

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
they get worried about that but as far

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.890 
they get worried about that but as far
as<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.319> gameplay<00:03:01.739> goes<00:03:02.090> it's<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.299> gimmicky

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
as the gameplay goes it's not gimmicky

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.720 
as the gameplay goes it's not gimmicky
it's<00:03:04.080> not<00:03:04.349> gimmicky<00:03:04.769> gameplay<00:03:05.190> everything

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
it's not gimmicky gameplay everything

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.460 
it's not gimmicky gameplay everything
that<00:03:06.000> they've<00:03:06.150> added<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.780> it's<00:03:07.049> talking

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
that they've added and it's talking

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.800 
that they've added and it's talking
about<00:03:07.680> our<00:03:08.150> simulation<00:03:09.150> aspects<00:03:09.720> of

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
about our simulation aspects of

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.570 
about our simulation aspects of
basketball<00:03:10.380> how<00:03:10.830> they<00:03:10.980> play<00:03:11.190> out<00:03:11.220> on<00:03:11.489> the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
basketball how they play out on the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.370 
basketball how they play out on the
floor<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> different<00:03:12.510> story<00:03:12.599> sometimes<00:03:13.230> it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
floor is a different story sometimes it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.620 
floor is a different story sometimes it
just<00:03:13.500> doesn't<00:03:13.680> look<00:03:14.040> great<00:03:14.340> there's<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.420> lot<00:03:15.599> of

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
just doesn't look great there's a lot of

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.060 
just doesn't look great there's a lot of
things<00:03:15.959> going<00:03:16.049> on<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.590> didn't<00:03:16.739> really<00:03:16.859> care
