00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.780
 but surprised 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.730
 and to our cashier 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.589
 is today 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.799
 Let's get to know some more. 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.739
 ending with asia 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.579
 anyone 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.579
 and without it we could not live 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.199
 photo ap on average approximately 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.169
 of eight square meters 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.739
 in only one square centimeter of a surface 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.519
 we can face the crisis moniz of cells 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.810
 political and religious leaders 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.890
 here are two cities 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.320
 yes about the second phase 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 three silver medals in the five matches in their domains 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.540
 in 12 months 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.460
 nerve fibers 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.780
 and through it 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.170
 that we relate to the outside world and at the same time protect us 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.600
 of these aggressions 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 until then 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.819
 is what is being done of erdogan fatty substances units 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:01.940
 nicacio oro 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.239
 moniz and vitamins and proteins 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.800
 she raised the body temperature 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.539
 prevent water loss 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.600
 and prevent bacteria from entering 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.030
 but I think it's colder 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.960
 evident 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.300
 has millions of cells that renew continuously 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.080
 300 million of them are replaced every day 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.290
 so for the conference be careful that it needs 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.720
 It's important to know how it works 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.720
 until then it is formed by three layers 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.040
 the law determines that the most superficial layer to defeat the intermediate 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.150
 who can return to the deepest 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.050
 each of these layers fulfills specific functions 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.060
 let's see 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.360
 eptv is essential for our survival because it is the one that is in 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.710
 contact 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.590
 on twitter microblog 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.100
 about him 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.570
 eptv plays an important role because it acts as a natural barrier in 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.460
 that the human body and external environmental aggressions in addition to being 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.650
 responsible for keeping in US dollars 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.379
 body temperature 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.879
 The picnic surface is covered by a mixture of solo repeats 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.049
 fat called a hydrolipidic mantle 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.909
 that the first barrier against external aggression because of its good 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.289
 grateful 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.499
 amy from developing bacteria to eptv 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.930
 is still responsible for maintaining skin hydration 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.009
 and his assistant 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:38.699
 velvety 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:44.549
 110 min is formed by different types of sports cells one on the 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.429
 others like bricks on a wall 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:52.029
 creating a barrier that prevented almost all the substances 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.129
 in its innermost part 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.699
 if we are daily millions of cells that divide 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.799
 this topic 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.249
 to give way to other evidence 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.389
 gradually we go with everything to the upper layers 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.159
 of these cells 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.159
 85% are kirana arrows 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.650
 are three inns for the production of an important protein called 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.999
 keratin 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:23.179
 keratin enhances the ability to take care of protecting the body to the extent 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.809
 that the cell approaches the surface of the skin they will start 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:27.420
 at the end 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.630
 begin to stand out that the defeat marking in front of the protective layer 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.260
 which is continually being renewed 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.270
 this week adopted 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.270
 are known as occurs in other sectors 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:41.240
 dead cells 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.210
 these dead cells let us know who is selling to deal with cattle 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.300
 the cells grow arrivals 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.269
 the team 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.539
 complete renewal every three to four weeks 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.609
 process we know 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.649
 as cell renewal 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:04:00.099
 Did you know that life-long squeezed chest between 18 and 20 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.060
 September dead cell shows 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.060
 the importance of making choices is our skin 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.009
 also participate in the cell renewal process 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.119
 the kilometers 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:16.579
 marks of youth responsible for validating cells 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.380
 so the inter has already 50 renew 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.599
 lately 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:26.889
 in the epidermis are also other cells called 1900 that produce the 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:27.740
 melanin 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.990
 responsible for the color of the skin and that the audience and the nuclear radiation 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.110
 the thickness of the epidermis is generally thin 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.279
 with some thick leaves like the palm of the hands 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.479
 were only 5 millimeters 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.000
 thinner areas with other eyes 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.060
 and the eyelids that boys said on Wednesday 05 million
