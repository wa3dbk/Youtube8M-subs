00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
time with experience has been the fact

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.279 
time with experience has been the fact
that<00:00:51.339> we<00:00:51.519> are<00:00:51.670> more<00:00:51.909> expert<00:00:52.539> more<00:00:52.749> capable

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
that we are more expert more capable

that we are more expert more capable
more<00:00:53.879> successful<00:00:54.879> in<00:00:55.149> terms<00:00:55.449> of<00:00:55.659> the<00:00:55.809> risk<00:00:56.050> of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.569 
the procedure in the first place and so

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:01.500 
the procedure in the first place and so
we<00:00:59.050> have<00:00:59.229> a<00:00:59.260> very<00:00:59.559> low<00:00:59.829> risk<00:01:00.339> profile<00:01:00.940> not<00:01:01.449> a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
we have a very low risk profile not a

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.360 
we have a very low risk profile not a
zero<00:01:01.929> risk<00:01:02.139> profile<00:01:02.499> that's<00:01:02.679> impossible<00:01:03.249> with

zero risk profile that's impossible with
any<00:01:03.489> treatment<00:01:03.999> but<00:01:04.600> it's<00:01:04.720> now<00:01:04.839> become<00:01:05.229> clear

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
any treatment but it's now become clear

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.649 
any treatment but it's now become clear
that<00:01:05.680> you're<00:01:05.829> more<00:01:06.189> likely<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.909> suffer

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
that you're more likely to suffer

that you're more likely to suffer

premature death if you don't have one of

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
these surgeries than if you do that's

these surgeries than if you do that's
