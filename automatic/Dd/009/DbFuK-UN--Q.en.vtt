00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
well there's my hinge this is how I had

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.280 
well there's my hinge this is how I had
to<00:00:05.279> mount<00:00:05.460> it<00:00:05.700> so<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:05.970> can<00:00:06.299> open<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.080> then

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
to mount it so I can open it and then

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.600 
to mount it so I can open it and then
open<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.710> door<00:00:09.800> and<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.550> didn't<00:00:13.460> make<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
open the door and I didn't make the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.970 
open the door and I didn't make the
inside<00:00:14.940> too<00:00:15.780> small<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.470> did<00:00:16.680> was<00:00:16.800> raise

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
inside too small what I did was raise

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.269 
inside too small what I did was raise
the<00:00:17.190> bottom<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.880> four<00:00:18.210> inches<00:00:19.279> which

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the bottom of it four inches which

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.509 
the bottom of it four inches which
really<00:00:20.840> removed<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.020> whole<00:00:22.199> bunch<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.590> cubic

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
really removed a whole bunch of cubic

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.250 
really removed a whole bunch of cubic
inches<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.660> thing<00:00:24.869> would<00:00:24.960> need<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
inches that this thing would need to

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.560 
inches that this thing would need to
heat<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.910> still<00:00:27.090> doesn't<00:00:27.300> heat<00:00:27.539> up

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
heat up and if it still doesn't heat up

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.710 
heat up and if it still doesn't heat up
I'm<00:00:27.930> gonna<00:00:28.460> bring<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.699> back<00:00:29.910> end<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.449> same

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
I'm gonna bring the back end the same

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.979 
I'm gonna bring the back end the same
amount<00:00:31.050> four<00:00:31.380> inches<00:00:32.120> but<00:00:33.120> I've<00:00:33.450> had<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.780> out

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
amount four inches but I've had this out

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.549 
amount four inches but I've had this out
here<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.910> thirty<00:00:36.329> minutes<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.470 

about<00:00:46.020> two<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.350> quarter<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.300> not

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
about two and a quarter and that's not

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.570 
about two and a quarter and that's not
bad<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:49.080> 30<00:00:49.350> minutes<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:53.400> going<00:00:53.520> to

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
bad for just 30 minutes so I'm going to

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.430 
bad for just 30 minutes so I'm going to
adjust<00:00:53.700> this<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> couple<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.750> times<00:00:54.989> over<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
adjust this a couple of times over the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
adjust this a couple of times over the
next<00:00:55.650> hour<00:00:55.950> and<00:00:58.370> I'll<00:00:59.370> show<00:00:59.700> you<00:00:59.730> what<00:00:59.910> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
next hour and I'll show you what the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.850 
next hour and I'll show you what the
final<00:01:00.270> temperature<00:01:00.630> is<00:01:03.440> all<00:01:04.440> right<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.710> been

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
final temperature is all right it's been

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.580 
final temperature is all right it's been
about<00:01:04.920> hour<00:01:08.390> that<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.660> officially<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
about hour that is officially the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
about hour that is officially the
hottest<00:01:10.920> I've<00:01:11.340> ever<00:01:11.670> got<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:13.460> 275<00:01:17.869> I'm

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
hottest I've ever got this 275 I'm

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.650 
hottest I've ever got this 275 I'm
thinking<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.380> still<00:01:19.680> may<00:01:19.860> need<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.450> fill<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
thinking I still may need to fill the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.540 
thinking I still may need to fill the
back<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.170> thing<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.890> few<00:01:23.340> inches

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
back of this thing in a few inches

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.570 
back of this thing in a few inches
that's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.660> whole<00:01:24.810> lot<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:24.990> cubic<00:01:25.380> inches<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
that's a whole lot of cubic inches to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.570 
that's a whole lot of cubic inches to
heat<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.540> no<00:01:27.660> reason<00:01:27.690> I'm<00:01:28.550> beginning<00:01:29.550> to

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
heat up for no reason I'm beginning to

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.749 
heat up for no reason I'm beginning to
understand<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:31.100> when<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> build<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.520> solar

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
understand that when you build a solar

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.330 
understand that when you build a solar
oven<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:34.080> just<00:01:34.380> doesn't<00:01:34.680> make<00:01:34.770> any<00:01:34.830> sense<00:01:35.190> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
oven it just doesn't make any sense to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.810 
oven it just doesn't make any sense to
build<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.700> any<00:01:35.850> bigger<00:01:36.710> then<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:38.340> pot<00:01:38.550> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
build it any bigger then your pot you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.570 
build it any bigger then your pot you
know<00:01:38.940> just<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:40.440> size<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.130> whatever

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
know just the size that get whatever

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.950 
know just the size that get whatever
you're<00:01:41.729> gonna<00:01:41.820> cook<00:01:42.149> you<00:01:42.300> in<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you're gonna cook you in there and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.560 
you're gonna cook you in there and
that's<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.380> want<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.410> make<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.710> work

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
that's it but I want to make this work

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.680 
that's it but I want to make this work
I'm<00:01:48.570> pretty<00:01:48.810> sure<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.260> it<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> 300<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
I'm pretty sure I can get it to 300 and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.649 
I'm pretty sure I can get it to 300 and
if<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.930> close<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.250> bring<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.420> four

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
if I close that back in bring it in four

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.030 
if I close that back in bring it in four
and<00:01:54.690> a<00:01:54.810> half<00:01:54.869> inches<00:01:55.260> like<00:01:55.440> I<00:01:55.560> did<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> bottom

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and a half inches like I did the bottom

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.240 
and a half inches like I did the bottom
I<00:01:57.860> think<00:01:58.860> it'll<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.610> satisfactory<00:02:00.510> I<00:02:01.220> have<00:02:02.220> a

I think it'll be satisfactory I have a
friend<00:02:02.640> who's<00:02:03.270> made<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> solar<00:02:03.990> oven<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:05.750> his

solar<00:02:07.140> oven<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.710> got<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.160> highest

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
solar oven has got the highest
