on<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.220> front<00:00:17.520> they've<00:00:17.730> gone<00:00:17.880> ahead<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.180> used

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
on the front they've gone ahead and used

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.359 
on the front they've gone ahead and used
single<00:00:18.779> density<00:00:18.930> foams<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> outside

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
single density foams on the outside

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.580 
single density foams on the outside
piece<00:00:20.699> they've<00:00:21.510> kind<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.960> set<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
piece they've kind of set this up as a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.980 
piece they've kind of set this up as a
segmented<00:00:23.070> panel<00:00:23.490> design<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.570> sewn

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
segmented panel design but they are sewn

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.900 
segmented panel design but they are sewn
into<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.590> tops<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.460> bottom<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:26.880> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
into the tops and the bottom so you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.640 
into the tops and the bottom so you
don't<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> stretch<00:00:27.779> there<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
don't have a stretch there it's going to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.779

offer<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> little<00:00:29.220> increased<00:00:29.640> mobility

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
offer a little increased mobility

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.509 
offer a little increased mobility
compared<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.019> one-piece<00:00:31.560> design<00:00:31.769> but

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
compared to just a one-piece design but

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:33.590 
compared to just a one-piece design but
it<00:00:32.580> would<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.760> been<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.879> little<00:00:33.030> bit<00:00:33.210> nicer<00:00:33.330> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it would have been a little bit nicer to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.299 
it would have been a little bit nicer to
see<00:00:33.720> some<00:00:33.870> elastic<00:00:34.440> strips<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.070> those

attachment to increase the mobility

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.139 
attachment to increase the mobility
they've<00:00:37.739> also<00:00:37.950> added<00:00:38.219> some<00:00:38.370> segments<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.059> you

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
they've also added some segments as you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.910 
they've also added some segments as you
can<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:39.780> helping<00:00:40.110> out<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.739> that

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
can see here helping out with that

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.740 
can see here helping out with that
mobility<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.520> well<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.940> both<00:00:42.149> sides<00:00:42.420> as

outside regions of the pad and then they

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
outside regions of the pad and then they
go<00:01:33.119> ahead<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> they've<00:01:33.780> doubled<00:01:34.049> up<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.560> the
