00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 with a very aggressive man and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.330
 fort military trend has in the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.480
 market a more powerful elastic the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.950
 segment left its factory in 1983 and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.670
 since then, nothing has gone wrong 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.160
 sales particularly in the US market 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.310
 I'm a coconut and today we're going to try it for 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.960
 rangers in its maximum version the 4x4 and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.960
 many let's see what I can do 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.190
 two 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.620
 and what do we expect from a bite like this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.949
 a very strong bond able to resist 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.510
 the most extreme working conditions 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.720
 the force in 2015 has below the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.720
 capot a very powerful engine let's see it 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.870
 diesel turbo tdci 5 cylinder in 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.440
 line 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.800
 with a volume of 3.2 liters and a torque 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.700
 of 470 newtons meter what gives us a 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.600
 power of 197 hp for its versions 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.230
 nothing bad but it does not start that 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.230
 only it looks stocky but it is 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.550
 and then to handle them for a few hours 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.440
 we can say that they have surprised us 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.680
 pleasantly performed the engine of the 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.560
 Queen feels a lot of strength 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.020
 quite big when we go down 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.520
 revolutions 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.039
 if we let ourselves be carried away by what we have 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.349
 mentioned in the engine and also when 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.489
 the d is quite big and strong one 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.780
 You may think it is a beast 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.209
 hungry 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.340
 however its mechanical configuration 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.870
 is geared towards efficiency and its 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.010
 fuel consumption is maintained by 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.010
 below the average of this segment 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.150
 almost all its versions are 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.550
 available in mechanical boxes and 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.710
 5 and 6 speed automatic in this 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.660
 version the attraction to the wheels of the 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.610
 Ford rangers is controlled from this 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.370
 selector knob just at the cost of the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.950
 shifter in the first instance 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.290
 comes activating in 2h mode for the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.940
 traction 4 x 2 rear in case of a 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.340
 conventional land management 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.440
 firm and slightly uneven then we have 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.740
 4 hours to have traction in the four 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.380
 wheels distributing the driving force 50% 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.330
 forward and 50% back that allows the 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.560
 truck traveling on surfaces outside 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.560
 the city ​​or asphalt 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.710
 The Ford Ranger is available in your 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.360
 versions x cl xls xlt the limit of in 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.210
 all Latin America that varies according to 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.240
 Traction 4 x 2 4x4 single cabin or 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.340
 double gasoline or diesel system like 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.120
 we already mentioned we are testing the 4x4 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.500
 limited which is one of the most equipped 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.300
 probably the ford ranger is one of 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.490
 the pick up with the inside more 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.290
 sophisticated of its category just for 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.420
 give an example the technology of 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.700
 connectivity and command system 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.010
 voice is very similar to that of a sedan 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.890
 luxury draws our attention 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.260
 the design of its center console that 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.330
 according to the brand is inspired by the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.630
 smartphones and that can be controlled to 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.850
 through a joystick in addition your steering wheel 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.280
 covered in leather gives you that subtle but 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.170
 precise elegant touch the interior is 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.950
 pick up features six airbags 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.420
 front side and curtain one 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.610
 something that has seemed very very 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.950
 practical is that you can see the screen 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.080
 in the back chamber in the mirror 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.350
 Rearview includes on-board computer 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.150
 abs system and swing control 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.150
 trailer in clear case bring one 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.020
 although it is not very common to see a box 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.570
 reductive in automatic versions you're 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.670
 active by moving the knob to 4 dl 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.770
 thus obtaining the greatest possible strength 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.260
 of the four-wheel engine for a 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.870
 off-road driving what are we going 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:43.680
 to try today and see how much we 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.680
 can give the 4x4 the force limit 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.650
 the reinier offers three types of handling 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.110
 automatic sport for when you want 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.210
 maximize engine capacity and 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.980
 manual in case you want to take the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.290
 control and manually change the 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.170
 marches and devices as control of 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.120
 stability that works quite well and 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.400
 it gives us a lot of safety in driving 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.130
 and a differential blockage of the rear 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.340
 that helps maintain the power in case 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.970
 that skids a wheel 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.970
 and 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.370
 we have tried that truck that has been 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.740
 incredible performance on a circuit 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.870
 full of sand one of the most 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.629
 difficult for one pickup and 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.759
 definitely in its version 4 l has 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.710
 been magnificent no one was cut 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:59.000
 moment the engine worked so 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.000
 simply perfect 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.490
 good friends that has been all that 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.599
 we have been able to see from the ford ranger 2015 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.389
 definitely a pretty big car 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:24.150
 robust but from the 27 that we have 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.919
 could show ideal the like to the 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.419
 facebook page and share this 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.190
 video that I did not know much and follow 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.229
 showing them different cars vehicles 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.569
 and everything we're going to find that 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.569
 have wheels and run now thirst
