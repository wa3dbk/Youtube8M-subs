00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.490
 30 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.249
 good 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:50.909
 at 30 years old 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.190
 antonio 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.190
 in these dates of 30 years 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.010
 last 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.120
 and luckily we were loaded with 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.300
 many things as much as it was loaded 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.910
 this championship final and a date 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.320
 before logically I think that missing 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.760
 just a date to define a 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.760
 championship equal against river 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.810
 the lout has been the truck 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 ryder that complicated thing that was a 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.149
 pretty strong decision I think that such 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.219
 time more than this because in that time 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.020
 there was much more rivalry there was another 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.960
 is against other local feelings 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.060
 those of the classics 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.659
 it felt more was more shocking the more 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.399
 strong you played less 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.399
 not so often clear 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.090
 for example now river mouth in the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.090
 summer 45 months 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.040
 it has taken us a few points and 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.069
 We were discounting finding the 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.299
 anxieties of parties 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.299
 people who now never won 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.030
 I think that ours was very meritorious and 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.770
 with a lot of sacrifice in the last eight 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.440
 or nine steps take seven matches 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.330
 we won them 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.910
 included the children of third peoples 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.490
 and weights 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 that gave him the blood that always 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.600
 need to get champion this year was 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.150
 and they gave me and weretilneck and greece where 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.950
 the lower ones that year was blas 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.080
 existence with higher rating than I think 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.510
 that you are the only pain in your mouth that gave 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.680
 the return to the old problem 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.680
 Jaque younger 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.880
 in several matches 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.689
 adapt 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:38.430
 it's not clear like ours as 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.990
 left of river attack a ball 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.850
 crusade 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.490
 I go out to take the riva 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.630
 but comes jumps jumps if it's because 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.630
 they served 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.590
 and then what happens 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:09.770
 and I think not 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:12.130
 let's remember the famous peeling the 62 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.130
 we go
