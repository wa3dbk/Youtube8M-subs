00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello and welcome back today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.189
 I show you how to meet her 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.130
 I can sew it here now 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.130
 my burner tim parat is there in 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.740
 different sizes and very distinctive 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.170
 is that they have a round tip 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.470
 are not pointed here accordingly 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.359
 so that the wool does not break 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.090
 I like to use the smaller one 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.810
 rather than the larger one when with so the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.969
 Kabul work I seldom have so then 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.550
 I still strictly mine here 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.440
 tense and unwashed and have here 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.210
 mine away and i hope i can 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 show you then how to do that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.320
 best for not like any needle 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.710
 Of course, the thread is first 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.449
 moved in and then you have this back 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.590
 with me are that here the knots of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.019
 the left mesh and in which I will 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.939
 now the club live a life 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.420
 means you do not go through the here 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.210
 entire knot how many of you that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.869
 but you only take one here 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.470
 small thread and then you go in 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.520
 knot the next one and pick up there 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.360
 again and a small part thread and in 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.640
 knot the next one and there you take 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:38.220
 again a small thread and so on 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 that will make you some some stitches 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.240
 Much like this, it's like that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.790
 one piece 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.770
 and when you arrive there you turn 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.689
 Just kill her and go for it 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.040
 penultimate again and pulls the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.869
 Thread again through that is important with it 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.759
 if that's my piece of it 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.689
 studio so do not learn the same 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.340
 I can split again so I hope so 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.340
 You have understood everything if you 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.209
 If you have questions you can post the mia 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.170
 or then put fun while washing 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.640
 otherwise you wish a lot of fun with 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.640
 to hide your threads
