 It is here that it is 2 It becomes a room bar of the form where the ship is two 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.800
 eh 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.760
 First, today's ribbon this day Tsuji's cute reborn 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.760
 Oh today 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.360
 I think that I want to use one color 40 centimeter 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.930
 First of all 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.020

 Good with the middle 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.010
 I put out only the size you like 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:29.370
 I was comparing a little 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:29.370
 The tail I've been waiting for can be cut, so let's put it to sleep without writing it this way 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.130
 icom same place 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.440
 Use root 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:43.840
 It will be the same as the wallet of these two loops because you can get rid of it 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.610
 Please 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.360
 Otherwise the atmosphere will change a little 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.360
 Because it is around say 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.090

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.819
 This is completed 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.670
 Because the site for the foot was slightly different 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.070
