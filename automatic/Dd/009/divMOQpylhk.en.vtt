00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.089
 for making milk we need 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.990
 chilled milk 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.990
 chilled preferably in the fridge and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.000
 sadness and proper 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.830
 start about this cave on preferably 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.139
 should clean if left a little 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.400
 pepper just because it's temporary 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.400
 pour milk milk 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.730
 from the calculation of the amount a little bit lower 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.730
 spout milk cold on 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.980
 tilt angle 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.970
 and strove to circus and degrees to 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.079
 did not interfere with the edges 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.760
 milkman can 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:51.999
 place it snout inside wear here 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.170
 it is important to track the height of the fermentation 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:58.550
 Ketcherov on dug in milk and if 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.110
 let go too deep then 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.199
 milk will warm but will not get stuck if 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.210
 raised too high by dug out then 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.680
 there will be a lot of foam 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.460
 rather there will be many bubbles of open 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.770
 him a little 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.930
 a result, it will disperse quickly and 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.690
 reason you do not is important then self 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.640
 position gave her no need 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.380
 do not have to be located near the edge 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.350
 have a center, that is, retreat from 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.290
 edges literally centimeter and main 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.810
 the task is to create a vortex motion 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.180
 milk milkmen 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.990
 my left hand I hold the pitcher not hand already 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.880
 accustomed therefore let's say i'm not really 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.600
 burning and being done to 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.430
 left hand caught a lot of temperature 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.360
 heated milk right hand constantly 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.130
 I hold on the handle 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.510
 because when temperature is a risk 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.820
 then you can rise very much 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.820
 get burned begin to unscrew naryl 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.570
 actually got the foam on top 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.840
 some cures bubbles appeared 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:20.170
 actually the main task for milk is 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.520
 You do not even have any opinion and should be 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.599
 watch how it breaks listens 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.489
 more to the ear 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:35.640
 if it bleeds it means that we 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.850
 lowered the panorama deep if 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.950
 it's about whistling it and now I will not 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.860
 show should not be about the means 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.480
 so we gave ways to understand more deeply 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.890
 can be easy if there are a lot of bubbles 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.209
 means generally raised high 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.010
 here actually to get rid of 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.350
 bubbles 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.660
 make advancement can give milk 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.550
 stand up a little this moment myself 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.250
 right moment to cook 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.819
 espresso and actually on to 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.890
 bubbles 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.630
 already burst can a couple of times simple 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.550
 here milk is not the most 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.410
 high-quality melt dawn after all 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.470
 left that is not perfect here 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:24.150
 gloss if there is such a problem happens 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.130
 helping in the following way not 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.489
 pounding too hard cover with 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.150
 napkin version and you can satellite 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.150
 now the last 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.700
 the principle has stabilized though anyway 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.700
 milk is not the most efficient general
