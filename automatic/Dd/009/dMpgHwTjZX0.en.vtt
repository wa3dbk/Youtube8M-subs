hi<00:00:03.409> this<00:00:03.470> is<00:00:03.710> a<00:00:04.330> 3d<00:00:05.330> printer<00:00:05.510> as<00:00:05.779> Justin<00:00:06.290> said

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
hi this is a 3d printer as Justin said

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.119 
hi this is a 3d printer as Justin said
and<00:00:06.830> I<00:00:07.549> named<00:00:08.510> it<00:00:08.630> Genesis<00:00:09.590> because<00:00:09.889> it's<00:00:10.010> my

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:10.129 
and I named it Genesis because it's my

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.950 
and I named it Genesis because it's my
first<00:00:10.400> one<00:00:10.639> and<00:00:10.910> the<00:00:11.389> company<00:00:11.750> name<00:00:11.870> is

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
first one and the company name is

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.089 
first one and the company name is
creator<00:00:12.639> I<00:00:13.639> saw<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:14.480> design<00:00:14.840> on<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.769> Internet

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
creator I saw the design on the Internet

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.130 
creator I saw the design on the Internet
obviously<00:00:16.790> they're<00:00:17.180> actually<00:00:17.630> I<00:00:17.660> read<00:00:17.840> it<00:00:17.990> in

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
obviously they're actually I read it in

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.190 
obviously they're actually I read it in
woodshop<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:19.340> I<00:00:20.090> decided<00:00:20.450> to<00:00:20.570> build<00:00:20.810> one<00:00:21.020> from

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
woodshop and I decided to build one from

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.310 
woodshop and I decided to build one from
scratch<00:00:21.790> mine's<00:00:22.790> quite<00:00:23.509> significantly

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
scratch mine's quite significantly

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.100 
scratch mine's quite significantly
larger<00:00:24.980> than<00:00:25.189> any<00:00:25.939> of<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.149> ones<00:00:26.360> that<00:00:26.509> i<00:00:26.960> have

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
larger than any of the ones that i have

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.769 
larger than any of the ones that i have
seen<00:00:27.439> plus<00:00:27.829> ax<00:00:27.860> how<00:00:28.130> you<00:00:28.189> had<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:28.460> pieces<00:00:28.849> made

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
seen plus ax how you had the pieces made

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.019 
seen plus ax how you had the pieces made
all<00:00:29.989> the<00:00:30.110> pieces<00:00:30.320> on<00:00:30.710> our<00:00:30.950> other<00:00:31.130> cnc<00:00:31.700> machine

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
all the pieces on our other cnc machine

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.430 
all the pieces on our other cnc machine
on<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.300> router<00:00:32.509> and<00:00:33.519> I<00:00:35.170> designed<00:00:36.170> them<00:00:36.289> all

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
on the router and I designed them all

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.340 
on the router and I designed them all
from<00:00:36.590> scratch<00:00:36.769> it<00:00:37.699> took<00:00:37.910> that<00:00:38.660> took<00:00:38.929> what<00:00:39.170> the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
from scratch it took that took what the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.560 
from scratch it took that took what the
majority<00:00:39.500> of<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:39.949> time<00:00:40.160> was<00:00:40.609> to<00:00:40.969> design<00:00:41.149> all

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
majority of the time was to design all

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.340 
majority of the time was to design all
the<00:00:41.719> pieces<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:43.280> here<00:00:44.030> i<00:00:44.179> can<00:00:44.449> jump<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.079> thing

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
the pieces and here i can jump the thing

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.069 
the pieces and here i can jump the thing
around<00:00:46.749> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
around so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.840 
around so
works<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.190> sandwich<00:00:50.550> see

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
works like the other sandwich see

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.849 
works like the other sandwich see
machine<00:00:51.269> and<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.960> got<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.289> same<00:00:52.469> basic

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
machine and you got the same basic

00:00:52.859 --> 00:01:01.549 
machine and you got the same basic
controls<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:54.859> all<00:00:55.859> the<00:00:56.039> access<00:01:00.440> just<00:01:01.440> had<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
controls and all the access just had a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.259 
controls and all the access just had a
good<00:01:01.710> time<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.129> saw<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.549> design<00:01:02.909> thought<00:01:03.149> it'd

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
good time I saw the design thought it'd

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.670 
good time I saw the design thought it'd
be<00:01:03.329> fun<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.250> start<00:01:05.250> working<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:06.680> run

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
be fun to do and start working on run

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.870 
be fun to do and start working on run
through<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> couple<00:01:07.890> parts<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.549> us<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.789> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
through a couple parts for us that you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
through a couple parts for us that you
built<00:01:09.090> especially<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:10.200> ones<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
built especially the ones that the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.510 
built especially the ones that the
bearings<00:01:11.009> head<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:15.920> one<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.009> my<00:01:17.100> favorite

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
bearings head I one of my favorite

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.930 
bearings head I one of my favorite
things<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.270> had<00:01:18.899> to<00:01:19.020> build<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:21.049> this<00:01:22.049> axis

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
things that I had to build was this axis

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.210 
things that I had to build was this axis
because<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:25.140> took<00:01:25.289> a<00:01:25.350> long<00:01:25.530> time<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.860> figure

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
because it took a long time to figure

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.510 
because it took a long time to figure
out<00:01:26.399> how<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.940> was<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.569> cause<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.520> stay

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
out how I was going to cause it to stay

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.529 
out how I was going to cause it to stay
full<00:01:30.270> sideways<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.819> front<00:01:32.819> and<00:01:32.940> backwards<00:01:33.209> so

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
full sideways and front and backwards so

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.630 
full sideways and front and backwards so
it<00:01:33.569> doesn't<00:01:33.990> jerk<00:01:34.259> around<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.830> screw<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.580> my

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it doesn't jerk around and screw up my

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.830 
it doesn't jerk around and screw up my
print<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.659> didn't<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.709> much<00:01:38.009> room<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
print so I didn't have much room and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.260 
print so I didn't have much room and
these<00:01:39.840> arms<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.409> back<00:01:40.679> I<00:01:41.039> had<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.789> cut<00:01:42.149> off

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
these arms on the back I had to cut off

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.570 
these arms on the back I had to cut off
the<00:01:42.299> arms<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.810> right<00:01:42.959> size<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.310> they

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
the arms to the right size so that they

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.190 
the arms to the right size so that they
were<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:45.060> length<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.569> I<00:01:45.780> still<00:01:46.049> have

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
were just right length that I still have

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.010 
were just right length that I still have
maximum<00:01:46.709> height<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:48.060> spring<00:01:48.330> can<00:01:48.750> still

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
maximum height and the spring can still

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.779 
maximum height and the spring can still
hold<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.409> together<00:01:49.560> without<00:01:49.950> pulling<00:01:50.490> too

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
hold them together without pulling too

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.240 
hold them together without pulling too
far<00:01:51.030> apart<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.630> took<00:01:52.500> me<00:01:52.649> almost<00:01:52.860> three

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
far apart that took me almost three

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.150 
far apart that took me almost three
weeks<00:01:53.819> just<00:01:54.179> to<00:01:54.360> figure<00:01:54.599> out<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:55.500> part<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
weeks just to figure out this part and

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.930 
weeks just to figure out this part and
how<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.819> this<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.709> then<00:01:58.709> my<00:01:59.099> most<00:01:59.610> favorite

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
how to do this and then my most favorite

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.080 
how to do this and then my most favorite
part<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.209> this<00:02:00.360> machine<00:02:00.539> is<00:02:01.019> the<00:02:01.830> gantry<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
part on this machine is the gantry the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.930 
part on this machine is the gantry the
gantry<00:02:03.479> took<00:02:03.979> probably<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.190> month<00:02:05.489> just<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
gantry took probably a month just to

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.850 
gantry took probably a month just to
figure<00:02:06.300> out<00:02:06.420> how<00:02:06.629> to<00:02:06.690> make<00:02:06.929> work<00:02:07.319> properly

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
figure out how to make work properly

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.660 
figure out how to make work properly
without<00:02:08.610> having<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.300> jerk<00:02:09.539> around<00:02:09.690> too<00:02:10.080> much

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
without having a jerk around too much

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.420 
without having a jerk around too much
because<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.599> know<00:02:12.720> all<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.709> designs<00:02:14.010> i<00:02:14.190> saw

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
because you know all the designs i saw

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.130 
because you know all the designs i saw
there<00:02:14.610> was<00:02:14.730> no<00:02:14.910> Gansa<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.660> bottom<00:02:15.930> plate

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
there was no Gansa just a bottom plate

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.040 
there was no Gansa just a bottom plate
move<00:02:16.349> back<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.739> forth<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.730> had<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.050> figure

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
move back and forth so I had to figure

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.720
