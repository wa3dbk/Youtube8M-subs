00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.890
 hi friends from youtube I bring you a 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.540
 tutorial that a lot of people that are 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.850
 catching it is like taking the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.800
 online games although nothing because that does not 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.610
 will fix your pc if you have little reason 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.310
 a little processor but something in the help 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.130
 little but what serves 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.650
 what we started with him here if being in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.939
 windows 8 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.720
 well he regretted how they would work 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.390
 there are 17 and 18 300 m collectively 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.420
 by jean-pierre red 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.260
 and if you open this registry editor with 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.380
 yes and here we can see this well 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.760
 local machine open they go to software 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.089
 and here it is vain 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.750
 microsoft here after microsoft 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.950
 huertanas 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.950
 windows nt 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.750
 of reinvestment illusions open and they 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.750
 they go here to one and a half 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.739
 there are new 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:19.200
 and here we go after these two things but 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.600
 this time is to show a value the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.550
 number is one side we're going to 45 days and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 it does not matter of smudges are ubrique in 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.440
 hexadecimal and put 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.750
 because you can not stop moving 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.750
 then if they give you they will accept 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.610
 the file has not been saved 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.530
 you go back to your pc and I would have eaten 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.899
 after this language is internet 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.850
 but if you do not fix the graphics and 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.319
 the things that they have to do good and 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.799
