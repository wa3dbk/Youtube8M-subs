millions<00:00:00.840> of<00:00:00.900> people<00:00:01.050> die<00:00:01.770> every<00:00:01.800> year

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
millions of people die every year

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.700 
millions of people die every year
because<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:03.149> lack<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.480> access<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.350> clean

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
because of lack of access to clean

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.010 
because of lack of access to clean
drinking<00:00:04.859> water<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.790> it's<00:00:06.390> been<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> serious

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
drinking water and it's been a serious

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.299 
drinking water and it's been a serious
problem<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.379> scientists<00:00:07.890> have<00:00:07.980> been<00:00:08.040> trying

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
problem that scientists have been trying

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.330 
problem that scientists have been trying
to<00:00:08.370> tackle<00:00:08.580> desalination<00:00:09.480> turning<00:00:10.340> uncodable

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
to tackle desalination turning uncodable

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.770 
to tackle desalination turning uncodable
water<00:00:11.670> into<00:00:12.090> something<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.450> we<00:00:12.660> could

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
water into something that we could

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.259 
water into something that we could
actually<00:00:12.929> drink<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:14.400> third<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> world

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
actually drink and a third of the world

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.200 
actually drink and a third of the world
is<00:00:15.509> actually<00:00:15.990> water<00:00:16.199> stressed<00:00:16.710> meaning<00:00:17.220> they

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
is actually water stressed meaning they

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.470 
is actually water stressed meaning they
are<00:00:18.480> vulnerable<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:19.609> dying<00:00:20.609> because<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.330> lack

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
are vulnerable to dying because of lack

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.250 
are vulnerable to dying because of lack
of<00:00:21.810> clean<00:00:22.410> drinking<00:00:22.800> water<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.900> problem

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
of clean drinking water and the problem

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.960 
of clean drinking water and the problem
of<00:00:25.350> desalination<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.369> prohibitively

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
of desalination is it's prohibitively

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.140 
of desalination is it's prohibitively
expensive<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.060> with<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
expensive to do right and with the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.400 
expensive to do right and with the
current<00:00:30.390> techniques<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:30.990> there's<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.199> new

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
current techniques but there's a new

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.950 
current techniques but there's a new
technique<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.239> actually<00:00:33.239> looks<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.600> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
technique that actually looks like it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.470 
technique that actually looks like it's
has<00:00:34.829> potential<00:00:35.399> yeah<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> could<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:35.940> promising

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
has potential yeah it could be promising

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.840 
has potential yeah it could be promising
yeah<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.590> generally<00:00:38.219> speaking<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> way

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
yeah so so generally speaking the way

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.600 
yeah so so generally speaking the way
that<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.930> desalinate<00:00:40.649> water<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that we desalinate water is it's a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.910 
that we desalinate water is it's a
membrane<00:00:41.940> technique<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.809> salt<00:00:43.680> water

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
membrane technique right so salt water

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.180 
membrane technique right so salt water
has<00:00:44.219> salt<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.660> black<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
has salt in it it's a black what it's a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
has salt in it it's a black what it's a
soul<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.610> salt<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.450> larger<00:00:49.110> than<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.559> certain

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
soul you salt is larger than a certain

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.430 
soul you salt is larger than a certain
size<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.690> put<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> membrane<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
size so you can put a membrane in the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.260 
size so you can put a membrane in the
water<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.399> water<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.789> fall<00:00:54.000> through<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
water the water will fall through the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.540 
water the water will fall through the
membrane<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> salt<00:00:55.260> won't<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:56.460> how

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
membrane and the salt won't that's how

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.010 
membrane and the salt won't that's how
we've<00:00:56.670> always<00:00:56.789> done<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
we've always done it but you have to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.270 
we've always done it but you have to
actually<00:00:58.170> add<00:00:58.410> some<00:00:58.620> sort<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.859> force<00:00:59.100> some

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
actually add some sort of force some

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.799 
actually add some sort of force some
sort<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> energy<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.030> push<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> water<00:01:00.539> through

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
sort of energy to push the water through

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.880 
sort of energy to push the water through
otherwise<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.320> takes<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:01.680> long<00:01:01.770> time

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
otherwise it takes a really long time

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
otherwise it takes a really long time
and<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:02.940> only<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.510> small

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and you can really only do this in small

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.590 
and you can really only do this in small
batches<00:01:04.010> but<00:01:05.010> these<00:01:05.820> researchers<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
batches but these researchers at the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000 
batches but these researchers at the
University<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.080> Texas<00:01:07.290> Austin<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
University of Texas Austin and the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.130 
University of Texas Austin and the
University<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.790> Marburg<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.570> developed

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
University of Marburg have developed

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
University of Marburg have developed
it's<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.710> small<00:01:10.950> chip<00:01:11.340> kind<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.150> looks<00:01:12.299> like

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it's a small chip kind of looks like

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.190 
it's a small chip kind of looks like
your<00:01:12.570> necklace<00:01:12.750> um<00:01:13.500> yeah<00:01:14.010> what<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
your necklace um yeah what and and the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.450 
your necklace um yeah what and and the
idea<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.280> pass

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
idea here is that they can pass

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.280 
idea here is that they can pass
low-voltage<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.570> small<00:01:18.780> electrical<00:01:19.229> current

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
low-voltage a small electrical current

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
low-voltage a small electrical current
it<00:01:19.590> looks<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.830> about<00:01:20.040> three<00:01:20.310> volts<00:01:20.670> through

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it looks like about three volts through

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
it looks like about three volts through
this<00:01:21.360> plastic<00:01:21.810> chip<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.200> they<00:01:22.350> filled<00:01:22.590> with

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this plastic chip that they filled with

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.460 
this plastic chip that they filled with
seawater<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.850> shunts<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.930> salt<00:01:25.229> because

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
seawater and it shunts the salt because

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.800 
seawater and it shunts the salt because
that's<00:01:25.740> an<00:01:25.860> ion<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.299> it's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that's an ion so it's going to it's

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.390 
that's an ion so it's going to it's
going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.080> react<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> electricity<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
going to react with the electricity and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
going to react with the electricity and
be<00:01:29.520> shunted<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.360> direction<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
be shunted in one direction and the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.170 
be shunted in one direction and the
freshwater<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:32.189> start<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.610> form<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.939> little

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
freshwater will start to form a little

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.480 
freshwater will start to form a little
reservoir<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.110> other<00:01:34.710> direction

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
reservoir in the other direction

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.580 
reservoir in the other direction
they're<00:01:36.150> only<00:01:36.299> doing<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.810> at<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> level<00:01:37.290> that's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
they're only doing it at a level that's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.469 
they're only doing it at a level that's
about<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.040> big<00:01:38.280> right<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.670> yeah<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.270> was

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
about this big right now yeah that was

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
about this big right now yeah that was
one<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> main<00:01:40.049> problems<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
one of the main problems with this I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.639 
one of the main problems with this I
read<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.430> was<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.090> only<00:01:42.210> achieve<00:01:42.649> 25%

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
read it was they can only achieve 25%

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.280 
read it was they can only achieve 25%
desalination<00:01:43.950> at<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.430> point<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.170> what<00:01:46.170> was

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
desalination at this point and what was

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.010 
desalination at this point and what was
it<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.770> day<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.430> could<00:01:48.020> desalinate

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it like in a day they could desalinate

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.730 
it like in a day they could desalinate
one<00:01:49.439> nano<00:01:49.799> liter<00:01:50.130> yeah<00:01:51.079> that's<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.200> millionth

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
one nano liter yeah that's a millionth

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
one nano liter yeah that's a millionth
of<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.009> liter<00:01:53.040> yeah<00:01:53.640> yeah<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.899> we're<00:01:55.079> talking

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
of a liter yeah yeah so we're talking

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.590 
of a liter yeah yeah so we're talking
about<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.770> reservoir<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.759> tiny<00:01:57.030> chip<00:01:57.360> we're

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
about a reservoir in a tiny chip we're

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.179 
about a reservoir in a tiny chip we're

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
talking about it only being 25%

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
talking about it only being 25%

with<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.369> health<00:02:05.520> effects<00:02:05.759> like

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
with all the health effects like

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760 
with all the health effects like
cremation<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.960> their<00:02:07.110> cells<00:02:07.290> shrinking

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
cremation you know their cells shrinking

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.339 
cremation you know their cells shrinking
but<00:02:08.069> basically<00:02:09.000> dehydration<00:02:09.750> drinking

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
but basically dehydration drinking

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.050 
but basically dehydration drinking
seawater<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:11.039> dehydrate<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> know<00:02:11.879> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
seawater will dehydrate you I know it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.960 
seawater will dehydrate you I know it
sounds<00:02:12.270> crazy<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.290> talk<00:02:13.410> about<00:02:13.530> awesome

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
sounds crazy we can talk about awesome

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.000 
sounds crazy we can talk about awesome
I<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.450> explain<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.080> look<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.860> up

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
I can explain to you I look it up

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.040 
I can explain to you I look it up
remember<00:02:16.370> from<00:02:16.670> freshman<00:02:17.060> biology<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:17.960> you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
remember from freshman biology but you

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.750 
remember from freshman biology but you
can't<00:02:18.290> drink<00:02:18.560> seawater<00:02:18.800> it's<00:02:19.160> really<00:02:19.400> bad<00:02:19.550> for

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
can't drink seawater it's really bad for

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.300 
can't drink seawater it's really bad for
your<00:02:19.820> cells<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.380> idea<00:02:21.650> here<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:22.040> that

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
your cells and so the idea here is that

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.400 
your cells and so the idea here is that
they've<00:02:22.700> only<00:02:22.880> been<00:02:23.090> able<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.390> achieve<00:02:23.540> 25%

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
they've only been able to achieve 25%

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.310 
they've only been able to achieve 25%
desalination<00:02:24.940> but<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.480> looks<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> step<00:02:27.170> in

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
desalination but it looks like a step in

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.960 
desalination but it looks like a step in
the<00:02:27.380> right<00:02:27.530> direction<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:28.460> if<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.790> can

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
the right direction that if you can

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.810 
the right direction that if you can
deliver<00:02:29.240> this<00:02:29.570> low<00:02:29.900> voltage<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.820> small

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
deliver this low voltage on a small

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.280 
deliver this low voltage on a small
scale<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.240> may<00:02:32.360> be<00:02:32.420> able<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.870> scalable

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
scale it may be able to be scalable

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.930 
scale it may be able to be scalable
because<00:02:33.500> right<00:02:33.770> now<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.070> looks<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.730> may

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
because right now it looks like this may

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.700 
because right now it looks like this may
be<00:02:34.970> able<00:02:35.210> to<00:02:35.300> run<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.600> something<00:02:36.020> with<00:02:36.230> as<00:02:36.380> low

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
be able to run on something with as low

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.340 
be able to run on something with as low
energy<00:02:36.740> as<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:38.120> simple<00:02:38.540> like<00:02:38.660> double-a<00:02:38.990> battery

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
energy as a simple like double-a battery

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.190 
energy as a simple like double-a battery
that's<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.130> huge<00:02:40.610> small<00:02:41.120> chip<00:02:41.390> or<00:02:41.660> if<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.080> were

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
that's a huge small chip or if you were

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.140 
that's a huge small chip or if you were
to<00:02:42.440> expand<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.100> I'm<00:02:43.340> not<00:02:43.520> sure<00:02:43.700> I'm<00:02:43.940> not<00:02:43.970> sure

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
to expand this I'm not sure I'm not sure

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.790 
to expand this I'm not sure I'm not sure
when<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.480> comes<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.750> being<00:02:44.900> scalable<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.590> does

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
when it comes to being scalable it does

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.980 
when it comes to being scalable it does
seem<00:02:46.100> like<00:02:46.130> though<00:02:46.640> it's<00:02:46.910> going<00:02:47.210> to<00:02:47.330> have<00:02:47.750> low

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
seem like though it's going to have low

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.870 
seem like though it's going to have low
energy<00:02:48.200> consumption<00:02:49.040> compared<00:02:49.640> to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880

straight kind of membrane filtration so

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.330 
straight kind of membrane filtration so

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
this planet tough part I know that we

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.640 
this planet tough part I know that we
can't<00:03:20.000> drink<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.570> know<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.959> so<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.350> be<00:03:21.560> able

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
can't drink it I know and so to be able

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.830 
can't drink it I know and so to be able
to<00:03:21.920> converge<00:03:22.310> sea<00:03:22.910> water<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.270> fresh<00:03:23.480> drinkable

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
to converge sea water to fresh drinkable

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.750 
to converge sea water to fresh drinkable
water<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.290> mean<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.370> would<00:03:25.459> be<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.580> game-changer

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
water I mean it would be a game-changer

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.160 
water I mean it would be a game-changer
