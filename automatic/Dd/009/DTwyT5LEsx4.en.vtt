 favorites of the month I will start with the 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.660

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.719

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.320
 fourth his little one and a pastel pink but 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.650
 very intense then these were my 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.120
 favorites of this month are and godfathers 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:00.150
 the only thing that I see them really 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.129
 it's okay the product is against water or 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.290
 be that if you can you can apply and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.340
 they go to bathe or they get into the pool 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.860
 this is the rose this is the green peek 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.800
 you can is this is the other rose is a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.320
 rose more conservative weighing more 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.880
 short is a set that is one more rose 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.100
 Elegant 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.610
 They will be put to bathe for 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.439
 go where they want these are the two 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.940
 blue this is the blues is that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.600
 is the being that is a blue plus 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.190
 and with its purple tone and this is the one 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.750
 we like to do lies blue, which is more 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.280
 water and that will seat us for 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.710
 any look can be put as 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.110
 the eyeliner for the top 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.690
 as a color on the eyelid for 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.730
 blur them they go with color to the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.310
 pool and so on then the only thing 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.050
 I see them is that they dry very fast 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.420
 but very fast that they have to work 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.580
 put them to apply them and leave them 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 dry out and you can not put them 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.710
 second layer because if it does not start to 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.110
 lift begins to be cartularized and 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.810
 they start to lift and it is to start putting 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.540
 like dishes or then it 's a single layer 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.130
 Quick to work it and already and well here 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.520

 makeup that is from the beach and cosmetics 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:57.449

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.590
 economic others and they come with their faces 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.240
