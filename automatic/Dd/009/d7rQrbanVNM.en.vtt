00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
low in order for it to be able to pull

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.210 
low in order for it to be able to pull
it<00:03:41.220> all<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.340> lies<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.670> spins<00:03:42.030> out<00:03:42.300> right<00:03:42.690> away

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
it all the lies it spins out right away

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.890 
it all the lies it spins out right away
if<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.490> like<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:45.000> can<00:03:45.120> usually<00:03:45.270> do<00:03:45.720> it

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
if just like this you can usually do it

00:03:45.900 --> 00:04:01.760 
if just like this you can usually do it
in<00:03:46.050> too<00:03:46.260> low<00:03:46.970> no<00:03:47.970> problem<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:50.550> we'll<00:03:50.670> go<00:03:50.790> drag

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.460 

there's<00:04:02.400> our<00:04:02.730> adjustment<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.570> Suzuki<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.350> it

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
there's our adjustment to Suzuki so it

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:16.060 
there's our adjustment to Suzuki so it
has<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.740> adjuster<00:04:05.220> up<00:04:05.370> there<00:04:05.670> got<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:06.900> law

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.840 

bitch<00:04:16.610> jars<00:04:16.970> around<00:04:17.420> and<00:04:17.630> look<00:04:17.780> at<00:04:17.960> all<00:04:18.850> my

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
bitch jars around and look at all my

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.200 
bitch jars around and look at all my
bolt<00:04:20.090> broke<00:04:21.220> well<00:04:22.250> we<00:04:22.580> encountered<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.180> few

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
bolt broke well we encountered a few

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.230 
bolt broke well we encountered a few
troubles<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:24.020> busted<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.860> one<00:04:24.980> bolt<00:04:25.280> so<00:04:26.210> I

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
troubles I busted the one bolt so I

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.940 
troubles I busted the one bolt so I
replaced<00:04:26.840> what's<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.170> bolts<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.590> some<00:04:27.740> bigger

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
replaced what's the bolts of some bigger

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.980 
replaced what's the bolts of some bigger
bolts<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:29.720> hardened<00:04:30.560> ones<00:04:31.390> and<00:04:32.390> well<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.600> had

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
bolts and hardened ones and well I had

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.290 
bolts and hardened ones and well I had
to<00:04:33.140> take<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.650> had<00:04:33.770> to<00:04:33.890> go<00:04:34.070> use<00:04:34.880> one<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.150> our

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
to take and I had to go use one of our

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.870 
to take and I had to go use one of our
old<00:04:35.510> tractor<00:04:36.190> one<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.340> change<00:04:37.610> that<00:04:37.700> we

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
old tractor one of the change that we

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.870 
old tractor one of the change that we
had<00:04:38.000> an<00:04:38.150> old<00:04:38.390> truck<00:04:38.750> than<00:04:39.020> our<00:04:39.260> tractor<00:04:39.880> to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
had an old truck than our tractor to

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.370 
had an old truck than our tractor to
pull<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.240> with<00:04:41.420> because<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.990> other<00:04:42.140> chain

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
pull it with because the other chain

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.160 
pull it with because the other chain
wouldn't<00:04:42.830> fit<00:04:43.010> on<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.310> bolt<00:04:43.660> since<00:04:44.660> it<00:04:44.870> has

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
wouldn't fit on the bolt since it has

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:58.060 
wouldn't fit on the bolt since it has
smaller<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.950> so<00:04:46.540> this<00:04:47.540> chain<00:04:47.780> will<00:04:47.900> work<00:04:57.070> so

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
smaller and so this chain will work so

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.690 
smaller and so this chain will work so
we're<00:04:58.310> gonna<00:04:58.430> drag<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.970> main<00:04:59.150> driveway<00:04:59.540> now

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
we're gonna drag the main driveway now

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.190 
we're gonna drag the main driveway now
just<00:05:01.700> going<00:05:01.880> straight<00:05:02.150> down<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.750> middle

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
just going straight down the middle

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.510 
just going straight down the middle
you<00:05:03.320> can<00:05:03.410> actually<00:05:03.560> turn<00:05:03.950> this<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.400> it'll

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
you can actually turn this and it'll

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:42.879 
you can actually turn this and it'll
push<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:04.820> dirt<00:05:05.240> off<00:05:05.480> to<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.870> side

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:51.310 

so<00:05:43.889> I<00:05:44.100> taught<00:05:44.430> drags

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.160 

as<00:05:51.920> my<00:05:52.280> brother<00:05:52.610> got<00:05:53.360> him<00:05:53.480> to<00:05:53.600> come<00:05:53.780> out<00:05:53.930> so<00:05:54.110> I

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
as my brother got him to come out so I

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:06.440 
as my brother got him to come out so I
get<00:05:54.380> some<00:05:54.560> video

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.400 

originally<00:06:07.450> I<00:06:07.480> built<00:06:07.810> this<00:06:08.020> so<00:06:08.230> we<00:06:08.290> could

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
originally I built this so we could

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.630 
originally I built this so we could
smooth<00:06:08.680> out<00:06:08.920> the<00:06:09.100> end<00:06:09.220> of<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.400> driveway

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
smooth out the end of the driveway

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.370 
smooth out the end of the driveway
because<00:06:09.820> they'd<00:06:10.120> drop<00:06:10.390> off<00:06:10.690> onto<00:06:11.140> the<00:06:11.230> road

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
because they'd drop off onto the road

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.080 
because they'd drop off onto the road
from<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:11.910> road<00:06:12.910> grade<00:06:13.240> grater<00:06:14.940> and<00:06:15.940> then<00:06:16.060> I

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
from the road grade grater and then I

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.120 
from the road grade grater and then I
just<00:06:16.360> added<00:06:16.780> the<00:06:17.140> weight<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:17.530> started<00:06:17.890> using

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
just added the weight and started using

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:32.390 
just added the weight and started using
it<00:06:18.400> to<00:06:18.550> do<00:06:18.700> this

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.400 

now<00:06:32.970> we'll<00:06:33.120> get<00:06:33.270> it<00:06:33.360> turned<00:06:33.570> sideways<00:06:33.870> to<00:06:34.260> push

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
now we'll get it turned sideways to push

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:41.019 
now we'll get it turned sideways to push
the<00:06:34.620> gravel<00:06:35.040> out

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:41.029 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:42.999 

oh<00:06:41.059> my<00:06:41.629> god<00:06:41.749> so<00:06:41.959> you<00:06:42.019> can<00:06:42.139> push<00:06:42.289> gravel<00:06:42.739> all<00:06:42.889> you

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
oh my god so you can push gravel all you

00:06:43.009 --> 00:07:16.519 
oh my god so you can push gravel all you
can't<00:06:43.249> see<00:06:43.459> it<00:06:43.519> ball<00:06:43.759> dust<00:06:44.059> now

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:16.529 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:20.659 

all<00:07:17.129> right<00:07:17.219> so<00:07:17.489> that's<00:07:17.579> my<00:07:17.789> homemade<00:07:18.209> drag
