00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.340
 Hello everyone! Well, we have finished this 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.450
 layout with front suspension 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:17.100
 still stopped on the lever with the steering 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.410
 finger now how would it all mock 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.640
 fitting room of thin metal cut 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.849
 but it keeps here 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 I redid the steering I just 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.180
 I will tell further here it turned out me with 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.770
 fist is still well so on Zhigulin not 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.739
 pressed in here in general here is such 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.290
 get the maximum angle from him 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.879
 twisting ie for example 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.969
 Jacks is beginning to have 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.500
 rises and the opposite part like 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.530
 would to maximize it again without 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 pillows without but without elastic elements so 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.170
 here are the traits I got what that is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.840
 here is the block itself period yes it is almost still 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.049
 just started to curl on it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.729
 as if effort is minimal the main effort 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.280
 took over himself so here he looks 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.189
 that is, here it is already turned everything on 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.189
 maximum and starts silent block 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.850
 the pen system itself is here with us 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.700
 such 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.280
 that is, there we sat on the block 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.820
 such longitudinal to from longitudinal 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.369
 rear strut attack strut will 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.310
 analysis for now 5 wives so for example 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.310
 done say here it is 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.930
 with a lot of faces on the face of 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.930
 looks like this 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.130
 platform 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.880
 and, accordingly, the lever itself lever I, too 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:12.100
 I'll tell you a little further what else 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.650
 You can probably show me further 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.370
 I will now sort them out separately for foty 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.370
 the elements themselves
