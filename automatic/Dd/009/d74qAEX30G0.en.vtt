00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.010 
but also you need some kind of surface
to<00:02:26.890> dab<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.700> nail<00:02:27.850> polish<00:02:28.270> on<00:02:28.390> obviously<00:02:28.780> i

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
to dab the nail polish on obviously i

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.590 
to dab the nail polish on obviously i
use<00:02:29.410> my<00:02:29.790> traditional<00:02:30.790> little<00:02:31.060> dish<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.540> i

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
use my traditional little dish that i

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.050 
use my traditional little dish that i
always<00:02:32.500> use<00:02:32.710> but<00:02:33.370> basically<00:02:33.820> you're<00:02:34.000> just

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
always use but basically you're just

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.970 
always use but basically you're just
going<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.390> draw<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.660> face<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.440> screen<00:02:35.740> guy

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
going to draw the face on the screen guy

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.180 
going to draw the face on the screen guy
and<00:02:36.280> i<00:02:36.640> definitely<00:02:37.090> recommend<00:02:37.890> looking<00:02:38.890> at<00:02:39.160> a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
and i definitely recommend looking at a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.500 
and i definitely recommend looking at a
picture<00:02:39.520> while<00:02:39.850> you're<00:02:40.000> doing<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.300> that's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
picture while you're doing this that's

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.570 
picture while you're doing this that's
what<00:02:40.630> i<00:02:40.750> did<00:02:41.140> he<00:02:41.320> kind<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.560> has<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> weird<00:02:42.040> eyes<00:02:42.520> a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
what i did he kind of has a weird eyes a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.300 
what i did he kind of has a weird eyes a
really<00:02:43.360> long<00:02:43.600> mouth<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.200> nose<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.980> i<00:02:45.010> guess

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
really long mouth and a nose so i guess

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:57.839 
really long mouth and a nose so i guess
just<00:02:45.520> kind<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.880> watch<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.870> learn

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.550 

so<00:02:58.849> once<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.329> are<00:02:59.420> done<00:02:59.599> with<00:02:59.659> that<00:02:59.930> then<00:03:00.140> you

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
so once you are done with that then you

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.080 
so once you are done with that then you
are<00:03:00.590> completely<00:03:01.219> finished<00:03:01.640> with<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.879> middle

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
are completely finished with the middle

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.309 
are completely finished with the middle
finger<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.450> now<00:03:02.750> we're<00:03:02.900> going<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.049> be<00:03:03.170> working

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
finger and now we're going to be working

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.920 
finger and now we're going to be working
on<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.709> other<00:03:03.950> ones<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:05.359> first<00:03:05.689> we're<00:03:05.840> going

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
on the other ones so first we're going

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.080 
on the other ones so first we're going
to<00:03:05.989> grab<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.469> red<00:03:06.950> nail<00:03:07.159> polish<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.730> chose<00:03:08.060> this

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
to grab a red nail polish I chose this

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.110 
to grab a red nail polish I chose this
one<00:03:08.420> from<00:03:08.659> OPI<00:03:09.109> and<00:03:09.500> it's<00:03:10.189> a<00:03:10.310> really<00:03:10.459> nice<00:03:10.640> dark

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
one from OPI and it's a really nice dark

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.789 
one from OPI and it's a really nice dark
red<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.810> reminds<00:03:12.230> me<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.500> color<00:03:12.709> of

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
red and it reminds me of the color of

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.860 
red and it reminds me of the color of
blood<00:03:13.159> so<00:03:13.579> that<00:03:13.609> is<00:03:14.030> why<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.209> chose<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.540> because

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
blood so that is why I chose it because

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.289 
blood so that is why I chose it because
on<00:03:15.650> our<00:03:16.069> three<00:03:16.370> other<00:03:16.579> nails<00:03:16.849> we're<00:03:17.120> going<00:03:17.239> to

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
on our three other nails we're going to

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.990 
on our three other nails we're going to
be<00:03:17.390> kind<00:03:17.659> of<00:03:17.750> drawing<00:03:18.470> blood<00:03:18.859> marks<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:19.970> our

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
be kind of drawing blood marks so on our

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.399 
be kind of drawing blood marks so on our
ring<00:03:20.299> finger<00:03:20.329> we're<00:03:20.840> going<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.049> be<00:03:21.109> drawing<00:03:21.260> a

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
ring finger we're going to be drawing a

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.250 
ring finger we're going to be drawing a
handprint<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:22.420> this<00:03:23.420> looks<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:23.989> it'd<00:03:24.139> be

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
handprint and this looks like it'd be

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.379 
handprint and this looks like it'd be
hard<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.859> seriously<00:03:25.280> wasn't<00:03:25.670> hard<00:03:25.909> at<00:03:26.060> all

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
hard but it seriously wasn't hard at all

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.270 
hard but it seriously wasn't hard at all
the<00:03:26.689> face<00:03:26.930> was<00:03:27.170> definitely<00:03:27.650> harder<00:03:27.980> than<00:03:28.189> the

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
the face was definitely harder than the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.099 
the face was definitely harder than the
handprint<00:03:28.730> but<00:03:29.269> all<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.569> really<00:03:29.599> got<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.989> do

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
handprint but all you really got to do

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.949 
handprint but all you really got to do
is<00:03:30.349> just<00:03:30.379> google<00:03:30.980> bloody<00:03:31.310> handprint<00:03:31.879> and<00:03:32.120> just

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
is just google bloody handprint and just

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.339 
is just google bloody handprint and just
completely<00:03:33.319> copy<00:03:33.950> off<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.609> photo<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.480> that's

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
completely copy off a photo and that's

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.750 
completely copy off a photo and that's
kind<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.650> what<00:03:36.769> helped<00:03:37.010> me<00:03:37.159> out<00:03:37.189> or<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.609> could

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
kind of what helped me out or you could

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.699 
kind of what helped me out or you could
just<00:03:37.790> watch<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.389> see<00:03:38.450> how<00:03:38.599> I<00:03:38.689> did<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.139> so<00:03:39.439> I

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
just watch and see how I did it so I

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.679 
just watch and see how I did it so I
can't<00:03:40.549> really<00:03:40.669> explain<00:03:41.030> how<00:03:41.269> to<00:03:41.359> do<00:03:41.540> this

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
can't really explain how to do this

00:03:41.689 --> 00:04:07.550 
can't really explain how to do this
stuff<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.379> just<00:03:42.799> kind<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:43.340> watch<00:03:43.669> and<00:03:43.879> learn

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.320 

so<00:04:08.560> that's<00:04:08.740> how<00:04:08.890> my<00:04:09.070> handprint<00:04:09.640> turned<00:04:10.090> out

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
so that's how my handprint turned out

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.000 
so that's how my handprint turned out
and<00:04:10.720> now<00:04:10.870> we're<00:04:10.990> going<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.140> be<00:04:11.230> working<00:04:11.350> on<00:04:11.770> the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
and now we're going to be working on the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.100 
and now we're going to be working on the
index<00:04:12.460> finger<00:04:12.820> and<00:04:13.000> pinky<00:04:13.450> finger<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:13.990> we're

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
index finger and pinky finger and we're

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.390 
index finger and pinky finger and we're
going<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.290> be<00:04:14.380> doing<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.680> same<00:04:14.710> thing<00:04:15.190> on<00:04:15.370> both

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
going to be doing the same thing on both

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.970 
going to be doing the same thing on both
fingers<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.470> basically<00:04:17.470> what<00:04:17.709> you're<00:04:17.800> just

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
fingers and basically what you're just

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.979 
fingers and basically what you're just
going<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.160> do<00:04:18.310> is<00:04:18.520> create<00:04:18.790> three<00:04:19.180> lines<00:04:19.570> and

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
going to do is create three lines and

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.470 
going to do is create three lines and
just<00:04:20.200> kind<00:04:20.380> of<00:04:20.440> drag<00:04:20.830> them<00:04:21.040> down<00:04:21.480> imperfectly

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
just kind of drag them down imperfectly

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.330 
just kind of drag them down imperfectly
and<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:23.260> is<00:04:23.410> going<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.680> kind<00:04:23.980> of<00:04:24.070> give<00:04:24.310> the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
and this is going to kind of give the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.760 
and this is going to kind of give the
illusions<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:25.060> like<00:04:25.360> bloody<00:04:25.690> hands<00:04:25.960> smearing

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
illusions of like bloody hands smearing

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.740 
illusions of like bloody hands smearing
on<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.040> nail<00:04:27.220> so<00:04:27.880> this<00:04:28.120> doesn't<00:04:28.150> have<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.600> be

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
on the nail so this doesn't have to be

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.480 
on the nail so this doesn't have to be
perfect<00:04:29.290> at<00:04:29.410> all<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.950> actually<00:04:30.250> looks<00:04:30.430> better

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
perfect at all it actually looks better

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.700 
perfect at all it actually looks better
when<00:04:30.910> it's<00:04:31.060> less<00:04:31.270> perfect<00:04:31.510> so<00:04:32.290> just<00:04:32.500> kind<00:04:32.650> of

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
when it's less perfect so just kind of

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.190 
when it's less perfect so just kind of
create<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.190> lines<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:33.730> kind<00:04:33.970> of<00:04:34.060> make<00:04:35.050> them

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
create the lines and kind of make them
