00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
dunkin donuts but we don't have one of

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.449 
dunkin donuts but we don't have one of
those<00:02:51.239> on<00:02:51.420> campus<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.530> there's<00:02:52.680> none<00:02:53.129> near

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
those on campus and there's none near

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.149 
those on campus and there's none near
campus<00:02:53.909> so<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.359> closest<00:02:54.900> thing<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.890> guess

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
campus so the closest thing to I guess

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.770 
campus so the closest thing to I guess
is<00:02:56.340> technically<00:02:56.760> on<00:02:56.970> campus<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.599> if<00:02:57.659> you<00:02:57.720> ever

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
is technically on campus so if you ever

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:08.789 
is technically on campus so if you ever
come<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.989> produce<00:02:58.200> campus<00:02:58.590> here's<00:02:59.159> McDonald's
