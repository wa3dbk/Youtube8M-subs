00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 two 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 I am cerrato I like the service 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.980
 new teaches because it's pretty cool 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.259
 because you add a type of chest is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.390
 like you can camouflage them 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.910
 last mods are like here that I have uploaded 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 they are camouflaging but it is that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.440
 quite general we are because you 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.809
 add the possibility of putting in 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.000
 things to this mini chest and other than that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.019
 can see how they see this they look like 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.059
 a chest for normal chests 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.559
 offensive there and he's going to say but like 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.440
 example if here they give accounts are 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.289
 chests like that camouflaged here as 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.820
 for example they can open them and for 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.559
 back will look like the normal block 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.449
 such as obsidian racks 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.679
 ton you can camouflage it from any 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.690
 block also up that can with 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.910
 campus just like what you see it 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.399
 It goes down like the campus is not so 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.220
 so square so that you can 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.729
 see how they see a space 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.780
 little limited are 6 are again 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.429
 space are 3 x 3 are 9 and so what 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.090
 you can reflect it as 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.759
 example 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.590
 blejer of any type of block then 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.810
 what we should do is first go to 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.380
 have to change your block obviously 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.189
 that this character is already in this way with 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.350
 with wood around and a crystal and it 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.149
 would create this this little block and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.939
 they could make another block that would be 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.270
 putting this in your inventory and you 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.490
 would come out this and then putting this in his 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.259
 inventory would come this this gives you 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.179
 eight there with the eight you will be able to 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.610
 do another of these and another of these and 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.349
 what are they for, these are not the first 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.579
 the normal that they are going to give you is going to serve 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:00.929
 why then can you open your 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.130
 small chest on this side as you see it 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.569
 will open up here and if they put it in their 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.489
 kraft table eo in your inventory 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.410
 normal then it will open on this side 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.629
 As you can see, it opens up here and remains 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.150
 quite well as well as that is how to 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.549
 to open both of them so they can put 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.379
 a system for both of you to give 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.400
 then the same and just have to occupy 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.730
 a lever here for example 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.760
 well i am this would open it here ok 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.579
 this little thing must be here here and here 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.080
 and I think you can not mother 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:38.640
 ok to see I think it's like that like that 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.050
 and so you could already the two blocks 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.480
 close the requirements to make it look 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.569
 wine and the third putting this then you 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.459
 is going to give this that would open up towards 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.080
 two sides as you see so it would open up is 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.190
 pretty cool that way the two guys would be 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.540
 of blocks and here they would have the like 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.550
 that the proof that in which is but 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.400
 I do not know why he says these were already good 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.160
 milestones blocks here and now you can then 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.270
 put a skin with it with the item that 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.060
 want like for example if I want 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.590
 put on this by grabbing a block 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.090
 of tony racks they put it where it says 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.060
 corners and it would look like you arrive in the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.010
 currency exchange the ski like that counted on 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.940
 all these like clay quartz's 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.670
 stone in gold emeralds 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.120
 cactus of this ours as it is called of 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.280
 pal bullet from him like that from the hay 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.569
 obsidian sponge of all those who 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.950
 you want up to crystal like 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.560
 see like that you would see the crystal you see 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.720
 quite well it looks very very very well and 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.970
 it is even transferred is quite 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.340
 great can also hide their 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.740
 this leave something to bear your blocks 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.650
 milestones like 6 I say can be hidden like 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.540
 for example you do not want anyone 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.400
 find him, tell him they are in a 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.290
 server multiplayer or are with 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.760
 mates feel his miniseries and 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.560
 you have a lot of apples and 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.230
 do not want to be stolen or with 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.030
 they expose this they put the ski to him already already 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.010
 I would see and you can cover it up 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.090
 for example and nobody will know where 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.400
 they have their chest you will only come 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.440
 they will remove this with their beak and you 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.850
 they would open and they could already have a 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.709
 block here can not be opened as you see 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.470
 it can not be opened so, well, well, 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.049
 so and so would not be there so 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.320
 could open can be camouflaged not not 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.990
 note that it is a chest or a chest 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.860
 fake is pretty good this one are already 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.110
 load your you're lonjita and it would be like this and 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.120
 now how things look like that would be the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.040
 example of how they would be seeing there 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.210
 how do they see the books and positions that 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.490
 shine are not those who are delighted 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.140
 they will be shining so it would look 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.820
 that way it would look like this would see the first 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.760
 space you only see one the second 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.290
 If they have more than one block, they cited it 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.700
 they will see more like here I have seem 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.140
 this third test events but they are 16 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.780
 like it's backwards you see there the 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.150
 they have and from the third block they cited they have 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.970
 three three observers or three items 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.580
 but in reality they are all 64 but I know 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.800
 how that divides them into three parts and 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.390
 you are and the last thing that was going to 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.930
 to say about this is that they can do 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.450
 these types of blocks as per 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.800
 example for you to put or be save 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.660
 your things separate programs that are 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.910
 giving light in your room without having to 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.530
 be putting torches at least 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.050
 you put as for example this 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.870
 block cited and from genaro at night and as 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.060
 come so light you take away this is not going to 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.440
 give light to that there he was seeing that no 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.210
 is happy that the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.860
 they remove as for example the are 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.170
 removing here and you only come the 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.060
 they put and now you will see how I am going to 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.830
 do you put it here as you see it 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.890
 it shines for nothing but you give it a 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.930
 Right click on this little thing or you're stuck going 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.020
 to jump the light 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.850
 ok giving a click ok there already got this 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.740
 this is how I am in creative so it comes out 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.570
 but you will not get this 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.030
 you will be and they will give you the 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.070
 helping a book click and it will be 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.340
 leaving the box and as you see is 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.169
 pretty simple to give you health and this 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.139
 would be the mold is pretty cool that 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.990
 You can modify your chest to taste 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.539
 that you want to put it in crystals or 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.060
 any material yeah yeah I want to put 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.860
 as for example of a mushroom also 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.169
 you can but it's pretty weird because 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.300
 see you see this 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.419
 they do not want do not want this really like 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.419
 what 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.740
 Favourite 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.350
 God 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.190
 Y 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.190
 i
