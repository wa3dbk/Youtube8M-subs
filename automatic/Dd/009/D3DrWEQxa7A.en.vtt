00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.310 
so we're here in well we int arena arena

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.220 
so we're here in well we int arena arena
we're<00:00:05.310> showing<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.879> piece<00:00:06.330> called<00:00:06.359> sound<00:00:06.930> life

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
we're showing a piece called sound life

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.140 
we're showing a piece called sound life
which<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.620> um<00:00:08.330> I<00:00:09.590> shoulda<00:00:10.590> known<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.639> an<00:00:11.969> old

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
which is um I shoulda known and an old

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.020 
which is um I shoulda known and an old
fashioned<00:00:12.570> woodworking<00:00:13.170> machine<00:00:13.500> for

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
fashioned woodworking machine for

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.120 
fashioned woodworking machine for
converting<00:00:15.030> sound<00:00:15.570> into<00:00:16.170> converting<00:00:16.680> sound

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
converting sound into converting sound

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:49.940 
converting sound into converting sound
converting<00:00:17.699> word<00:00:17.910> into<00:00:18.240> sound<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.690> think

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.320 

it's<00:00:50.950> one<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.250> long<00:00:51.370> chain<00:00:51.400> of<00:00:51.640> other<00:00:51.880> wood

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
it's one of the long chain of other wood

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.300 
it's one of the long chain of other wood
projects<00:00:52.750> isn't<00:00:52.990> it<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.710> we<00:00:53.860> were<00:00:54.010> working

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
projects isn't it that we were working

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.090 
projects isn't it that we were working
on<00:00:54.580> we<00:00:54.700> were<00:00:54.820> not<00:00:54.970> making<00:00:55.150> lots<00:00:55.450> of<00:00:56.100> electronic

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
on we were not making lots of electronic

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.970 
on we were not making lots of electronic
instruments<00:00:57.550> from<00:00:57.670> wood<00:00:58.530> which<00:00:59.530> we<00:00:59.710> sort<00:00:59.920> of

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
instruments from wood which we sort of

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.440 
instruments from wood which we sort of
carve<00:01:00.250> out<00:01:00.430> and<00:01:00.610> shape<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.059> we<00:01:01.120> put<00:01:01.300> our<00:01:01.420> own

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
carve out and shape and we put our own

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.420 
carve out and shape and we put our own
electronics<00:01:02.110> inside<00:01:02.470> and<00:01:02.860> sort<00:01:03.040> of<00:01:03.070> used<00:01:03.280> them

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
electronics inside and sort of used them

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.240 
electronics inside and sort of used them
in<00:01:03.489> performances<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:05.500> make<00:01:05.680> well<00:01:06.010> we<00:01:06.100> did

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
in performances and we make well we did

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.469 
in performances and we make well we did
have<00:01:06.400> some<00:01:06.430> quite<00:01:06.760> portable<00:01:07.000> ones<00:01:07.300> like<00:01:07.450> a

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
have some quite portable ones like a

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.240 
have some quite portable ones like a
laptop<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.200> then<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.530> ilok<00:01:08.890> which<00:01:09.100> is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
laptop and then the ilok which is

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.340 
laptop and then the ilok which is
handheld<00:01:09.550> and<00:01:09.880> for<00:01:10.420> some<00:01:10.600> reason<00:01:10.840> we<00:01:11.229> decided

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
handheld and for some reason we decided

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.859 
handheld and for some reason we decided
to<00:01:11.770> make<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.920> really<00:01:12.330> unpractical<00:01:13.330> giant

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
to make a really unpractical giant

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.870 
to make a really unpractical giant
instrument<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.590> was<00:01:14.770> really<00:01:15.010> hard<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.310> use

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
instrument that was really hard to use

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.940 
instrument that was really hard to use
and<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.990> make<00:01:17.140> music<00:01:17.229> would<00:01:17.619> you<00:01:17.650> have<00:01:17.830> to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
and to make music would you have to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.780 
and to make music would you have to
pedal<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.280> lot

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.760 

we've<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.909> logistic<00:01:28.390> battles<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.290> happened<00:01:29.680> he

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
we've a logistic battles and happened he

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.850 
we've a logistic battles and happened he
had<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.130> really<00:01:30.340> work<00:01:30.460> this<00:01:30.970> machine<00:01:31.180> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
had to really work this machine to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.850 
had to really work this machine to
generate<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.189> energy<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.670> turn<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.030> wood<00:01:34.210> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
generate the energy to turn the wood and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.460 
generate the energy to turn the wood and
Tulu<00:01:35.860> kind<00:01:36.100> of<00:01:36.189> translated<00:01:36.729> that<00:01:36.850> into<00:01:37.470> having

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
Tulu kind of translated that into having

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:59.300 
Tulu kind of translated that into having
the<00:01:38.560> energy<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.270> drown<00:01:40.270> joy<00:01:40.780> music

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.910 

they<00:02:00.310> tried<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.610> cut<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.360> music<00:02:01.540> by<00:02:02.320> creating

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
they tried to cut the music by creating

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.180 
they tried to cut the music by creating
the<00:02:03.070> shape<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:03.550> also<00:02:03.700> also<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.840> rhythm<00:02:05.190> the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
the shape but also also the rhythm the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.980 
the shape but also also the rhythm the
rhythms<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.820> sounds<00:02:07.270> which<00:02:07.510> are<00:02:07.600> generated

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
rhythms and sounds which are generated

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.529 
rhythms and sounds which are generated
start<00:02:08.649> affecting<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.340> way<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:09.819> car<00:02:10.149> so

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
start affecting the way that you car so

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.300 
start affecting the way that you car so
in<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.750> way<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.740> weird<00:02:11.980> feedback

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
in that way is this is a weird feedback

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.830 
in that way is this is a weird feedback
we've<00:02:12.730> even<00:02:12.880> though<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.180> not<00:02:13.270> necessarily

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
we've even though it's not necessarily

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.750 
we've even though it's not necessarily
electronic<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.530> more<00:02:14.709> like<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.430> do<00:02:15.580> with

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
electronic it's more like to do with

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:27.900 
electronic it's more like to do with
your<00:02:15.910> creativity<00:02:16.570> as<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.170> would<00:02:17.590> work

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.540 

I<00:02:27.970> used<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.870> work<00:02:28.990> with<00:02:29.170> yeah<00:02:29.740> me<00:02:29.950> too<00:02:29.980> yeah

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
I used to work with yeah me too yeah

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.270 
I used to work with yeah me too yeah
before<00:02:31.390> yeah<00:02:31.960> but<00:02:32.440> not<00:02:32.560> formally<00:02:33.070> know<00:02:35.280> you

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
before yeah but not formally know you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.790 
before yeah but not formally know you
made<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.460> very<00:02:36.550> nice<00:02:36.790> kitchen<00:02:37.030> yeah<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.530> kind

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
made a very nice kitchen yeah that kind

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.700 
made a very nice kitchen yeah that kind
of<00:02:39.720> sculpture<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.840> college<00:02:41.200> like<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.560> would

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
of sculpture of a college like it would

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:51.130 
of sculpture of a college like it would
call<00:02:41.950> me

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.940 

compete

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.580 

and<00:02:55.300> I<00:02:56.300> think<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.600> loses<00:02:56.930> quite<00:02:57.140> some<00:02:57.350> quite

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
and I think it loses quite some quite

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.560 
and I think it loses quite some quite
intrinsic<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.310> project<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.910> turns<00:02:59.360> it

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
intrinsic to the project it turns it

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.100 
intrinsic to the project it turns it
into<00:02:59.810> a<00:03:00.410> situation<00:03:01.400> listening<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.450> CD<00:03:02.660> kind

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
into a situation listening to a CD kind

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.490 
into a situation listening to a CD kind
of<00:03:04.120> experience<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.390> think<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.870> need<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.170> see

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
of experience I think you need to see

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.050 
of experience I think you need to see
the<00:03:06.680> wood<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:06.980> need<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.250> smell<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.610> word<00:03:07.910> you

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
the wood you need to smell the word you

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.090 
the wood you need to smell the word you
to<00:03:08.240> see<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.950> shavings<00:03:10.490> flying<00:03:10.820> around
