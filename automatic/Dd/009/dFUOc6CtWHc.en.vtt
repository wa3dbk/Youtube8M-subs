checking them out and they've been

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.060 
checking them out and they've been
really<00:00:26.220> good<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.460> far<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:28.740> highest

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
really good so far and the highest

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.250 
really good so far and the highest
commented<00:00:29.640> thing<00:00:29.849> for<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> longest<00:00:30.570> time<00:00:30.689> was

commented thing for the longest time was

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.100 
commented thing for the longest time was
for<00:00:31.500> me<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.070> build<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> pixel<00:00:32.730> art<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
for me to build a pixel art of the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.780 
for me to build a pixel art of the
garden<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.469> harmony<00:00:34.890> now<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> do

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
garden of harmony now was going to do

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.119 
garden of harmony now was going to do
that<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.149> then<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.750> checked<00:00:37.020> yesterday<00:00:37.380> which

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that and then I checked yesterday which

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.700 
that and then I checked yesterday which
I<00:00:38.460> guess<00:00:38.730> would<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:38.969> Thursday<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.530> day<00:00:40.680> before

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
I guess would be Thursday the day before

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.270 
I guess would be Thursday the day before
and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:42.149> see<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.899> request<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.860> figure<00:00:44.250> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
and I see that request so I figure I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.920 
and I see that request so I figure I
might<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.640> well<00:00:44.940> throw<00:00:45.360> something<00:00:45.780> together

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
might as well throw something together

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.810 
might as well throw something together
and<00:00:46.350> tada<00:00:47.030> this<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.180> probably<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.690> worst

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
and tada this is probably the worst

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.810 
and tada this is probably the worst
railway<00:00:50.820> system<00:00:51.570> thing<00:00:52.170> I've<00:00:52.440> ever<00:00:52.500> built<00:00:53.160> but

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
railway system thing I've ever built but

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
railway system thing I've ever built but
it<00:00:54.090> does<00:00:54.329> exactly<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.050> says<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.350> box

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it does exactly what it says on the box

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
it does exactly what it says on the box
and<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.340> course<00:00:56.370> now<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.760> getting<00:00:57.030> night

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and of course now it's getting night

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240 
and of course now it's getting night
time<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.690> I'm<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> bed<00:00:58.320> now<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
time so I'm going to get a bed now it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.529 
time so I'm going to get a bed now it
should<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.550> clear<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.180> more<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
should be clear this is more of a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.389 
should be clear this is more of a
concept<00:01:00.989> than<00:01:01.199> anything<00:01:01.590> else<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.100> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
concept than anything else this is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
concept than anything else this is
definitely<00:01:03.059> not<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.570> finished<00:01:03.989> product<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.710> be

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
definitely not a finished product to be

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
definitely not a finished product to be
honest<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.309> don't<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> time<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.450> do

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
honest I just don't have the time to do

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
honest I just don't have the time to do
one<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.290> now<00:01:07.549> but<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
one right now but you can see how this

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
one right now but you can see how this
works<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> think<00:01:10.530> at<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.010> point<00:01:11.130> if

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
works but I think at this point if

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.070 
works but I think at this point if
you're<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> add<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> PEZ<00:01:12.510> dispenser<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you're going to add a PEZ dispenser you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.420 
you're going to add a PEZ dispenser you
might<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.530> well<00:01:13.710> make<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> fully-fledged

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
might as well make a fully-fledged

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.399 
might as well make a fully-fledged
station<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.299> I'm<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> link<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
dispenser and refills that spot now it's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
dispenser and refills that spot now it's
the<00:01:50.640> same<00:01:50.850> way<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> other<00:01:51.119> side<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.899> all

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the same way the other side and it's all

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.850 
the same way the other side and it's all
coming<00:01:52.920> off<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.220> same<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.680> there

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
coming off the same you can see there

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.440 
coming off the same you can see there
it's<00:01:56.009> all<00:01:56.130> coming<00:01:56.430> off<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.670> same<00:01:56.880> dispensers

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it's all coming off the same dispensers

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.450 
it's all coming off the same dispensers
so<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:57.960> dispenser<00:01:58.530> feeds<00:01:58.890> both<00:01:59.130> sides

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
so that one dispenser feeds both sides

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.819 
so that one dispenser feeds both sides
now<00:01:59.729> these<00:02:00.299> carts<00:02:00.719> are<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> slowly<00:02:01.530> go

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
now these carts are going to slowly go

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.410 
now these carts are going to slowly go
around<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> track<00:02:02.520> because<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.909> still<00:02:03.210> have

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
around the track because I still have

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.190 
around the track because I still have
all<00:02:03.570> these<00:02:03.719> other<00:02:04.850> carts<00:02:05.850> not<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:07.049> these

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
all these other carts not all these

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
all these other carts not all these
other<00:02:07.380> stations<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.220> when<00:02:08.940> they<00:02:09.090> get<00:02:09.270> back

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
other stations and when they get back

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.639 
other stations and when they get back
you're<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:10.020> what<00:02:10.050> happens<00:02:10.200> so

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
you're going to see what happens so

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.229 
you're going to see what happens so
let's<00:02:10.860> say<00:02:10.979> somebody<00:02:11.280> approaches<00:02:12.030> this

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
let's say somebody approaches this

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.210 
let's say somebody approaches this
station

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
station

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.660 
station
because<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.430> has<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.580> minecart<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:15.670> because

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
because it has a minecart in it because

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.100 
because it has a minecart in it because
there's<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.090> car<00:02:17.270> already<00:02:17.540> there<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.870> grabs

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
there's a car already there it grabs

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.760 
there's a car already there it grabs
that<00:02:18.320> car<00:02:18.620> puts<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.460> pass<00:02:20.500> for<00:02:21.500> later

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
that car puts it in the pass for later

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.800 
that car puts it in the pass for later
use<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.550> can<00:02:22.580> see<00:02:22.910> both<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.180> them<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
use and you can see both of them do the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.510 
use and you can see both of them do the
same<00:02:24.020> thing<00:02:24.320> if<00:02:24.500> this<00:02:24.680> one<00:02:24.860> ever<00:02:25.010> makes<00:02:25.250> it

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
same thing if this one ever makes it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.070 
same thing if this one ever makes it
here<00:02:26.210> it<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.480> see<00:02:29.720> there's<00:02:30.020> a

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
here it is and you can see there's a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.940 
here it is and you can see there's a
detector<00:02:30.560> rail<00:02:31.120> goes<00:02:32.120> over<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.950> this

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
detector rail goes over that this

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.300 
detector rail goes over that this
detector<00:02:34.490> rail<00:02:34.700> here<00:02:35.120> turns<00:02:35.990> this<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.160> is

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
detector rail here turns this on this is

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.660 
detector rail here turns this on this is
the<00:02:37.460> same<00:02:37.670> detector<00:02:38.300> rail<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.380> before<00:02:39.770> but<00:02:40.430> now

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
the same detector rail as before but now

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.800 
the same detector rail as before but now
this<00:02:41.120> one<00:02:41.330> also<00:02:41.630> sends<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.620> signal<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:43.810> this

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
this one also sends a signal to this

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.470 
this one also sends a signal to this
piece<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.770> rail<00:02:45.980> here<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.970> switches<00:02:47.180> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
piece of rail here and it switches the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.970 
piece of rail here and it switches the
direction<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.080> we'll<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.290> press<00:02:48.830> these

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
direction so we'll just press these

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.490 
direction so we'll just press these
buttons<00:02:49.040> again<00:02:49.900> just<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.959> send<00:02:51.200> them<00:02:51.350> on<00:02:51.470> their

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
buttons again just to send them on their

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.580 
buttons again just to send them on their
way<00:02:51.970> get<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> card<00:02:53.270> there<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:54.050> can<00:02:54.260> see<00:02:54.290> this

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
way get a card there you can see this

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.770 
way get a card there you can see this
one<00:02:54.830> changes<00:02:55.310> as<00:02:55.459> well<00:02:55.610> whenever<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:56.120> send<00:02:56.690> a

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
one changes as well whenever I send a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.949 
one changes as well whenever I send a
card<00:02:57.050> away<00:02:57.350> on<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.800> one<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:59.120> changes<00:02:59.600> whoops

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
card away on this one it changes whoops

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.220 
card away on this one it changes whoops
it<00:03:00.380> changes<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.130> track<00:03:01.790> here<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.959> sends

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
it changes this track here so it sends

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.970 
it changes this track here so it sends
the<00:03:03.350> car<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.250> correct<00:03:04.580> spot<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:08.950> when<00:03:09.950> I

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
the car to the correct spot and when I

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.550 
the car to the correct spot and when I
send<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.580> their<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.880> doesn't<00:03:11.240> say<00:03:12.230> that's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
send it to their it doesn't say that's

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.699 
send it to their it doesn't say that's
pretty<00:03:12.920> much<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.580> construction<00:03:14.480> it's<00:03:15.260> not

to do with the adventure map stuff so

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.890 
to do with the adventure map stuff so
keep<00:03:43.100> an<00:03:43.250> eye<00:03:43.370> out<00:03:43.400> for<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.760> one<00:03:44.090> it's<00:03:44.840> a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
keep an eye out for that one it's a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.580 
keep an eye out for that one it's a
speed<00:03:45.170> build<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.680> when<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:45.980> built<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.430> one<00:03:46.640> and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
speed build of when I built this one and
