 we won't get even better on this occasion 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.749
 by the way recently got quite a few years after 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:55.739
 worry about it that teachers 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.749

 choice to face 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.550
 Why in Voskresensk 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.120
 such data does not happen shops from 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.120
 them children 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.090
 I wrote 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.370
 since 1980 g rarely vice premierâ€™s 15 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.270

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.820
 as reported 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.270
 but also sorrow inclinations 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 children that's what 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.240
 I think that only 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.870
 recession 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.230

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.800

 but not related to vitamins 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.889
 and so 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.389
