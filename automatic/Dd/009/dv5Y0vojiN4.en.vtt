00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.989
 i 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.280
 this we must teach them from a house of 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.110
 beach a beach house very close to lima 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.580
 where he studied green dica 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:25.510
 has made a house concept very 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.300
 very small town to use it all year round and 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.400
 We dedicate to talk to the architect 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.440
 Now you are 3 where he will explain us 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.440
 contracts the project let's see it 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.140
 brutal 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.680
 i 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 ah 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.520
 to work many textures there is no separate 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.220
 that they themselves 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.440
 other clear concepts for example if 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.630
 you see many of the lights in the house as 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.350
 that there or some are the brick and 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.660
 degrees 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.910
 abroad that is already used for 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.120
 lamp does not prevent is a luminaire between 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.330
 food of the dam is not 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.330
 the same 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
 ordinary 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.460
 the theme of wood is also a thing 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.790
 that the andÃ©s who have treated him then in 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.280
 its natural shape and with little finish with 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.990
 the half open pore low not that not 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.390
 so you can always breathe the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.150
 strange way live and technology apart 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.440
 of that you have this that a little bit 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.080
 close to area d 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.530
 the garage service and how it 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.830
 enclose this face at the beginning to a 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.300
 area a little more public every time in 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.120
 the part as the service says that 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.890
 is placed in such a way that when not 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.800
 are the fates will consist or those of children 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.800
 and everything and never seems that a second 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.180
 Y 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.860
 ah 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.300

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.460
 a window in English version if you want 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.700
 but I expected something has but in fact 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.850
 It is a super comfortable and pleasant place 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.920
 management of the galley to stay for 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.810

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.880
 Summer and winter, as the 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.470
 friday hours hottest super and this 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.320
