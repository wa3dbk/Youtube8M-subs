00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hiding this side of the screens is the droid 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.750
 rus events called anb 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.849
 Act 2015 by samsung were here 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.490
 as many as two flagship galaxy 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.410
 s6 about which we have another video and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.269
 galaxy s6 edge 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.300
 here it is in my hands let's see 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.460
 what is interesting in it the first thing you want 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
 say practically nothing stuffing this 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.220
 smartphone is no different this is analog 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.500
 galaxy s6 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.480
 but very different design 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.189
 the main feature is of course curved 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.260
 the screen is immediately conspicuous 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.369
 the truth is not completely curved like 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.829
 for example on laptop with 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.600
 but the bend comes to about here is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.760
 It looks spectacular and at the same time when you 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.140
 hold it in your hands it does not interfere well 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 Of course you need a little longer to use 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.370
 by this back what to understand how convenient 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.500
 Here are these facets but for the first feelings myself 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.180
 the device is in the hand is very nice here 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.160
 these sharp edges should not crash into 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 arm it seems even thinner the subject is on 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.500
 really 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 separately I want to say something when 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.640
 you start to look at different 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.160
 the details of this device you see what they 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.469
 all very well designed as well 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.180
 this happens with the apple technique all these 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.729
 facets all these edges here 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.700
 They are exactly neat and except 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.130
 that here only metal and glass and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.110
 no plastic absolutely no 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.939
 Plastic I do not see where there is no plastic 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.189
 plastic but there is plastic 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.409
 small cap for infrared 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.570
 port, he is also there who is concerned 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.880
 buttons they are located on traditional 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.229
 places under the thumb button falls 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.540
 power on the right 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.920
 volume control is also convenient for 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.079
 just reach out in front of us 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.210
 the main home button where without it 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.310
 is located behind the sensor for reading 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.720
 pulse and the camera itself is 16 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.549
 megapixels design of this device 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.939
 really all right and want 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.220
 even 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.100
 they have but the problem is that very 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.090
 difficult to come up with an application for these 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 rounded edges several attempts 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.750
 korean company i did about them 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.820
 I'll tell about you already judge how they 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.040
 useful 1 through these faces can be obtained 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.140
 quick access to such contacts 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.610
 way you can pull some 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 contacts that you will be saved and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.140
 immediately call them second when you 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.020
 turn off the screen and iron it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.659
 way this line of arises here so 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.759
 here is a summary of the day with the latest alerts 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.720
 calendar with the weather and such 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.850
 can they 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 when the phone is on the table is cancer are you 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.000
 can use 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.370
 the third chip when you have a phone 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.410
 upside down he can highlight his 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.780
 it looks impressive but except 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.790
 In addition, it is also useful when you call 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.770
 different contacts you can assign to 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.240
 they are different colors and you will immediately 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.550
 understand who is calling you for example when 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.650
 you are sitting in a meeting the boss is calling you 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.590
 or wife calls you will light up 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.690
 different colors and can be using 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.860
 applying on this sensor 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.690
 send a message I can not take 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.000
 the tube here is such a thing else 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.860
 firmware looks the same as on galaxy 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.390
 s6 salt worth everything works smartly 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.010
 a little bit unusual when you look at 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.780
 these cranes it so bends a little bit 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.160
 but it seems to me it is not even fun 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.690
 know what their kerens will be when 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.520
 watching a movie and or playing games 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.530
 Of course everything needs to be tried, but for example 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.100
 But on such things it looks very 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.050
 spectacularly 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.600
 especially this black color on amoled 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.300
 the screen and the last difference galaxy s6 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.920
 edge from his fellow it will be him 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.500
 wife she will be different in big 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.880
 side by about a third or so 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.100
 most likely there was a high price 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.020
 due to the fact that this phone is more complicated 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.850
 produce and produce it in smaller 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.530
 quantities and demand for it all the same 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.970
 will be slightly lower than the main 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.130
 I'm not sure what model costs 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.410
 overpay for these curved edges 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.360
 this is already an amateur but they themselves were 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.450
 Valery seams Boris Vedeno with exhibition
