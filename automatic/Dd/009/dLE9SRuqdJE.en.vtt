it looks like it's been rewritten and
everything<00:01:34.039> but<00:01:34.189> I<00:01:34.459> feel<00:01:34.700> like<00:01:34.789> all<00:01:34.939> the

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
everything but I feel like all the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.029 
everything but I feel like all the
morals<00:01:35.389> and<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:35.600> same<00:01:35.899> topics<00:01:36.740> are<00:01:36.859> still

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
morals and the same topics are still

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.919 
morals and the same topics are still
there<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:37.219> I<00:01:37.670> think<00:01:38.149> no<00:01:38.240> matter<00:01:38.359> what<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.810> can

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
there so I think no matter what you can

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.060 
there so I think no matter what you can
rewrite<00:01:39.139> as<00:01:39.200> much

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
rewrite as much

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.620 
rewrite as much
I<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.310> that's<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.550> magic<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.510> whole

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
I think that's like magic of the whole

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.470 
I think that's like magic of the whole
thing<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:43.020> crazy<00:01:44.030> if<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.150> look<00:01:45.300> at<00:01:45.390> our
