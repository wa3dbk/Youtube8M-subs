guess<00:04:26.780> not<00:04:27.080> really<00:04:27.140> true<00:04:27.800> but<00:04:28.040> you<00:04:28.220> know<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.550> a

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
guess not really true but you know is a

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.310 
guess not really true but you know is a
better<00:04:28.970> scenario<00:04:29.210> alright<00:04:29.840> let's<00:04:29.990> break<00:04:30.110> into

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
better scenario alright let's break into

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.320 
better scenario alright let's break into
one<00:04:30.350> more<00:04:30.680> level<00:04:30.860> out<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.370> energy<00:04:31.520> let's<00:04:31.970> do<00:04:32.150> no

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
one more level out of energy let's do no

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.000 
one more level out of energy let's do no
more<00:04:32.570> levels<00:04:32.960> great<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.590> guess<00:04:33.740> that's<00:04:33.950> the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
more levels great I guess that's the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.440 
more levels great I guess that's the
best<00:04:34.190> place<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.490> end<00:04:34.760> this<00:04:34.850> video<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.270> any

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
best place to end this video is any

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.490 
best place to end this video is any
because<00:04:35.660> that's<00:04:35.810> where<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.080> game<00:04:36.260> doesn't

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
because that's where the game doesn't

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.320 
because that's where the game doesn't
want<00:04:36.770> me<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.980> play<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.370> anymore<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.090> game

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
want me to play it anymore so this game

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.310 
want me to play it anymore so this game
that<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:38.600> assume<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:39.050> going<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.260> be

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
that I assume is going to be

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.750 
that I assume is going to be
free-to-play<00:04:39.530> then<00:04:39.950> because<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.370> first<00:04:40.580> dude

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
free-to-play then because the first dude

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.700 
free-to-play then because the first dude
perfect<00:04:41.000> was<00:04:41.270> like<00:04:41.420> $0.99<00:04:42.080> this<00:04:42.230> one<00:04:42.440> has<00:04:42.680> a

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
perfect was like $0.99 this one has a

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.680 
perfect was like $0.99 this one has a
little<00:04:43.340> bit<00:04:43.490> more<00:04:43.550> free-to-play<00:04:44.150> down<00:04:44.390> so<00:04:44.660> I

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
little bit more free-to-play down so I

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.480 
little bit more free-to-play down so I
mean<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.020> don't<00:04:45.230> know<00:04:45.410> more<00:04:45.620> knowing<00:04:45.980> I<00:04:46.250> guess

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
mean I don't know more knowing I guess

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.950 
mean I don't know more knowing I guess
but<00:04:46.730> I<00:04:46.760> assume<00:04:47.000> this<00:04:47.180> game<00:04:47.390> will<00:04:47.510> be<00:04:47.600> out<00:04:47.630> soon

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
but I assume this game will be out soon

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.210 
but I assume this game will be out soon
