but very short as are a lot of the

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.580 
but very short as are a lot of the
events<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:18.100> getting<00:01:18.460> quick<00:01:18.820> bursts<00:01:19.440> so<00:01:20.440> I<00:01:20.470> can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
events but getting quick bursts so I can

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.560 
events but getting quick bursts so I can
have<00:01:20.680> another<00:01:20.920> look<00:01:21.220> at<00:01:21.460> some<00:01:21.729> more<00:01:22.090> events

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
now let's select a different event you

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.960 
now let's select a different event you
know<00:01:27.670> what<00:01:27.850> can<00:01:28.000> we<00:01:28.090> be<00:01:28.270> equally<00:01:28.660> bad<00:01:28.900> at

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970

marathon<00:01:33.970> night<00:01:34.270> I<00:01:34.479> don't<00:01:34.690> think<00:01:34.720> maybe<00:01:34.960> that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
marathon night I don't think maybe that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.270 
marathon night I don't think maybe that

so when a good rhythm a moment in a
feeling<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.170> family<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.100> have<00:02:41.900> from<00:02:42.900> AJ<00:02:46.820> paper

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
feeling a family if I have from AJ paper

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:56.250 
feeling a family if I have from AJ paper
out<00:02:48.960> there

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.340

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.780 

ready

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.210 

look<00:03:08.790> at<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.530> I've<00:03:10.620> actually<00:03:10.710> found<00:03:11.040> a

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
look at that so I've actually found a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.940 
look at that so I've actually found a
game<00:03:11.460> that<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.700> could<00:03:11.880> say<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.570> every<00:03:12.930> May<00:03:13.080> so

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
game that I could say is every May so

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.630 
game that I could say is every May so
that<00:03:14.070> was<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> year<00:03:14.460> 20<00:03:14.790> kilometres<00:03:15.180> auch<00:03:16.640> and

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that was the year 20 kilometres auch and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:29.800 
that was the year 20 kilometres auch and
then<00:03:18.320> we<00:03:19.320> go<00:03:19.470> attempt<00:03:20.010> another<00:03:20.130> event<00:03:20.670> now

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.040 

okay<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:30.870> we're<00:03:31.110> going<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.260> try<00:03:31.500> some

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
okay so we're going to try some

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.350 
okay so we're going to try some
synchronize<00:03:34.050> driving<00:03:35.010> now<00:03:35.880> all<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.180> got<00:03:36.330> to

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
synchronize driving now all you got to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.110 
synchronize driving now all you got to
do<00:03:36.510> basically<00:03:36.990> is<00:03:37.110> get<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.410> timing<00:03:37.650> right<00:03:38.120> and

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
do basically is get the timing right and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.260 
do basically is get the timing right and
pressed<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.600> button<00:03:39.630> on<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.050> right<00:03:40.200> time

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
pressed a button on the right time

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.390
