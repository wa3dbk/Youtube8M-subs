00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
beer is inside the cake it does it by

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.609 
beer is inside the cake it does it by
temperature<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.180> pretty<00:01:30.299> cool<00:01:30.619> like

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
temperature so it's pretty cool like

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.859 
temperature so it's pretty cool like
seven<00:01:31.950> using<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> little<00:01:32.579> while<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.270> got

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
seven using for a little while it's got

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.120 
seven using for a little while it's got
little<00:01:34.049> instructions<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> back<00:01:34.920> here

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
little instructions on the back here

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.679 
little instructions on the back here
think<00:01:35.340> they're<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> buck<00:01:35.909> apiece<00:01:35.939> right

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
think they're like a buck apiece right

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.780 
think they're like a buck apiece right
out<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.290> much<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.490> basically

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
out of but not much you just basically

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.929 
out of but not much you just basically
stick<00:01:39.390> them<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> side<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> keg<00:01:40.290> and

stick them on the side of the keg and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.950 
stick them on the side of the keg and

hundred degrees water spray on white and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.830

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
bottom from 15 down to thirty degrees so

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.870 
bottom from 15 down to thirty degrees so
and<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> also<00:02:04.049> has<00:02:04.320> Celsius<00:02:04.710> ten<00:02:05.040> degree<00:02:05.310> 10

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and it also has Celsius ten degree 10

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.350 
and it also has Celsius ten degree 10
Celsius<00:02:06.180> down<00:02:06.570> 2-1<00:02:07.500> Celsius<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.179> shows

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
Celsius down 2-1 Celsius and it shows

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.580 
Celsius down 2-1 Celsius and it shows
three<00:02:09.660> coral<00:02:10.080> 3/4<00:02:10.950> 3/4<00:02:11.790> half<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.510> quarter

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
three coral 3/4 3/4 half and a quarter

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.560 
three coral 3/4 3/4 half and a quarter
but<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.280> say<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.520> putting<00:02:15.270> these<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
but like I say you putting these on a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.090 
but like I say you putting these on a
corner<00:02:15.960> cake<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.320> just<00:02:16.500> put<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.800> all<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.040> way

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
corner cake I just put it all the way

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.980 
corner cake I just put it all the way
down<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.430> bottom<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:18.480> your<00:02:18.690> reading<00:02:18.930> is

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
down to the bottom so if your reading is

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.540 
down to the bottom so if your reading is
gonna<00:02:19.590> be<00:02:19.650> half<00:02:19.800> full<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.160> you'll<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.310> able<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
gonna be half full but you'll be able to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.640 
gonna be half full but you'll be able to
get<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> good<00:02:20.850> visual<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.200> I'll<00:02:22.410> put<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
get a good visual of it and I'll put the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.410 
get a good visual of it and I'll put the
camera<00:02:22.860> down<00:02:22.890> I've<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.820> kid<00:02:24.060> again<00:02:24.180> here

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
camera down I've have a kid again here

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.670 
camera down I've have a kid again here
that<00:02:24.450> actually<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.810> don't<00:02:24.870> have<00:02:25.290> one<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.590> these

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
that actually I don't have one of these

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
that actually I don't have one of these
on<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.890> other<00:02:26.130> one<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.400> do<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.850> there<00:02:27.360> should

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
on the other one I do and there should

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.030 
on the other one I do and there should
be<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.690> difference<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.290> how<00:02:28.350> much<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.680> left<00:02:28.830> on

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
be a difference and how much is left on

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.860 
be a difference and how much is left on
these<00:02:29.160> two<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.580> hopefully<00:02:30.510> I'll<00:02:30.570> be<00:02:30.600> able<00:02:30.750> to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
these two so hopefully I'll be able to

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.590 
these two so hopefully I'll be able to
show<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.080> how<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.220> thing<00:02:32.280> works<00:02:32.610> okay<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.390> got

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
show you how this thing works okay I got

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.060 
show you how this thing works okay I got
my<00:02:33.630> little<00:02:33.870> flashlight<00:02:34.350> set<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:34.920> so

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
my little flashlight set up in here so

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.000 
my little flashlight set up in here so
hopefully<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.550> see<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.650> it's<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:37.800> very

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
hopefully you can see this it's not very

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.510 
hopefully you can see this it's not very
good<00:02:38.190> lighting

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
good lighting

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.060 
good lighting
but<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.720> an<00:02:39.840> Oktoberfest<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:40.920> is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
but this is an Oktoberfest and this is

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.449 
but this is an Oktoberfest and this is
my<00:02:41.250> planning<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:43.590> one<00:02:43.740> should<00:02:43.920> be<00:02:43.950> more<00:02:44.220> full

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
my planning this one should be more full

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.900 
my planning this one should be more full
I'm<00:02:44.970> guessing<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.540> can<00:02:45.660> see<00:02:45.780> how<00:02:45.930> the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
I'm guessing but you can see how the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.090 
I'm guessing but you can see how the
strip<00:02:47.910> has<00:02:48.060> turned<00:02:48.270> red<00:02:48.360> pink<00:02:48.780> color<00:02:49.380> so

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
strip has turned red pink color so

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.380 
strip has turned red pink color so
basically<00:02:50.400> I'll<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.610> lay<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> towel<00:02:51.180> at<00:02:51.360> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
basically I'll just lay a towel at the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.120 
basically I'll just lay a towel at the
bottom<00:02:51.720> there<00:02:51.900> because<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.260> gonna<00:02:52.410> spray

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
bottom there because it's gonna spray

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.729 
bottom there because it's gonna spray
quite<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> bit<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.670> water<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.910> get<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.209> reset

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
quite a bit of water to get it to reset

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.600 
quite a bit of water to get it to reset
and<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.800> just<00:02:56.010> got<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.160> little<00:02:56.280> spray<00:02:56.580> bottle

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
and I just got a little spray bottle

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.850 
and I just got a little spray bottle
here<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.060> put<00:02:57.570> hot<00:02:57.959> tap<00:02:58.170> water<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.770> I'll

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
here I put hot tap water in and I'll

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.449 
here I put hot tap water in and I'll
start<00:02:59.130> spraying<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.850> pretty<00:03:00.270> hard

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.620 

get<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.550> going<00:03:05.790> you'll<00:03:06.060> see<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.330> starts

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
get it going you'll see it starts

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.020 
get it going you'll see it starts
changing<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.900> white<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:11.040> then<00:03:11.489> I'll<00:03:11.640> wipe<00:03:11.850> it

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
changing to white and then I'll wipe it

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.560 
changing to white and then I'll wipe it
down<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:13.459> I'd<00:03:14.459> do<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.790> very<00:03:15.000> good<00:03:15.060> job<00:03:15.239> but

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
down and I'd do a very good job but

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.930 
down and I'd do a very good job but
you'll<00:03:15.780> see<00:03:15.989> right<00:03:16.170> there<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:17.459> line<00:03:17.670> is

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
you'll see right there that line is

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.670 
you'll see right there that line is
works<00:03:18.180> changing<00:03:18.720> color<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.110> that's<00:03:19.320> how<00:03:19.530> much

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
works changing color so that's how much

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.550 
works changing color so that's how much
is<00:03:19.860> left<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.220> corner<00:03:20.610> keg<00:03:21.110> which<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.260> cool

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
is left in that corner keg which is cool

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.380 
is left in that corner keg which is cool
less<00:03:23.100> actually<00:03:23.549> less<00:03:23.700> than<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.000> thought<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.299> was

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
less actually less than I thought it was

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.140 
less actually less than I thought it was
cover<00:03:25.100> for<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.160> planning<00:03:26.519> but<00:03:26.670> we<00:03:26.760> did<00:03:26.940> hit

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
cover for the planning but we did hit

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.080 
cover for the planning but we did hit
pretty<00:03:27.510> hard<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:28.880> party<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.940> other<00:03:29.970> night

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090
