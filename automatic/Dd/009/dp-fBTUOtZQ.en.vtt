00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.610
 hi friends my name is mario arias i am 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.100
 your advisor photography with photography 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.610
 art I want to talk about toqui na 1116 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.980
 efe 28 this lens is an evolution of the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.560
 that already had the same manufacturer in fact 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.340
 as it says in the box or in the own 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.890
 target would be the ate x 116 pro version 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.539
 of x 2 this second version comes to 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.350
 obviously improve the first one that 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.080
 existed and above all they have added a 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.629
 series of lenses for some coatings 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.280
 - better those lenses that I was wearing 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.860
 incorporated the objective itself with the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.300
 theme of improving reflections in the case of 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.129
 nikon 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.480
 today for me with and for here not in the 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.829
 no pollutant case incorporates the motor 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.870
 of internal focus to make it 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.420
 compatible with all ranges with all 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.970
 the range of sensor type cameras to psc that 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.769
 has the unique manufacturer with which I 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.000
 there is no possibility of wanting some of 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.820
 focus by hand as it happened in that 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.829
 one version to each his and I believe 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.690
 playing if you have any specialty 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.509
 the market then it's about the 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.740
 Optical full ultra wide angle is a 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.420
 type of goal by own 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.159
 construction by the amount of degrees 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.310
 that opens you have to keep in mind that 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.310
 this end since it goes from 84 degrees to 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.660
 105 104 degrees to be exact is a 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.280
 really complicated objective to 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.630
 make and well well just like that 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.310
 rom has his specialties of the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.560
 Ultra zoom lenses also those of the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.509
 objectives the range I think there are also 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.860
 very good without bad our goals 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.110
 professionals I think it's the number 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.460
 one but maybe it's just like the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.470
 others have their specialty where 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.840
 it has really been highlighted where 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.920
 it's really worth the manufacturer 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.350
 Japanese is in ultra ultra ultra zoom 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.950
 angular to be an 11 16 then 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.240
 obviously you have to publish 1.5 with 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.030
 which we are 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.560
 of covering the focal distances more 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.470
 angular that we can get to need 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.030
 and then as a complement to the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.340
 the low towards the position where more 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.470
 they open the angles for those teams 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.689
 from a psc is a very very optics 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.159
 recommended another thing that calls 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.869
 good attention come you will see that 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.729
 comes with the parasol incorporated in the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.440
 front and rear covers is the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.760
 construction toki na is characterized by 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.709
 have one of the best constructions 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.870
 that there may be in the market is a 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.790
 objective that transmits solidity to 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.470
 highlight also a detail that to me by 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.450
 at least I like it a lot that it's like 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.180
 we went from manual focus to ansoc 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.500
 automatic by a traction ring I do not know 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.709
 backwards we would be the manual focus 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.790
 and forward autofocus 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.000
 it has a pretty focus module 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.680
 quick is to say that it is an evolution of 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.360
 The first version is then vd 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.850
 of an extraordinary goal the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.470
 diaphragm is a 2 with 8 to all the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.709
 seal in a more open position 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.830
 closing at 22 and incorporating 9 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.800
 diaphragm blades 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.470
 that is to say they are circular this blade is 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.520
 whereby the ship effect that the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.930
 it's true that it's pretty good in 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.490
 for optical data construction 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.150
 more technical because it is composed of 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.340
 thirteen lens lenses in eleven groups of 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.530
 which two of them are spherical and 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.290
 two others are of low dispersion type 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.850
 optical headquarters to correct all 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.830
 aberrations that we told you that good 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.090
 well, if they achieve angular we will attend 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.190
 always have some aberration about 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.140
 everything in the corners but of course they are 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.180
 very correctable or with some 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.400
 photoshop through the different 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.200
 options that these software have and in 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.090
 any case is little avoidable this 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.160
 type of such and good then of course 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.810
 within which the objectives that what 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.610
 we can compare I would say that they are 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.190
 Minimum easy to correct course 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.740
 minors than in their competition and to a 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.540
 lens diameter of 77 mm and 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.950
 Well, I insist on the construction of 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.840
 something metallic goal for me with or for 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.480
 canon and the truth is that whatever 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.860
 the version you have of the psc I think 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.050
 If I go looking for a wide angle the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.910
 angular to take more into account without a doubt 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.530
 some under one point of view if you want 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.300
 a goal of performance quality 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.950
 extraordinary optical good 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.610
 construction and that you have objectives 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.260
 for many 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.210
 lovers of architectural photography 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.650
 landscape photography 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.870
 I think you're in luck or this 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.970
 is a large lens below 600 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.010
 euros that another of the things that there is is 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.690
 very precious the myth of this crystal of 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.550
 this goal and then with all the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.230
 technical complications lotina has done 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.060
 a lens and an extraordinary job 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.640
 I hope you liked this little one 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.410
 approach to high quin 11 16 2 with 8 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.000
 and well you know with photography 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.769
 art we are here to help you and any 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.360
 doubt or consult that you want to do what 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.760
 that you want to come and try the product 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.380
 we will be happy to help you 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.380
 thank you and until next days
