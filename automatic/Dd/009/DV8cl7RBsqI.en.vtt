work the all must hold out it must be

independent of lean against anything and

independent of lean against anything and
it<00:04:31.380> must<00:04:31.680> not<00:04:32.040> be<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:34.470> can<00:04:34.680> very<00:04:35.430> important

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
it must not be you can very important

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.480 
it must not be you can very important

it's<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:38.729> difference<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.300> concentration

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
it's a difference of a concentration

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.670 
it's a difference of a concentration
here

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
here

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.990 
here
it's<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.460> force<00:04:42.830> compression<00:04:43.830> of<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.460> bicep

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
it's that force compression of the bicep

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.870 
it's that force compression of the bicep
that<00:04:45.620> gives<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.830> extra<00:04:47.040> peak

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
that gives you that extra peak

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.210 
that gives you that extra peak
now<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.300> people<00:04:48.840> vary<00:04:49.110> in<00:04:49.260> people<00:04:49.710> some

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
now the people vary in people some

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.800 
now the people vary in people some
people<00:04:50.250> they<00:04:50.580> scoop<00:04:50.820> all<00:04:51.000> night<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.449> gets<00:04:51.600> just

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
people they scoop all night it gets just

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.070 
people they scoop all night it gets just
a<00:04:51.960> bit<00:04:52.139> but<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.410> was<00:04:52.680> scoop<00:04:53.220> more<00:04:53.760> people<00:04:54.300> they

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
a bit but it was scoop more people they

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.360 
a bit but it was scoop more people they
would<00:04:55.229> have<00:04:55.470> when<00:04:55.650> they<00:04:55.740> don't<00:04:55.889> do<00:04:56.070> it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
would have when they don't do it

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.620 
would have when they don't do it
barbells<00:04:57.330> build<00:04:57.960> mass<00:04:58.440> blow<00:04:59.340> which<00:05:00.300> we'll<00:05:00.479> get

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
barbells build mass blow which we'll get

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.840 
barbells build mass blow which we'll get
to<00:05:00.690> later<00:05:00.810> but<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.860> scoop<00:05:02.130> will<00:05:02.370> give<00:05:02.580> me<00:05:02.699> that

to later but the scoop will give me that

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.780 
to later but the scoop will give me that
