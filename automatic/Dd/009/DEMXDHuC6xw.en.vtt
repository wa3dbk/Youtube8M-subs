wipe to expose the nut take out a 15
millimeter<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.780> then<00:01:00.559> it<00:01:00.680> is<00:01:01.120> about<00:01:03.969> five<00:01:04.969> or

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
millimeter and then it is about five or

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.719 
millimeter and then it is about five or
six<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.780> these<00:01:05.990> torques<00:01:06.439> to<00:01:06.860> t22

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
six of these torques to t22

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:15.130 
six of these torques to t22
or<00:01:07.880> screws<00:01:08.439> they<00:01:09.439> go<00:01:11.740> in<00:01:12.740> here<00:01:13.960> inside<00:01:14.960> the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
or screws they go in here inside the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.340 
or screws they go in here inside the
wheel<00:01:15.380> in<00:01:15.920> some<00:01:15.979> areas<00:01:16.549> you<00:01:17.420> hear<00:01:17.929> it's<00:01:18.170> like

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
wheel in some areas you hear it's like

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.749 
wheel in some areas you hear it's like
five<00:01:18.709> them<00:01:19.039> all<00:01:19.280> around<00:01:19.609> and<00:01:21.639> there's<00:01:22.639> a

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
five them all around and there's a

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.730 
five them all around and there's a
plastic<00:01:23.270> strip<00:01:23.600> that<00:01:23.840> goes<00:01:23.899> around<00:01:24.319> here<00:01:24.590> and

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
plastic strip that goes around here and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.639 
plastic strip that goes around here and
move<00:01:24.889> that<00:01:25.009> point<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.810> now<00:01:26.810> we<00:01:26.869> are<00:01:27.409> removing

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
move that point to now we are removing

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.059 
move that point to now we are removing
the<00:01:28.399> plastic<00:01:28.609> cover<00:01:28.969> and<00:01:29.889> exposing<00:01:30.889> the<00:01:31.240> wiper

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
the plastic cover and exposing the wiper

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.609 
the plastic cover and exposing the wiper
motor

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
motor

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.260 
motor
here<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.709> comes<00:01:37.539> this<00:01:38.950> capacitive<00:01:39.950> strip<00:01:40.270> but

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
here it comes this capacitive strip but

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.569 
here it comes this capacitive strip but
for<00:01:41.569> people<00:01:41.689> who<00:01:41.869> want<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.289> do<00:01:42.679> the<00:01:42.829> wiper<00:01:43.189> or

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
for people who want to do the wiper or

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.819 
for people who want to do the wiper or
wiper<00:01:43.880> motors<00:01:44.389> I<00:01:44.630> guess<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.679> good

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
wiper motors I guess this is a good

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.429 
wiper motors I guess this is a good
opportunity<00:01:46.039> to<00:01:46.429> of<00:01:47.079> take<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.109> look<00:01:48.289> at<00:01:48.349> this

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
opportunity to of take a look at this

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.429 
opportunity to of take a look at this
video<00:01:48.649> as<00:01:48.829> well<00:01:49.509> after<00:01:50.509> removing<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:50.899> wipers

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
video as well after removing the wipers

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.589 
video as well after removing the wipers
in<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:51.799> top<00:01:52.219> cover<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:52.909> have<00:01:53.869> removed<00:01:54.170> about

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
in the top cover I have removed about

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.230 
in the top cover I have removed about
four<00:01:56.599> bolts<00:01:57.049> thirteen<00:01:57.529> millimeter<00:01:57.999> that<00:01:58.999> go

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
four bolts thirteen millimeter that go

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.839 
four bolts thirteen millimeter that go
into<00:01:59.719> the<00:01:59.990> body<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:01.929> is<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:04.009> disconnect<00:02:04.700> the

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
into the body and is a disconnect the

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:07.419 
into the body and is a disconnect the
wiring<00:02:05.539> harness<00:02:06.049> as<00:02:06.169> well<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.039> at<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:07.219> point

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
wiring harness as well so at this point

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.690 
wiring harness as well so at this point
it<00:02:07.639> feels<00:02:07.700> out<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.500> will<00:02:09.709> use<00:02:09.920> both<00:02:10.160> my<00:02:10.429> hands

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
it feels out so I will use both my hands

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.089 
it feels out so I will use both my hands
to<00:02:10.880> remove<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.860> hopefully<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.040> have

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
to remove it and hopefully you have

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.100 
to remove it and hopefully you have
access<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.760> rear<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.000> engine<00:02:14.209> okay<00:02:14.930> I

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
access to the rear of the engine okay I

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.160 
access to the rear of the engine okay I
have<00:02:15.470> removed<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.040> wiper<00:02:16.910> motor<00:02:17.390> assembly

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
have removed the wiper motor assembly

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.980 
have removed the wiper motor assembly
and<00:02:18.940> down<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.209> have<00:02:20.959> removed<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.440> cover<00:02:21.830> first

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
and down I have removed the cover first

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.540 
and down I have removed the cover first
that<00:02:23.990> goes<00:02:24.200> on<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.500> top

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
that goes on the top

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.870 
that goes on the top
that's<00:02:26.480> how<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.720> looks<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:28.640> one

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that's how it looks like so this one

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.380 
that's how it looks like so this one
came<00:02:29.060> out<00:02:29.210> first<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:31.520> came<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.910> second

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
came out first this one came the second

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.270 
came out first this one came the second
they<00:02:32.510> want<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.840> motors<00:02:33.170> anybody<00:02:33.890> wants<00:02:34.160> to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
they want the motors anybody wants to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.850 
they want the motors anybody wants to
wipe<00:02:34.490> your<00:02:34.670> work<00:02:34.910> or<00:02:35.120> motor<00:02:35.330> removal<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:35.990> guess

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
wipe your work or motor removal I guess

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.350 
wipe your work or motor removal I guess
that's<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.130> way<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.370> do<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> there<00:02:38.180> are<00:02:38.210> the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
that's the way to do it there are the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.860 
that's the way to do it there are the
wipers<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:39.080> now<00:02:40.180> that's<00:02:41.180> where<00:02:41.390> looks<00:02:41.600> like

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
wipers and now that's where looks like

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.910 
wipers and now that's where looks like
the<00:02:42.500> engine<00:02:42.860> without<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.960> very<00:02:44.960> easy<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.680> work

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
the engine without it very easy to work

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.270 
the engine without it very easy to work
at<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.280> NZ<00:02:46.550> now<00:02:47.170> anyone<00:02:48.170> wants<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.950> spark

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
at the NZ now anyone wants the spark

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.250 
at the NZ now anyone wants the spark
