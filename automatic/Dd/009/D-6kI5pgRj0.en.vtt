a<00:01:10.149> little<00:01:10.330> bit<00:01:10.450> about<00:01:10.600> how<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.530> program<00:01:11.890> works

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
a little bit about how the program works

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.070 
a little bit about how the program works
and<00:01:12.520> why<00:01:12.729> why<00:01:13.300> it's<00:01:13.450> important<00:01:13.810> why<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:13.960> guys

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
and why why it's important why you guys

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.249 
and why why it's important why you guys
utilize<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.330> biggest<00:01:16.660> thing<00:01:16.810> that<00:01:16.840> I

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
utilize it the biggest thing that I

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.740 
utilize it the biggest thing that I
guess<00:01:18.100> why<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.369> works<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.970> there's<00:01:19.539> people

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
guess why it works is there's people

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.440 
guess why it works is there's people
that<00:01:20.009> either<00:01:21.009> intentionally<00:01:21.729> or<00:01:21.910> when<00:01:22.360> the

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.860 
you know if people have to stop and look

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
and decide whether or not it's a dummy

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.569 
and decide whether or not it's a dummy
there's<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.829> know<00:02:29.950> we<00:02:30.070> hear<00:02:30.250> things<00:02:30.430> that

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
there's a you know we hear things that

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.509 
there's a you know we hear things that
coffee-shop<00:02:31.030> stuff<00:02:31.480> where<00:02:31.720> people<00:02:32.519> swear

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
coffee-shop stuff where people swear

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.800 
coffee-shop stuff where people swear
we've<00:02:33.699> been<00:02:33.880> running<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.209> dummy<00:02:34.449> somewhere

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
we've been running the dummy somewhere

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.540 
we've been running the dummy somewhere
that<00:02:34.989> we<00:02:35.109> sure<00:02:35.350> as<00:02:35.380> heck<00:02:35.650> learned

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
that we sure as heck learned

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.230 
that we sure as heck learned
but<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.810> they<00:02:37.960> saw<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.200> dummy<00:02:38.470> deer<00:02:38.710> or<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
but but they saw the dummy deer or the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.420 
but but they saw the dummy deer or the
the<00:02:40.240> decoy<00:02:40.750> as<00:02:41.440> far<00:02:41.740> as<00:02:41.830> they<00:02:41.950> were<00:02:42.010> concerned

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
the decoy as far as they were concerned

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.960 
the decoy as far as they were concerned
and<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:44.080> likely<00:02:44.680> wasn't<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.280> that's<00:02:45.640> it's<00:02:45.880> a

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
and it likely wasn't so that's it's a

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.670 
and it likely wasn't so that's it's a
bonus<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.600> they're<00:02:46.810> thinking<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.500> way

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
bonus that they're thinking that way

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.280 
bonus that they're thinking that way
that's<00:02:48.010> because<00:02:48.400> they're<00:02:48.880> not<00:02:49.840> beyond<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
that's because they're not beyond the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.690 
that's because they're not beyond the
trigger<00:02:50.530> when<00:02:50.710> they<00:02:50.800> may<00:02:50.950> have<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.460> it

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
trigger when they may have and it it

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.520 
trigger when they may have and it it
makes<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.090> lot<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.270> conversation<00:02:52.960> because<00:02:53.320> then

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
makes a lot of conversation because then

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.440 
makes a lot of conversation because then
you<00:02:54.190> know<00:02:54.310> some<00:02:54.610> folks<00:02:54.880> think<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.300> we're

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
you know some folks think that we're

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.430 
you know some folks think that we're
we're<00:02:56.290> playing<00:02:57.130> dirty<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:59.080> it's

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
we're playing dirty and that it's it's

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.800 
we're playing dirty and that it's it's
in<00:02:59.890> a<00:03:00.220> form<00:03:00.490> of<00:03:00.640> entrapment<00:03:00.970> or<00:03:01.270> whatever<00:03:01.540> and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
in a form of entrapment or whatever and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.230 
in a form of entrapment or whatever and
it's<00:03:02.350> not<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.340> we've<00:03:03.610> had<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:04.000> through

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
use this but a flashlight with just a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.970 
use this but a flashlight with just a
little<00:03:45.280> bit<00:03:45.370> of<00:03:45.489> being<00:03:45.670> while<00:03:46.120> he's<00:03:46.300> filming

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
little bit of being while he's filming

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.060 
little bit of being while he's filming
maybe<00:03:47.980> put<00:03:48.250> your<00:03:48.370> hand<00:03:48.550> over<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.820> big<00:03:49.120> one

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
maybe put your hand over that big one

maybe put your hand over that big one
you<00:03:51.070> can<00:03:51.280> see<00:03:51.520> kind<00:03:51.820> of<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.320> reflective

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
you can see kind of the reflective

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.550 
you can see kind of the reflective
that's<00:03:54.640> at<00:03:54.820> work<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:57.430> right<00:03:58.270> and<00:03:58.540> his<00:03:59.170> headlamp

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
that's at work so right and his headlamp

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.180 
that's at work so right and his headlamp
seems<00:03:59.860> to<00:04:00.040> make<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.250> work<00:04:01.709> I'm<00:04:02.709> not<00:04:02.770> used<00:04:03.100> to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
seems to make it work I'm not used to

would<00:04:20.269> be<00:04:20.389> looking<00:04:20.630> hard<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.079> notice<00:04:21.350> that

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
would be looking hard to notice that

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.810 
would be looking hard to notice that
it's<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.739> buck<00:04:21.949> and<00:04:24.310> be<00:04:25.310> getting<00:04:25.550> ready<00:04:25.669> to

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
it's a buck and be getting ready to

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.860 
it's a buck and be getting ready to
shoot<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.150> because<00:04:26.330> they<00:04:26.419> don't<00:04:26.479> want<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.750> get

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
shoot it because they don't want to get

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.900 
shoot it because they don't want to get
any<00:04:27.050> closer<00:04:27.290> without<00:04:27.770> scaring<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:30.910> so

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
any closer without scaring it so

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.370 
any closer without scaring it so
probably<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.449> is<00:04:32.510> as<00:04:32.780> close<00:04:33.020> as<00:04:33.169> we'd<00:04:33.350> expect

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
probably this is as close as we'd expect

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.230 
probably this is as close as we'd expect
him<00:04:33.889> to<00:04:33.919> get<00:04:34.190> before<00:04:34.400> they'd<00:04:34.729> want<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:34.970> shoot

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
him to get before they'd want to shoot

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.020 
him to get before they'd want to shoot

yeah<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:28.099> I'll<00:05:28.910> play<00:05:29.419> with<00:05:29.570> words<00:05:29.870> we<00:05:29.990> don't

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
yeah and I'll play with words we don't

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.810 
yeah and I'll play with words we don't
try<00:05:30.349> to<00:05:30.380> entice<00:05:30.710> them<00:05:30.950> we<00:05:31.099> just<00:05:31.310> provide<00:05:31.669> the

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
try to entice them we just provide the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.969 
try to entice them we just provide the
opportunity<00:05:32.419> right<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.050> if<00:05:33.500> they<00:05:33.710> choose<00:05:33.919> to

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
opportunity right and if they choose to

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.870 
opportunity right and if they choose to
shoot<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.460> then<00:05:34.669> there's<00:05:36.370> so<00:05:37.370> I<00:05:37.400> guess<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.849> the

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
shoot it then there's so I guess the the

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.650 
shoot it then there's so I guess the the
key<00:05:38.360> message<00:05:39.260> here<00:05:39.470> is<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.669> you<00:05:40.669> you<00:05:41.000> know<00:05:41.120> if

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
idea here being that if you're you're

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.909 
idea here being that if you're you're
out<00:06:13.550> and<00:06:13.789> about<00:06:14.000> and<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:15.050> see<00:06:15.289> something<00:06:15.590> that

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
out and about and you see something that

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.170 
out and about and you see something that
looks<00:06:15.949> a<00:06:16.130> little<00:06:16.220> too<00:06:16.460> good<00:06:16.580> be<00:06:16.699> true<00:06:16.880> it<00:06:17.000> might

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
looks a little too good be true it might

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.839 
looks a little too good be true it might
be<00:06:17.419> so<00:06:17.780> you<00:06:18.199> might<00:06:18.410> want<00:06:18.740> to<00:06:18.889> rethink<00:06:19.340> it<00:06:19.760> and

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
be so you might want to rethink it and

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.380 
be so you might want to rethink it and
drive<00:06:20.090> on<00:06:20.300> because<00:06:20.599> it's<00:06:20.750> illegal<00:06:21.139> anyway
