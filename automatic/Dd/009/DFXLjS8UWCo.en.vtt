00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.960
 on day three here in portugal 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.580
 Today we want a boat trip 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.970
 do 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:36.400
 with the ship around the coast of none 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:47.570
 I know how it is 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:50.300
 So I have to say the world is as big as 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.950
 you can also learn surfing and me 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.720
 We notice you I make the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.610
 want beautiful weather i am now 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.890
 four days behind lattice and the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.450
 coast here is not good but I know 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.610
 not her 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.820
 So that does not show that special here 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.820
 tuned 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.750
 I just do not have that one 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:18.670
 changed a bit and here you see 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:21.180
 again my brother was karl willingly make 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.180
 my advice 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:33.350
 okay I just do know you yet 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350
 Not 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.430
 of course I do not do it now because I am 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.430
 it can be nice 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.010
 the weather is not so nice today 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.260
 is 19 degrees but it is cloudy and 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:40.290
 that's why we decided that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:43.380
 we each other day x the helper make us 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.440
 yes , we show you that so well weeks 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.440
 not friendly again 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.769
 we are then it's who at home as 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.210
 in the hotel and we will eat something now 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.750
 and then we'll see what we'll do after that 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.430
 do 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.260
 today, the weather is not so good 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.300
 it always rains so easily 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.980
 and that's why we thought so 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.450
 my brother and me that after us 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.360
 maybe just down there in the hotel 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.440
 play billiards or something else 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.470
 you can do there 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.820
 and yes I hope it's okay for you 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.460
 that I place the background music in places 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.740
 used because I have to stop for that 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.120
 Buy a license and that's why I can 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.220
 just use this song 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.780
 but well, I'm still trying somehow 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.550
 to use another song if it 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.650
 I go and I say pretty often right now 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.640
 That's why I'm going to use it 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.060
 and see you tomorrow at day 4 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.060
 in Portugal
