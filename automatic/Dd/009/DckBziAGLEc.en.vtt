00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.309
 Hi, how are you today? 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.610
 platicarles an experience that just 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.099
 Well I just happen to operate him 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.890
 they removed the matrix today we hear a lot 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.450
 to the lady that is to say is that when the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.250
 matrix no longer gives you children the only thing that 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.259
 you have problems well I never knew what 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.460
 kind of problems I just listened to 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.469
 and ready 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.670
 apart from that I did not think it was a 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.280
 of the people I went to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.070
 touch that that matter because I 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.809
 So healthy person is always worried 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.239
 by itself eat this if you do not eat it 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.589
 another finally good because it touched me last three 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.980
 years without going to do the 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:55.190
 pap and as always reasons 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.039
 neglect that after then afterwards 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.059
 I feel good I do not have anything and so good 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:05.150
 finally started bleeding that did not 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.460
 it was nothing normal and now that I know that I 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.590
 they will review then they send me to do some 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.850
 studies take me a biopsy and then 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.810
 well there appeared cancer 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.810
 for me it was a 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.260
 very hard news 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.530
 although I thought I was prepared to 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.530
 wait for the news because 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.700
 well I always like to get in 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.350
 Internet inquire about any doubt that 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.960
 I have always look for myself 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.030
 information and when the doctor had 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920
 said that there was a lot of cell movement 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.780
 He told me on the phone before giving me 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.290
 the results, of course, I can 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.869
 investigate and there I found that there was the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.450
 possibility or that it was almost certain that I 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.800
 had cancer then when it was a 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:58.520
 husband and I who gave us the the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.399
 result of the biopsy my gynecologist 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.250
 He cited an oncologist to talk 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.460
 with me others 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.310
 because being a specialist in this he 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.400
 gave the explanation and well there was no 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.370
 option more than to operate 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.299
 The surgery lasted three hours and a half 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.120
 be a somewhat complicated surgery given that 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.040
 it was not going to be anything else to take away the womb 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.319
 but they were going to review each of the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.959
 organs that were not infected 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.439
 thank god everything went well it was a 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.989
 uncertainty in that interest and I knew that 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.170
 had passed was always in the hands of 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.170
 God 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.610
 it really changed his life 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.300
 I get excited and actually I'm fine already 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.820
 I do not have cancer , he really is 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.310
 experience that I want to talk to you 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.290
 is for you if you are one of the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.150
 people that was like me in the sense 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.910
 that no, it will not happen to me, not if 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.880
 then really do not leave it for later 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.730
 it is very important to make your studies 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.840
 that we already know that you have to do 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.810
 do not give him long and I hope that my 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.110
 experience will serve to encourage you to 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.840
 go accept your studies already in the 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.620
 family we had an experience of 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.040
 a person who gave cancer cancer in 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.800
 the bones something rather difficult clear that 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.420
 when I found out that my sister in law 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.870
 had cancer in the bones are called 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.650
 well the most multiple I was impacted 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.170
 never, I thought how sometimes we leave 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.120
 for later important things 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.060
 because of course I thought of that 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.600
 almost a year ago that we were 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.420
 we found out 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.800
 I thought I was going to make myself my 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.780
 studies that I was not going to leave things 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.140
 for after he greeted me first that 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.020
 because you always put your work first and 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.920
 in my case, I wanted the videos 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:08.070
 you have to do that they are always everything 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.440
 it is before our good health in my 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.630
 This is how it happened to me and I know that many 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.520
 women does not happen the same anymore when 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.730
 we are 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.160
 moms housewives that we are so so 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.030
 home are delivered to do the most 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.920
 that you can at home I know we are 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.510
 decided sas then please attend 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.979
 I'm going to aa 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.310
 tell them I will put here a 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.669
 annotation of a study that the oncologist 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.250
 He told me he does it because he's got 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.169
 color he does a study that is the 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.600
 pap smear but that also includes 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.050
 another study that is basically for 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.949
 confirm that there is none in any 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.470
 indication of cancer and then if you 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.419
 can do 0 would be very good but 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.990
 because good to me when I went with the 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.949
 gynecologist he told me this that you 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.470
 it turned out you do not look at in a pap smear 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.510
 common then after I speak with 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.460
 the oncologist of this I said good because 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.320
 says it's not commonly seen in a 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.389
 pap smear then it means that 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.550
 Even if I do a Pap smear, it's not 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.320
 sure that maybe I have cancer and 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.990
 they have not realized then the 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.120
 Oncologist told me ah you say that well 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.550
 we as specialists in 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.560
 cancer, you know, we make you this 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.100
 study like that or not even what 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.620
 they charge extra 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.600
 in the case of the gynecologist because he does not 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.180
 applies to these studies because then he 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.760
 he is not a specialist in oncology 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.450
 then do not throw in a broken bag what they 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.970
 I said the money comes and goes and our 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:51.110
 health is first truly that in a 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.650
 time is both one ends 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.650
 Y 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.370
 to me the thoughts that came to me is 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.620
 how I did not think about doing this before as 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.010
 I let it go as long as yes but 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.320
 that already happened there was nothing that I 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.080
 I could do more than put my batteries 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.240
 is to think that we are all 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.550
 exposed that can all happen to us in 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.930
 this case all and also the men or 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.060
 be it also men there are studies that 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.740
 should be done when you reach 40 years 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.660
 they will reach a certain age or have 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.310
 certain symptoms but 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.830
 I do not know how we always wait if 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.470
 Then yes then then nothing 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.470
 thank you thank you that follow my videos and 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.960
 I hope I have left a 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.450
 little seed so they do not postpone a 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.580
 postpone your studies that should be 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.580
 do until the next
