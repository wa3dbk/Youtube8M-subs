the racket pulls out away from the body
okay<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:42.060> reason<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.899> this

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
okay but if the reason I like this

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.249 
okay but if the reason I like this
racket<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:44.149> because<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.329> racket<00:01:45.810> has<00:01:45.990> some

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
racket is because this racket has some

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.910 
racket is because this racket has some
weight<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.700> helps<00:01:48.030> me<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:49.259> loosen<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
weight and it helps me to loosen up the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
weight and it helps me to loosen up the
shoulder<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.549> stretches<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.270> my<00:01:51.509> shoulder<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
shoulder it stretches out my shoulder a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.700 
shoulder it stretches out my shoulder a
little<00:01:52.170> bit<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> know<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.180> older<00:01:54.710> I'm

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
fruits and vegetables stay away from the

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.250 
fruits and vegetables stay away from the
heavy<00:03:43.500> animal<00:03:43.980> products<00:03:44.820> they're<00:03:45.660> going<00:03:46.080> to

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
is key you've got to stretch use the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.240 
is key you've got to stretch use the
resistance<00:04:02.190> band<00:04:03.200> make<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.230> racket<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:04.890> has<00:04:05.220> a

yet more racket drop and you're gonna

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:46.280 
yet more racket drop and you're gonna
get<00:04:30.390> more<00:04:30.720> speed<00:04:31.260> on<00:04:31.500> your<00:04:31.590> serve<00:04:45.290> okay

there's<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.890> little<00:04:47.160> point<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.580> my<00:04:47.730> racket

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
there's the little point of my racket

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.530 
there's the little point of my racket
drop<00:04:48.450> not<00:04:49.200> too<00:04:49.470> bad<00:04:49.740> for<00:04:50.010> a<00:04:50.070> 65<00:04:50.760> year<00:04:51.030> old<00:04:51.240> but<00:04:51.510> I

really need to improve this so I'm gonna
do<00:04:54.330> this<00:04:54.620> stretching<00:04:55.620> with<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.920> resistance

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
do this stretching with the resistance

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.260 
do this stretching with the resistance
band<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:57.090> use<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.870> heavy<00:04:58.110> racket<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:59.340> stretch

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
band and use the heavy racket to stretch

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.600 
band and use the heavy racket to stretch
out<00:05:00.570> my<00:05:00.600> shoulder<00:05:01.230> see<00:05:01.920> if<00:05:02.040> I<00:05:02.190> could<00:05:02.400> get<00:05:02.580> a

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
out my shoulder see if I could get a

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.180 
out my shoulder see if I could get a
little<00:05:02.910> further<00:05:03.360> with<00:05:03.720> this<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.290> more<00:05:04.710> drop

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
little further with this a more drop
