00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
can see it's not really glossy I thought

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.219

it<00:01:21.430> was<00:01:21.610> going<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.789> be<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.000> lot<00:01:22.330> glossy<00:01:22.930> er<00:01:22.960> when

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
it was going to be a lot glossy er when

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.130 
it was going to be a lot glossy er when

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
I sprayed it and I was surprised that it

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.680 
I sprayed it and I was surprised that it
wasn't<00:01:26.440> that<00:01:26.560> gavazzi<00:01:27.100> I<00:01:27.340> actually<00:01:28.060> really

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
wasn't that gavazzi I actually really

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.809 
wasn't that gavazzi I actually really
liked<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.080> finish<00:01:29.410> because<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.429> isn't<00:01:30.700> too

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
liked the finish because it isn't too

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.460 
liked the finish because it isn't too
glossy<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.450> I'm<00:01:31.509> not<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.690> big<00:01:31.899> fan<00:01:31.929> of<00:01:32.140> real
