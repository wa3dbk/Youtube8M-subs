combinations<00:00:36.559> it's<00:00:37.160> basically<00:00:37.550> unpickable

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
combinations it's basically unpickable

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.030 
combinations it's basically unpickable
undrivable<00:00:38.839> and<00:00:39.170> what<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:39.559> would<00:00:39.650> do<00:00:39.830> is

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
undrivable and what you would do is

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.860 
undrivable and what you would do is
you'd<00:00:40.400> slide<00:00:40.670> this<00:00:40.850> around<00:00:41.120> your<00:00:41.300> front<00:00:41.510> brake

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
you'd slide this around your front brake

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.619 
you'd slide this around your front brake
disc<00:00:42.519> the<00:00:43.519> brake<00:00:43.820> disc<00:00:44.030> would<00:00:44.150> slide<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:44.600> here

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
disc the brake disc would slide in here

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.979 
disc the brake disc would slide in here
you'd<00:00:45.589> then<00:00:45.620> lock<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.010> into<00:00:46.280> place<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:46.989> this

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
you'd then lock it into place and this

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.560 
you'd then lock it into place and this
would<00:00:48.170> this<00:00:48.650> would<00:00:48.890> enable<00:00:49.550> you<00:00:50.150> to<00:00:50.180> lock<00:00:50.540> your

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
couldn't rotate the front wheel a full

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.259 
couldn't rotate the front wheel a full
360<00:00:54.799> degree<00:00:55.280> motion<00:00:55.549> without<00:00:55.640> this<00:00:55.879> banging

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
360 degree motion without this banging

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.609 
360 degree motion without this banging
into<00:00:56.420> your<00:00:56.540> fork<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.140> it's<00:00:57.260> really<00:00:57.379> going<00:00:57.559> to

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:57.619 
into your fork so it's really going to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.140 
into your fork so it's really going to
immobilize<00:00:58.159> your<00:00:58.339> bike<00:00:58.489> but<00:00:58.850> really<00:00:59.059> the

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
materials it's going to be hardened

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.679 
materials it's going to be hardened
stainless<00:01:22.460> steel<00:01:22.969> that's<00:01:23.359> going<00:01:23.509> to<00:01:23.600> be

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
stainless steel that's going to be

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.959 
stainless steel that's going to be
corrosion<00:01:23.840> proof<00:01:24.289> weather<00:01:24.770> proof<00:01:25.070> they<00:01:25.789> call

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
corrosion proof weather proof they call

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.940 
corrosion proof weather proof they call
it<00:01:26.090> hammer<00:01:26.600> blow<00:01:26.960> proof<00:01:27.259> but<00:01:27.499> what<00:01:27.619> that<00:01:27.740> does

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
it hammer blow proof but what that does

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.010 
it hammer blow proof but what that does
is<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.189> uses<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.520> proprietary<00:01:29.329> material<00:01:29.869> and

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
is it uses a proprietary material and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.779 
is it uses a proprietary material and
tempering<00:01:30.590> process<00:01:30.979> it's<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.189> softer<00:01:31.579> core

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
tempering process it's a softer core

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.300 
tempering process it's a softer core
with<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.299> harder<00:01:32.689> exterior<00:01:33.289> so<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:33.799> can't<00:01:34.069> saw

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
with a harder exterior so you can't saw

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.830 
with a harder exterior so you can't saw
through<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:34.579> what<00:01:34.969> a<00:01:34.999> security<00:01:35.270> systems<00:01:35.689> go

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
through it what a security systems go

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.989 
through it what a security systems go
always<00:01:35.929> going<00:01:36.109> to<00:01:36.170> do<00:01:36.289> is<00:01:36.469> buy<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:36.799> time<00:01:37.429> so

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
always going to do is buy you time so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:39.789 
always going to do is buy you time so
it's<00:01:38.149> going<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.299> take<00:01:38.450> someone<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.990> lot<00:01:39.530> longer

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
it's going to take someone a lot longer

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.440 
it's going to take someone a lot longer
to<00:01:40.039> be<00:01:40.280> able<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.579> get<00:01:40.759> your<00:01:40.880> bike<00:01:40.999> to<00:01:41.179> a<00:01:41.210> point

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
where they could take it outside of the

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.520 
where they could take it outside of the
steel<00:01:44.210> elements<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:44.810> have<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.140> hardened

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
steel elements you have this hardened

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.080
