big trackpad and what i like the most is

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.009 
big trackpad and what i like the most is

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070

them but they have a really good click
to<00:00:35.190> them<00:00:35.340> otherwise<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.809> course<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
also a fingerprint reader since this is

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000 
also a fingerprint reader since this is
a<00:00:39.059> business<00:00:39.239> model<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.780> let's<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.800> what

the front is only on the left side if

your status LEDs nothing special there

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260 
your status LEDs nothing special there
and<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> other<00:00:53.340> side<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.910> actually

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and on the other side we have actually

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.580 
and on the other side we have actually

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
here USB 3.0 extra power out when the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.340 
here USB 3.0 extra power out when the
device<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.890> off<00:00:59.039> HDMI<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.690> also<00:01:00.960> use<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
device is off HDMI you can also use the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.170 
device is off HDMI you can also use the
network<00:01:01.530> adapter<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.190> Metro<00:01:02.489> port<00:01:02.760> without<00:01:03.030> an

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
network adapter in Metro port without an

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.600 
network adapter in Metro port without an
adapter<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.290> power<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.860> also<00:01:05.070> built-in

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
adapter and the power is also built-in

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.730 
adapter and the power is also built-in
so<00:01:06.060> there's<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> maximum

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so there's actually and not to maximum

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.230 
so there's actually and not to maximum
that<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.159> tilt<00:01:08.400> back<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.820> head<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that you can tilt back to this head to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.030 
that you can tilt back to this head to
this<00:01:09.659> would<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> maximum<00:01:10.260> which<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.680> quite

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
this would be the maximum which is quite

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.190 
this would be the maximum which is quite
nice<00:01:11.280> because<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.820> Zen<00:01:11.970> books<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
nice because the Zen books don't go this

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.030 
nice because the Zen books don't go this
far<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:13.799> now

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
far right now

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.429 
far right now
and<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.850> Asus<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.479> listening<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> our<00:01:16.080> reviews

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and so Asus was listening to our reviews

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.200 
and so Asus was listening to our reviews
on<00:01:16.650> top<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.979> didn't<00:01:17.400> forget<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.790> tell<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
on top I didn't forget to tell you that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.149 
on top I didn't forget to tell you that
we<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.390> camera<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.869> course<00:01:18.900> buildin<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
we have camera of course buildin on the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.700 
we have camera of course buildin on the
outside<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.909> also<00:01:21.150> here<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.020> no<00:01:22.259> foil

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
outside we have also here but no foil

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710 
outside we have also here but no foil
but<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.040> says<00:01:23.250> instance<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.420> actually

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
but it says instance on it and actually

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.510 
but it says instance on it and actually
everything<00:01:24.930> feels<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.680> cold<00:01:25.890> since

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
everything feels a little bit cold since

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.990 
everything feels a little bit cold since
this<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> made<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.990> aluminum<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.000> there

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
this is made out of aluminum so there

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
this is made out of aluminum so there
the<00:01:30.270> quality<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.810> quite<00:01:31.020> nice<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.560> didn't

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the quality is quite nice and I didn't

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.319 
the quality is quite nice and I didn't
actually<00:01:31.950> show<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> bottom<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.240> can

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
actually show you the bottom but you can

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
actually show you the bottom but you can
see<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.020> cannot<00:01:34.380> change<00:01:34.439> everything<00:01:35.100> too

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
see that we cannot change everything too

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.270 
see that we cannot change everything too
easily<00:01:35.630> but<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:37.170> also<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.650> here<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> cold

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
easily but we also have here a cold

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.260 
easily but we also have here a cold
bottom<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.189> built<00:01:41.189> out<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.460> aluminum

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
bottom so this is built out of aluminum

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.910 
bottom so this is built out of aluminum
I<00:01:42.420> would<00:01:42.630> say<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.170> let's<00:01:43.350> actually<00:01:43.500> compare

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I would say so let's actually compare

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.429 
I would say so let's actually compare
this<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> samsung<00:01:45.270> series<00:01:45.600> 9<00:01:46.020> which<00:01:46.229> has

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
this with the samsung series 9 which has

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.160 
this with the samsung series 9 which has
also<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.799> 14<00:01:47.250> inch<00:01:47.399> screen<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:49.020> bit

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
also a 14 inch screen and a little bit

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.010 
also a 14 inch screen and a little bit
thinner<00:01:49.829> bezel<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> price<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
thinner bezel but I think the price is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
thinner bezel but I think the price is
completely<00:01:52.649> different<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.579> see

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
completely different so you can see

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.810 
completely different so you can see
actually<00:01:54.649> quite<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.680> differences<00:01:56.670> between

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
actually quite the differences between

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.480 
actually quite the differences between
the<00:01:57.119> bulb<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.350> example<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.950> almost

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the bulb we have for example here almost

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
the bulb we have for example here almost
2<00:01:59.790> centimeters<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.509> top<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
2 centimeters on the top and here on the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.319 
2 centimeters on the top and here on the
bottom<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.219> course<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.969> different

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
bottom of course where it's different

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.440 
bottom of course where it's different
and<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:04.170> terms<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.619> thickness<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.119> sensor

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
and in terms of thickness and the sensor

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.609 
and in terms of thickness and the sensor
is<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.200> slim<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.979> actually<00:02:08.129> even

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
is so so slim that you can actually even

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.009 
is so so slim that you can actually even
see<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.340> ports<00:02:09.700> of<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:09.879> Aces<00:02:10.390> when<00:02:10.629> you<00:02:10.780> put

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
see the ports of the Aces when you put

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.830 
see the ports of the Aces when you put
the<00:02:11.640> Samsung<00:02:12.640> right<00:02:12.819> next<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.239> which<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:13.599> of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the Samsung right next to it which is of

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.320 
the Samsung right next to it which is of
course<00:02:14.290> quite<00:02:14.610> embarrassing<00:02:15.610> for<00:02:15.790> Asus<00:02:16.150> but

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
course quite embarrassing for Asus but

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.720 
course quite embarrassing for Asus but
the<00:02:17.230> battery<00:02:17.530> life<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.890> think<00:02:17.950> on<00:02:18.280> both<00:02:18.489> is

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
the battery life I think on both is

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.820 
the battery life I think on both is
quite<00:02:19.030> similar<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.629> as<00:02:20.019> I<00:02:20.110> said<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.379> think<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
quite similar and as I said I think the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.039 
quite similar and as I said I think the
Samsung<00:02:21.190> cost<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:22.000> twice<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.569> money<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:22.959> you

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
Samsung cost that twice the money so you

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.899 
Samsung cost that twice the money so you
can<00:02:23.200> see<00:02:23.379> here<00:02:23.620> actually<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.670> difference

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
can see here actually the difference

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.750 
can see here actually the difference
between<00:02:25.329> these<00:02:25.690> two<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.500> business<00:02:26.980> blue<00:02:27.459> will

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
between these two and business blue will

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.970 
between these two and business blue will
trebles<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.510> think<00:02:28.780> about<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.140> for<00:02:29.590> watching

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
trebles so think about what for watching

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.750 
trebles so think about what for watching
with<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.640> asus<00:02:31.000> prohm<00:02:31.480> bu<00:02:32.079> 400v<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:33.549> next

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
with the asus prohm bu 400v the next
