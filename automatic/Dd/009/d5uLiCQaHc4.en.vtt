 do good and will follow the description of 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.620
 video I'll leave you 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.579
 what is the data or bb of the game and the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.510
 apk 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.690
 and there are going to be many links because 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.640
 it's going to be several engines one of them 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.989
 good just closed the door one 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.989
 of them is this 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.640
 like llama smalling integrates or adreno that 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.909
 is the one that I have on my motorcycle gp for 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.409
 that we are going to occupy what sp z is a 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.510
 application that is free on the place 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.640
 thor 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.510
 weighs 1 weighs less than 2 megabytes and good 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.640
 here we will have qualcomm snapdragon 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 1.19 come to exercise here you will have what 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.610
 that is working two cpu and here what 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.940
 what we care about is here in gpu or render 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:35.360
 where I'm marking because why not 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:38.820
 there is adreno tells us and father not you m 305 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.980
 450 better you exercise that nothing else is what 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.990
 import 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.650
 we also need to have a ram giga 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.220
 or more since it's a game that goes 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.690
 requires several bone graphics 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.530
 what 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.230
 goes to what is asking too much with the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.230
 graphics that's why we need a 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.810
 come over ram 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.470
 another thing that we have to have is what 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.630
 what is this a file explorer or 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.020
 a file manager as you want 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.910
 call in this case is ruth explorer my 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.910
 favorite you can also install 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.599
 star that is the explorer 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.510
 in my case I'm not good rod 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.360
 explorer and good once downloaded the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.689
 application that said crosshead is 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.579
 they go they fix there which they have and already they go to 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.530
 the description of the video to download the 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.569
 files it is advisable that what 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.019
 download by computer bet that 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.680
 by cell phone is very bag now is going to be 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.690
 very slow because I'm telling you because I have 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.439
 discharged 82 heavy on the in the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.230
 cellular and yes it's going too slow and 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:58.010
 well I did it with my computer 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.409
 from mozilla firefox and good better 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.079
 let's start once downloaded and 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:07.370
 step to the computer we are going to set 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:11.319
 to what is in configuration we are going to 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.319
 go to what is 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.990
 first let's go to what is 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.660
 security where this security 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.930
 let's see, let's see, we'll stay 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.250
 here is security let's go towards 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.680
 down 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.960
 where it says unknown sources or 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.360
 Unknown origins 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.260
 we are going to mark it with a little do 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.210
 let's activate like this we can already like this already 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.740
 we can have accessibility to the 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.480
 all applied to install them 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.430
 another thing we have to do is if 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.850
 tell us about the device in some 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.690
 cases the programmer's options 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.210
 already they are already 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.910
 what is it called and they are activated by 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.890
 default but in this case I motorola not 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.080
 we are going to go to what is number of 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.960
 compilation and we're going to press the 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.260
 seven times in my case already and we 're going to 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.850
 go to the programmer's options 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.770
 we debug usb enabled it and 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.390
 Once we enabled you are going to give in 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.590
 accept I should cancel it because I 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.200
 I already have it here we go to what we are going to 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.620
 pass the files to what is this to 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.710
 where we want we will go to my case 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.650
 ruth explorer and here we are going to have all 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.960
 the partners that I have in memory we're going 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.570
 to have this one that matters to us 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.110
 there is this one that matters to us 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:42.240
 which I have marked with a check mark with 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:45.510
 dot o point og 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.969
 mk x this one we are going to move to what is 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.709
 here 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.709
 let's move it 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.460
 we leave it pressed move we go to 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.449
 go to the android folder or bb and we're going 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.289
 to give in 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.700
 move here 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.240
 of this one 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.450
 I'm going to leave it without two already 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.410
 decompressed rather since 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.710
 I suppose it will also take a long time 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.950
 and now we are going to go to what is the apk 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.930
 that I have it here and we're going to give it there 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.850
 through good packages you do not 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.510
 this will appear but those who have 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.640
 those who have road explorer if 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.910
 since it is normal for road explorer 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.060
 that the one who asks for that we will give in 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.850
 install here good here tells us all 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.070
 the permissions that you want to have 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.520
 Equis we show how we are going to 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.520
 install 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.860
 We waited a bit to be the 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.860
 installation 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:52.129
 well I think I'm going to pause the video 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:54.110
 not very well already finished what is the 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:57.860
 installation let's see what I have here 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.449
 what is mortal kombat x let's see what 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.919
 what is this great game 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.659
 this competitive file 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.279
 socially and you can submit under 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.129
 good performance that's why you do not have to 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:11.460
 worry is just a warning not 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:14.669
 I think it happens to us nothing bad yes good 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.930
 Here we will automatically what 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:21.439
 is this connect in the google play and 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.169
 well let's wait for it to load 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:28.499
 normally all good this one I've already 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.529
 come back again and well we're going to 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.529
 watch 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.680
 sorry for the good interruption 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.820
 there is the screen to attack 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.590
 and let's see that we have diseased corp 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.800
 Jon and cons but keep pressure 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.800
 why 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.860
 well there we can do what are the 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.530
 types of specials what are the 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.290
 special abilities but if not in 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.210
 fatality good the fatality does it 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.190
 automatically we just have to continue 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.070
 a series of patterns either slide 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.440
 touch or anything else in this case 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.860
 it's just to perform and then we see that it 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:22.110
 cuts a lot the face is not and what is 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:27.290
 this what is 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.290
 I do not know if I can I do not think I see it 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:35.169
 I think I'm going to omit that part what 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.030
 that's what I'm going to make it blurry 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:38.860
 put what 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.200
 I do not want youtube to remove the video 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.120
 since it is a very good video and therefore 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.550
 well that was everything I hope you 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.840
