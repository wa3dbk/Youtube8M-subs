00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
Rockets their interest in James Harden

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.050 
Rockets their interest in James Harden
has<00:01:10.229> been<00:01:10.409> known<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.619> quite<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> long<00:01:11.340> time<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
has been known for quite a long time so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.390 
has been known for quite a long time so
they<00:01:12.960> were<00:01:13.080> able<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.409> consummate<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> deal<00:01:14.250> with

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
Houston pretty quickly but I think

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
Houston pretty quickly but I think
around<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> levy<00:01:17.070> expectation<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:17.970> have

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
around the levy expectation would have

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.070 
around the levy expectation would have
been<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> Thunder<00:01:18.780> would<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:18.990> at

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
been that the Thunder would have at

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.050 
been that the Thunder would have at
least<00:01:19.200> tried<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.590> take<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.939> to
