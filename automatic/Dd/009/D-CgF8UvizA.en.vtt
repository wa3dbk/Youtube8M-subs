starting<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.450> rim<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.550> specific

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
starting on the rim we have a specific

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
starting on the rim we have a specific
carbon<00:00:42.270> layup<00:00:42.600> which<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.140> reducing<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.070> the

twist<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> road<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.100> when<00:01:26.310> riding<00:01:26.549> hard

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
twist on the road and when riding hard

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.460 
twist on the road and when riding hard
so<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.299> will<00:01:27.420> always<00:01:27.600> stay<00:01:27.780> positioned

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so it will always stay positioned

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.280 
so it will always stay positioned
perfectly<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:29.310> optimal<00:01:30.299> aerodynamics<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
perfectly for optimal aerodynamics and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.940 
perfectly for optimal aerodynamics and
this<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:32.340> drag<00:01:32.640> as<00:01:32.759> possible<00:01:33.829> what<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
this little drag as possible what it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.280 
this little drag as possible what it
also<00:01:35.130> allows<00:01:35.549> us<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.689> position<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
also allows us that we can position the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.620 
also allows us that we can position the
spokes<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:38.159> far<00:01:38.369> apart<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
spokes really far apart so we have a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.800 
spokes really far apart so we have a
bigger<00:01:40.590> angle<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> spoke<00:01:41.490> which<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.540> turn

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
bigger angle of the spoke which in turn

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.550 
bigger angle of the spoke which in turn
leads<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.350> stiffer<00:01:43.619> wheel<00:01:45.020> raised<00:01:46.020> side<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
leads to a stiffer wheel raised side to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.580 
leads to a stiffer wheel raised side to
side<00:01:46.740> stiffness<00:01:47.280> better<00:01:48.000> acceleration<00:01:48.590> more

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
side stiffness better acceleration more

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.940

hundred grams for the 32 ml tubular
wheelset<00:02:03.350> which<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> pretty<00:02:05.009> competitive

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
wheelset which is a pretty competitive

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.380

if<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.930> talk<00:02:07.079> about<00:02:07.110> weight<00:02:07.640> stiffness

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
if you talk about weight stiffness

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.540 
if you talk about weight stiffness
I<00:02:09.929> guess<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.440> need<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.860> consider<00:02:11.009> looks<00:02:11.400> as

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
I guess we need to consider looks as

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.370 
I guess we need to consider looks as
well<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.060> looks<00:02:12.270> pretty<00:02:12.510> clean<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.080> pretty

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380

we also have new in the trike on line up
is<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.880> 29<00:03:15.600> inch<00:03:15.630> wheel<00:03:16.019> version<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.829> trike

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
is a 29 inch wheel version of the trike

is a 29 inch wheel version of the trike
on<00:03:17.310> XM<00:03:17.820> 1550<00:03:18.720> it's<00:03:19.560> got<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.860> 30<00:03:20.220> spokes<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.670> well

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
on XM 1550 it's got a 30 spokes as well

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.180 
on XM 1550 it's got a 30 spokes as well
so<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.299> wanted<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.630> make<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.350> stiff<00:03:22.620> 29

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
so we wanted to make really stiff 29

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.210 
so we wanted to make really stiff 29
inch<00:03:23.400> wheel<00:03:23.610> set<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.630> solve<00:03:25.410> sort<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:25.980> solve

the problem of soft and flexi what was a

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.810 
the problem of soft and flexi what was a
lot<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.850> criticism<00:03:30.690> 29er<00:03:31.380> wheels<00:03:31.680> it's<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.670> real

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
lot of criticism 29er wheels it's a real

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.420 
lot of criticism 29er wheels it's a real
set<00:03:33.060> with<00:03:33.209> 26<00:03:33.780> mil<00:03:34.019> white<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.980> blue<00:03:35.100> stream<00:03:35.310> as

set with 26 mil white to blue stream as

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.880 
set with 26 mil white to blue stream as
well<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.480> caters<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.019> cross<00:03:37.380> country<00:03:37.560> and

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
well so it caters to cross country and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.580 
well so it caters to cross country and
more<00:03:38.730> aggressive<00:03:38.820> cross<00:03:39.329> county<00:03:39.480> riders<00:03:39.989> a

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
more aggressive cross county riders a

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.500 
more aggressive cross county riders a
little<00:03:41.190> bit<00:03:41.280> into<00:03:41.489> all-mountain<00:03:41.760> used<00:03:42.390> as

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
little bit into all-mountain used as

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.640 
little bit into all-mountain used as
well<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.799> should<00:03:43.950> be<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.100> nice<00:03:44.340> really<00:03:44.820> add

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
well so it should be a nice really add

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.810 
well so it should be a nice really add
