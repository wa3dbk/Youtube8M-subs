and she's dropping her wall breakers to
break<00:01:27.869> through<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> she's<00:01:28.619> using<00:01:28.829> archers<00:01:29.250> as

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
break through and she's using archers as

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
break through and she's using archers as
reinforcements<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.960> pretty

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
reinforcements so this is a pretty

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.520 
reinforcements so this is a pretty
common<00:01:31.590> strategy<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.729> um<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.689> tend<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
common strategy that I use um I tend to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.080 
common strategy that I use um I tend to
use<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> lot<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> giants<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> usually<00:01:35.820> don't<00:01:35.909> use

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
use a lot of giants I usually don't use

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330 
use a lot of giants I usually don't use
a<00:01:36.119> healer<00:01:36.509> i<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> healing<00:01:37.259> spell<00:01:37.590> just

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
a healer i use the healing spell just

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
a healer i use the healing spell just
for<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> convenience<00:01:39.030> factor<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.600> she<00:01:39.869> went

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
for a convenience factor but she went

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.240 
for a convenience factor but she went
ahead<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.350> she<00:01:40.530> now<00:01:40.650> she's<00:01:40.860> dropped<00:01:41.130> her

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
ahead and she now she's dropped her

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.010 
ahead and she now she's dropped her
healer<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> top<00:01:41.909> right<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
healer on the top right and it is

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.560 
healer on the top right and it is
protected<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.570> mustard

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
protected because all of the mustard

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
protected because all of the mustard
seed<00:01:45.720> destroyed<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> air<00:01:46.560> defense<00:01:46.860> unit<00:01:47.159> on

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
seed destroyed the air defense unit on

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.030 
seed destroyed the air defense unit on
the<00:01:47.549> top<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.170> with<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.500> he's<00:01:49.799> pretty

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the top and with that he's pretty

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.280 
the top and with that he's pretty
vulnerable<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.640> attacks<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.420> now<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.200> it's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
vulnerable to attacks so now that it's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.310 
vulnerable to attacks so now that it's
just<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> healer<00:01:53.159> um<00:01:53.369> or<00:01:54.299> now<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.689> now<00:01:55.170> it's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
just the healer um or now it's now it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.080 
just the healer um or now it's now it's
the<00:01:55.470> healer<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.040> first<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> archer

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the healer and first like the archer

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.760 
the healer and first like the archer
towers<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.630> wizard<00:01:57.930> towers<00:01:58.229> usually

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
towers and the wizard towers usually

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.109 
towers and the wizard towers usually
they're<00:01:59.310> not<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.700> worry<00:01:59.850> about<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
they're not going to worry about the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.310 
they're not going to worry about the
healer<00:02:00.390> they're<00:02:00.689> gonna<00:02:00.810> worry<00:02:01.049> about<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
healer they're gonna worry about the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.929 
healer they're gonna worry about the
unit<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.799> closest<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> them<00:02:02.549> which<00:02:02.790> will

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
unit that is closest to them which will

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
unit that is closest to them which will
be<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> giants<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.899> pretty<00:02:04.140> much<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.439> healers

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
be the giants so pretty much for healers

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.830 
be the giants so pretty much for healers
can<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.040> safe<00:02:05.280> from<00:02:05.399> now<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.939> long<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
can be safe from now on as long as it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.690 
can be safe from now on as long as it
isn't<00:02:07.049> dumb<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.710> runs<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> center<00:02:08.580> or

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
isn't dumb and runs in the center or

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.210 
isn't dumb and runs in the center or
something<00:02:09.000> alright<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:10.739> as<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:10.979> see

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
something alright so as you can see

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.570 
something alright so as you can see
Giants<00:02:12.090> are<00:02:12.180> making<00:02:12.510> their<00:02:12.660> way<00:02:12.690> through<00:02:12.780> now

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
Giants are making their way through now

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.490 
Giants are making their way through now
taking<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.180> lot<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.450> golden<00:02:14.900> elixir<00:02:15.080> again

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
taking a lot of golden elixir again

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.040 
taking a lot of golden elixir again
there<00:02:15.680> was<00:02:15.770> over<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.250> believe<00:02:16.640> 400<00:02:17.150> what<00:02:17.780> thirty

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
there was over I believe 400 what thirty

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.190 
there was over I believe 400 what thirty
thousand<00:02:18.410> gold<00:02:18.970> 420,000<00:02:19.970> elixir<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:21.020> it's<00:02:21.140> a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
thousand gold 420,000 elixir so it's a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.980 
thousand gold 420,000 elixir so it's a
huge<00:02:21.230> raid<00:02:21.950> um<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.880> think<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:23.450> is<00:02:23.600> more<00:02:23.810> than

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
huge raid um I think this is more than

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.450 
huge raid um I think this is more than
I've<00:02:24.110> captured<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.620> video<00:02:24.890> I've<00:02:25.100> had<00:02:25.220> some

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.790 
it sucks so bad but she was fully
prepared<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:03.050> definitely<00:03:03.320> in<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.500> payoff

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
prepared and it's definitely in a payoff

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.230

flaw<00:03:10.730> was<00:03:10.910> not<00:03:11.060> having<00:03:11.390> high<00:03:12.080> enough<00:03:12.290> level

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530

air<00:03:12.680> defense<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.820> think<00:03:14.000> he<00:03:14.060> only<00:03:14.209> had<00:03:14.360> like

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.390 
air defense and I think he only had like
one<00:03:14.780> air<00:03:14.990> defense<00:03:15.260> unit<00:03:15.560> or<00:03:15.800> maybe<00:03:16.220> at<00:03:16.370> a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
one air defense unit or maybe at a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.710 
one air defense unit or maybe at a
second<00:03:16.760> one<00:03:16.880> or<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:17.120> got<00:03:17.360> destroyed

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720
