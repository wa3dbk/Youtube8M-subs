hello fellows it's seven demo seven and
my<00:00:03.870> 350<00:00:04.589> QX<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:05.220> caught<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.819> tree<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.950> one

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
my 350 QX is caught in the tree that one

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.089 
my 350 QX is caught in the tree that one
right<00:00:08.130> up<00:00:08.280> there<00:00:09.440> I've<00:00:10.440> already<00:00:10.769> tried

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
right up there I've already tried

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.249 
right up there I've already tried
hooking<00:00:11.759> my<00:00:12.059> climbing<00:00:12.450> rope<00:00:12.630> up<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.110> some

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
hooking my climbing rope up to some

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.539 
hooking my climbing rope up to some
carabiners<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.799> tossing<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.309> up<00:00:14.370> there

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
carabiners and tossing it up there

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.700 
carabiners and tossing it up there
unfortunately<00:00:15.120> it's<00:00:15.269> pretty<00:00:15.540> high<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.500> was

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
unfortunately it's pretty high and I was

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.460 
unfortunately it's pretty high and I was
never<00:00:16.980> able<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.340> get<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.910> out<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.260> my

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
never able to get it out so here is my

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.130 
never able to get it out so here is my
kit<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.670> I'm<00:00:20.760> hopefully<00:00:21.150> maybe<00:00:21.990> gonna

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
kit that I'm hopefully maybe gonna

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:37.100 
kit that I'm hopefully maybe gonna

I'm<00:00:46.770> planning<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.430> shooting<00:00:48.379> attaching

I'm planning to do is shooting attaching

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.380 
I'm planning to do is shooting attaching
this<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.190> shooting<00:00:50.670> line<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.120> over

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this to this and shooting line up over

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.709 
this to this and shooting line up over
the<00:00:51.480> branch<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.699> once<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> line

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the branch and then once I get the line

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.119 
the branch and then once I get the line
over<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> branch<00:00:55.170> I'm<00:00:55.350> gonna<00:00:55.530> haul<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.949> my

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
over the branch I'm gonna haul up my

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.770 
over the branch I'm gonna haul up my
bigger<00:00:56.460> line<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.210> help<00:00:57.449> pull

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
bigger line so I can actually help pull

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.590 
bigger line so I can actually help pull
the<00:00:58.050> craft<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.579> branch<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.059> which

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the craft out of the the branch so which

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.630 
the craft out of the the branch so which
we<00:01:00.750> look<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.469> put<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> guys<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.309> my<00:01:02.340> vine

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
we look at all put the guys on my vine

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
we look at all put the guys on my vine
blinded<00:01:02.940> by<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> hauling<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.090> climbing<00:01:06.689> rope<00:01:06.900> up

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
blinded by so hauling a climbing rope up

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
blinded by so hauling a climbing rope up
into<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> tree<00:01:07.650> didn't<00:01:08.369> work<00:01:08.580> every<00:01:09.000> time<00:01:09.180> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
into the tree didn't work every time it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
into the tree didn't work every time it
would<00:01:09.540> get<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> branch<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.890> fishing

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
would get up to the branch the fishing

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.359 
would get up to the branch the fishing
line<00:01:11.760> would<00:01:12.060> break<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.920> went<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> different

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
line would break so went to a different

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.600 
line would break so went to a different
plan<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> ended<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.150> shooting<00:01:15.479> about<00:01:16.170> three<00:01:16.860> set

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
plan I ended up shooting about three set

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.870 
plan I ended up shooting about three set
separate<00:01:18.180> lines<00:01:18.420> over<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> branch<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
separate lines over the branch and the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.249 
separate lines over the branch and the
reason<00:01:21.150> why<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.299> had<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.659> three<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> every

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
reason why I had to do three is every

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.719 
reason why I had to do three is every
time<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> would<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.830> one<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.310> start<00:01:23.549> pulling

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
time I would do one and start pulling

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.770 
time I would do one and start pulling
the<00:01:24.380> branch<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.159> lion<00:01:26.970> would<00:01:27.180> break<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the branch and the lion would break so I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.960 
the branch and the lion would break so I
ended<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.020> shooting<00:01:28.290> three<00:01:28.740> over<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
ended up shooting three over and that

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.810 
ended up shooting three over and that
worked<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:31.040> in<00:01:32.040> other<00:01:32.159> words<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.460> was<00:01:32.549> pulling

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
worked so in other words I was pulling

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
worked so in other words I was pulling
on<00:01:32.909> six<00:01:33.240> lines<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.900> start<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> move<00:01:34.470> this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
on six lines to start to move this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.219 
on six lines to start to move this
branch<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.340> pretty<00:01:35.490> thick<00:01:35.729> branch

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
branch and it was pretty thick branch

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.929 
branch and it was pretty thick branch
the<00:01:37.229> quarter<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.680> really<00:01:38.040> stuck<00:01:38.310> badly<00:01:38.790> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the quarter was really stuck badly it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.999 
the quarter was really stuck badly it
was<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.689> landing<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.320> straddling<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
was the landing it was straddling a

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.510 
was the landing it was straddling a
branch<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:46.259> thing<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> note<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.159> when

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
branch so one thing to note is that when

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.730 
branch so one thing to note is that when
you<00:01:47.700> shoot<00:01:48.030> your<00:01:48.299> sinker<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:49.259> line<00:01:49.470> up

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
you shoot your sinker and your line up

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
you shoot your sinker and your line up
over<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.130> branch<00:01:50.399> make<00:01:50.850> sure<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
over a branch make sure you have the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.410 
over a branch make sure you have the
free<00:01:52.020> end<00:01:52.549> attached<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.820> something<00:01:54.030> because

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
free end attached to something because

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.740 
free end attached to something because
otherwise<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:56.040> such<00:01:56.490> they've<00:01:56.880> been<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
otherwise it's such they've been the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.330 
otherwise it's such they've been the
clear<00:01:57.960> line<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.500> won't<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:58.979> where<00:01:59.219> it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
clear line that you won't see where it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.590 
clear line that you won't see where it
goes<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.119> will

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
goes and you will

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.170 
goes and you will
lose<00:02:00.720> it<00:02:00.930> or<00:02:01.409> it'll<00:02:01.740> go<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.220> into<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.580> tree<00:02:02.820> as

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
lose it or it'll go up into the tree as

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.270 
lose it or it'll go up into the tree as
the<00:02:03.509> sinker<00:02:03.900> comes<00:02:04.110> back<00:02:04.320> down<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the sinker comes back down to the the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.390 
the sinker comes back down to the the
earth<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.570> quick<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:07.170> note<00:02:07.200> there
