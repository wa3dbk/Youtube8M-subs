00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
gets off the intimidate and so that's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.670 
gets off the intimidate and so that's
basically<00:01:18.930> give<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.290> big<00:01:19.500> game<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:21.350> band<00:01:22.350> but

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
I still looks like it's going to be a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
I still looks like it's going to be a
solid<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.900> hit<00:01:25.049> KO<00:01:25.259> against<00:01:25.619> him<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.860> top<00:01:26.070> and

thinking<00:02:51.880> well<00:02:52.030> if<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.240> can<00:02:52.390> predict<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.840> ruse

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
thinking well if I can predict the ruse

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260 
thinking well if I can predict the ruse
I<00:02:53.560> might<00:02:53.830> be<00:02:53.860> able<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.340> hit<00:02:54.550> him<00:02:54.700> was<00:02:54.850> on<00:02:55.120> the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
I might be able to hit him was on the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.290 
I might be able to hit him was on the
ground<00:02:55.420> with<00:02:56.320> power<00:02:56.980> whip<00:02:57.280> or<00:02:57.490> earthquake<00:02:58.030> and

ground with power whip or earthquake and

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.700

oh he's<00:03:56.660> probably<00:03:56.900> starved<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:58.010> huggabug<00:03:58.670> is

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
oh he's probably starved so huggabug is

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.300 
oh he's probably starved so huggabug is
taken<00:03:59.180> out<00:03:59.300> that's<00:03:59.690> really<00:03:59.900> it's<00:04:00.590> too<00:04:00.800> bad<00:04:00.950> but

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
taken out that's really it's too bad but

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.370 
taken out that's really it's too bad but
it<00:04:01.670> is<00:04:01.730> what<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:01.970> is<00:04:02.120> i<00:04:02.300> think<00:04:02.900> i<00:04:02.990> can<00:04:03.140> probably

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
it is what it is i think i can probably

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.500 
it is what it is i think i can probably
take<00:04:03.560> one<00:04:03.950> fire<00:04:04.220> blast<00:04:04.580> plus<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:05.060> might<00:04:05.180> miss

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
take one fire blast plus you might miss

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.150 
take one fire blast plus you might miss
or<00:04:05.660> something<00:04:05.900> like<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.020> so<00:04:06.170> goes<00:04:06.920> for<00:04:07.100> the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
or something like that so goes for the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.770 
or something like that so goes for the
Fire<00:04:07.340> Blast<00:04:07.490> I<00:04:07.730> really<00:04:08.000> actually<00:04:08.150> should<00:04:08.660> have

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
Fire Blast I really actually should have

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.990

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
faster so i could go for the sub if i

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.780 
faster so i could go for the sub if i
wanted<00:04:54.530> quick<00:04:54.770> oh<00:04:54.860> i<00:04:54.889> do<00:04:55.010> go<00:04:55.190> for<00:04:55.280> this<00:04:55.370> out<00:04:55.550> how

you guys from a leaf storm actually was
not<00:05:00.470> predicting<00:05:01.040> that<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:02.000> i<00:05:02.180> actually<00:05:02.330> have

not predicting that and i actually have

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.880 
not predicting that and i actually have
enough<00:05:02.750> how<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:02.930> felt<00:05:03.380> that<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.560> could<00:05:03.740> actually

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
enough how I felt that I could actually

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.750 
enough how I felt that I could actually
make<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.280> second<00:05:04.790> son<00:05:05.630> and<00:05:06.010> potentially<00:05:07.010> you

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
make a second son and potentially you

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.150 
make a second son and potentially you
know<00:05:07.880> make<00:05:08.300> enough<00:05:08.540> subs<00:05:08.840> that<00:05:09.110> he<00:05:09.860> couldn't

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
know make enough subs that he couldn't

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.440 
know make enough subs that he couldn't
break<00:05:10.430> them<00:05:10.610> with<00:05:10.729> a<00:05:10.760> leaf<00:05:11.000> storm<00:05:11.210> but<00:05:11.419> I

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
break them with a leaf storm but I

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.790 
break them with a leaf storm but I
really<00:05:11.690> don't<00:05:11.870> want<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.080> screw<00:05:12.470> around<00:05:12.500> with

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
really don't want to screw around with

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.440 
really don't want to screw around with

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
that he might not have a sink powder or

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.140 
that he might not have a sink powder or
mic<00:05:18.800> over<00:05:19.130> something<00:05:19.370> else<00:05:19.490> goes<00:05:19.910> for<00:05:20.090> the

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
mic over something else goes for the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.630 
mic over something else goes for the
earthquake<00:05:20.630> here<00:05:20.900> so<00:05:21.860> it's<00:05:22.010> all<00:05:22.160> its<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.430> mix

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
rocks anyway I hit is not however see

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.860 
rocks anyway I hit is not however see
your<00:05:58.940> effective<00:05:59.210> damage<00:05:59.479> I'm<00:05:59.660> going<00:05:59.810> to

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
your effective damage I'm going to

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.930 
your effective damage I'm going to
predict<00:06:00.229> here<00:06:00.500> i<00:06:00.650> am<00:06:00.979> going<00:06:01.160> to<00:06:01.250> predict<00:06:01.669> him

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
predict here i am going to predict him

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.690 
predict here i am going to predict him
to<00:06:02.120> roost<00:06:02.330> this<00:06:02.539> time<00:06:02.750> so<00:06:03.410> indeed<00:06:03.740> he<00:06:04.220> goes<00:06:04.460> for

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
to roost this time so indeed he goes for

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.029 
to roost this time so indeed he goes for
the<00:06:04.789> roofs<00:06:05.060> and<00:06:05.390> so<00:06:05.810> I<00:06:05.960> instead<00:06:06.620> of<00:06:06.710> going<00:06:07.010> for

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
the roofs and so I instead of going for

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.529 
the roofs and so I instead of going for
the<00:06:07.280> hidden<00:06:07.580> power<00:06:07.849> eyes<00:06:08.030> which<00:06:08.180> would<00:06:08.390> do

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
the hidden power eyes which would do

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:11.260 
the hidden power eyes which would do
absolutely<00:06:09.320> nothing<00:06:09.740> I<00:06:10.159> am<00:06:10.550> going<00:06:10.729> to<00:06:10.820> go<00:06:11.030> for

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
absolutely nothing I am going to go for

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.870 
absolutely nothing I am going to go for
the<00:06:11.300> freaking<00:06:11.780> power<00:06:12.020> went<00:06:12.349> BAM<00:06:13.159> and<00:06:13.550> on<00:06:13.640> oh

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
the freaking power went BAM and on oh

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.460 
the freaking power went BAM and on oh
yeah<00:06:14.150> look<00:06:14.300> at<00:06:14.419> that<00:06:14.450> health<00:06:14.750> drop<00:06:15.050> he

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
yeah look at that health drop he

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.860 
yeah look at that health drop he
survives<00:06:16.010> but<00:06:16.280> with<00:06:16.460> not<00:06:16.729> that<00:06:16.970> much<00:06:17.210> HP<00:06:17.479> and

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
survives but with not that much HP and

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.420 
survives but with not that much HP and
actually<00:06:18.200> that<00:06:18.349> range<00:06:18.620> of<00:06:18.740> health<00:06:18.860> I'm

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
actually that range of health I'm

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.070 
actually that range of health I'm
thinking<00:06:19.760> if<00:06:20.060> I<00:06:20.150> hit<00:06:20.330> him<00:06:20.390> with<00:06:20.539> another<00:06:20.570> power

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
thinking if I hit him with another power

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.740 
thinking if I hit him with another power
yet<00:06:21.500> if<00:06:21.590> he's<00:06:21.710> in<00:06:21.860> the<00:06:21.979> air<00:06:22.159> I<00:06:22.460> can<00:06:23.030> probably<00:06:23.390> KO

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
yet if he's in the air I can probably KO

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.860 
yet if he's in the air I can probably KO
now<00:06:24.050> colored<00:06:24.380> has<00:06:24.710> awful<00:06:25.250> accuracy<00:06:25.849> and<00:06:26.030> you

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
now colored has awful accuracy and you

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.940 
now colored has awful accuracy and you
know<00:06:26.960> there's<00:06:27.140> a<00:06:27.200> good<00:06:27.409> chance<00:06:27.680> that<00:06:27.830> one<00:06:27.919> of

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
know there's a good chance that one of

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.050 
know there's a good chance that one of
my<00:06:28.039> power<00:06:28.280> ups<00:06:28.460> is<00:06:28.550> going<00:06:28.700> to<00:06:28.760> miss<00:06:28.880> but<00:06:29.000> I

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
my power ups is going to miss but I

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.120 
my power ups is going to miss but I
didn't<00:06:29.390> want<00:06:29.419> you<00:06:29.690> know<00:06:29.900> earthquake<00:06:30.380> has<00:06:30.560> far

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
didn't want you know earthquake has far

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.860 
didn't want you know earthquake has far
less<00:06:31.159> power<00:06:31.640> considering<00:06:32.240> its<00:06:32.330> non<00:06:32.539> stabbed

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
less power considering its non stabbed

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.270 
less power considering its non stabbed
and<00:06:33.320> I<00:06:33.470> just<00:06:33.620> didn't<00:06:33.770> want<00:06:33.950> to<00:06:34.010> screw<00:06:34.190> around

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
and I just didn't want to screw around

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.790 
and I just didn't want to screw around
but<00:06:34.550> I<00:06:34.669> go<00:06:35.000> for<00:06:35.300> the<00:06:35.330> second<00:06:35.900> power<00:06:36.050> would<00:06:36.289> take

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
but I go for the second power would take

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.860 
but I go for the second power would take
out<00:06:36.979> his<00:06:37.099> knock<00:06:37.340> towel<00:06:37.640> and<00:06:37.970> I<00:06:38.270> am<00:06:38.390> a<00:06:38.419> happy

hidden<00:06:52.340> power<00:06:52.550> ice<00:06:52.760> but<00:06:53.720> you<00:06:53.930> know<00:06:54.050> I'm<00:06:54.169> not

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 
hidden power ice but you know I'm not

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.159 
hidden power ice but you know I'm not
really<00:06:55.030> steering<00:06:56.030> too<00:06:56.150> much<00:06:56.300> he<00:06:56.450> does<00:06:56.570> have<00:06:56.780> it

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
really steering too much he does have it

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.570 
really steering too much he does have it
does<00:06:57.380> actually<00:06:57.500> do<00:06:57.770> a<00:06:57.800> fair<00:06:58.070> amount<00:06:58.099> of<00:06:58.340> damage

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
does actually do a fair amount of damage

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.279 
does actually do a fair amount of damage
ice<00:06:58.700> that<00:06:58.909> was<00:06:59.030> the<00:06:59.419> hidden<00:06:59.630> power<00:06:59.780> fire<00:07:00.020> ice

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
ice that was the hidden power fire ice

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.839 
ice that was the hidden power fire ice
I'm<00:07:00.800> actually<00:07:00.950> going<00:07:01.159> to<00:07:01.250> say<00:07:01.640> it<00:07:01.729> was

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:01.849 
I'm actually going to say it was

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:03.070 
I'm actually going to say it was
probably<00:07:01.970> hidden<00:07:02.300> power<00:07:02.510> fire<00:07:02.750> because

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
probably hidden power fire because

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.510 
probably hidden power fire because
that's<00:07:03.200> poor<00:07:03.380> comment<00:07:03.770> on<00:07:03.830> can<00:07:04.039> grow<00:07:04.250> these

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
that's poor comment on can grow these

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.089 
that's poor comment on can grow these
days<00:07:04.990> but<00:07:05.990> you<00:07:06.229> know<00:07:06.349> i'm<00:07:06.560> thinking<00:07:06.890> i'm<00:07:06.950> just

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:07.099 
days but you know i'm thinking i'm just

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:08.469 
days but you know i'm thinking i'm just
going<00:07:07.250> to<00:07:07.280> stay<00:07:07.430> and<00:07:07.669> see<00:07:07.880> what<00:07:08.030> he's<00:07:08.120> gonna<00:07:08.270> do

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
going to stay and see what he's gonna do

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.870 
going to stay and see what he's gonna do
this<00:07:09.050> for<00:07:09.229> the<00:07:09.289> second<00:07:09.620> hidden<00:07:09.770> power<00:07:10.039> it's

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
this for the second hidden power it's

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.399 
this for the second hidden power it's
going<00:07:11.030> to<00:07:11.090> do<00:07:11.180> a<00:07:11.210> lot<00:07:11.599> of<00:07:11.630> damage<00:07:11.930> i'm<00:07:12.229> down<00:07:12.380> to

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:12.409 
going to do a lot of damage i'm down to

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:14.589 
going to do a lot of damage i'm down to
107<00:07:12.979> and<00:07:13.250> I<00:07:13.340> wake<00:07:13.550> up<00:07:13.580> this<00:07:13.880> turn<00:07:14.120> and<00:07:14.150> go<00:07:14.419> from

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 
107 and I wake up this turn and go from

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:16.390 
107 and I wake up this turn and go from
my<00:07:14.720> own<00:07:14.870> heavy<00:07:15.200> power<00:07:15.470> that's<00:07:16.130> going<00:07:16.250> to<00:07:16.370> be

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 
my own heavy power that's going to be

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.770 
my own heavy power that's going to be
super<00:07:16.610> affected<00:07:17.090> and<00:07:17.270> I<00:07:17.300> don't<00:07:17.479> think<00:07:17.539> he<00:07:17.690> has

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
super affected and I don't think he has

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.140 
super affected and I don't think he has
any<00:07:17.990> investment<00:07:18.500> is<00:07:18.590> special<00:07:19.070> attack<00:07:19.460> or<00:07:19.880> so<00:07:20.120> I
