00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello everybody with thiago sodré do forró 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.520
 this broccoli rice recipe is 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.379
 perfect to serve with that 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.670
 weekend barbecue and show 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.280
 for everyone you know how to do 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.799
 much more than plain white rice 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.780
 I'm going to use a broccoli head here. 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.850
 but if you want you can use the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.160
 American who also works out 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.449
 begin by preparing the larger stems and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:31.220
 leaves then cut into pieces 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.220
 and put in a pan 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.219
 cut the thickest tips of stems and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.219
 put in the pan too 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.660
 add four cups of water 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.660
 I'm using four cups of water 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.329
 because they will make two cups of rice and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.420
 take the pot to a high heat 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.940
 for ten minutes 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:04.559
 now the florets of the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:07.619
 broccoli bring another pan over medium heat 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.810
 and add a little olive oil when you 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.650
 is hot put half onion 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.350
 chop and sauté a little 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.350
 add 2 cloves of garlic and saute more 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.259
 now I'll put the two cups of 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.420
 rice 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.070
 sauté a little and very carefully and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.140
 with the aid of a sieve 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.409
 I'll put the broccoli water to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.930
 cook the rice 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.200
 add a teaspoon of salt and stir 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.140
 some put the cap but not 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.329
 completely capping down the fire 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.759
 to the minimum and cook for 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.520
 12 to 15 minutes 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.060
 time will check if the water already 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.510
 dry in the bottom turn off the heat and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.850
 add the explained one 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.550
 if you want you can also use the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.560
 broccoli that suffered in the other pan 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.500
 stay well and put together 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.660
 stir well and leave the pan covered until the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.900
 time to serve 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.490
 It looks like it was a delight 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.770
 Good appetite and then you liked it because how is it? 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.270

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.400
