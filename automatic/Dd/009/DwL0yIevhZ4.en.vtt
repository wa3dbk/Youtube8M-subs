00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:39.990 

yeah<00:00:00.650> and<00:00:01.669> it's<00:00:02.669> in<00:00:10.670> operation<00:00:11.670> Heuer<00:00:12.450> okay

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.950 

they<00:00:41.000> don't<00:00:41.180> leave<00:00:41.329> this<00:00:41.510> works

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
they don't leave this works

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.090 
they don't leave this works
these<00:00:42.530> were<00:00:43.840> okay

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
these were okay

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.979 
these were okay
there's<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.760> output<00:00:47.120> from<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.540> primeSense

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
there's the output from the primeSense

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:56.920 
there's the output from the primeSense
sensor<00:00:48.580> and<00:00:53.260> okay<00:00:54.280> so<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.820> got<00:00:56.629> this<00:00:56.720> neat

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
sensor and okay so I got this neat

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.049 
sensor and okay so I got this neat
control<00:00:57.290> panel<00:00:57.620> just<00:00:57.650> to<00:00:58.010> talk<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.519> Hale

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
control panel just to talk to Hale

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.950 
control panel just to talk to Hale
motion<00:01:00.730> I've<00:01:01.730> got<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.940> program<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:02.690> one

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
motion I've got a program that in one

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.740 
motion I've got a program that in one
thread<00:01:03.260> is<00:01:03.759> sitting<00:01:04.759> here<00:01:04.940> hammering<00:01:05.509> the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
thread is sitting here hammering the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.890 
thread is sitting here hammering the
sensor<00:01:06.200> getting<00:01:06.940> all<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.119> skeleton<00:01:08.509> data<00:01:08.690> if

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
sensor getting all the skeleton data if

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.050 
sensor getting all the skeleton data if
it<00:01:09.020> exists<00:01:09.440> and<00:01:09.830> then<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.340> have<00:01:10.490> another<00:01:10.610> thread

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
it exists and then I have another thread

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.880 
it exists and then I have another thread
that<00:01:11.300> it's<00:01:11.479> connected<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:11.899> a<00:01:11.990> lotion<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.770> it's

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
that it's connected to a lotion and it's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.590 
that it's connected to a lotion and it's
just<00:01:13.039> sending<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.550> bunch<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:13.850> commands<00:01:14.210> based

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
just sending a bunch of commands based

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.420 
just sending a bunch of commands based
on<00:01:14.899> my<00:01:15.890> body's<00:01:16.220> position<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.590> so<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:19.280> can<00:01:20.240> first

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
on my body's position and so I can first

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:32.790 
on my body's position and so I can first
turn<00:01:22.430> this<00:01:22.640> stiffness<00:01:22.970> on

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.940 

goto<00:01:33.400> mean<00:01:33.700> opposed<00:01:34.680> okay

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
goto mean opposed okay

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.270 
goto mean opposed okay
no<00:01:36.790> wait<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.720> trick<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.230> I<00:01:38.530> gotta<00:01:38.920> move<00:01:39.100> from

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
no wait the trick is I gotta move from

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.710 
no wait the trick is I gotta move from
here<00:01:39.550> but<00:01:39.730> I<00:01:39.760> don't<00:01:39.970> want<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.270> skeleton

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
here but I don't want the skeleton

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.570 
here but I don't want the skeleton
tracker<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.170> get<00:01:41.350> in<00:01:41.470> yet

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.650 

so<00:01:45.580> then<00:01:48.330> okay<00:01:49.330> so<00:01:50.110> now<00:01:50.950> he's<00:01:51.310> just<00:01:51.660> watching

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
so then okay so now he's just watching

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.690 
so then okay so now he's just watching
my<00:01:52.750> hands<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.410> little<00:01:53.680> bit<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:57.430> just

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
my hands a little bit and it's just

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.870 
my hands a little bit and it's just
puppetry<00:01:58.620> it's<00:01:59.620> really<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.310> just<00:02:00.610> glued<00:02:00.880> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
puppetry it's really I just glued the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.520 
puppetry it's really I just glued the
excuse<00:02:03.880> me<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.470> might<00:02:05.470> in<00:02:05.620> a<00:02:05.650> moment<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:07.030> know

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
excuse me I might in a moment you know

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.390 
excuse me I might in a moment you know
really<00:02:08.530> it's<00:02:08.680> just<00:02:09.070> gluing<00:02:09.730> the<00:02:10.000> skeleton<00:02:10.570> API

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
really it's just gluing the skeleton API

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.530 
really it's just gluing the skeleton API
into<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.910> mauki<00:02:13.690> API<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:15.030> from<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.150> Kinect<00:02:16.420> I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
into the mauki API and from the Kinect I

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.020 
into the mauki API and from the Kinect I
get<00:02:16.780> some<00:02:17.140> XYZ<00:02:17.530> coordinates<00:02:18.460> of<00:02:18.610> all<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.820> body

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
get some XYZ coordinates of all the body

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.590 
get some XYZ coordinates of all the body
parts<00:02:22.590> okay<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.620> get<00:02:23.860> XYZ<00:02:24.370> coordinates<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.450> get

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
parts okay I get XYZ coordinates you get

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.050 
parts okay I get XYZ coordinates you get
rotations<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.470> joints<00:02:26.890> too<00:02:27.070> but<00:02:27.820> it's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
rotations of the joints too but it's

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.720 
rotations of the joints too but it's
actually<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:29.650> very<00:02:29.710> useful<00:02:29.980> for<00:02:30.370> directly

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
actually not very useful for directly

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.610 
actually not very useful for directly
going<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.240> robot<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:32.110> rotational

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
going to the robot the rotational

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.350 
going to the robot the rotational
information<00:02:33.070> from<00:02:33.310> open-eyed<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.120> really

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
information from open-eyed is really

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.830 
information from open-eyed is really
really<00:02:34.810> bad<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.640> took<00:02:36.790> these<00:02:37.239> XYZ

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
really bad and so I took these XYZ

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.000 
really bad and so I took these XYZ
coordinates<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.470> did<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> bunch<00:02:38.860> of

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
coordinates and I did a bunch of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.670 
coordinates and I did a bunch of
trigonometric<00:02:39.400> tricks<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.900> took<00:02:41.500> this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
trigonometric tricks like I took this

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.030 
trigonometric tricks like I took this
XYZ<00:02:42.100> this<00:02:42.430> XYZ<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:43.239> XYZ<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.020> mean<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.770> vector

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
XYZ this XYZ this XYZ I mean it vector

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.949 
XYZ this XYZ this XYZ I mean it vector
going<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.459> way<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:46.270> actually<00:02:46.600> going<00:02:46.660> that

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
going that way of actually going that

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.030 
going that way of actually going that
way<00:02:47.140> then<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:48.250> take<00:02:48.489> Tata<00:02:49.180> connectors<00:02:50.040> do

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
way then you take Tata connectors do

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.070 
way then you take Tata connectors do
inverse<00:02:51.520> cosine<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.630> gives<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.930> the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
inverse cosine and it gives you the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.170 
inverse cosine and it gives you the
inner<00:02:53.230> angle<00:02:53.709> then<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.250> just<00:02:54.459> take<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.820> angle

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
inner angle then I just take that angle

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.710 
inner angle then I just take that angle
and<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.570> extend<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.739> motion<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.670> make<00:02:57.970> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.680 

elbow<00:03:01.720> joint<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:04.270> have<00:03:04.570> some

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
elbow joint do that and I have some

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.270 
elbow joint do that and I have some
primers<00:03:04.959> like<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.260> can<00:03:05.410> see<00:03:05.590> he's<00:03:05.830> kind<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:06.250> um

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
primers like you can see he's kind of um

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:22.410 
primers like you can see he's kind of um
shake<00:03:09.280> he's<00:03:09.430> kind<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.760> smooth<00:03:09.970> he's<00:03:10.480> um

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.970 

don't<00:03:22.900> move<00:03:23.050> akin<00:03:23.410> or<00:03:23.680> tracking<00:03:24.459> you

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.080 

I<00:03:28.010> see<00:03:28.879> you<00:03:29.060> interests<00:03:29.569> are<00:03:29.810> taking<00:03:30.140> control

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
I see you interests are taking control

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.330 
I see you interests are taking control
so<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.120> can<00:03:32.480> let's<00:03:33.230> make<00:03:33.409> it<00:03:33.440> dangerous<00:03:33.769> I'll

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
so I can let's make it dangerous I'll

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.860 
so I can let's make it dangerous I'll
read<00:03:34.940> motor<00:03:35.269> speed<00:03:35.629> was<00:03:36.530> at<00:03:36.799> 0.7<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.670> can<00:03:38.629> go

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
read motor speed was at 0.7 I can go

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.440 
read motor speed was at 0.7 I can go
make<00:03:39.379> motor<00:03:39.680> speed<00:03:40.010> full<00:03:40.250> speed<00:03:41.409> and<00:03:45.430> first

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
make motor speed full speed and first

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.729 
make motor speed full speed and first
I'm<00:03:47.450> taking<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.900> connected<00:03:48.319> at<00:03:48.410> 30<00:03:48.590> frames

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
I'm taking the connected at 30 frames

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.830 
I'm taking the connected at 30 frames
per<00:03:48.950> second<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:49.910> was<00:03:50.030> smoothing<00:03:50.510> eight<00:03:50.690> out

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
per second and I was smoothing eight out

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.369 
per second and I was smoothing eight out
of<00:03:50.870> every<00:03:51.019> 30<00:03:51.410> frames<00:03:52.599> so<00:03:53.599> that<00:03:53.780> already<00:03:54.049> meant

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
of every 30 frames so that already meant

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.500 
of every 30 frames so that already meant
that<00:03:54.739> he<00:03:55.370> was<00:03:55.489> experiencing<00:03:56.000> about<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.239> third

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
that he was experiencing about a third

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.160 
that he was experiencing about a third
second<00:03:56.959> delay<00:03:58.329> saw<00:03:59.329> he<00:03:59.450> was<00:03:59.569> maybe<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.959> little

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
second delay saw he was maybe a little

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.390 
second delay saw he was maybe a little
jerky<00:04:00.680> if<00:04:01.370> we<00:04:02.019> smooth<00:04:03.019> in<00:04:03.260> let's<00:04:03.709> say<00:04:03.890> almost<00:04:04.160> a

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
jerky if we smooth in let's say almost a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.509 
jerky if we smooth in let's say almost a
second<00:04:04.760> two<00:04:04.849> frames<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:06.379> lower<00:04:07.040> his<00:04:07.280> feet

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
second two frames and I lower his feet

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:17.020 
second two frames and I lower his feet
down<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:07.760> 0.5<00:04:08.299> or<00:04:08.450> so<00:04:10.150> let's<00:04:11.150> see<00:04:11.329> if<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:15.789> know<00:04:16.789> is

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
down to 0.5 or so let's see if I know is

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.600 
down to 0.5 or so let's see if I know is
it<00:04:17.150> smoother<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:18.489> don't<00:04:19.489> know<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:20.380> think<00:04:21.380> so<00:04:21.610> yeah

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
it smoother I don't know I think so yeah

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.790 
it smoother I don't know I think so yeah
I<00:04:22.639> guess<00:04:22.850> it's<00:04:23.000> what<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.389> shaking<00:04:23.720> less<00:04:23.870> but

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
I guess it's what I is shaking less but

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.379 
I guess it's what I is shaking less but
I<00:04:25.130> don't<00:04:25.370> like<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.669> run<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:25.910> that<00:04:26.030> way<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.180> like

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
I don't like to run it that way I like

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.040 
I don't like to run it that way I like
to<00:04:26.510> run<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:26.810> really<00:04:27.320> dangerous<00:04:28.600> nice<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.840> real

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
to run it really dangerous nice and real

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.680 
to run it really dangerous nice and real
time<00:04:32.889> back<00:04:33.889> in<00:04:34.039> the<00:04:34.070> day<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.310> about<00:04:35.240> a<00:04:35.300> year<00:04:35.510> ago

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
time back in the day I about a year ago

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.230 
time back in the day I about a year ago
I<00:04:35.720> didn't<00:04:36.080> dance<00:04:36.229> with<00:04:36.440> this<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:38.560> I<00:04:40.240> needed

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
I didn't dance with this and I I needed

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.450 
I didn't dance with this and I I needed
to<00:04:41.389> react<00:04:41.599> as<00:04:41.750> fast<00:04:41.780> as<00:04:42.200> possible<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:42.950> smooth

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
to react as fast as possible so I smooth

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.190 
to react as fast as possible so I smooth
no<00:04:43.669> frames<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.270> send<00:04:44.479> every<00:04:44.720> frame<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.080> the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
no frames I send every frame to the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.600 
no frames I send every frame to the
robot<00:04:45.530> as<00:04:45.680> quickly<00:04:45.919> as<00:04:46.099> possible<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:47.650> I<00:04:48.650> do<00:04:49.580> it

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
robot as quickly as possible and I do it

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:58.429 
robot as quickly as possible and I do it
at<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.940> maximum<00:04:50.510> speed<00:04:51.669> so<00:04:52.669> I<00:04:53.620> need

00:04:58.429 --> 00:04:58.439 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.459 

yeah<00:04:59.520> and<00:05:00.659> I'm<00:05:01.659> gonna<00:05:01.840> enable<00:05:02.050> this<00:05:02.319> other

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
yeah and I'm gonna enable this other

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.790 
yeah and I'm gonna enable this other
thing<00:05:02.710> here<00:05:02.860> at<00:05:02.949> this<00:05:03.069> enable<00:05:03.610> leg<00:05:03.849> movement

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
thing here at this enable leg movement

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.140 
thing here at this enable leg movement
that's<00:05:05.800> not<00:05:06.009> enabled<00:05:06.400> by<00:05:06.430> default<00:05:08.819> but<00:05:09.819> if<00:05:09.999> I

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
that's not enabled by default but if I

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.559 
that's not enabled by default but if I
decide<00:05:10.449> to<00:05:10.479> go<00:05:10.659> up<00:05:10.840> really<00:05:11.259> quick<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:15.729> would

decide to go up really quick I would
recommend<00:05:16.990> this<00:05:17.050> on<00:05:17.229> your<00:05:17.439> robot<00:05:17.800> you<00:05:18.430> have<00:05:18.580> a

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
recommend this on your robot you have a

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.090
