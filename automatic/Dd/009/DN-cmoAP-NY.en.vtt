00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
hello and welcome to a quick ticket

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.030 
hello and welcome to a quick ticket
build<00:00:42.820> up<00:00:43.240> early<00:00:44.080> today<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.380> had<00:00:44.770> a<00:00:44.800> random

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
build up early today I had a random

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.550 
build up early today I had a random
thought<00:00:45.370> what<00:00:46.240> if<00:00:46.390> I<00:00:46.480> built<00:00:46.720> a<00:00:46.870> tnt<00:00:47.530> cannon

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
thought what if I built a tnt cannon

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.710 
thought what if I built a tnt cannon
that<00:00:48.190> could<00:00:49.500> fire<00:00:50.500> repeatedly<00:00:51.390> load<00:00:52.390> its<00:00:52.570> own

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
that could fire repeatedly load its own

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.049 
that could fire repeatedly load its own
tnt<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:54.030> build<00:00:55.030> its<00:00:55.239> own<00:00:55.360> tnt<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.860> here<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:57.940> is

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
tnt and build its own tnt so here it is

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.910 
tnt and build its own tnt so here it is
also<00:00:58.900> i<00:00:59.050> tried<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.380> make<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.559> as<00:00:59.770> much<00:01:00.100> as<00:01:00.130> a<00:01:00.430> on

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
also i tried to make it as much as a on

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.049 
also i tried to make it as much as a on
renewable<00:01:02.920> sources<00:01:03.340> so<00:01:03.580> it<00:01:03.670> wouldn't<00:01:03.879> have<00:01:03.970> to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
renewable sources so it wouldn't have to

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.330 
renewable sources so it wouldn't have to
have<00:01:04.180> fuel<00:01:04.420> anything<00:01:04.809> so<00:01:05.050> there's<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.130> quick

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
have fuel anything so there's a quick

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.990 
have fuel anything so there's a quick
over<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:06.790> view<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.690> course<00:01:07.930> solar<00:01:08.830> panels<00:01:09.130> to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
over you view of course solar panels to

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.060 
over you view of course solar panels to

this part because or don't work for what
I<00:01:29.920> have<00:01:30.250> set<00:01:30.640> up<00:01:30.759> which<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.210> energy<00:01:31.750> condensers

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
I have set up which is energy condensers

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.109 
I have set up which is energy condensers
but<00:01:33.009> dust<00:01:33.250> does<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:36.009> what<00:01:36.160> I<00:01:36.190> have<00:01:36.430> is<00:01:36.460> all<00:01:36.940> this

but dust does so what I have is all this

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.850 
but dust does so what I have is all this

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
resources and if I want to make a

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.940 
resources and if I want to make a
cobblestone<00:01:39.550> generator<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:41.050> feed<00:01:41.500> constant

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
cobblestone generator to feed constant

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
power into my tent II builder which is

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.250 
power into my tent II builder which is
pretty<00:01:44.890> simple<00:01:45.159> have<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.060> energy<00:01:46.780> condenser

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
pretty simple have a energy condenser

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.330 
pretty simple have a energy condenser
making<00:01:47.979> sand<00:01:48.490> which<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.770> ways<00:01:50.950> but

and then making gunpowder of course we
have<00:01:55.330> our<00:01:55.680> automated<00:01:58.140> machine<00:01:59.140> here<00:01:59.440> how<00:01:59.560> did

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
have our automated machine here how did

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.649 
have our automated machine here how did
glow<00:01:59.979> just<00:02:00.010> get<00:02:00.430> in<00:02:00.549> there<00:02:03.060> well<00:02:04.060> anyways<00:02:04.479> I'm

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
glow just get in there well anyways I'm

glow just get in there well anyways I'm
the<00:02:04.780> nice<00:02:04.960> thing<00:02:05.260> is<00:02:06.299> using<00:02:07.299> these<00:02:07.450> uh<00:02:07.510> tubes

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
the nice thing is using these uh tubes

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.340 
the nice thing is using these uh tubes
here<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.799> if<00:02:09.040> anything<00:02:09.700> fills<00:02:10.030> up<00:02:10.269> like<00:02:10.600> I'll

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
here is if anything fills up like I'll

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.130 
here is if anything fills up like I'll
show<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.620> up<00:02:11.739> there<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.370> stops<00:02:12.820> pumping<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:14.049> it

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
show you up there it stops pumping so it

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.380 
show you up there it stops pumping so it
won't<00:02:14.350> overfill<00:02:14.920> like<00:02:15.190> these<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> standard

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
won't overfill like these a standard

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.229 
won't overfill like these a standard
pipe<00:02:16.600> will<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.830> anyways<00:02:18.130> as<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.790> can<00:02:19.090> see

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
pipe will so anyways as you can see

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.180 
pipe will so anyways as you can see
there's<00:02:19.540> now<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.410> course<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.830> know<00:02:20.890> dust

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
there's now the course you know dust

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.520 
there's now the course you know dust
coming<00:02:21.459> out<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.600> have<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.959> dust<00:02:23.170> feeding

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
coming out and I have the dust feeding

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.850 
coming out and I have the dust feeding
the<00:02:23.680> more<00:02:23.980> expensive<00:02:24.299> gunpowder<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.590> again

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
the more expensive gunpowder so again

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.550 
the more expensive gunpowder so again
feeds<00:02:27.850> into<00:02:28.060> these<00:02:28.360> tubes<00:02:28.780> which<00:02:29.410> is

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
feeds into these tubes which is

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.430 
feeds into these tubes which is
currently<00:02:29.739> powered<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.660> feeding<00:02:31.660> up<00:02:32.080> there

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
currently powered on feeding up there

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.990 
currently powered on feeding up there
which<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.650> completely<00:02:33.190> full<00:02:33.400> at<00:02:33.549> this<00:02:33.670> point

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
which is completely full at this point

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.120 
which is completely full at this point
so<00:02:34.330> that's<00:02:34.660> why<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.620> these<00:02:35.739> tubes<00:02:36.040> they

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
so that's why I like these tubes they

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.710 
so that's why I like these tubes they
don't<00:02:36.450> overflow<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:39.329> doubt<00:02:40.329> I<00:02:40.360> could<00:02:40.450> ever

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
don't overflow so I doubt I could ever

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.350 
don't overflow so I doubt I could ever
fill<00:02:41.019> up<00:02:41.170> all<00:02:41.380> these<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:44.200> actually<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:46.120> keep

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
fill up all these and actually just keep

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.000 
fill up all these and actually just keep
things<00:02:46.660> simple<00:02:46.840> keep<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.590> daylight

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
things simple keep it daylight

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.220 
things simple keep it daylight
so<00:02:49.790> again<00:02:50.000> that's<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.299> basic<00:02:50.629> setup<00:02:50.989> just

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
so again that's the basic setup just

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.460 
so again that's the basic setup just
turning<00:02:51.920> resources<00:02:52.519> into<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:53.170> drop<00:02:54.170> them<00:02:54.349> in

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
turning resources into to drop them in

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.210 
turning resources into to drop them in
TNT<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.760> now<00:02:56.349> we<00:02:57.349> take<00:02:57.530> them<00:02:57.650> up<00:02:57.829> here<00:02:58.040> where

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
TNT and now we take them up here where

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.080 
TNT and now we take them up here where
it<00:02:58.340> loads<00:02:58.700> into<00:02:59.890> these<00:03:00.890> deployers<00:03:03.939> which<00:03:04.939> is

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
it loads into these deployers which is

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.750 
it loads into these deployers which is
completely<00:03:05.629> full<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.140> let<00:03:07.129> me<00:03:07.250> go<00:03:07.370> around<00:03:07.640> to

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
completely full and let me go around to

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.380 
completely full and let me go around to
show<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:09.310> some<00:03:10.310> reason<00:03:10.579> they<00:03:10.670> drop<00:03:10.909> two

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
show you some reason they drop two

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.839 
show you some reason they drop two
spaces<00:03:12.049> down<00:03:12.409> so<00:03:12.890> they<00:03:13.040> end<00:03:13.220> up<00:03:13.370> right<00:03:13.670> here

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
spaces down so they end up right here

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.130 
spaces down so they end up right here
and<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:15.440> course<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:15.799> line<00:03:16.540> no<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.810> had<00:03:18.049> it

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
and of course this line no I had it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.190 
and of course this line no I had it
wrong<00:03:18.260> anyways<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:19.450> powered<00:03:20.450> by<00:03:20.480> redstone<00:03:20.959> so

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
wrong anyways is powered by redstone so

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.869 
wrong anyways is powered by redstone so
as<00:03:21.290> soon<00:03:21.379> as<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.620> lands<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.129> drops<00:03:22.549> down<00:03:22.700> into

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
as soon as it lands it drops down into

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.259 
as soon as it lands it drops down into
the<00:03:23.720> property<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.319> he<00:03:24.470> cannon<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.819> let<00:03:26.239> me

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
the property and he cannon so let me

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.039 
the property and he cannon so let me
show<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:26.720> thing<00:03:26.870> in<00:03:27.019> action<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.930> have

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
show you this thing in action just have

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.500 
show you this thing in action just have
the<00:03:30.370> inverted<00:03:31.370> there<00:03:31.519> just<00:03:31.730> because<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.329> was

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
the inverted there just because I was

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.660 
the inverted there just because I was
having<00:03:32.629> issue<00:03:32.989> having<00:03:33.859> that<00:03:33.889> last<00:03:34.250> one<00:03:34.430> fire

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
having issue having that last one fire

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.800 
having issue having that last one fire
all<00:03:34.909> the<00:03:35.030> time<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:37.150> have<00:03:38.150> this<00:03:38.329> set<00:03:38.540> on<00:03:38.659> the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
all the time so have this set on the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.099 
all the time so have this set on the
minute<00:03:39.799> delay<00:03:40.099> i<00:03:40.129> could<00:03:40.400> actually<00:03:41.109> probably

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
minute delay i could actually probably

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.509 
minute delay i could actually probably
have<00:03:42.379> it<00:03:42.470> faster<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:44.269> there<00:03:44.510> we<00:03:44.659> go<00:03:45.519> let's

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
have it faster but so there we go let's

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:54.599 
have it faster but so there we go let's
see<00:03:46.639> if<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.819> works<00:03:47.379> there<00:03:48.379> we<00:03:48.620> go<00:03:52.299> perfect<00:03:53.299> and

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
see if it works there we go perfect and

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:03.339 
see if it works there we go perfect and
see<00:03:55.609> if<00:03:55.669> we<00:03:55.760> get<00:03:55.879> two<00:03:56.120> rounds<00:03:56.419> in<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.569> row<00:04:01.389> and<00:04:02.389> as

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
see if we get two rounds in a row and as

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.949 
see if we get two rounds in a row and as
that's<00:04:03.650> emptying<00:04:04.099> up<00:04:04.540> resources<00:04:05.540> are<00:04:05.660> coming

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
that's emptying up resources are coming

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.250 
that's emptying up resources are coming
up<00:04:06.049> from<00:04:06.169> the<00:04:06.260> bottom<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.970> refill

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.979 

there<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.189> go<00:04:14.760> now<00:04:15.760> because<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.389> time<00:04:16.660> I'd

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
there you go now because of the time I'd

likes<00:04:25.449> it<00:04:25.600> just<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.810> simple<00:04:25.930> idea<00:04:26.139> I<00:04:26.290> wanted<00:04:26.530> to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
likes it just a simple idea I wanted to

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.090 
likes it just a simple idea I wanted to
see<00:04:26.740> if<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.780> look<00:04:28.990> at<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.229> all<00:04:29.560> going<00:04:29.949> back

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
see if and look at that all going back

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.860 
see if and look at that all going back
because<00:04:30.190> it's<00:04:30.430> already<00:04:32.760> so<00:04:33.760> in<00:04:34.030> theory<00:04:34.630> this

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
because it's already so in theory this

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.460 
because it's already so in theory this
can<00:04:35.139> go<00:04:35.289> on<00:04:35.320> until<00:04:35.949> those<00:04:36.100> quarries<00:04:36.639> are<00:04:36.789> empty

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
can go on until those quarries are empty

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.020 
can go on until those quarries are empty
at<00:04:38.470> which<00:04:38.770> point<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.520> said<00:04:39.699> unless<00:04:39.910> I

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
at which point and like said unless I

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.350 
at which point and like said unless I
have<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.210> cobblestone<00:04:40.630> generator<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:43.150> thing

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
have a cobblestone generator this thing

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.500 
have a cobblestone generator this thing
could<00:04:43.539> pretty<00:04:43.780> much<00:04:43.840> go<00:04:44.139> on<00:04:44.320> forever<00:04:45.150> but<00:04:46.150> the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
could pretty much go on forever but the

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.990 
could pretty much go on forever but the
problem<00:04:46.690> is<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:47.050> course<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.440> ratio<00:04:47.919> of<00:04:47.979> them

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.730 

all<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.090> way<00:04:52.180> there<00:04:52.300> of<00:04:52.570> how<00:04:53.169> much<00:04:53.320> it<00:04:53.500> costs

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
all the way there of how much it costs

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.129 
all the way there of how much it costs
to<00:04:53.800> make<00:04:54.010> gunpowder<00:04:54.250> vs<00:04:54.880> san<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:55.479> if<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:55.990> was

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
to make gunpowder vs san so if I was

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.629 
to make gunpowder vs san so if I was
doing<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:56.440> cobblestone<00:04:56.770> generator<00:04:56.919> separate

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
doing a cobblestone generator separate

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.260 
doing a cobblestone generator separate
buy<00:04:57.789> a<00:04:58.949> diamond<00:04:59.949> stone<00:05:00.280> pipe<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.910> have<00:05:01.030> more

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
buy a diamond stone pipe and have more

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.300 
buy a diamond stone pipe and have more
stone<00:05:01.600> go<00:05:01.870> towards<00:05:02.320> one<00:05:02.500> than<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.800> other<00:05:02.949> but

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
stone go towards one than the other but

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.270 
stone go towards one than the other but
again<00:05:03.810> just<00:05:04.810> a<00:05:04.900> quick<00:05:05.139> build<00:05:05.470> of<00:05:05.770> an<00:05:05.860> idea<00:05:06.220> i

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
again just a quick build of an idea i

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.719 
again just a quick build of an idea i
had<00:05:06.669> so<00:05:07.620> which<00:05:08.620> amazingly<00:05:09.100> worked<00:05:09.430> so<00:05:09.669> i

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
had so which amazingly worked so i

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.990 
had so which amazingly worked so i
thought<00:05:09.940> i'd<00:05:10.090> show<00:05:11.610> so<00:05:12.610> again<00:05:13.389> self-loading

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
thought i'd show so again self-loading

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.020 
thought i'd show so again self-loading
repeating<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:16.180> self<00:05:16.930> building<00:05:17.410> tnt<00:05:18.280> cannon<00:05:18.310> I

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.360 

think<00:05:22.199> call<00:05:23.199> it<00:05:23.349> now<00:05:23.470> before<00:05:23.710> something<00:05:24.099> blows

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
think call it now before something blows

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.670 
think call it now before something blows
up<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.729> ruins<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.120> whole<00:05:25.260> video<00:05:26.260> so<00:05:26.650> until

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
up and ruins the whole video so until

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.640 
up and ruins the whole video so until
next<00:05:27.010> time<00:05:27.400> see<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:27.849> later

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.710 

you
