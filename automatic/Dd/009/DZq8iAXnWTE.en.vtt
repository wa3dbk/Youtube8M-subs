00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
you just have to ground out all the time

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.340 
you just have to ground out all the time
just<00:02:33.860> your<00:02:34.459> sensitivity<00:02:35.060> it's<00:02:35.209> not<00:02:35.360> bad<00:02:35.660> and

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
also keep your coil off the ground if it

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.630 
also keep your coil off the ground if it
bumps<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.350> ground<00:02:39.590> out<00:02:39.769> here<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.370> going<00:02:40.580> to

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
bumps the ground out here it's going to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.870 
bumps the ground out here it's going to
go<00:02:40.819> off<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.500> it's<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:42.709> far<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:42.950> good

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
go off so it's so far so good

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.720 
go off so it's so far so good
I<00:02:44.920> really<00:02:45.920> wish<00:02:46.069> I<00:02:46.160> could<00:02:46.280> go<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.580> water

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
I really wish I could go in the water

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.820 
I really wish I could go in the water
deeper<00:02:47.239> but<00:02:47.450> it's<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.019> water<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.380> really<00:02:48.709> cold

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
deeper but it's the water is really cold

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.930 
deeper but it's the water is really cold
and<00:02:49.459> it's<00:02:50.209> just<00:02:50.330> not<00:02:50.450> worth<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.810> today<00:02:51.940> anyway

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
and it's just not worth it today anyway

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.080 
and it's just not worth it today anyway
just<00:02:53.239> thought<00:02:53.420> I'd<00:02:53.510> get<00:02:53.630> back<00:02:53.720> with<00:02:53.930> you
