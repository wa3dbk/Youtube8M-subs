00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
you're starting to get close so there's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.640 
you're starting to get close so there's
a<00:02:15.180> lot<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.390> clarity<00:02:15.780> starting<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.350> come<00:02:16.530> this

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
a lot of clarity starting to come this

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.260 
a lot of clarity starting to come this
is<00:02:16.800> when<00:02:16.950> mercury<00:02:17.190> catches<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.030> Sun

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
is when mercury catches up with the Sun

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.450 
is when mercury catches up with the Sun
forward<00:02:19.230> now<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.920> bring<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.250> lot<00:02:20.400> of

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
like fast quick reactions and things a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.080 
like fast quick reactions and things a
lot<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.010> quick<00:02:23.160> understanding<00:02:23.460> fun

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
conversations things really starting to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.490 
conversations things really starting to
pick<00:02:26.310> up<00:02:26.340> energetically<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.570> lots<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.080> stuff

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
pick up energetically to lots of stuff

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.850 
pick up energetically to lots of stuff
happening<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.630> weird<00:02:30.930> aspect<00:02:31.710> that's

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
happening the one weird aspect that's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.520 
happening the one weird aspect that's
happening<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.660> Sun<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.200> starting<00:02:34.380> to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
happening is the Sun is starting to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.790 
happening is the Sun is starting to
square<00:02:34.860> chyron<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.350> maybe<00:02:37.350> all<00:02:37.530> these

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
square chyron and so maybe all these

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.440 
square chyron and so maybe all these
events<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.340> are<00:02:38.430> happening<00:02:38.460> of<00:02:39.000> good<00:02:39.240> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
events that are happening of good to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.510 
events that are happening of good to
maybe<00:02:39.630> help<00:02:39.900> heal<00:02:40.290> us<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.980> where<00:02:41.250> you

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
maybe help heal us and see where you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.820 
maybe help heal us and see where you
know<00:02:42.030> maybe<00:02:42.240> we<00:02:42.360> need<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.600> find<00:02:42.900> new<00:02:43.050> doorways

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
know maybe we need to find new doorways

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.120 
know maybe we need to find new doorways
new<00:02:44.160> avenues<00:02:44.730> or<00:02:44.880> maybe<00:02:45.120> new<00:02:45.360> beliefs<00:02:45.750> and

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
new avenues or maybe new beliefs and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.710 
new avenues or maybe new beliefs and
finding<00:02:47.130> ways<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.490> overcome<00:02:47.640> our<00:02:48.180> wounds<00:02:48.450> or

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
finding ways to overcome our wounds or

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.110 
finding ways to overcome our wounds or
sensitivities<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.500> our<00:02:49.740> life<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.640> think

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
sensitivities in our life but I think

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.720 
sensitivities in our life but I think
that<00:02:51.410> because<00:02:52.410> there's<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:52.800> much<00:02:52.950> good<00:02:53.340> around

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
that because there's so much good around

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.250 
that because there's so much good around
and<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.970> think<00:02:54.210> that<00:02:54.420> there's<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.840> much<00:02:54.990> to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
and I think that there's so much to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.490 
and I think that there's so much to
learn<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.530> expand<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:57.110> can<00:02:58.110> help<00:02:58.290> you

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500

think<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.130> godsend<00:03:02.430> from<00:03:02.880> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
think that this is a godsend from the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.520 
think that this is a godsend from the
universe<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.420> think<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.870> very<00:03:04.170> rare

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
universe I think that this is very rare

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.580 
universe I think that this is very rare
and<00:03:04.710> very<00:03:05.000> exciting<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:06.930> Mars<00:03:07.230> enters

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
and very exciting but as Mars enters

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.740 
and very exciting but as Mars enters
Aquarius<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.460> time<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.090> try<00:03:09.360> things<00:03:09.420> that

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
Aquarius it's time to try things that

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.060 
Aquarius it's time to try things that
you<00:03:09.840> haven't<00:03:10.140> before<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.620> time<00:03:10.860> to

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
you haven't before it's time to

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.590 
you haven't before it's time to
rearrange<00:03:11.340> things<00:03:11.820> in<00:03:12.000> your<00:03:12.090> life<00:03:12.150> it's<00:03:12.540> been

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600

over<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:12.990> couple<00:03:13.410> years<00:03:13.530> since<00:03:13.740> we<00:03:13.890> had<00:03:14.040> Mars

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
over a couple years since we had Mars

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.130 
over a couple years since we had Mars
and<00:03:14.490> aquarius<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.180> they<00:03:15.690> really<00:03:15.960> haven't

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
and aquarius and they really haven't

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.320 
and aquarius and they really haven't
been<00:03:16.320> any<00:03:16.680> major<00:03:16.890> planets<00:03:17.520> in<00:03:17.610> aquarius<00:03:18.090> for<00:03:18.300> a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
been any major planets in aquarius for a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.550 
been any major planets in aquarius for a
long<00:03:18.600> time<00:03:19.020> so<00:03:19.890> it's<00:03:19.920> actually<00:03:20.700> very<00:03:21.560> exciting

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
long time so it's actually very exciting

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.650 
long time so it's actually very exciting
to<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.800> Mars<00:03:23.160> come<00:03:23.520> here<00:03:23.760> because<00:03:24.330> it's<00:03:24.510> been

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
to have Mars come here because it's been

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.960 
to have Mars come here because it's been

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
years since we've been able to kind of

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.170 
years since we've been able to kind of
defrag<00:03:27.959> that's<00:03:28.590> such<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:29.160> know<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.850> sounds

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180
