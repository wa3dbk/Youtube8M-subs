00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Talk to people, be welcome. 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.890
 there is one more video and this time aquino gta5 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.410
 of playstation 4 is the following galera 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.719
 Look at the fish I turned into. 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.219
 My hand got another one of those pixote 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.990
 you have here on the pier're 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.330
 I already showed the location here in the video 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.609
 past but finally the location of this 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.680
 package is right here guys folks 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 take it well at this point here is more or 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.800
 less is only you in the sea that 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.660
 you find him 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.400
 in the last video had turned me into 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.460
 a hammerhead shark for those who have not seen 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.980
 see why it's really cool too 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.280
 This time man I turned a fish I do not know 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.530
 What kind of fish are you in? 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.840
 much more if anyone knows about the species 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.289
 I said this in the comments 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.570
 interesting to know next time people are 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.980
 this fish does not attack're 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.230
 - I think it does not attack and I see it here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.129
 by the old map I'll mark a point 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.260
 here o 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.969
 It's going to be more or less here. I do not think 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.910
 do not need it here so much more or 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.780
 less and although I can not see the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.900
 map né 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.030
 anyway let's go there next because I went there 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.890
 because there is the location of 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.200
 some whales are being deceived 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.119
 Whale hump she stays there and it would be 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.259
 interesting to swim a lot 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.960
 This fish to see if we can 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.140
 finds other things here at sea and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.000
 Let's explore the seabed that is something 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.119
 that we can not do while the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.579
 People are a normal character, right? 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.590
 I never took a detailed look then 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.530
 So deep in the sea and let's go then 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.360
 Let's see if we can find the shawl. 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.380
 we find something interesting 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.450
 already has a pipe here old is cool this 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.740
 fish he is small so maybe we 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.290
 can enter smaller places, I do not know 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.890
 Look the detail is that it gives the algae galera 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.450
 that perfection that impede did here 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.670
 in this seabed on Playstation 3 already 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.939
 it was very beautiful like that and now 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.509
 playstation 4 is even more so 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.430
 show is here a lot of show that can 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.780
 enter this field here I do not know if it has 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.690
 something interesting 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.060
 There's going to be something here. 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.590
 Oh no, it's not locked up like you had a 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.520
 invisible wall here 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.380
 What a shame, I do not know if it was in the area of 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.870
 Whales even because I already showed beauty 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.650
 then we will focus who explore the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.700
 sea ​​bottom the algae here everything else 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.480
 look at this guys and other smaller fish 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.030
 here too I know that if there was a 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.630
 shark he would attack me too 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.630
 thing in that sense 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.600
 I do not know, but we're going down here at last. 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.340
 seabed 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.420
 This is very cool here for the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.940
 holding in galley could have an easter 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.360
 egg around here for us to check or 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.360
 something like that would be too old 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.230
 ah I'm going down there slope a seaweed 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.720
 move there in the front 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.750
 to give at last I will walk here as well 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.860
 It's low for us to see things with 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:15.209
 much detail despite being a fish and 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:19.470
 nothing too slow in the seaweed that pretty 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.860
 too many fish here many animals 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.959
 marine where you store type 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.530
 lobster on the seabed 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.050
 the crabs would be crazy too I am 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:36.209
 asking too much I do not know many fish 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.800
 You're not afraid of me here , I can not. 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.040
 attack too 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.400
 and come on come on guys this is the here 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.890
 I was swinging at that hour. 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.080
 I think he fish up is equal is and the 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.510
 man is to show that completing this fish 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.580
 People who have not seen 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.500
 Look very crazy, right? 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.150
 And look at this wall, what a crazy thing. 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.780
 to explore a bit more than the bottom 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.190
 from the sea 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.560
 I do not know if we'll find any 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.470
 something that is really very 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.180
 interesting here but I'm going at sea 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.830
 That thing, you can not. 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.680
 find things you never 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.269
 I imagined here right? 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.220
 It's what attracts me a lot of attention. 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:25.350
 old sea bottom must be very crazy 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.510
 Old beauty, let's walk here. 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.780
 walking not swimming, right? 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:36.770
 Look, it 's a very differentiated class here. 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:40.350
 well done also ream and let's go 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.289
 go little goldfish, nothing quick, it 's too much 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.539
 Slow old fish should be more 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.130
 fast to the old the whale shark 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.130
 any of them anyway 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.190
 I'll finally get to that rock that 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.320
 people are watching there guys, if not 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.270
 have anything good 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.490
 Thanks, I came by the seabed that 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.810
 is very beautiful 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.120
 I do not think it's worth it to stay. 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.440
 focusing so much because I think at 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.479
 less here we will not go 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:13.200
 find very different things 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:18.000
 users while the on-screen details 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.530
 incredible amazing there fish and we arrived 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.690
 here at the point I had spoken to 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.580
 you 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.560
 Come on, I'll make another video. 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.840
 showing another marine animal I'm going 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.490
 go to other directions as 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.349
 if here we went well for 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.720
 right 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:40.650
 from there to pick up other animals or 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.630
 left or forwards or backwards will not 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.370
 stay the same, right, because I intend 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.320
 show all marine animals here 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.320
 Five I think it's really cool, guys. 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.599
 It's like people around here do not 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:58.349
 It will have nothing of interest not to 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:00.450
 be the nature the way it is 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.099
 Anyway, that's it, I got into this. 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.720
 video here is getting all dark 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.060
 even better hope you have 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.650
 tanned if you enjoyed leaving 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.630
 Favorite team to these videos here I 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.610
 I really like a tie well 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.729
 It's fun to even know these things. 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.110
 new here in gta 5 and that's it guys 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.030
 I'm going to stay here 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.410
 a big hug to all of you and even 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.410
 I went next
