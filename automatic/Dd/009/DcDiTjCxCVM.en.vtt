based<00:00:10.559> design<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.670> I've<00:00:11.880> created<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.570> has

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
based design that I've created that has

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.400 
based design that I've created that has
been<00:00:12.950> golden<00:00:13.950> for<00:00:14.429> me<00:00:14.780> so<00:00:15.780> what<00:00:16.109> i've<00:00:16.230> done

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
been golden for me so what i've done

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.080 
been golden for me so what i've done
here<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.800> i've<00:00:16.949> created<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.460> base<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
here is i've created a base that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.779 
here is i've created a base that
protects<00:00:18.810> your<00:00:19.260> most<00:00:19.560> important<00:00:20.070> resource<00:00:20.310> at

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
protects your most important resource at

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.090 
protects your most important resource at
this<00:00:20.939> point<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.510> me<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.900> would<00:00:21.990> be<00:00:22.050> gold<00:00:22.439> for

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
this point for me that would be gold for

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.290 
this point for me that would be gold for
you<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.340> might<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> lexer<00:00:23.970> maybe<00:00:24.150> you're

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
you that might be a lexer maybe you're

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.060 
you that might be a lexer maybe you're
saving<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.869> huge<00:00:25.170> upgrade<00:00:25.439> such<00:00:25.890> as

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
saving for a huge upgrade such as

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.990 
saving for a huge upgrade such as
dragons<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:27.710> archers<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:29.010> balloons<00:00:29.820> or

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
dragons or archers or balloons or

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.620 
dragons or archers or balloons or
whatever<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.420> feel<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.869> important<00:00:32.630> but

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
whatever you feel is important but

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.500 
whatever you feel is important but
currently<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.050> finished<00:00:34.649> all<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:35.510> Alexa

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
upgrades so now all I'm protecting is my

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.660 
upgrades so now all I'm protecting is my
dark<00:00:39.420> elixir<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.050> my<00:00:40.230> gold<00:00:40.590> don't<00:00:41.399> care<00:00:41.579> about

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
dark elixir and my gold don't care about

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.119 
dark elixir and my gold don't care about
trophies<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.570> almost<00:00:42.840> level<00:00:43.170> 79<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.040> I'm

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
trophies I'm almost level 79 so I'm

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.799 
trophies I'm almost level 79 so I'm
getting<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:44.910> close<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.570> maxing

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
getting really really close to maxing

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.850 
getting really really close to maxing
and<00:00:46.399> this<00:00:47.399> base<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.940> powerful

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
and this base is just so so powerful

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.709 
and this base is just so so powerful
what<00:00:52.860> i've<00:00:52.980> done<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.489> i've<00:00:53.730> put<00:00:54.180> some<00:00:54.629> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the most important things that would be

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
protect your gold now and keep pushing

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.550 
protect your gold now and keep pushing
on<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.430> they'll<00:02:00.240> kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.630> it'll<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.409> good

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
on that they'll kind of it'll be good

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.770 
on that they'll kind of it'll be good
because<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:02.460> you'll<00:02:02.670> go<00:02:03.240> through<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> gold

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
because then you'll go through the gold

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
because then you'll go through the gold
stuff<00:02:04.049> faster<00:02:04.560> than<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.770> normally<00:02:04.950> would<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
stuff faster than you normally would and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.819 
stuff faster than you normally would and
then<00:02:05.880> they'll<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.060> closer<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> same<00:02:07.530> time

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
then they'll be closer to the same time

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.199 
then they'll be closer to the same time
that<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.069> finish<00:02:08.340> them<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.789> you'll<00:02:09.060> finish

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that you finish them and you'll finish

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.790 
that you finish them and you'll finish
the<00:02:09.420> gold<00:02:09.660> stuff<00:02:09.899> faster<00:02:10.289> than<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.530> would<00:02:10.709> if

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the gold stuff faster than you would if

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.410 
the gold stuff faster than you would if
you<00:02:10.830> protected<00:02:11.430> both<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.819> at<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.030> same<00:02:12.239> time

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
you protected both them at the same time

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.000 
you protected both them at the same time
if<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.840> makes<00:02:13.349> sense

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
if that makes sense

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.840 
if that makes sense
currently<00:02:15.010> what<00:02:15.130> I'm<00:02:15.220> going<00:02:15.459> for<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.760> this

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
currently what I'm going for in this

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.180 
currently what I'm going for in this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
base now I'm kind of done the walls for

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.770 
base now I'm kind of done the walls for
now<00:02:21.400> I'm<00:02:21.790> going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> finish<00:02:22.360> those<00:02:22.660> up

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
now I'm going to finish those up

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.010 
now I'm going to finish those up
obviously<00:02:23.560> I'm<00:02:23.650> going<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.830> get<00:02:23.920> all<00:02:24.100> those<00:02:24.310> 27

obviously I'm going to get all those 27
might<00:02:26.020> get<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.440> intersections<00:02:27.280> 28<00:02:28.090> but<00:02:28.870> i

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
might get that intersections 28 but i

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.930 
might get that intersections 28 but i
don't<00:02:29.140> think<00:02:29.530> i<00:02:29.920> will<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.610> because<00:02:30.819> it's<00:02:30.910> just

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
don't think i will is because it's just

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.100 
don't think i will is because it's just
