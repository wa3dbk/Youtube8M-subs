00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.509
 hello guys welcome to this video 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.510
 now I will show you how to reproduce 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.210
 any type of minecraft animal 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:27.570
 initial mushroom to make them reproduce 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.060
 we must cultivate wheat and then come on 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.510
 I always ask if they will take it for 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.760
 attracting them you see that they follow me button 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:48.719
 right on their body and they will reproduce 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:51.660
 we will need the little ones for the chickens 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:07.850
 seeds both to attract them and to make them 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:11.510
 play believed and small for the wolves 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.500
 to get them to play first we have to 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.890
 get them 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.150
 we have to train them practically 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.370
 giving him bones that you can 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.729
 find by closing the skeletons of 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.370
 usually 6 is enough here is one 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.630
 I got lucky here even one for 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.160
 luck 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.300
 see that when we are trained 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.540
 answer first let 's get up they have 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.850
 place to blend red water to remove 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.860
 produce enough that they committed to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.300
 any type of meat and time prone 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.040
 were the head we click on and 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:53.550
 they will reproduce to attract them enough that 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.070
 train them and then they will follow us 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.600
 if then they stay behind that 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.390
 they will carry near us 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.450
 the peak of jade layer let's do it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:11.220
 really sit second characters 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:16.410
 be careful with you be careful with i 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.170
 wolves because they devour me read when 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.739
 they are not trained or see if 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.220
 we can make it sit or perfect for the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.220
 sheep and the emotion of the wheat always 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.120
 and dogs are sitting means that 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.690
 they're standing still they won't follow us for the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.500
 We still need the holes to look like wheat 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.150
 to find the grain and have to have it 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.590
 signs and make a deal 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.690
 of wheat in fact and to see how 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.900
 do and interim straight problems 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.900
 spoiler 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.079
 all a spoiler yes a link on the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.480
 video to do to show my 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:20.790
 tutorial on how to do it then do train 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:24.420
 for pigs we will need one saying for 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.269
 the pigs will serve us carrots 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.200
 can find or in the baskets the mines 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:34.549
 or by killing the zombies for a long time 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.549
 hard to find them and with zombies 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.549
 animals of those can be reproduced 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.230
 once a day you will sometimes need it 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.269
 always leave ago to make him attract 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.340
 see that no now because in short there 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.260
 let's go to the tower because it can say 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.950
 however, products do not seem to be 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.780
 trust me follow the speech ok guys 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.250
 thank you for seeing us 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.510
 next video put her that 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.230
 subscribe 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.080
 meanwhile I take this opportunity to show him 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.040
 this little bug 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.500
 of when you generate a super flat 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.390
 see I have made a world to dream that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.340
 it would be very high you don't even see the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.989
 summit but in reality I had everything 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:27.740
 practically here a world that does not have one 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:33.560
 setting is in fact if you see here z 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.480
 indeed not on y above left 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.720
 see that we are at 102 instead when yes 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:44.360
 it is at it and there will be at 5 more or less e 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.990
 see that you can also see the peak of the hour 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.970
 let's see now you see I don't know why 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:58.100
 however he made this little bug and 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:01.370
 it happens quite a lot to me though 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.560
 I think it 's a minecraft error 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.620
 sepino what functions with look 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.180
 what happens with minecraft rainews 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.190
 but I thank you again for the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.270
 vision to the next video said by 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.270
