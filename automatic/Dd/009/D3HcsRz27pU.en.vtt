little<00:00:04.170> bit<00:00:04.290> more<00:00:04.529> exciting<00:00:05.220> than<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.670> normal

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
little bit more exciting than a normal

the<00:00:08.250> exact<00:00:08.580> same<00:00:08.790> crossover<00:00:09.540> stunt<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the exact same crossover stunt and in a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.259 
the exact same crossover stunt and in a
slightly<00:00:10.380> smaller<00:00:10.800> more<00:00:11.580> dramatic<00:00:12.030> looking

slightly smaller more dramatic looking

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.910 
slightly smaller more dramatic looking
package<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.840> mean<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.049> certainly<00:00:13.380> stands<00:00:13.679> out

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
package I mean it certainly stands out

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760 
package I mean it certainly stands out
the<00:00:14.219> top<00:00:14.370> off<00:00:14.580> its<00:00:15.179> coupe<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.500> mean<00:00:16.529> it's

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
the top off its coupe I like I mean it's

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.830 
the top off its coupe I like I mean it's
a<00:00:16.800> bit<00:00:16.980> reminiscent<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.910> GTR<00:00:18.330> whereas<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
a bit reminiscent of the GTR whereas the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.429 
a bit reminiscent of the GTR whereas the
bottom<00:00:19.260> bit<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.890> pure<00:00:20.279> jacked-up<00:00:20.760> hard<00:00:21.570> SUV

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
bottom bit is pure jacked-up hard SUV

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.130 
bottom bit is pure jacked-up hard SUV
but<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> best<00:00:23.160> bit<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.820> at<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> front<00:00:24.840> because

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
but the best bit is at the front because

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.349 
but the best bit is at the front because
it's<00:00:25.439> kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> like<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.859> cross<00:00:26.130> between<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.760> moon

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
it's kind of like a cross between a moon

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.810 
it's kind of like a cross between a moon
buggy<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.900> an<00:00:28.260> evil<00:00:29.099> Frank

horsepower in the Juke it's good for

naught to 60 in 8 seconds although I

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.250 
naught to 60 in 8 seconds although I
have<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.090> say<00:00:50.270> does<00:00:50.600> actually<00:00:50.720> feel<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.020> little

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
have to say does actually feel a little

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.110 
have to say does actually feel a little
bit<00:00:51.440> quicker<00:00:51.829> than<00:00:51.949> that<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.670> unit<00:00:52.910> revs

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
bit quicker than that the unit revs

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.819 
bit quicker than that the unit revs
really<00:00:53.390> smoothly<00:00:53.720> then<00:00:54.379> there<00:00:54.500> is<00:00:54.590> a<00:00:54.620> bit<00:00:54.739> of

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
really smoothly then there is a bit of

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.009 
really smoothly then there is a bit of
turbo<00:00:55.339> lag<00:00:55.370> down<00:00:55.760> at<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.030> bottom<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:56.600> have<00:00:56.839> to

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
turbo lag down at the bottom I have to

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.740 
turbo lag down at the bottom I have to
say<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.530> noise<00:00:57.800> itself<00:00:58.280> then<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.699> makes<00:00:58.970> it<00:00:59.210> a

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
say the noise itself then it makes it a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.540 
say the noise itself then it makes it a
little<00:00:59.870> bit<00:01:00.170> whiny<00:01:03.009> as<00:01:04.009> for<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.250> handling

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
little bit whiny as for the handling

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.399 
little bit whiny as for the handling
well<00:01:04.879> there's<00:01:05.479> only<00:01:05.570> body<00:01:05.960> roll<00:01:06.170> through

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
well there's only body roll through

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.660 
well there's only body roll through
corners<00:01:06.740> but<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.950> trade-off<00:01:07.159> for<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.640> a

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
corners but the trade-off for that is a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.609 
corners but the trade-off for that is a
suspension<00:01:08.150> can<00:01:08.630> be<00:01:08.659> a<00:01:08.869> little<00:01:08.990> bit<00:01:09.200> firm<00:01:09.440> and

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
suspension can be a little bit firm and

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.040 
suspension can be a little bit firm and
jittery<00:01:09.950> on<00:01:10.070> rough<00:01:10.640> roads<00:01:10.790> from<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.690> have<00:01:11.899> is

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
jittery on rough roads from I have is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.719 
jittery on rough roads from I have is
the<00:01:12.229> steering<00:01:12.619> feels<00:01:12.800> a<00:01:12.860> little<00:01:12.920> bit<00:01:13.160> nerman

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
the steering feels a little bit nerman

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.639 
the steering feels a little bit nerman
slow<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.539> he<00:01:14.690> can<00:01:14.840> sharpen<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.259> up<00:01:15.289> by<00:01:15.410> putting

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
slow and he can sharpen it up by putting

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.859 
slow and he can sharpen it up by putting
the<00:01:15.740> car<00:01:15.890> into<00:01:16.070> sports<00:01:16.369> mode<00:01:16.700> but<00:01:17.300> ultimately

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
the car into sports mode but ultimately

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.109 
the car into sports mode but ultimately
I<00:01:18.170> think<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.890> GPS<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:19.399> a<00:01:19.430> much<00:01:19.640> fun<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.970> drive

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
I think the GPS is a much fun to drive

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.650 
I think the GPS is a much fun to drive
as<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:20.720> could<00:01:20.960> have<00:01:21.080> been<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.910> Jukes<00:01:26.149> cabin<00:01:26.479> is

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
as it could have been the Jukes cabin is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.359 
as it could have been the Jukes cabin is
a<00:01:26.690> little<00:01:26.990> bit<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.259> mixed<00:01:27.530> bag<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.070> driving

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
a little bit of a mixed bag the driving

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.980 
a little bit of a mixed bag the driving
position<00:01:28.460> feels<00:01:28.880> very<00:01:29.060> sporty<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.780> high

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
position feels very sporty in the high

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.050 
position feels very sporty in the high
gear<00:01:30.259> lever<00:01:30.440> is<00:01:30.710> nice<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.640> it's<00:01:31.910> very

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
gear lever is nice and it's very

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.570 
gear lever is nice and it's very
accurate<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.690> use<00:01:32.869> I<00:01:33.140> like<00:01:33.649> this<00:01:34.250> centre

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
accurate to use I like this centre

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.700 
accurate to use I like this centre
console<00:01:35.030> which<00:01:35.360> mimics<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.200> look<00:01:36.410> of<00:01:36.619> the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
console which mimics the look of the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.490 
console which mimics the look of the
tank<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.310> motorbike<00:01:37.940> however<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:39.140> think<00:01:39.320> some

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
tank of a motorbike however I think some

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.889 
tank of a motorbike however I think some
of<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.619> materials<00:01:40.160> using<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.850> cabin<00:01:41.240> are<00:01:41.840> a

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
of the materials using the cabin are a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.050 
of the materials using the cabin are a
little<00:01:42.080> bit<00:01:42.350> low-rent<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.579> is<00:01:43.729> kind<00:01:44.000> of

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
little bit low-rent and this is kind of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.910 
little bit low-rent and this is kind of
clever<00:01:44.240> LCD<00:01:44.869> system<00:01:45.320> down<00:01:45.560> there<00:01:45.590> which<00:01:45.890> shows

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
clever LCD system down there which shows

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.120 
clever LCD system down there which shows
you<00:01:46.220> things<00:01:46.400> like<00:01:46.900> g-force<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.170> turbo<00:01:48.860> boost

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
you things like g-force and turbo boost
