00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
then that's going to result in a much

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.940 
then that's going to result in a much

greater jail sentence than trespassing

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.929 
greater jail sentence than trespassing
in<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.220> case<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.790> eight

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
in this case it's going to be eight

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.910

months<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.299> jail<00:01:12.420> apiece<00:01:12.750> instead<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.710> had

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
months in jail apiece instead of one had

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.170 
months in jail apiece instead of one had
they<00:01:14.070> only<00:01:14.100> been<00:01:14.400> able<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.760> charge<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.150> with

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480 
they only been able to charge them with
trespassing<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> question<00:01:17.189> looks<00:01:17.340> like

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
trespassing so the question looks like

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.120 
trespassing so the question looks like
this<00:01:17.930> suppose<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.229> thieves<00:01:19.560> only<00:01:19.710> want<00:01:20.070> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
this suppose the thieves only want to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.410 
this suppose the thieves only want to
minimize<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> number<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.880> months<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.299> spend

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
minimize the number of months they spend

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
minimize the number of months they spend
in<00:01:21.630> jail<00:01:21.659> we're<00:01:21.990> making<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.290> assumption<00:01:22.560> here

in jail we're making an assumption here
we're<00:01:23.340> supposing<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> criminals<00:01:24.479> only

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
we're supposing that the criminals only
care<00:01:25.110> about<00:01:25.140> themselves<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.130> moment<00:01:26.460> if

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
care about themselves for the moment if

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.700 
care about themselves for the moment if
that's<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> case<00:01:27.479> should<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.290> confess<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
that's the case should they confess to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.249 
that's the case should they confess to
the<00:01:28.979> police<00:01:29.630> now<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.689> saw<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> lot<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the police now we saw a lot of

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.170 
the police now we saw a lot of
information<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> last<00:01:32.430> two<00:01:32.610> slides<00:01:32.909> but

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
information in the last two slides but

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.670 
information in the last two slides but
we<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.420> condense<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.869> into<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.439> little

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
we can condense it into just this little

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.140 
we can condense it into just this little
payoff<00:01:35.040> matrix<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.090> we

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
payoff matrix right here this is what we

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030 
payoff matrix right here this is what we
call<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> prisoner's<00:01:36.810> dilemma<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.920> two

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
call a prisoner's dilemma so we have two

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
call a prisoner's dilemma so we have two
players<00:01:38.250> player<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:38.880> player<00:01:39.000> two<00:01:39.150> each

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
players player one and player two each

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
players player one and player two each
of<00:01:40.140> them<00:01:40.259> has<00:01:40.470> two<00:01:40.829> strategies<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.490> can

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
of them has two strategies they can

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.039 
of them has two strategies they can
either<00:01:41.700> confess<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.630> keep<00:01:42.750> quiet

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
either confess or they can keep quiet

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
either confess or they can keep quiet
and<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:44.040> based<00:01:44.250> off<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.520> those<00:01:44.790> strategies

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and then based off of those strategies

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.940 
and then based off of those strategies
you<00:01:45.479> end<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.810> different<00:01:45.840> outcomes<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.799> if

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
you end up at different outcomes so if

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.410 
you end up at different outcomes so if
both<00:01:47.100> keep<00:01:47.310> quiet<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:47.850> both<00:01:48.000> spend<00:01:48.270> one

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
both keep quiet and they both spend one

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.609 
both keep quiet and they both spend one
month<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.780> jail<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.259> could<00:01:49.380> both<00:01:49.439> get

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
month in jail so they could both get

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.539 
month in jail so they could both get
negative<00:01:50.009> one<00:01:50.159> there

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
negative one there

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.490 
negative one there
if<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.360> confesses<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.079> other<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.350> keeps

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
if one confesses the other one keeps

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.080 
if one confesses the other one keeps
quiet<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.130> who<00:01:53.220> confesses<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.909> case

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
quiet the one who confesses in this case

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.780 
quiet the one who confesses in this case
player<00:01:54.329> 2<00:01:54.360> gets<00:01:55.170> no<00:01:55.380> time<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.710> jail<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.070> player

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
player 2 gets no time in jail and player

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.249 
player 2 gets no time in jail and player
1<00:01:57.030> gets<00:01:57.060> 12<00:01:57.540> months<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.810> jail<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
1 gets 12 months in jail so that's a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.870 
1 gets 12 months in jail so that's a
negative<00:01:58.590> 12<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.340> reverse

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
negative 12 and it's the reverse

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.700 
negative 12 and it's the reverse
situation<00:02:00.420> over<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.350> finally

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
situation over here and then finally

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.899 
situation over here and then finally
both<00:02:01.890> confess<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.460> end<00:02:02.579> up<00:02:02.670> over<00:02:02.850> here

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
both confess then you end up over here

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.100 
both confess then you end up over here
where<00:02:03.210> they<00:02:03.329> both<00:02:03.479> spend<00:02:03.719> eight<00:02:03.840> months<00:02:04.049> in

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
where they both spend eight months in

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
where they both spend eight months in
jail<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.950> course<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:05.670> confused

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
jail and of course if you get confused

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.370 
jail and of course if you get confused
about<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> payoffs<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.960> notice<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
about the payoffs you just notice that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.020 
about the payoffs you just notice that
these<00:02:07.619> are<00:02:07.710> color-coordinated<00:02:08.340> where<00:02:08.819> player

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
these are color-coordinated where player

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.880 
these are color-coordinated where player
one<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.300> player<00:02:09.629> player<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.500> blue<00:02:10.679> rather

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
one is player player one is blue rather

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.480 
one is player player one is blue rather
and<00:02:11.160> player<00:02:11.370> two<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.640> red

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
and player two is red

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.130 
and player two is red
now<00:02:12.940> also<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.360> game<00:02:13.510> theory<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:13.900> have<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
now also in game theory we have the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.720 
now also in game theory we have the
following<00:02:14.320> convention<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.070> make<00:02:15.220> player<00:02:15.430> 1<00:02:15.700> a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
following convention we make player 1 a

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.820 
following convention we make player 1 a
man<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.270> player<00:02:16.450> 2<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.720> woman<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.560> reason<00:02:17.770> that

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
man and player 2 a woman the reason that

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.410 
man and player 2 a woman the reason that
we<00:02:17.950> do<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.460> so<00:02:18.670> we<00:02:18.790> can<00:02:18.940> use<00:02:19.120> pronouns

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
we do this is so we can use pronouns

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.390 
we do this is so we can use pronouns
like<00:02:20.020> he<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.350> she<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.800> differentiate<00:02:21.280> between

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
like he and she to differentiate between

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.340 
like he and she to differentiate between
the<00:02:21.670> players<00:02:21.880> without<00:02:22.180> creating<00:02:23.110> any<00:02:23.230> extra

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
the players without creating any extra

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.980 
the players without creating any extra
confusion<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.330> aside<00:02:25.570> let's<00:02:25.600> actually

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
confusion so that aside let's actually

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.630 
confusion so that aside let's actually
solve<00:02:26.320> this<00:02:26.530> game<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.310> way<00:02:27.400> we're<00:02:27.550> going

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
solve this game and the way we're going

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.910 
solve this game and the way we're going
to<00:02:27.700> do<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.180> by<00:02:28.330> noting<00:02:28.780> how<00:02:29.050> player<00:02:29.590> 1<00:02:29.890> and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
to do that is by noting how player 1 and

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.160 
to do that is by noting how player 1 and
player<00:02:30.100> 2<00:02:30.310> should<00:02:30.640> respond<00:02:31.060> based<00:02:31.870> off<00:02:32.020> what

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
player 2 should respond based off what

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.360 
player 2 should respond based off what
the<00:02:32.230> other<00:02:32.380> person<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.680> going<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.890> do<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:33.250> let's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the other person is going to do so let's

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.250 
the other person is going to do so let's
look<00:02:33.460> at<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.700> for<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.060> second<00:02:34.390> like<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:34.690> this

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
look at this for a second like this this

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.690 
look at this for a second like this this
is<00:02:35.440> just<00:02:35.680> highlighting<00:02:36.040> player<00:02:36.310> 1s<00:02:36.670> payoff

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
is just highlighting player 1s payoff

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.170 
is just highlighting player 1s payoff
here<00:02:37.150> suppose<00:02:37.750> player<00:02:38.050> 1<00:02:38.500> knew<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.760> player<00:02:39.970> 2

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
here suppose player 1 knew that player 2

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.670 
here suppose player 1 knew that player 2
is<00:02:40.300> going<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.510> keep<00:02:40.690> why'd<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.080> just<00:02:41.260> predict

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
is going to keep why'd you just predict

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.320 
is going to keep why'd you just predict
this<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.190> he<00:02:42.310> saw<00:02:42.520> into<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.880> future<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.240> he

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
this and he saw into the future and he

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.820 
this and he saw into the future and he
knew<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.570> player<00:02:43.930> 2<00:02:44.170> was<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.680> keep

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
knew that player 2 was going to keep

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.730 
knew that player 2 was going to keep
quiet<00:02:45.070> what<00:02:45.760> should<00:02:45.970> he<00:02:46.090> do<00:02:46.270> well<00:02:47.200> if<00:02:47.380> we<00:02:47.590> look

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
quiet what should he do well if we look

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.140 
quiet what should he do well if we look
at<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.950> payoffs<00:02:48.220> on<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> screen<00:02:48.640> here<00:02:48.820> we<00:02:48.970> see

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
at the payoffs on the screen here we see

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.700 
at the payoffs on the screen here we see
that<00:02:49.330> he's<00:02:49.720> better<00:02:49.870> off<00:02:49.960> confessing<00:02:50.530> than<00:02:50.650> he

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
that he's better off confessing than he

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.110 
that he's better off confessing than he
is<00:02:50.830> keeping<00:02:50.980> quiet<00:02:51.220> because<00:02:51.580> he<00:02:51.670> spends<00:02:51.940> no

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
is keeping quiet because he spends no

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.760 
is keeping quiet because he spends no
time<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.510> jail<00:02:52.540> if<00:02:52.780> he<00:02:52.840> confesses<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.320> one

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
time in jail if he confesses and one

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.770 
time in jail if he confesses and one
month<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.070> jail<00:02:54.160> if<00:02:54.340> he<00:02:54.400> keeps<00:02:54.550> quiet<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.360> 0<00:02:55.660> is

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
month in jail if he keeps quiet so 0 is

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.000 
month in jail if he keeps quiet so 0 is
greater<00:02:55.870> than<00:02:56.050> negative<00:02:56.410> 1<00:02:56.590> he<00:02:56.830> should

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
greater than negative 1 he should

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.330 
greater than negative 1 he should
confess<00:02:57.280> if<00:02:57.580> player<00:02:57.820> 2<00:02:58.120> keeps<00:02:58.390> quiet<00:02:59.340> now

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
confess if player 2 keeps quiet now

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.400 
confess if player 2 keeps quiet now
suppose<00:03:00.730> player<00:03:00.880> 1<00:03:01.270> knew<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.900> player<00:03:02.080> 2<00:03:02.290> is

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
suppose player 1 knew that player 2 is

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.110 
suppose player 1 knew that player 2 is
going<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.650> confess<00:03:02.980> think<00:03:03.790> about<00:03:03.940> what<00:03:04.060> he

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
going to confess think about what he

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.000 
going to confess think about what he
should<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:04.330> hear<00:03:04.660> well<00:03:05.020> if<00:03:05.470> he<00:03:05.680> keeps<00:03:05.800> quiet

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
should you hear well if he keeps quiet

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.740 
should you hear well if he keeps quiet
he'll<00:03:06.340> spend<00:03:06.580> 12<00:03:06.820> months<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.180> jail<00:03:07.360> if<00:03:07.570> you

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
he'll spend 12 months in jail if you

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.480 
he'll spend 12 months in jail if you
confesses<00:03:08.350> he'll<00:03:08.530> spend<00:03:08.770> 8<00:03:08.980> months<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.310> jail

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
confesses he'll spend 8 months of jail

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.210 
confesses he'll spend 8 months of jail
so<00:03:10.300> in<00:03:10.570> response<00:03:10.960> to<00:03:11.230> player<00:03:11.440> 2<00:03:11.680> confessing

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
so in response to player 2 confessing

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.790 
so in response to player 2 confessing
player<00:03:12.490> 1<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:13.000> also<00:03:13.270> better<00:03:13.690> off<00:03:13.990> confessing

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
player 1 is also better off confessing

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.530 
player 1 is also better off confessing
if<00:03:15.490> you<00:03:15.610> string<00:03:15.880> these<00:03:16.000> two<00:03:16.180> pieces<00:03:16.330> of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
if you string these two pieces of

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.390 
if you string these two pieces of
information<00:03:16.750> together<00:03:17.140> whether<00:03:17.860> player<00:03:18.130> 2

information together whether player 2

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.790 
information together whether player 2
keeps<00:03:18.640> quiet<00:03:18.850> or<00:03:19.180> player<00:03:19.690> 2<00:03:19.930> confesses<00:03:20.440> player

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
keeps quiet or player 2 confesses player

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.980 
keeps quiet or player 2 confesses player
1<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.250> always<00:03:21.520> better<00:03:21.910> confessing<00:03:22.600> confessing

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
1 is always better confessing confessing

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.950 
1 is always better confessing confessing
always<00:03:23.740> leads<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.250> better<00:03:24.430> outcome<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:25.780> say

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
always leads to a better outcome we say

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.260 
always leads to a better outcome we say
that<00:03:26.170> player<00:03:26.680> ones<00:03:27.040> confess<00:03:27.610> strategy

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
that player ones confess strategy

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.560 
that player ones confess strategy
strictly<00:03:28.810> dominates<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:30.360> keep<00:03:31.360> quiet

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
strictly dominates is keep quiet

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.660 
strictly dominates is keep quiet
strategy<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:32.440> in<00:03:32.560> general<00:03:32.770> strategy<00:03:33.430> X

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
strategy and so in general strategy X

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.780 
strategy and so in general strategy X
dominates<00:03:34.270> strategy<00:03:34.690> Y<00:03:34.870> if<00:03:35.230> X<00:03:36.040> generates<00:03:36.730> a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
dominates strategy Y if X generates a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.520 
dominates strategy Y if X generates a
greater<00:03:37.000> payoff<00:03:37.360> for<00:03:37.540> y<00:03:37.690> regardless<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.410> what

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
greater payoff for y regardless of what

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.410 
greater payoff for y regardless of what
the<00:03:38.620> players<00:03:38.860> do<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.640> in<00:03:39.760> this<00:03:39.880> case<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.270> is

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
the players do so in this case this is

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.380 
the players do so in this case this is
confess<00:03:40.870> strictly<00:03:41.680> dominating<00:03:42.340> keep<00:03:43.120> quiet

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
confess strictly dominating keep quiet

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.620 
confess strictly dominating keep quiet
so<00:03:44.080> keep<00:03:44.440> quiet<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.800> strictly<00:03:45.130> dominated<00:03:45.630> now

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
so keep quiet is strictly dominated now

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.390 
so keep quiet is strictly dominated now
rational<00:03:47.170> players<00:03:47.380> never<00:03:47.710> play<00:03:47.980> strictly

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
rational players never play strictly

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.670 
rational players never play strictly
dominated<00:03:48.880> strategies<00:03:49.420> like<00:03:49.840> keeping<00:03:50.410> quiet

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
dominated strategies like keeping quiet

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.620 
dominated strategies like keeping quiet
the<00:03:51.430> reason<00:03:51.700> for<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:52.150> why<00:03:52.330> would<00:03:52.540> you

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
the reason for that is why would you

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.700 
the reason for that is why would you
want<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.840> keep<00:03:52.930> quiet<00:03:53.140> when<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.560> could

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
want to keep quiet when you could

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.560 
want to keep quiet when you could
confess<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.280> do<00:03:54.430> better<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.880> so<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.210> general

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
confess and do better and so in general

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.790 
confess and do better and so in general
why<00:03:55.690> would<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:55.960> want<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.170> play<00:03:56.230> y<00:03:56.470> when<00:03:56.710> you

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
why would you want to play y when you

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.010 
why would you want to play y when you
can<00:03:56.890> play<00:03:57.040> X<00:03:57.280> instead<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.690> in<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.900> future

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
can play X instead and so in the future

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.180 
can play X instead and so in the future
as<00:03:59.290> we<00:03:59.440> go<00:03:59.530> through<00:03:59.680> these<00:03:59.770> videos<00:03:59.830> we're

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
as we go through these videos we're

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.740 
as we go through these videos we're
going<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.400> make<00:04:00.730> sure<00:04:00.910> that<00:04:01.060> these<00:04:01.480> players

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
going to make sure that these players

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.030 
going to make sure that these players
are<00:04:01.990> never<00:04:02.140> going<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.350> be<00:04:02.470> playing<00:04:02.650> strictly

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
are never going to be playing strictly

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.290 
are never going to be playing strictly
dominated<00:04:03.490> strategies<00:04:03.880> because<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.150> just

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
dominated strategies because it just

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.460 
dominated strategies because it just
doesn't<00:04:04.510> make<00:04:04.600> sense<00:04:04.660> for<00:04:04.990> them<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.110> ever<00:04:05.290> do

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
doesn't make sense for them to ever do

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.320 
doesn't make sense for them to ever do
that<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.670> finish<00:04:06.850> solving<00:04:07.060> the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
that and so to finish solving the

that and so to finish solving the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
player's prisoner's dilemma here we know

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.700 
player's prisoner's dilemma here we know
that<00:04:09.160> player<00:04:09.370> 1<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:09.820> going<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.240> confess<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:11.320> all

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
that player 1 is going to confess so all

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.960 
that player 1 is going to confess so all
that's<00:04:11.920> left<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.430> figure<00:04:12.550> out<00:04:12.640> what<00:04:12.730> player

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
that's left is to figure out what player

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.910 
that's left is to figure out what player
2<00:04:13.000> is<00:04:13.270> going<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.570> do<00:04:13.660> here<00:04:13.960> so<00:04:14.080> imagine<00:04:14.890> that

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
2 is going to do here so imagine that

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.979 
2 is going to do here so imagine that
player<00:04:15.250> 2<00:04:15.550> knew<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:16.120> player<00:04:16.330> 1<00:04:16.570> was<00:04:16.720> going<00:04:16.900> to

player 2 knew that player 1 was going to
keep<00:04:17.109> quiet<00:04:17.260> we<00:04:17.890> can<00:04:18.010> see<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.280> she's<00:04:18.489> in<00:04:18.609> the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
keep quiet we can see that she's in the

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.120 
keep quiet we can see that she's in the
exact<00:04:19.030> same<00:04:19.270> boat<00:04:19.330> as<00:04:19.600> player<00:04:19.810> 1<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.200> player<00:04:20.890> 1

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
exact same boat as player 1 is player 1

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.500 
exact same boat as player 1 is player 1
keeps<00:04:21.340> quiet<00:04:21.580> she's<00:04:21.940> also<00:04:22.210> better<00:04:22.360> off

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
keeps quiet she's also better off

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.150 
keeps quiet she's also better off
confessing<00:04:23.020> because<00:04:23.140> 0<00:04:23.530> is<00:04:23.800> greater<00:04:23.980> than

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
confessing because 0 is greater than

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.280 
confessing because 0 is greater than
negative<00:04:24.610> 1

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
negative 1

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.350 
negative 1
but<00:04:25.680> on<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.860> other<00:04:25.950> hand<00:04:26.040> if<00:04:26.310> player<00:04:26.520> 1<00:04:26.850> is

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
but on the other hand if player 1 is

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.970 
but on the other hand if player 1 is
going<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.840> confess<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.320> player<00:04:28.470> 2<00:04:28.710> could<00:04:28.860> see

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
going to confess and player 2 could see

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.920 
going to confess and player 2 could see
that<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.280> advance<00:04:29.430> again<00:04:30.300> player<00:04:30.570> 2<00:04:30.810> would

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
that in advance again player 2 would

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.630 
that in advance again player 2 would
also<00:04:31.110> want<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.470> confess<00:04:31.710> because<00:04:32.100> negative<00:04:32.340> 8

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
also want to confess because negative 8

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.640 
also want to confess because negative 8
is<00:04:32.790> better<00:04:32.820> than<00:04:33.210> negative<00:04:33.540> 12<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.590> you

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
is better than negative 12 and so you

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.500 
is better than negative 12 and so you
ended<00:04:35.100> up<00:04:35.190> starting<00:04:35.820> out<00:04:35.940> with<00:04:36.060> 4<00:04:36.360> different

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
ended up starting out with 4 different

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.180 
ended up starting out with 4 different
outcomes<00:04:37.050> possible<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.770> but<00:04:37.920> we<00:04:38.010> know<00:04:38.160> that

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
outcomes possible here but we know that

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.950 
outcomes possible here but we know that
there's<00:04:38.460> only<00:04:38.610> one<00:04:38.880> sensible<00:04:39.300> outcome<00:04:39.750> and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
there's only one sensible outcome and

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.100 
there's only one sensible outcome and
that's<00:04:40.320> for<00:04:40.560> both<00:04:40.590> players<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.490> confess<00:04:42.110> now

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
that's for both players to confess now

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.750 
that's for both players to confess now
when<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.680> first<00:04:43.830> show<00:04:44.070> this<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.460> people<00:04:44.730> who

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
when you first show this to people who

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.400 
when you first show this to people who
are<00:04:44.910> new<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.090> game<00:04:45.330> theory<00:04:45.600> they'll<00:04:45.870> ask<00:04:46.170> you

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
are new to game theory they'll ask you

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.840 
are new to game theory they'll ask you
that<00:04:46.770> doesn't<00:04:46.950> make<00:04:47.160> sense<00:04:47.340> why<00:04:47.490> they<00:04:47.670> end<00:04:47.790> up

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
that doesn't make sense why they end up

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.460 
that doesn't make sense why they end up
in<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.090> outcome<00:04:48.270> right<00:04:48.570> here<00:04:48.810> when<00:04:49.230> this

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
in this outcome right here when this

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.200 
in this outcome right here when this
outcome<00:04:49.920> when<00:04:50.310> they<00:04:50.400> both<00:04:50.550> keep<00:04:50.760> quiet<00:04:50.940> is

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
outcome when they both keep quiet is

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.060 
outcome when they both keep quiet is
mutually<00:04:51.720> better<00:04:51.900> for<00:04:52.170> them<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.470> it's<00:04:52.830> true

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
mutually better for them and it's true

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.950 
mutually better for them and it's true
this<00:04:53.250> is<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.490> better<00:04:53.880> outcome<00:04:54.180> for<00:04:54.570> both<00:04:54.630> the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
this is a better outcome for both the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.630 
this is a better outcome for both the
players<00:04:55.200> collectively<00:04:56.010> right<00:04:56.310> because

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
players collectively right because

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.490 
players collectively right because
negative<00:04:57.000> 1<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.420> negative<00:04:57.450> 1<00:04:58.050> is<00:04:58.320> better

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
negative 1 and negative 1 is better

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.860 
negative 1 and negative 1 is better
individually<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.670> collectively<00:04:59.870> than

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
individually and collectively than

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.070 
individually and collectively than
confessing<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:01.890> ending<00:05:02.640> up<00:05:02.760> in<00:05:02.880> 8<00:05:03.300> 8<00:05:03.870> months

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
confessing and ending up in 8 8 months

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.260 
confessing and ending up in 8 8 months
in<00:05:04.170> jail<00:05:04.260> apiece<00:05:04.620> but<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.580> reason<00:05:06.000> that<00:05:06.150> this

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
in jail apiece but the reason that this

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.630 
in jail apiece but the reason that this
outcome<00:05:06.540> isn't<00:05:06.960> sensible<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:07.890> because<00:05:08.220> each

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
outcome isn't sensible is because each

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.940 
outcome isn't sensible is because each
of<00:05:08.910> them<00:05:09.060> can<00:05:09.240> individually<00:05:09.990> do<00:05:10.170> better<00:05:10.410> by

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
of them can individually do better by

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.100 
of them can individually do better by
switching<00:05:11.340> off<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.640> confess<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:12.960> there

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
switching off to confess and so there

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.350 
switching off to confess and so there
isn't<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.560> stable<00:05:14.160> sort<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:14.670> solution<00:05:15.150> here

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
isn't a stable sort of solution here

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.970 
isn't a stable sort of solution here
because<00:05:15.660> they<00:05:15.840> can<00:05:15.990> always<00:05:16.380> do<00:05:16.560> better<00:05:16.770> by

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
because they can always do better by

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.410 
because they can always do better by
flipping<00:05:17.280> their<00:05:17.520> strategies<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.030> going<00:05:18.330> to

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
flipping their strategies and going to

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.660 
flipping their strategies and going to
confess<00:05:18.750> even<00:05:19.530> if<00:05:19.620> they<00:05:19.740> agree<00:05:20.040> to<00:05:20.070> do<00:05:20.370> this<00:05:20.490> in

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
confess even if they agree to do this in

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.760 
confess even if they agree to do this in
the<00:05:20.910> in<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.750> time<00:05:22.320> before<00:05:22.500> they<00:05:22.740> actually

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
the in the time before they actually

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.770 
the in the time before they actually
went<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.340> interrogation<00:05:24.000> rooms<00:05:24.210> those

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
went to the interrogation rooms those

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.210 
went to the interrogation rooms those
sorts<00:05:25.050> of<00:05:25.110> agreements<00:05:25.320> don't<00:05:25.770> actually

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
sorts of agreements don't actually

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.160 
sorts of agreements don't actually
withstand<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.150> test<00:05:27.330> of<00:05:27.480> time<00:05:27.540> because<00:05:27.990> as

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
withstand the test of time because as

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.600 
withstand the test of time because as
soon<00:05:28.380> as<00:05:28.530> they<00:05:28.680> get<00:05:28.830> into<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.190> room<00:05:29.400> and

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
soon as they get into the room and

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.100 
soon as they get into the room and
actually<00:05:29.700> had<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.120> confess<00:05:30.450> or<00:05:30.690> keep<00:05:30.870> quiet

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
actually had to confess or keep quiet

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.020 
actually had to confess or keep quiet
it's<00:05:31.740> in<00:05:31.920> their<00:05:32.070> mutual<00:05:32.340> it's<00:05:32.790> in<00:05:32.910> their

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
it's in their mutual it's in their

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.360 
it's in their mutual it's in their
individual<00:05:33.510> rather<00:05:33.750> interest<00:05:34.290> to<00:05:34.890> confess

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
individual rather interest to confess

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.760 
individual rather interest to confess
and<00:05:35.610> not<00:05:35.670> keep<00:05:36.180> quiet<00:05:36.450> and<00:05:36.750> so<00:05:37.320> that's<00:05:37.470> why<00:05:37.620> we

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
and not keep quiet and so that's why we

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.930 
and not keep quiet and so that's why we
think<00:05:37.920> that<00:05:38.040> this<00:05:38.250> is<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.550> only<00:05:38.700> outcome

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
think that this is the only outcome

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.430 
think that this is the only outcome
that's<00:05:39.360> sensible<00:05:39.690> when<00:05:39.960> both<00:05:40.110> of<00:05:40.140> the<00:05:40.320> players

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
that's sensible when both of the players

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.920 
that's sensible when both of the players
confess<00:05:40.950> so<00:05:41.730> that<00:05:41.970> is<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.570> prisoner's

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
confess so that is the prisoner's

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.420 
confess so that is the prisoner's
dilemma<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.440> strict<00:05:43.860> dominance<00:05:44.190> in<00:05:44.370> a

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
dilemma and strict dominance in a

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.550 
dilemma and strict dominance in a
nutshell<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:45.000> in<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.900> next<00:05:46.080> video<00:05:46.290> we<00:05:46.530> will
