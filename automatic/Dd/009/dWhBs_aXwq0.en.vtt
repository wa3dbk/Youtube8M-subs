00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.400
 it suggests every day his words 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.690
 on the bass these two things the lru 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.769
 a person left me a comment 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.859
 but first I want to say thank you to 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.599
 1415 view for my life of the loud cries live 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.619
 and here we go down comments 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.899
 that they hate audric dukekou alone 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.469
 human that sound duo fucking I soak 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.610
 crazy one of the microphone is very bad can 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.140
 you confirm 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.399
 in the end it would seem that 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.780
 watts she does not believe wide angle 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.440
 to be a big disadvantage for a beautiful 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.989
 so yeah shot for an act and but 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.600
 then the camera has a very good sound info 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.430
 know it the only shot the end of May and 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.320
 picks up the sound well I think it says 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.890
 like this stove actually it's the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.600
 case what this killer then I take 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.119
 with the other ben yeah then you want here 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.780
 so you disassemble if you can put a 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:18.320
 adapter for for micro so like 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.520
 like lego pro but the problem is 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:28.179
 that in the case came to 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.179
 admit it an upside down jaser 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:41.690
 we will say that this is what I 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.560
 did you find that m if you see there we see 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.660
 the interior esquieu the clasp they have it 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.239
 set at level 1 at the holes this 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.569
 which means that we can not put 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:56.539
 accessories and compare the group in 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.470
 many who close above what 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.039
 makes it much more convenient 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.770
 to put the accessories and others 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:07.940
 so bahia means if you want I 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.720
 imagined receives it with a small rod 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.459
 in scrap of black color you him 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.530
 done at the end of the camera so 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.650
 all around so I'll have to fold it 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.170
 the all I see so this will be fixed 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.750
 between actera just buy another 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.269
 another what we did that is a 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.470
 fix below is used which 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.400
 does that will hold cleat but the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.940
 problem is that he will have no 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.190
 protection 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.739
 but you can access here but I 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.110
 repeat there will be no protection 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.850
 otherwise you buy a box like that 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.670
 simply to be who comes 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.420
 cut here with a saw or other 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.690
 to remove that then you withdraw the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.480
 you will be able to follow your camera this 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.740
 that will affect access to all of that right 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.300
 close and put a system 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.030
 of elastics to hold all 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.980
 so that will be protected then there where to be 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.880
 three access wood is that it will be 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.290
 more waterproof 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.700
 so that's the only problem for 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.520
 picking because the colleague she 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.870
 has a very good sound but that's the 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.040
 case that is that is very badly done 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.390
 so then for languages ​​start to 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.930
 the angle I think she has a very 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.870
 good angle so then I'll see this 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.270
 would be tests then then if i do 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.560
 no video but about the state of his 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.410
 supporters of whom they simply have the 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.810
 even so I will not see if you do not see 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.150
 happened to video that's where science and 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.040
 I have not found so bah if it was 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.700
 raw live that's what the goods is just 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.160
 the quality which is slightly less good 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.590
 that cunego promises but it's really 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.310
 reasonable here I hope I could 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.670
 help you then here is yes a little 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.660
 thing plus this moment just stop 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.160
