project and this is what he had to say

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.700 
project and this is what he had to say
check<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.040> out<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.150> met<00:02:06.750> about<00:02:07.049> two<00:02:07.500> years

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
check it out and I met about two years

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.869 
check it out and I met about two years
ago<00:02:07.860> he<00:02:09.379> came<00:02:10.379> out<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.860> build<00:02:11.370> an<00:02:11.489> Earthship

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
ago he came out to build an Earthship

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.970 
ago he came out to build an Earthship
out<00:02:12.209> here<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.720> same<00:02:12.900> community<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.379> live<00:02:13.709> in

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
out here in the same community I live in

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.000 
out here in the same community I live in
Towson<00:02:14.790> Mexico<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:16.200> he<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.980> just

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
Towson Mexico and and he and I just

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.220 
Towson Mexico and and he and I just
started<00:02:17.489> talking<00:02:17.849> about<00:02:18.230> sustainable

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
started talking about sustainable

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.400 
started talking about sustainable
building<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
building and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.590 
building and
how<00:02:21.130> we<00:02:21.190> could<00:02:21.670> conduct<00:02:22.180> workshops<00:02:23.370> that

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
how we could conduct workshops that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.160 
how we could conduct workshops that
where<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.900> could<00:02:26.100> not<00:02:27.100> necessarily<00:02:27.670> about<00:02:28.170> fur

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
where we could not necessarily about fur

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.750 
where we could not necessarily about fur
chips<00:02:29.500> because<00:02:30.100> that's<00:02:30.340> already<00:02:30.550> done

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
chips because that's already done

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.370 
chips because that's already done
there's<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.150> great<00:02:31.300> forum<00:02:31.600> for<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.200> Dan

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
there's a great forum for that so Dan

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.990 
there's a great forum for that so Dan
and<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.560> are<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.800> was<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.070> well<00:02:33.220> let's<00:02:33.730> develop

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
and I are it was like well let's develop

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.910 
and I are it was like well let's develop
three<00:02:34.390> or<00:02:34.480> four<00:02:34.660> different<00:02:34.960> prototype

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
three or four different prototype

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.660 
three or four different prototype
prototypical<00:02:36.730> type<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.090> buildings<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:38.670> maybe

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
prototypical type of buildings and maybe

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.340 
prototypical type of buildings and maybe
we<00:02:39.850> can<00:02:40.000> find<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.270> piece<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.570> land<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.930> conduct

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
we can find a piece of land to conduct

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.980 
we can find a piece of land to conduct
these<00:02:41.560> building<00:02:42.100> types<00:02:42.310> on<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.990> let's

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
these building types on and let's

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.200 
these building types on and let's
advertise<00:02:44.770> for<00:02:45.100> people<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.760> come<00:02:45.940> and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
advertise for people to come and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.010 
advertise for people to come and
participate<00:02:46.480> observe<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.890> let's<00:02:48.670> get<00:02:48.850> this

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
participate observe and let's get this

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.350 
participate observe and let's get this
documented<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.260> these<00:02:50.380> things<00:02:50.620> well<00:02:50.860> and

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
documented and these things well and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.060 
documented and these things well and
let's<00:02:52.360> get<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:52.750> an<00:02:52.930> open<00:02:53.290> source<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:53.920> them

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
let's get it on an open source for them

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.320 
let's get it on an open source for them
so<00:02:54.640> they<00:02:55.330> can<00:02:55.360> be<00:02:55.770> globally<00:02:56.770> accessed<00:02:57.730> by

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
so they can be globally accessed by

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.960 
so they can be globally accessed by
people<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:59.350> information<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.310> locally

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
people this information and locally

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.180 
people this information and locally
access<00:03:01.450> by<00:03:01.690> people<00:03:02.050> who<00:03:02.140> participate<00:03:02.860> in<00:03:02.890> the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
access by people who participate in the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.730 
access by people who participate in the
building<00:03:03.490> process<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.510> they<00:03:05.500> have<00:03:05.590> an

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
building process so they have an

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.610 
building process so they have an
opportunity<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.430> build<00:03:07.330> prototype<00:03:07.990> one<00:03:08.260> in

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
opportunity to build prototype one in

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.090 
opportunity to build prototype one in
