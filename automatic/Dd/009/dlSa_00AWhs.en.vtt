00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.680
so I'll mark now what one other areas
that we spend a lot of time on was

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.830
functionality

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.540
he soon use purpose purposeful practical

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.880
features and functions I call it no
gimmicks

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.600
no gimmicks on on the GMC your the
Chevrolet into

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.630
specifically when it comes to the box
this so this corner step

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.660
look at this corner step in this pumper
integrated in there for a large boat

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.670
that can easily yup urge both their

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.920
have we seen this on the Avalanche did
see that some heritage in the other

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.460
sonya is really resonated with a
avalanche customers

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.780
but we are but we want to provide

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.910
purposeful practical east to our
customers so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.350
this corner staff he's enough with a
specifically designed

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.700
hand-hold pocket here this is a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.840
years for customers know what formally
be known as a stake pocket right

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.089
has been designed for your hand to go in
here easy so it's

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.330
one step one hand in urine in the bed

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.820
talk to me a little bit about rolled
steel

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.380
versus stamped steel you guys made it
beyond that's a big deal

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.380
are a floor and our souls

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.520
our role form that allows us to use a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.850
I higher strength steels and a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.659
allows for more performance versus
stamped and in

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.100
capability for carrying loled I mean
we're really excited about this week we

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.999
test these boxes to the extremes so you
havin give us

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.039
given us any GW numbers are payload
capacity members are towing members

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.920
at this that mean are we going to get a
bigger payload number

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.880
yeah out of this box there will be an
increase in pay low in an increase in

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.520
trailer

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.829
I miss trucks and we we

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.439
took attacked when we did these on
trucks that tho

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.469
when we design an engineer

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.109
something we will take mass over

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.800
and will also increase its performance
so for example the frame on this truck

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.620
is our our signature I reform frame uses
high strength steels

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.280
in the cross members we've been able to
across the board depending on cab style

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.689
regular cab to from cat took about 20
kilograms

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.260
mass out of the frame all at the same
time as I said earlier will be

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.060
increasing our capabilities

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.620
kilograms and 2.2

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.780
pounds per kilogram of solvent collette
over forty yes and so it's pretty

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.830
significant to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.430
I talked about her axles for the v8s I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.269
we threw brand new axle to brand new so
a dedicated one for the 53 dedicated for

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:46.950
62

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.549
yes the 53 is a nine and a half the 62

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.420
was a 93 quarter her the for the high
power high torque at the 62 was the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.189
ninth record

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.860
but in Seoul redesigning the nine and a
half which is featured on today's

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.810
trucks I'm we took about 10 kilograms

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.799
other that well improving its
capabilities there for the additional

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.060
horsepower and torque that we will be
providing our

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.239
needed so the we went into this program
saying hey

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.629
I'm when when we're redesigning in
reengineering

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.640
a component we're going to not only take
an asset over

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.879
1.2 increase its capabilities talk about
towing we've talked about the frame

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.969
they've are we gonna get the towing
numbers with Jay 2807

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.379
or as is that coming when the rest of
the industry goes to 20 yeah I went when

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.900
the rest the industry goes it

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.760
that's a great question I G 2006 2007
when the industry goals

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.269
GM is is prepared israel's so you've
done all the testing you've got all the

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:46.810
numbers

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.829
yes nice until four RAM get there

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.409
any other info and we're doing that
because we don't wanna keep confuse

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.930
cultures in the workplace

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.650
yeah night you talk about the different
frame makes for the different cams

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.489
can we talk a little bit about the cab
configurations because there are some

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.780
things that are new here with this mod
yeah exactly and I think one thing on

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.599
this crew cab model that

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.480
his new that is really going to hit home
for the customers that they've asked for

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.200
is the availability of a six and a half
with box that's brand new you guys have

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.549
never had a rough correct so you'll be
able to get

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.010
a five-foot eight-inch box which is like
today struck or

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.220
you can option up to a six and a half
foot box

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.310
should you desire the additional fall
let's talk about the cab a little bit

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.580
more

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.020
take a closer look sounds good

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.520
%uh
