00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.660
 the camera knows no mercy and takes 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.059
 Just open everything up and take care of that 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.030
 that no one forgets what happened 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.279
 Luckily because here are the funniest 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.279
 tv breaks of the year 2014 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.270
 some people just do what they do 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:44.170
 want like this 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:47.850
 newsreader in alaska with it 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.850
 probably did not expect her colleague 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.220
 Nobody likes burbot in the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.260
 background during a meeting and 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.479
 this also applies to this bbc reporter 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.479
 his mouth is banned without further ado 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.659
 but at least that was a very polite one 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.260
 British style to say you should 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.260
 shut up 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.360
 sometimes it's pretty damn hard 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.960
 the attention of the bartender too 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.729
 win 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.060
 pay attention to the man in the 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.539
 background because he does not get a drink 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.539
 he simply improvises 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.390
 It's so exciting when you have a new one 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.100
 you get toys and you just do it 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.100
 can not wait is unpack 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.670
 bad enough that the expensive iphone 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.900
 but fell off then laughs 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.900
 reporters are also about it 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.770
 actually it should be a quiet 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.000
 polite discussion about the politics in the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.220
 be the middle east 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.220
 but the exact opposite was the case 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.600
 these journalists should not be on any 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.430
 fall the next peace negotiations 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.430
 moderate in the middle east 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.260
 whether it is the boss's turn 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.480
 to say or with one 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.500
 Colleagues to each other is one 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.450
 camera 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.450
 then something like that will never be forgotten
