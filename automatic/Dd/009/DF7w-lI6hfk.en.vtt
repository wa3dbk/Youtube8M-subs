very<00:01:24.869> fast<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.950> looks<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.189> we've<00:01:26.369> got<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
very fast and it looks like we've got a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.240 
very fast and it looks like we've got a
few<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:26.939> jumps<00:01:27.479> coming<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.560> let's<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.130> if

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
few more jumps coming up so let's see if

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
few more jumps coming up so let's see if
we<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.670> come<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.240> let's<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.140> make

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
away from me and Wow even the plane I
like<00:01:43.530> how<00:01:43.710> during<00:01:44.280> these<00:01:44.369> missions<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.909> add

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
like how during these missions they add

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
like how during these missions they add
these<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.630> effects<00:01:46.049> planes<00:01:46.890> flying<00:01:47.220> over

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
these like effects planes flying over

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.270 
these like effects planes flying over
you<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.909> stuff<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:48.960> okay<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.979> kind

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.020 
you and stuff like that but okay we kind
of<00:01:50.369> lost<00:01:50.610> our<00:01:50.880> target<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.799> we're<00:01:52.799> oh<00:01:53.130> oh<00:01:53.579> wait

of lost our target here we're oh oh wait
here<00:01:54.270> okay<00:01:54.630> let's<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.140> cut<00:01:55.259> him

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
here okay let's see if we can cut him

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.810 
here okay let's see if we can cut him
off<00:01:55.439> yes<00:01:55.799> yes<00:01:56.280> yes<00:01:56.610> yeah<00:01:57.450> oh<00:01:57.689> yes<00:01:58.490> nailed<00:01:59.490> him

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
off yes yes yes yeah oh yes nailed him

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.670 
off yes yes yes yeah oh yes nailed him
but<00:02:00.180> okay<00:02:00.630> apparently<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.200> wasn't<00:02:01.409> hard

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
but okay apparently that wasn't hard

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.310 
but okay apparently that wasn't hard
enough<00:02:01.770> yet<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.780> guess<00:02:03.780> we're<00:02:04.020> gonna<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
enough yet I guess we're gonna have to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.679 
enough yet I guess we're gonna have to
hit<00:02:04.500> him<00:02:04.590> again<00:02:04.829> or<00:02:04.860> her<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> forget<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.540> is

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
hit him again or her I forget if this is

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.779 
hit him again or her I forget if this is
a<00:02:06.719> male<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> female<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.860> wasn't<00:02:08.220> paying<00:02:08.399> total

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
a male or a female I wasn't paying total

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.660 
a male or a female I wasn't paying total
attention<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:10.110> we're<00:02:11.069> getting<00:02:11.310> down<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
attention so we're getting down to the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.699 
attention so we're getting down to the
1-minute<00:02:12.030> mark<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.540> crunch<00:02:12.930> time

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
1-minute mark it is crunch time

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.080 
1-minute mark it is crunch time
so<00:02:13.859> let's<00:02:14.040> keep<00:02:14.189> traveling<00:02:14.609> across<00:02:14.790> these

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so let's keep traveling across these

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.479 
so let's keep traveling across these
dunes<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.109> why<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.890> guy<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.250> fast

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
epic so we got bronze but that's okay

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.789 
epic so we got bronze but that's okay
new<00:03:02.609> exhaust<00:03:02.939> part<00:03:03.239> one<00:03:03.450> nice<00:03:04.169> we'll<00:03:04.680> be

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
new exhaust part one nice we'll be

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.729

putting<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.099> on<00:03:05.310> our<00:03:05.489> Nissan<00:03:06.060> 370z<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.709> I

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
putting that on our Nissan 370z so I

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.440 
putting that on our Nissan 370z so I
guess<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.519> pretty<00:03:08.730> much<00:03:08.790> wraps<00:03:09.090> up<00:03:09.299> this

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
guess that pretty much wraps up this

guess that pretty much wraps up this
