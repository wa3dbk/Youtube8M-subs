00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
all over again we took a different

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.400 
all over again we took a different
approach<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.670> global<00:00:51.030> events<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.809> means<00:00:52.109> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
approach with global events it means a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
approach with global events it means a
lot<00:00:52.770> more<00:00:52.949> playing<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> lot<00:00:53.850> less<00:00:53.879> awaiting

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
lot more playing and a lot less awaiting

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.330 
lot more playing and a lot less awaiting
the<00:00:55.079> way<00:00:55.199> global<00:00:55.559> events<00:00:55.859> works<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.309> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the way global events works is that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
the way global events works is that
there's<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> constant<00:00:57.149> ongoing<00:00:57.480> live

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
