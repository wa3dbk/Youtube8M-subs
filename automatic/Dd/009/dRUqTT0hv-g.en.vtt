00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.910
 guys girls hi everyone I'm 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.790
 untied laces and this is minecraft 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.730
 today I bring you a tutorial like all 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.889
 Monday how to make a spider farm 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.929
 of cave that is to say are the spiders that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.789
 they come out in the dungeons is that they are 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.410
 greenish thirties a little ugly and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.730
 disgusting that give a lot for sack and there 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.929
 a lot of cobwebs always around 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.490
 of the rest so I'm going to show you how 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:30.060
 make a farm from that little 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.529
 rest is still good and good since adding that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.300
 I'm preparing especially my 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.079
 subscribers to which we arrived on 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.149
 Sunday 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.350
 and as soon as I have, I'll take it out because 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.870
 the truth that is taking me a 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.289
 little bit of work and I have people gathering 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.160
 and such and good you'll see how it surprises you 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.100
 and they like it so good, let's start 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.949
 pum pum 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.329
 it's basically going to be the logo what 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.469
 what are we going to do to create our 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.579
 grass farm that 's the prototype 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.589
 what do you see there we will teach 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.390
 still because I 'm preparing it a 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.189
 little more than anything for spiders that do not 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.680
 be of cave when I have it finished 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.710
 and later I 'll put them on 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.380
 small steps that I'm doing good at 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.840
 the one that I'm going to show you how it works 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:19.659
 we go to difficulty then easy 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.520
 for example we take here is 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.960
 you imagine that there is a backup and all the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.509
 spiders with a hat water has come 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.490
 here and it's worth I know I'm doing the 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.600
 model I'm not explaining how they have 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.159
 to get the spiders that already as 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.719
 you always want with a trickle 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.640
 of water you have already seen on my farm 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.320
 skeletons 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.840
 you can have them all come here and they 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.810
 together we make here in agreement 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.060
 we give with our vote that goes to 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:49.340
 move the lapis lazuli crushing the spider 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.880
 and will leave it to two strokes or 1 1 and 2 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.090
 dies of two dies dies and has more 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.430
 all experience and then all the wool with 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.189
 the spider eyes and the truth that comes 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.759
 very good to do questions worth 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:07.890
 well basically this works here 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.620
 the block below 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.060
 we put together many we give all 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.209
 they come up suddenly and when you press it 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.650
 makes the signal stay adjusted 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.290
 that stays just two blocked 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.520
 blows I will explain how it is done 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.680
 I'm going to remove the videos so that I do not 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.340
 bother 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.050
 well we have here what you want there 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.890
 something different that I always take the same 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.050
 when catching 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:44.420
 the gold 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:48.710
 simplest 4 is worth 12 for 4 1 2 3 and 4 and 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.300
 here the same is true can we here we are 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.150
 because if it does not matter as if on this side 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.090
 from the other 1 here came here and one here 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.420
 we take a little bit of the rest and a back 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.270
 and here and there in agreement 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.480
 we take a buyer that you can 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.470
 do and we can do them so that two and 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.470
 then here one 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.880
 that more than more buttons better those of 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.770
 wood when I say to the modeled ones of 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.770
 stone that I like more 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.360
 is here and this blog 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.480
 I have already put you know that to me the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.240
 clay is I love it so nothing the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.260
 volume up and down is down 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.260
 will move be here 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.000
 Hong Kong 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.980
 and another one right next to it that's going to 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.330
 move the top 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.780
 and good on the sheet too but if 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.780
 we leave it does not come back to see very well 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:54.350
 I'm more out now, we want a 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.650
 signal of a lamp we go from the rest 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.930
 we also want lapis lazuli 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.270
 you can also use iron or you can use 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.560
 gold block or diamond voucher arrived 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.410
 the one with the blue skin and that is going to be 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.160
 always the cheapest capitulations not 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.060
 it's good for nothing 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.140
 he goes up in agreement and then 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.140
 the bust down 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.359
 the lamp next to the lapis lazuli and 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.320
 then fill it in, it 's all you want 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.320
 in the form of 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.240
 if you leave this empty here that is 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.240
 where the spiders are going 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.690
 and nothing we fill in over lapis lazuli 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.250
 we put a block and we will place a 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.720
 iron bar according to such that there is 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.190
 this is going to make spiders can not 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.770
 climb up but we if we go 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.259
 to be able to hit down is worth 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.630
 saying this means that they can not escape 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.680
 lamp what you are going to do is that 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.990
 imagine what all this we have 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.520
 covered when we have the 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.960
 button is going to turn on and when it 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.960
 turn off is that it's over 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:05.399
 he turned off 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.639
 And besides, I always hope to have this 

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.639
 switched on 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.639
 there, perfect that the 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.639
 spiders and ready 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.099
 and we're going to prove it works because what 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.340
 we have done, we have to prove it to the year of 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.340
 cave 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.449
 and now we have to see the difficulty 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.720
 there is 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:34.030
 we give 211 I do not speak no 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.860
 to the button the light turns on 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:42.130
 lapis lazuli moves to crush the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.510
 spider and two strokes 1 and 2 perfect us 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.100
 we would take all the experience and we 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.270
 we would take 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.500
 the objects that swarm and good this 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.060
 has been the eye of the people has been 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.310
 generated in a moment I saw you I can not 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.419
 this has been the tutorial there if it has 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.770
 liked to like subscribe and nothing the 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.210
 next day more and better you know that 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.710
 media touch touch I think I have 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.750
 I'm going to do it 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.550
 in your comments but let's go if 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.120
 you want to add one or the other you already know 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.620
 leave it to me written and ready and good until 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.620
