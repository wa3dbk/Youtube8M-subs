 Important Point of Safety Performance of Studless Tires 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:10.800

 If you keep the standbus tires firmly and carefully 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:46.030
 If it is made in the bottom of 2 years, no major change appears in its performance. 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:49.980
 The ability is proved by the performance comparison test 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.980
