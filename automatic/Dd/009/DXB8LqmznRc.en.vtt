00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.290
 welcome everyone to our channel in this 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.140
 I will show the video how to attach the firefly 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.869
 for night fishing on the edge of vershinki 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.189
 feeder rods 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.320
 Generally for mounting fireflies on 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.980
 rods there are such special 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.590
 adapters 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.080
 By the way, I showed about them already in one of 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.870
 previous videos I'm on these adapters 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.440
 there is one drawback they can not be fixed 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.129
 on the very edge I will now demonstrate 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.909
 so we wear it and how we see that he 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.979
 just hanging out spinning around 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:49.640
 it does not suit us because the firefly 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.470
 should not touch and cord and during 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.339
 castings but also generally while fishing 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.339
 Well, now try a little lower 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.610
 as we see the same thing everything revolves everything 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:16.030
 hanging out 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:21.000
 try even lower here of course already 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.000
 better but still not what 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.690
 I try even lower here and only here will be 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.290
 ok stand our 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.530
 firefly here but as you can see he 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.479
 far enough from the tip of course 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.840
 have him be here then 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.160
 bite will be visible but I assure you that 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.899
 absolutely not as if he was standing on 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.770
 very edge that's why our task 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.100
 put a firefly 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.290
 it is on the very edge I am actually here 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.380
 everything is easy 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.380
 take any package of fireflies and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.380
 opening 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.650
 in all packages there is usually 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.600
 such a transparent tube, it is generally 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.830
 used for mounting fireflies and 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.130
 on floats 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.490
 but now we need it for 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.590
 mounting firefly on vershinka also 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.209
 here is this adapter included 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:36.370
 my immediately put off the side and 20.10 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:42.320
 man we lay down and we will need one 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:47.140
 we take our tubule and we cut off the scissors 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.140
 a piece of tube width of 2 3 millimeters 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.440
 one 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:59.810
 and exactly the same 2 here we got 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:04.100
 as if two such a little ring here they are two 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:09.260
 ringlet width of 2 3 millimeters and now 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:14.590
 we take our vershinka and our task is these 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:18.739
 two little rings put on the tip for this we 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:25.580
 ring like this 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:28.060
 tulip here and pull the tube here 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.930
 elastic it expands a little 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.420
 so there will be no problems 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.780
 Here they put on one ring and a second sofa 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.780
 little ring 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.430
 now take the firefly 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:51.400
 and break it in half so the reaction goes 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.019
 it began to glow then one end 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:01.180
 flower insert into one tube here 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:10.269
 that way the second end 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:12.730
 firefly insert another tube all 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.109
 in such a simple way we reliably 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.840
 fixed firefly 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.400
 at the very edge of the feeder tip and now 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.650
 at night we won't miss even one 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.080
 the most cautious bites of course only 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.940
 if we are not going to sleep thank you for your attention
