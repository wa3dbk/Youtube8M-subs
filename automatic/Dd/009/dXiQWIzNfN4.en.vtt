00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello everyone , we will continue to do ours 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.200
 firewood and today we will do so 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.860
 us a cap could not marry our 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.799
 screen Well the two colors can be done 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.289
 copy this group here 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.380
 then we change its name and now 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.199
 let's change events to the first thing we 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.599
 we will do everywhere we remove this -150 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:33.600
 so we remove the video is not 150 plus 150 but this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.890
 we do not need it here but now note 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.180
 will be right here 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 change our event so well now 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.520
 us will clean up our system here we are 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.230
 must choose our cursor that is we 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:57.500
 here must determine the position of x and 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:05.780
 here we write scrolling on x 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.780
 grass plus not from -10 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.350
 so but now it can be an event 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.350
 copy transfer downgraded 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.939
 such a system is no longer needed here 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.939
 here we change the right on the left 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:41.950
 don't put no to minus 10 plus 10 here 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.860
 you can also take the system everywhere 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:54.770
 here we set not to define courses for 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:59.360
 x and y and here we write not left by 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:06.770
 bottom that is devoid of this 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:10.429
 and write me x and y y so now it's 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.930
 also can be copied only here we are 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.750
 put a minus here we have a plus and 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.959
 Now we have our bottom on top then 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:26.870
 there is on the top and now we look at that 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.020
 us out of this is our mouse 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.020
 can't get off our screen 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.470
 one of the most faithful 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.360
 such simple scrolling creatures 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.489
 I'll tell you the screen now quickly 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.970
 another option is to scroll the screen 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.230
 so let's change here first we 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:58.989
 name are you a group for this group we 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.989
 call the mouse does not come out 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.090
 behind the screen 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.950
 let's say so and now note 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.950
 make such an event so that these are ours 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.200
 events didn't work if we call on 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:23.799
 enter make such a network if we 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:26.830
 clicked on let's say on the right button 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.660
 mouse then we will work it so 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.000
 events are now quick how to make 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.590
 alternative way to scroll nude 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.200
 may seem a little way 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.720
 it is easier the husband more difficult I do not know but if 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.220
 explain all the events about how it seems 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.530
 a little more difficult if 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.390
 how to do it then it will be a little bit 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.670
 easier 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.230
 Well, there you need to know more all the code, but how 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.170
 I myself will not write I quickly him 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.970
 copy and then you throw off in the description 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.629
 if you like you can do 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.590
 so or so well let's start like this 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:09.010
 create new scrolling system events 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:11.709
 on x scrolling on x and here we paste 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.709
 This is the code we have here. 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:19.260
 scrolling x minus distance 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:23.740
 mouse scream scrolling onyx squalene 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.039
 scrolling a y divided by thirty two 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.950
 multiplied by the cosine of the angle of the mouse x the mouse 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:33.160
 y scrolling mix 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.169
 scrolling y didnâ€™t understand anything 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.760
 so even trying to explain is not 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:44.590
 I will now create new events 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.380
 scrolling system on y and here we are 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.180
 We enter here such a code to explain I 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.760
 him not going so well now let's 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.039
 let's see what we have and now 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.080
 let's see what we did here 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.210
 see we started working truth click 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.099
 right click then we are talking about such 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.789
 rabbit and with us being calculated 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.419
 distance where our mouse and if our 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.840
 mouse 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:11.080
 in the middle of the screen we have a king from very 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.729
 slowly and if we bring to the commune 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.870
 s loot we increase immediately 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.240
 speed 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.320
 Well, I think today we will finish everything 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.390
 Thank you for watching 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.840
 I think you can choose what 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.400
 I prefer the way you like 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.180
 more like the way I 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.930
 explained and did because he is more 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.760
 simple more clear well I think you 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.270
 you can choose the way that 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.190
 do you like well for today we 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.350
 finish our lesson everyone thanks for
