want<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.260> get<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> Pistons<00:00:10.950> out<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.750> so

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
want to get the Pistons out of it so

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.030 
want to get the Pistons out of it so
what<00:00:12.960> I'm<00:00:13.019> going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.590> I'm<00:00:13.710> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.889> go

ahead<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.460> put<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.030> board<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.480> here<00:00:15.630> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
ahead and put this board in here to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.269 
ahead and put this board in here to
guard<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> piston<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.650> they<00:00:16.740> don't<00:00:16.920> get<00:00:17.039> too

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
guard the piston so they don't get too

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.630 
guard the piston so they don't get too
wild<00:00:17.490> when<00:00:17.730> they<00:00:17.820> come<00:00:18.029> out<00:00:19.400> using<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.460> little

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
wild when they come out using a little

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.920 
wild when they come out using a little
bit<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.880> compressed<00:00:21.270> air<00:00:26.449> and<00:00:27.449> watch<00:00:27.689> your

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
bit of compressed air and watch your

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.359 
bit of compressed air and watch your
fingers<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.410> don't<00:00:28.529> behind<00:00:29.250> something<00:00:31.369> ain't

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
fingers you don't behind something ain't

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.020 
fingers you don't behind something ain't
get<00:00:32.520> second<00:00:33.120> want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> come<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:35.480> it's<00:00:36.480> jammed

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
get second want to come out it's jammed

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:53.290 
get second want to come out it's jammed
good<00:00:39.030> sign<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> brake<00:00:39.750> problem<00:00:39.960> coming<00:00:40.410> on

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.700 

okay<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> want<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> show<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.109> meant<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
okay I want to show you what I meant on

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.180 
okay I want to show you what I meant on
my<00:00:55.980> ride<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.550> earlier<00:00:57.180> about<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.010> pits<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
my ride up earlier about the pits and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
my ride up earlier about the pits and
sliding<00:00:59.519> into<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> cylinders<00:01:00.180> properly<00:01:00.719> as

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
sliding into the cylinders properly as

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.249 
sliding into the cylinders properly as
you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.690> only<00:01:03.690> falls<00:01:04.019> in

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
you can see this one only falls in

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.440 
you can see this one only falls in
partial<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> rust<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
partial way because the rust and the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.200 
partial way because the rust and the
cylinder<00:01:06.900> where<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:09.200> just<00:01:10.200> drops<00:01:10.380> in

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
cylinder where this one just drops in

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.920 
cylinder where this one just drops in
that's<00:01:12.210> normal

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that's normal

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.580 
that's normal
this<00:01:13.649> isn't<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.020> rust

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
this isn't and as you can see the rust

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980 
this isn't and as you can see the rust
is<00:01:16.799> built<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> piston<00:01:18.180> causing<00:01:18.690> it<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
is built up on the piston causing it to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.460 
is built up on the piston causing it to
bind<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.039> will<00:01:20.190> not<00:01:20.220> pass<00:01:21.049> there<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> just

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
bind up it will not pass there it just

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.980 
bind up it will not pass there it just
even<00:01:22.740> got<00:01:22.950> stuck<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.700> there's<00:01:24.330> no<00:01:24.479> seals<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
even got stuck so there's no seals in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.740 
even got stuck so there's no seals in
there<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.350> seals<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.800> completely<00:01:26.190> removed

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
there the seals are completely removed

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.380 
there the seals are completely removed
so<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.220> got<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.369> cleanup<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:29.970> piston

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
so I got a little cleanup on my piston

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.730 
so I got a little cleanup on my piston
to<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.929> it<00:01:31.050> back<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> service

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
to do to get it back to the service

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.260 
to do to get it back to the service
okay<00:01:34.740> earlier<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.250> showed<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.700> hanging

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
okay earlier I showed you that hanging

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.899 
okay earlier I showed you that hanging
piston<00:01:36.840> okay<00:01:37.440> now<00:01:38.069> with<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.490> cleanup

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
piston okay now with a little cleanup

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.010 
piston okay now with a little cleanup
both<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.750> them<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:42.030> would<00:01:42.210> still<00:01:42.479> hang<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.810> dip

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
both of them that would still hang a dip

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.480 
both of them that would still hang a dip
a<00:01:43.259> little<00:01:43.470> bit<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.069> little<00:01:44.250> more

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
a little bit on it to be a little more

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.029 
a little bit on it to be a little more
clean<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.300> but<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.409> goes<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.920> now<00:01:47.159> no

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
clean up on it but it goes in now no

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.029 
clean up on it but it goes in now no
just<00:01:50.039> very<00:01:50.310> very<00:01:50.549> tight<00:01:51.500> right<00:01:52.500> at<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.679> bottom

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
just very very tight right at the bottom

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.639 
just very very tight right at the bottom
I<00:01:56.030> got<00:01:57.030> some<00:01:57.179> debris<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.750> hole<00:01:58.050> because<00:01:58.470> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
I got some debris in the hole because it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.650 
I got some debris in the hole because it
slides<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.190> normally<00:01:59.670> just<00:02:00.000> there's

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
slides in normally just there's

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.449 
slides in normally just there's
something<00:02:00.959> in<00:02:01.050> there<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.470> caught<00:02:01.800> cousins

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
something in there just caught cousins

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:03.109 
something in there just caught cousins
hang-up

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
hang-up

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.469 
hang-up
so<00:02:03.899> now<00:02:04.470> I<00:02:04.500> got<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:05.039> is<00:02:05.160> wash<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.700> copper<00:02:06.360> up

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
so now I got to do is wash the copper up

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.709 
so now I got to do is wash the copper up
real<00:02:06.750> good<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.140> reassemble
