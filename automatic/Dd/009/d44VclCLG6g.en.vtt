00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello to all today a new 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.610
 little video to represent the room 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.809
 of gaulle and has as promised but in a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.450
 first time I go first to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.180
 show with what materials I realize 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:22.529
 my project so to begin 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.859
 generally I draw I dont what 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.119
 I want to realize once drawn 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.570
 I take the odds and there I Thrace 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.739
 in cardboard like this so it's a 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.800
 special cardboard that makes 2 5 mm 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.800
 thick 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.520
 I trace my drawings I cut and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.120
 then 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.030
 I gather by means of a Scotch tape 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.730
 call craft once the piece 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.590
 is completely assembled I'm going 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.410
 to be able to cover with 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.379
 paper so here today I'm riding a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.630
 red hui simic paper that I used 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.860
 for the fog flanders 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.840
 so it was a paper that earns very 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.110
 very resistant and that really allows 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.210
 a lot of things besides who 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.290
 has the advantage of allowing my daughter to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.119
 play without a tree trunk of the half 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.509
 for a little more detail I you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.020
 shows a project in progress 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.820
 so it's a bunk bed like you 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 can see for the moment stone 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:39.509
 macquart so i start so by 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.780
 cut out the us at the crossroads so there we 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.610
 can see the brown parts this is the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.610
 scratch that allows to assemble everything 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.390
 it has a shape of dog baskets 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.690
 since it's going to be for cloud jean and his 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.690
 little sister 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.820
 I stayed in rape and there by 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.470
 against it is a bit heavy 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:11.070
 very nice for the morning completely 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:14.730
 covered with easter cloth so this is 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:19.090
 for support I created a kind of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.860
 of shelves in fact so the feet do not 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.500
 are not completely covered either 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.440
 I finished the little shelves but 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.380
 below is well advanced still remains 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.590
 the little details 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.360
 it will be enough then to finish first 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.550
 had to finish covering you off the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.840
 of livestock flow and create a 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.400
 second snag will go underneath it makes it a 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.400
 tool need the same measurement 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.320
 they fit perfectly so that 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.020
 it was to show you my neighbor 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.900
 project is also the materials used 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.310
 to realize the different peoples that 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.020
 I already showed you that I'm going 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.989
 continue to show you that today 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.250
 we will go to the goulia room that 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.940
 I realized have still in the 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.050
 same principle in cardboard so here 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.510
 at first, read it so it's 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:26.620
 a fully covered cardboard mini 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:30.160
 paper head and made small 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:40.209
 shelves so they can eat 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:41.380
 his books things like that so the 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.290
 small shelves are also 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.110
 covered with the earliest paper 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.989
 equalized metallized a bit I put a 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.200
 little touch of black on slice 1 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.610
 of glass pardon on the face for a 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.780
 took a little the colors that are 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.780
 always used with this doll 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:08.819
 it's cabbage is completely covered 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:11.450
 also for this one I made a 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.450
 small cover 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:23.600
 so that's for better then I 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.600
 realized a wardrobe 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.889
 so she closes with a small link on the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.639
 side inside I created three 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:44.180
 small shelves to eat the 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.990
 clothing girl between 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.280
 two I made a small loop 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.600
 because I wanted to put a little 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.990
 framework so that she can put there the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.990
 favorite character of his doll including coty 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:08.780
 frame is really just got up to the 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:13.820
 size of the year so then I 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:17.419
 manufactured drawers so there she 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:23.360
 tidies the smaller accessories of the 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:28.729
 net doll 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.699
 leslie cloud big that's it it's for 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.949
 the cabinet so always in the same 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:40.460
 colors always in the same 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:44.800
 materials actually my daughter wanted 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:48.760
 have a little fun too and she realized 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:53.780
 a little basket to avenge the owl 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:56.060
 standing read so on the same principle one 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.770
 on the sides of the cardboard we assembled 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.960
 and then she covered with paper 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.960
 so the device always a leather sign 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.750
 it is true that it is a paper that remains 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:15.729
 not too fragile and that really allows 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.729
 to be handled without problem 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.979
 so here I presented you the 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:29.060
 gaulle chamber yesterday we 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:34.520
