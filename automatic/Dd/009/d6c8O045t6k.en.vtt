00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.110 
now I'm going to show you these

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.139 
now I'm going to show you these
structures<00:00:01.709> and<00:00:01.949> actually<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.790> can<00:00:02.939> plot

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
structures and actually you can plot

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.550 
structures and actually you can plot
them<00:00:03.300> out<00:00:03.419> on<00:00:03.540> your<00:00:03.659> own<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:04.080> me<00:00:04.230> that's<00:00:04.410> the

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
them out on your own to me that's the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.869 
them out on your own to me that's the
best<00:00:04.770> way<00:00:04.920> for<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.190> teach<00:00:05.430> yourself<00:00:05.549> and

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
best way for you to teach yourself and

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.099 
best way for you to teach yourself and
really<00:00:06.150> learn<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.629> then<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.839> figure<00:00:07.080> out

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
really learn it and then you figure out

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.299 
really learn it and then you figure out
on<00:00:07.290> your<00:00:07.319> own<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.589> can<00:00:07.710> remember<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> lot<00:00:08.160> more

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
on your own you can remember a lot more

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.799 
on your own you can remember a lot more
than<00:00:08.429> if<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.639> show<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:08.910> or<00:00:09.120> somebody<00:00:09.300> else<00:00:09.540> does

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
than if I show you or somebody else does

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.540 
than if I show you or somebody else does
remember<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.830> power<00:00:11.010> chord<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
remember that a power chord is the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.360 
remember that a power chord is the
region<00:00:11.940> v<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:13.049> let's<00:00:13.230> look<00:00:13.380> at<00:00:13.530> octaves<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
region v so let's look at octaves the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.860 
region v so let's look at octaves the
octave<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.730> any<00:00:14.849> note<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> sixth<00:00:15.630> string

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
octave of any note on the sixth string

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.689 
octave of any note on the sixth string
is<00:00:16.410> two<00:00:16.619> frets<00:00:16.770> higher<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.340> fourth<00:00:17.609> string

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
is two frets higher on the fourth string

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.330 
is two frets higher on the fourth string
so<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.000> see<00:00:18.240> these<00:00:18.390> two<00:00:18.449> beats<00:00:19.010> then<00:00:20.010> here's

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
so you see these two beats then here's

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.070 
so you see these two beats then here's
your<00:00:20.460> f-sharp<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:21.210> five<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.840> see<00:00:21.990> those

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
your f-sharp the five so you see those

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.720 
your f-sharp the five so you see those
two<00:00:22.289> F<00:00:22.439> sharps<00:00:22.830> now<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.310> put<00:00:23.460> all<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
two F sharps now if you put all that

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.060 
two F sharps now if you put all that
together<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.660> really<00:00:25.470> big<00:00:25.769> power

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
together you get a really big power

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.810 
together you get a really big power
chord<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.580> got<00:00:26.760> root<00:00:27.000> v

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
chord you got root v

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.769 
chord you got root v
another<00:00:28.480> way<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.689> view<00:00:28.900> it<00:00:28.960> be<00:00:29.140> rooted<00:00:29.589> rootkit

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
another way to view it be rooted rootkit

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.939 
another way to view it be rooted rootkit
it's<00:00:31.779> important<00:00:32.320> you<00:00:32.379> see<00:00:32.590> it<00:00:32.710> as<00:00:32.800> different

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
it's important you see it as different

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.090 
it's important you see it as different
clusters

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
clusters

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.770 
clusters
if<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.340> keep<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.670> across<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.329> neck<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.690> this

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
if we keep going across the neck in this

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.689 
if we keep going across the neck in this
diagonal<00:00:37.320> fashion<00:00:37.500> left<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.250> low<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
diagonal fashion left to right low to

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.240 
diagonal fashion left to right low to
high<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.680> B<00:00:40.859> the<00:00:41.100> F

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
high then you would have the B the F

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.310 
high then you would have the B the F
sharp<00:00:41.280> over<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.600> another<00:00:42.899> way<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.079> might

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
sharp over here so another way you might

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.630 
sharp over here so another way you might
want<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.070> say<00:00:44.250> well<00:00:44.460> here's

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
want to see is just to say well here's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.259 
want to see is just to say well here's
route<00:00:44.850> v

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
route v

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.299 
route v
to<00:00:45.480> no<00:00:45.629> power<00:00:45.870> cord<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.890> an<00:00:47.010> octave

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
to no power cord here it is an octave

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
to no power cord here it is an octave
higher<00:00:47.449> here's<00:00:48.449> an<00:00:48.659> octave<00:00:48.960> higher<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
higher here's an octave higher so if I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.420 
higher here's an octave higher so if I
put<00:00:50.339> all<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.699> together<00:00:50.909> I<00:00:51.269> could<00:00:51.570> look

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.160 

it's<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:55.030> big<00:00:55.240> six<00:00:55.510> no<00:00:55.660> power<00:00:55.900> court<00:00:56.290> any<00:00:56.590> group

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it's a big six no power court any group

the B that was a mapping now you could

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.610 
the B that was a mapping now you could
stay<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> same<00:01:30.690> area<00:01:30.720> you'd<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.320> root

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
stay in the same area you'd have root

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.710 

now<00:01:50.430> hybrid<00:01:50.790> picking<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.300> but<00:01:51.510> be<00:01:51.690> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
now hybrid picking on that but be a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120 
now hybrid picking on that but be a
little<00:01:51.930> tricky<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.650> have<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.800> split

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
little tricky for you have a split

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.710 
little tricky for you have a split
meaning<00:01:53.550> you<00:01:53.640> skip<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:53.970> string<00:01:54.300> between<00:01:54.450> your

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
meaning you skip a string between your

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.679 
meaning you skip a string between your
middle<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> ring<00:01:55.110> fingers

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689

you

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
you

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.760 
you
that's<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.930> little<00:02:46.080> bit<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.350> technical

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
that's a little bit of a technical

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.900 
that's a little bit of a technical
challenge<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.220> play<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.580> because<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.820> have

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
challenge to play that because you have

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.820 
challenge to play that because you have
to<00:02:48.000> stretch<00:02:48.210> out<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.570> hyperextend<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.470> you

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
to stretch out and hyperextend and you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.530 
to stretch out and hyperextend and you
don't<00:02:49.980> have<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.460> play<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.760> six<00:02:51.000> string<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.480> you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
don't have to play the six string so you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.270 
don't have to play the six string so you
have<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.020> structure<00:02:52.350> up<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.680> top

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
have this structure up on top

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.670 
have this structure up on top
and<00:02:54.910> try<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.180> link<00:02:55.480> these<00:02:55.630> together<00:02:56.290> here's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
and try to link these together here's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.710 
and try to link these together here's
your<00:02:56.860> B<00:02:56.980> bar<00:02:57.250> chord<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.000> say<00:02:58.209> out<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.420> that

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
your B bar chord so you say out of that

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.410 
your B bar chord so you say out of that
I<00:02:58.750> have<00:02:58.990> root<00:02:59.230> fifth<00:02:59.530> root<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:00.790> root<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.360> I

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
I have root fifth root this root so I

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.230 
I have root fifth root this root so I

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
these different power chords I can just

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.960 
these different power chords I can just
voice<00:03:08.319> anyway

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
voice anyway

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.210

where I want so let's mix it up I'm

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.260 
where I want so let's mix it up I'm
gonna<00:03:12.310> play<00:03:12.460> one<00:03:12.580> with<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.760> track<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.180> a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
little bit then I'm gonna move on to

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:24.430 
little bit then I'm gonna move on to
another<00:03:14.830> kind<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.370> approach<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:15.910> track

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.210 

you

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:42.360 

you

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.229 

now<00:03:43.370> let's<00:03:43.640> go<00:03:43.879> to<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.030> clean<00:03:44.390> sound<00:03:46.060> I'm<00:03:47.060> going

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
now let's go to a clean sound I'm going

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.479 
now let's go to a clean sound I'm going
to<00:03:47.300> change<00:03:47.629> patches<00:03:48.140> put<00:03:48.709> on<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:48.830> chorus<00:03:49.280> delay

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
to change patches put on a chorus delay

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.309 
to change patches put on a chorus delay
nice<00:03:49.940> clean<00:03:50.269> sound<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.900> we're<00:03:51.170> going<00:03:51.290> to

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
nice clean sound and we're going to

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.559 
nice clean sound and we're going to
actually<00:03:51.800> change<00:03:51.830> our<00:03:52.280> approach<00:03:52.670> we<00:03:53.420> were

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
actually change our approach we were

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.330 
actually change our approach we were
thinking<00:03:53.900> like<00:03:53.930> guitars<00:03:54.440> then<00:03:54.830> actually

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
thinking like guitars then actually

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.580 
thinking like guitars then actually
guitars<00:03:56.060> wearing<00:03:56.510> keyboard<00:03:56.930> hats<00:03:57.110> because<00:03:57.470> we

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
guitars wearing keyboard hats because we

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.780 
guitars wearing keyboard hats because we
wanted<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:57.890> pluck<00:03:58.129> and<00:03:58.340> sound<00:03:58.549> like<00:03:58.610> a

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
wanted to pluck and sound like a

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.640 
wanted to pluck and sound like a
keyboard<00:03:58.970> instead<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.420> strumming<00:03:59.810> but<00:04:00.410> we<00:04:00.500> had

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
keyboard instead of strumming but we had

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.830 
keyboard instead of strumming but we had
the<00:04:00.799> sound<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.370> guitarist<00:04:01.700> now<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.480> want<00:04:02.810> to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
the sound of a guitarist now you want to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.300 
the sound of a guitarist now you want to
sound<00:04:03.110> like<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.290> keyboard<00:04:03.890> so<00:04:03.950> you're<00:04:04.160> going<00:04:04.280> to

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
sound like a keyboard so you're going to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.220 
sound like a keyboard so you're going to
voice<00:04:04.549> things<00:04:04.879> a<00:04:04.970> little<00:04:05.090> differently<00:04:05.540> we<00:04:06.019> can

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
voice things a little differently we can

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.020 
voice things a little differently we can
actually<00:04:06.440> use<00:04:06.980> what<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:07.459> learned<00:04:07.700> and

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
actually use what you just learned and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.400 
actually use what you just learned and
we're<00:04:08.120> going<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.299> add<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.019> create<00:04:09.230> some

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
we're going to add to it to create some

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.539 
we're going to add to it to create some
color<00:04:09.650> because<00:04:09.830> we<00:04:10.160> haven't<00:04:10.459> even

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
color because we haven't even

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.220 
color because we haven't even
established<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:11.299> major<00:04:11.510> tonality<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.140> these

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
established the major tonality of these

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.479 
established the major tonality of these
chords<00:04:12.530> because<00:04:12.620> we<00:04:12.739> just<00:04:12.920> played<00:04:13.069> roots<00:04:13.310> and

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
chords because we just played roots and

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.479 
chords because we just played roots and
fifths<00:04:13.670> so<00:04:14.540> we<00:04:14.630> have<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> major<00:04:15.049> chord<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:16.070> a

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
fifths so we have a major chord and a

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.340 
fifths so we have a major chord and a
major<00:04:16.669> chord<00:04:17.090> now<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:17.690> see<00:04:17.959> upon<00:04:18.229> the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
major chord now you see upon the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.830 
major chord now you see upon the
analysis<00:04:18.889> that<00:04:18.919> it's<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.400> 5-4<00:04:20.030> in<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.419> key<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:20.600> e

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
analysis that it's a 5-4 in the key of e

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.600 
analysis that it's a 5-4 in the key of e
so<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.350> mode<00:04:21.560> you're<00:04:21.709> in<00:04:21.829> or<00:04:21.950> B<00:04:22.130> mixolydian

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
so the mode you're in or B mixolydian

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.120 
so the mode you're in or B mixolydian
and<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.180> Lydian<00:04:23.630> keep<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.650> in<00:04:24.770> mind<00:04:24.979> because

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
and a Lydian keep that in mind because

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.770 
and a Lydian keep that in mind because
I'll<00:04:25.340> be<00:04:25.490> pulling<00:04:25.820> notes<00:04:26.180> out<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.540> each<00:04:26.660> of

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
I'll be pulling notes out of each of

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.350 
I'll be pulling notes out of each of
those<00:04:26.870> scales<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.410> add<00:04:27.560> to<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.160> harmony<00:04:28.610> the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
those scales to add to the harmony the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.420 
those scales to add to the harmony the
first<00:04:29.630> thing<00:04:29.840> we<00:04:29.960> talk<00:04:30.169> about<00:04:30.350> is<00:04:30.680> just<00:04:30.710> sus

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
first thing we talk about is just sus

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.719 
first thing we talk about is just sus
two<00:04:31.669> voicings<00:04:32.740> they're<00:04:33.740> open<00:04:34.160> because<00:04:34.610> you're

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
two voicings they're open because you're

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.520 
two voicings they're open because you're
not<00:04:34.850> established<00:04:35.389> in<00:04:35.479> some<00:04:35.630> major<00:04:36.080> tonality

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
not established in some major tonality

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.040 
not established in some major tonality
take<00:04:37.190> all<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.700> power<00:04:37.940> chord<00:04:38.360> voicings<00:04:38.870> you

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
take all the power chord voicings you

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.070 
take all the power chord voicings you
just<00:04:39.289> worked<00:04:39.530> out<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:40.760> add<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.449> to<00:04:41.690> someplace

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
just worked out and add the to someplace

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.140 
just worked out and add the to someplace
in<00:04:42.530> there<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.310> if<00:04:43.430> you're<00:04:43.580> looking<00:04:43.729> at<00:04:43.970> this

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
in there so if you're looking at this

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.080 
in there so if you're looking at this
for<00:04:44.419> example<00:04:45.190> there<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:46.280> have<00:04:46.430> root<00:04:46.700> fifth

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
for example there you have root fifth

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.900 
for example there you have root fifth
root<00:04:47.660> fifth<00:04:48.020> well<00:04:48.860> all<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:49.460> got<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.639> do<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.820> get

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
root fifth well all you got to do to get

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.520 
root fifth well all you got to do to get
the<00:04:50.060> nine<00:04:50.270> or<00:04:50.539> the<00:04:50.600> two<00:04:50.810> is<00:04:51.020> go<00:04:51.139> up<00:04:51.260> a<00:04:51.350> whole

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
the nine or the two is go up a whole

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.490 
the nine or the two is go up a whole
step<00:04:51.770> from<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:52.250> rousseau<00:04:52.960> so<00:04:53.960> there<00:04:54.169> we<00:04:54.289> have

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
step from the rousseau so there we have

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.250 
step from the rousseau so there we have
root<00:04:55.280> fifth<00:04:55.610> ninth<00:04:56.050> 50

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
root fifth ninth 50

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.950 
root fifth ninth 50
it's<00:04:58.770> starting<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.130> sound<00:04:59.310> really<00:04:59.550> cool<00:04:59.960> so

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
it's starting to sound really cool so

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
it's starting to sound really cool so
I'm<00:05:01.020> going<00:05:01.140> to<00:05:01.170> play<00:05:01.290> along<00:05:01.410> with<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.710> track

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
I'm going to play along with the track

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.890 
I'm going to play along with the track
play<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.580> couple<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:02.970> examples<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:03.630> then<00:05:03.780> I'll

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
play a couple of examples and then I'll

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.970 
play a couple of examples and then I'll
break<00:05:04.140> them<00:05:04.290> down<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.650> show<00:05:04.710> you<00:05:04.800> what<00:05:04.920> I'm

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
break them down to show you what I'm

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:33.760 
break them down to show you what I'm
doing

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.860 

okay<00:05:34.770> let's<00:05:35.280> stop<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.580> track<00:05:35.850> like<00:05:36.630> wait<00:05:36.840> a

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
okay let's stop the track like wait a

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.590 
okay let's stop the track like wait a
minute<00:05:37.170> this<00:05:37.260> guy<00:05:37.470> wasn't<00:05:37.800> playing<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.700> B<00:05:39.240> or

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
minute this guy wasn't playing the B or

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.330 
minute this guy wasn't playing the B or
the<00:05:39.630> a<00:05:39.750> over<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.170> a<00:05:40.200> through<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:40.980> some<00:05:41.130> B's

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
the a over the a through and some B's

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.440 
the a over the a through and some B's
well<00:05:41.700> I'm<00:05:41.760> going<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:41.910> show<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.120> what's<00:05:42.270> going

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
well I'm going to show you what's going

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.660 
well I'm going to show you what's going
on<00:05:42.570> with<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:43.320> first<00:05:43.590> thing<00:05:43.860> is<00:05:44.130> I<00:05:44.310> played

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
on with that the first thing is I played

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.200 
on with that the first thing is I played
some<00:05:45.180> sus2<00:05:45.510> voicings<00:05:46.290> which<00:05:46.470> are<00:05:46.620> just<00:05:46.770> roots

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
some sus2 voicings which are just roots

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.760 
some sus2 voicings which are just roots
fifth<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.510> second<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.050> I<00:05:49.110> had<00:05:49.260> this<00:05:49.500> but

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
fifth and second so I had this but

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.020 
fifth and second so I had this but
notice<00:05:49.980> how<00:05:50.100> I<00:05:50.160> actually<00:05:50.400> created<00:05:50.820> some

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
notice how I actually created some

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.710 
notice how I actually created some
motion<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:52.860> brought<00:05:53.310> it<00:05:53.460> back<00:05:53.730> to<00:05:54.420> the<00:05:54.510> power

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
motion I brought it back to the power

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.190 
motion I brought it back to the power
chord<00:05:56.240> so<00:05:57.240> here<00:05:57.420> are<00:05:57.480> some<00:05:57.570> of<00:05:57.660> your<00:05:57.750> voicings

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
chord so here are some of your voicings

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.300 
chord so here are some of your voicings
from<00:05:59.130> low<00:05:59.310> to<00:05:59.370> high<00:05:59.460> one<00:06:00.240> five<00:06:00.720> nine<00:06:01.220> then<00:06:02.220> you

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
from low to high one five nine then you

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.520 
from low to high one five nine then you
can<00:06:02.430> build<00:06:02.640> on<00:06:02.790> top<00:06:02.820> of<00:06:03.180> that<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:04.290> another

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
can build on top of that and another

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.920 
can build on top of that and another
five<00:06:04.830> I've<00:06:05.070> been<00:06:05.220> there<00:06:05.460> you<00:06:06.270> could<00:06:06.450> go<00:06:06.480> one

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
five I've been there you could go one

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.760 
five I've been there you could go one

if you know a D chord you know that if
you<00:07:18.330> pick<00:07:18.510> up<00:07:18.660> your<00:07:18.780> second<00:07:19.110> finger<00:07:19.470> that's<00:07:19.830> a

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:19.950 
you pick up your second finger that's a

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.270 
you pick up your second finger that's a
DC<00:07:20.430> -<00:07:20.730> so<00:07:21.030> we<00:07:21.150> re<00:07:21.330> finger<00:07:21.720> it<00:07:21.890> your<00:07:22.890> root<00:07:23.040> is<00:07:23.130> on

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 
DC - so we re finger it your root is on

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.550 
DC - so we re finger it your root is on
the<00:07:23.370> fourth<00:07:23.670> string<00:07:23.790> so<00:07:24.090> you<00:07:24.150> move<00:07:24.360> it<00:07:24.510> up<00:07:24.630> so

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 
the fourth string so you move it up so

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.210 
the fourth string so you move it up so
this<00:07:25.710> was<00:07:25.860> the<00:07:25.950> Vsauce<00:07:26.520> -<00:07:26.760> the<00:07:27.090> a<00:07:27.120> a<00:07:27.270> sus<00:07:27.750> -<00:07:28.190> so<00:07:29.190> I

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 
this was the Vsauce - the a a sus - so I

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.440 
this was the Vsauce - the a a sus - so I
was<00:07:29.310> just<00:07:29.430> a<00:07:29.490> quick<00:07:29.670> overview<00:07:29.970> of<00:07:30.120> some<00:07:30.210> of<00:07:30.390> the

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450 
was just a quick overview of some of the

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.200 
was just a quick overview of some of the
voicings<00:07:30.840> I<00:07:30.930> used
