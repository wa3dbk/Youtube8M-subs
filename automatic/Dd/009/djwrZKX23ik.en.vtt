over the place over the last few years
them<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.090> I've<00:00:18.180> begin<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> realize<00:00:19.199> now<00:00:19.439> that

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
them and I've begin to realize now that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.099 
them and I've begin to realize now that
really<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.820> West<00:00:21.000> Country<00:00:21.180> has<00:00:21.689> got<00:00:21.900> all<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
really the West Country has got all I

need and both on Dartmoor and down in
Cornwall<00:00:25.160> this<00:00:26.160> coast<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.609> probably<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> most

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
Cornwall this coast is probably the most

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.529 
Cornwall this coast is probably the most
spectacular<00:00:27.449> bit<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.109> coast<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.500> Cornwall

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
spectacular bit of coast in Cornwall

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.959 
spectacular bit of coast in Cornwall
with<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.750> mining<00:00:31.560> remains<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> really

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
with the mining remains and so I really

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.580 
with the mining remains and so I really
decided<00:00:33.270> I'd<00:00:33.540> concentrate<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.079> this

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
decided I'd concentrate this this

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.470 
decided I'd concentrate this this
exhibition<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.670> piece<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.210> three<00:00:36.390> or

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
exhibition on that piece just three or

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.880 
exhibition on that piece just three or
four<00:00:36.510> miles<00:00:36.870> around<00:00:37.320> sent<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.100> pending

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
four miles around sent just pending

four miles around sent just pending
cover<00:00:40.890> all<00:00:41.219> these<00:00:41.370> sort<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> places<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.180> this

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
cover all these sort of places and this

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.209 
cover all these sort of places and this
one<00:00:43.350> tennis<00:00:44.129> coast<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:45.260> probably<00:00:46.260> typical

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
one tennis coast one is probably typical

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
one tennis coast one is probably typical
of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> whole<00:00:47.850> show<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> brings<00:00:48.719> together

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
of the whole show but it brings together

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.970 
of the whole show but it brings together
most<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> factors<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:51.440> I<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
most of the factors that I put in

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.200 
most of the factors that I put in
different<00:00:53.280> ways<00:00:53.399> through<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> paintings

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
different ways through the paintings

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.049 
different ways through the paintings
I'll<00:00:54.600> often<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.100> adopt<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.219> viewpoint<00:00:56.699> which

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
I'll often have adopt a viewpoint which

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.939 
I'll often have adopt a viewpoint which
is<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.570> nowhere<00:00:57.899> near<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> place<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.710> could

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
is not nowhere near with a place I could

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.520 
is not nowhere near with a place I could
be<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.699> since<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.030> painting<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:01.350> would

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
be and since this painting it would

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.950 
be and since this painting it would
appear<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.859> I'm<00:01:02.100> over<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> sea<00:01:02.760> flying<00:01:03.660> in

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
appear that I'm over the sea flying in

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.890 
appear that I'm over the sea flying in
towards<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> coast<00:01:05.150> with<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> sea<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
towards the coast with the sea and the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.539 
towards the coast with the sea and the
cliffs<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> landscape<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
cliffs and then the landscape and the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.600 
cliffs and then the landscape and the
moorland<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.900> now<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.950> seems<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.400> sort<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
moorland and now that seems to sort of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.800 
moorland and now that seems to sort of
come<00:01:11.760> naturally<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> me<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.540> sort<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
come naturally to me this sort of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.859 
come naturally to me this sort of
multi-layered<00:01:13.409> approach<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.659> like

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
multi-layered approach and I like

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.260 
multi-layered approach and I like
playing<00:01:16.140> with<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.560> perspective<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> way

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
playing with it perspective and the way

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.760 
playing with it perspective and the way
that<00:01:18.479> some<00:01:18.659> things<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.110> horizontal<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that some things will be horizontal and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.170 
that some things will be horizontal and
some<00:01:19.979> things<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.369> tipped<00:01:20.640> vertically

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
some things will be tipped vertically

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
some things will be tipped vertically
and<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:21.930> very<00:01:22.140> typical<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.650> most<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.070> my

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and that's very typical of most of my

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.209 
and that's very typical of most of my
paintings

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.520 

why<00:01:30.729> this<00:01:30.789> painting<00:01:31.289> encapsulate<00:01:32.289> Saul<00:01:32.499> that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
why this painting encapsulate Saul that

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.499 
why this painting encapsulate Saul that
had<00:01:32.950> in<00:01:33.100> mind<00:01:33.340> when<00:01:33.549> I<00:01:33.640> was<00:01:33.759> doing<00:01:33.999> this<00:01:34.149> series

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
had in mind when I was doing this series

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.239 
had in mind when I was doing this series
is<00:01:34.749> that<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:35.319> really<00:01:35.439> brings<00:01:35.649> together<00:01:35.920> all

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
is that it really brings together all

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.279 
is that it really brings together all
the<00:01:36.429> factors<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:36.909> are<00:01:37.539> probably<00:01:37.780> prevailing

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
the factors that are probably prevailing

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.499 
the factors that are probably prevailing
in<00:01:38.409> that<00:01:38.560> piece<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.890> Coast<00:01:39.130> Norland<00:01:40.119> along<00:01:40.359> the

of West penneth and of course the
remaining<00:01:56.049> remains<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.740> old<00:01:56.890> engine<00:01:57.099> houses

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
remaining remains the old engine houses

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.120 
remaining remains the old engine houses
and<00:01:57.849> other<00:01:58.000> remains<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:58.990> did<00:01:59.229> focus<00:01:59.500> quite

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
and other remains and I did focus quite

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.889 
and other remains and I did focus quite
a<00:02:00.159> lot<00:02:00.399> on<00:02:00.429> drawing<00:02:00.880> those<00:02:01.240> remains<00:02:01.659> and

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
a lot on drawing those remains and

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.600 
a lot on drawing those remains and
understanding<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.649> shapes<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.250> fall

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
understanding the shapes that fall

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.940 
understanding the shapes that fall
within<00:02:03.849> the<00:02:04.090> remains<00:02:04.560> then<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.679> course<00:02:05.860> the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
within the remains then of course the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.279 
within the remains then of course the
cliffs<00:02:06.189> themselves<00:02:06.819> with<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.569> verticality

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
cliffs themselves with the verticality

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.080 
cliffs themselves with the verticality
of<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.560> cliffs<00:02:08.829> coming<00:02:09.310> down<00:02:09.459> into<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.879> sea

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
of the cliffs coming down into the sea

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.809 
of the cliffs coming down into the sea
this<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.290> all<00:02:11.470> granite<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.280> very<00:02:12.430> special

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
this is all granite it's a very special

thing about the granite that Coast is

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.000 
thing about the granite that Coast is
there<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.519> nature<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.090> granite<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.010> I

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
there is the nature of the granite and I

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.530 
there is the nature of the granite and I
know<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.430> well<00:02:18.610> from<00:02:18.730> one<00:02:18.910> ocean<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.180> climb<00:02:19.360> on

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.430 
know it well from one ocean to climb on
the<00:02:19.569> cliffs<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:20.079> like<00:02:20.290> that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
houses and in this painting I've used

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.160 
houses and in this painting I've used
some<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.740> man-made<00:02:50.450> images<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.690> circular

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
some of the man-made images the circular

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.870 
some of the man-made images the circular
Wells<00:02:52.380> which<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.220> changed<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.670> perspective

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
Wells which I changed the perspective

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.479 
Wells which I changed the perspective
and<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.290> nearly<00:02:55.680> always<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.100> man-made

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
and so on and nearly always the man-made

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.330 
and so on and nearly always the man-made
images<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.180> will<00:02:57.390> exaggerate<00:02:58.020> or<00:02:58.530> illustrate

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
images I will exaggerate or illustrate

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.310 
images I will exaggerate or illustrate
those<00:02:59.489> by<00:02:59.730> giving<00:03:00.030> them<00:03:00.150> sharp<00:03:00.420> edges<00:03:00.630> as

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
those by giving them sharp edges as

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.930 
those by giving them sharp edges as
against<00:03:01.739> natural<00:03:02.100> edges<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.580> via<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
against natural edges so via the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.910 
against natural edges so via the
buildings<00:03:03.360> we<00:03:03.510> have<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.750> stones<00:03:04.020> now<00:03:04.739> when<00:03:04.890> I

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
buildings we have the stones now when I

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.430 
buildings we have the stones now when I
go<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.610> sketch<00:03:05.820> these<00:03:06.570> various<00:03:07.050> elements

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
go to sketch these various elements

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.710 
go to sketch these various elements
around<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> landscape<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.670> use<00:03:09.150> them<00:03:09.390> then<00:03:09.570> as

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
around the landscape I use them then as

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.470 
around the landscape I use them then as
tools<00:03:10.020> as<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.560> vocabulary<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.730> work<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:12.300> my

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
tools as a vocabulary to work on all my

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.810 
tools as a vocabulary to work on all my
painting<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.170> once<00:03:13.620> I've<00:03:13.830> got<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> few<00:03:14.370> simple

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
painting so once I've got a few simple

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.360 
painting so once I've got a few simple
images<00:03:15.480> which<00:03:15.989> are<00:03:16.140> evocative<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:17.070> place

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
images which are evocative of that place

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.570 
images which are evocative of that place
I<00:03:17.640> can<00:03:18.120> use<00:03:18.270> them<00:03:18.480> on<00:03:18.540> all<00:03:18.720> my<00:03:18.870> paintings<00:03:19.290> and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
I can use them on all my paintings and

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.949 
I can use them on all my paintings and
these<00:03:20.580> sort<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:20.880> circular<00:03:21.090> shapes<00:03:21.570> which<00:03:21.870> are

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
these sort of circular shapes which are

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.479 
these sort of circular shapes which are
very<00:03:22.140> typical<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.190> stone

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
very typical of the of the stone

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.210 
very typical of the of the stone
surrounding<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.239> mine<00:03:24.450> shafts<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
surrounding the mine shafts and of the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.250 
surrounding the mine shafts and of the
obvious<00:03:26.580> things<00:03:26.790> like<00:03:26.880> engine<00:03:27.390> houses<00:03:27.780> once

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
obvious things like engine houses once

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.870 
obvious things like engine houses once
you<00:03:28.620> have<00:03:28.799> an<00:03:28.920> image<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.250> an<00:03:29.310> engine<00:03:29.580> house<00:03:29.730> I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
you have an image of an engine house I

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.400 
you have an image of an engine house I
don't<00:03:30.060> really<00:03:30.360> need<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.600> draw<00:03:30.780> anymore<00:03:30.959> engine

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
don't really need to draw anymore engine

don't really need to draw anymore engine

the<00:03:43.150> mining<00:03:43.540> remains<00:03:43.900> in<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.590> same<00:03:44.800> area<00:03:45.160> I

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
the mining remains in the same area I

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.100 
the mining remains in the same area I
did<00:03:45.610> tend<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.090> pick<00:03:46.270> some<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.690> names<00:03:46.870> and

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
did tend to pick some of the names and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.200 
did tend to pick some of the names and
titles<00:03:47.170> because<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.220> just<00:03:48.370> loved<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.760> sound<00:03:48.970> of

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
titles because I just loved the sound of

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.700 
titles because I just loved the sound of
the<00:03:49.300> words<00:03:49.510> rather<00:03:49.840> than<00:03:50.020> being<00:03:50.320> accurately

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
the words rather than being accurately

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.260 
the words rather than being accurately
from<00:03:50.950> where<00:03:51.130> they<00:03:51.280> were<00:03:51.340> from<00:03:51.550> but<00:03:52.030> anybody

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
from where they were from but anybody

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.390 
from where they were from but anybody
who<00:03:52.540> checks<00:03:52.810> on<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.110> OS<00:03:53.620> map<00:03:53.830> will<00:03:54.040> find<00:03:54.280> that

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
who checks on the OS map will find that

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.360 
who checks on the OS map will find that
all<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.970> titles<00:03:55.360> within<00:03:56.140> within<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:56.950> area<00:03:57.280> if

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
all the titles within within the area if

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.740 
all the titles within within the area if
they're<00:03:57.520> four<00:03:57.670> or<00:03:57.790> five<00:03:57.940> miles<00:03:58.210> they're<00:03:58.600> all

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
they're four or five miles they're all

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.510 
they're four or five miles they're all
there<00:03:59.020> but<00:03:59.590> sometimes<00:03:59.830> I've<00:04:00.160> used<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.400> good

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
there but sometimes I've used a good

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.190 
there but sometimes I've used a good
deal<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.760> license<00:04:01.150> about<00:04:01.420> how<00:04:01.690> I've<00:04:01.840> titled

evocative<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.760> think<00:04:10.270> it's<00:04:10.390> more<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.840> an

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
evocative I think it's more of an

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.650 
evocative I think it's more of an
emotional<00:04:11.560> response<00:04:11.740> to<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.670> coast<00:04:12.910> than

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
emotional response to the coast than

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.360 
emotional response to the coast than
perhaps<00:04:13.840> some<00:04:14.140> of<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.530> other<00:04:14.560> paintings<00:04:15.160> I

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
perhaps some of the other paintings I

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.000 
perhaps some of the other paintings I
had<00:04:16.150> very<00:04:16.360> much<00:04:16.540> in<00:04:16.720> mind<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.440> way<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.860> the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
had very much in mind the way that the

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.460 
had very much in mind the way that the
cliffs<00:04:18.489> fall<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:19.270> the<00:04:19.390> sea<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.140> way<00:04:20.260> that

cliffs fall to the sea and the way that

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.590 
cliffs fall to the sea and the way that
