00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
I like doing play once in a while but
just<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> thought<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.020> having<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> sculpt

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
just the thought of having to sculpt

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.590 
just the thought of having to sculpt
something<00:01:19.950> out<00:01:20.189> every<00:01:20.460> few<00:01:20.759> minutes<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.360> like

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
something out every few minutes and like

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600 
something out every few minutes and like
having<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.439> details<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.340> gets

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
having to do all the details just gets

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.789 
having to do all the details just gets
on<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.790> nerves<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.299> little<00:01:24.390> bit<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.439> find<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
on my nerves a little bit so I find it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.710 
on my nerves a little bit so I find it
easier<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.280> resin<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.909> decoden<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.689> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
easier to do resin in decoden so I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
easier to do resin in decoden so I
really<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> lot<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.340> second
