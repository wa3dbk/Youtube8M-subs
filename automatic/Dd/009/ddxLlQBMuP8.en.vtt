there is no heart well it comes from the
Sun<00:00:45.290> really<00:00:45.710> when<00:00:46.310> you<00:00:46.430> look<00:00:46.670> at<00:00:46.970> how<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:47.870> Sun

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
Sun really when you look at how the Sun

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.260 
Sun really when you look at how the Sun
is<00:00:48.470> interacting<00:00:49.130> with<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.370> plant<00:00:49.700> you're

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
is interacting with the plant you're

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.720 
is interacting with the plant you're
really<00:00:50.570> looking<00:00:50.690> at<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.410> most<00:00:51.860> fundamental

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
really looking at the most fundamental

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.510 
really looking at the most fundamental
of<00:00:53.060> functioning<00:00:53.630> of<00:00:53.810> the<00:00:54.560> health<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.250> plant

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
of functioning of the health of a plant

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.050 
of functioning of the health of a plant
so<00:00:56.480> we<00:00:56.510> don't<00:00:56.840> monitor<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.320> heartbeat<00:00:57.950> but<00:00:58.850> we

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
so we don't monitor the heartbeat but we

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.210 
so we don't monitor the heartbeat but we
monitor<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.720> vine<00:00:59.900> water<00:01:00.110> use<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:00.800> what<00:01:01.010> you

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
monitor the vine water use and what you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.100 
monitor the vine water use and what you
need<00:01:01.790> to<00:01:02.000> understand<00:01:02.480> is<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:02.600> pretty<00:01:02.899> much

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
need to understand is that pretty much

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.289 
need to understand is that pretty much
like<00:01:03.380> when<00:01:03.560> we<00:01:03.710> are<00:01:03.860> running<00:01:04.670> faster<00:01:05.149> our

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
like when we are running faster our

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.370 
like when we are running faster our
heartbeat<00:01:05.810> goes<00:01:06.020> faster<00:01:06.710> well<00:01:07.159> when<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.670> plant

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
heartbeat goes faster well when a plant

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.500 
heartbeat goes faster well when a plant
senses<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.860> there<00:01:10.280> is<00:01:10.400> an<00:01:10.520> increased<00:01:10.940> water

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
senses that there is an increased water

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.460 
senses that there is an increased water
deficit<00:01:12.110> that<00:01:12.290> starts<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.830> be<00:01:14.260> detected<00:01:15.260> at

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
deficit that starts to be detected at

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.219 
deficit that starts to be detected at
the<00:01:15.620> root<00:01:15.800> level<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.940> modifies<00:01:17.540> immediately

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
the root level it modifies immediately

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.520 
the root level it modifies immediately
its<00:01:18.350> water<00:01:18.530> consumption<00:01:19.390> so<00:01:20.390> what<00:01:20.960> we<00:01:21.110> monitor

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
its water consumption so what we monitor

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.340 
its water consumption so what we monitor
is<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:22.520> fluctuations<00:01:23.299> in<00:01:23.540> how<00:01:23.930> much<00:01:24.049> water

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
is the fluctuations in how much water

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.539 
is the fluctuations in how much water
gets<00:01:24.890> absorbed<00:01:25.630> used<00:01:26.630> consumed<00:01:27.530> by<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.159> plant

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
gets absorbed used consumed by the plant

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.820 
gets absorbed used consumed by the plant
and<00:01:28.760> by<00:01:29.299> looking<00:01:29.600> at<00:01:29.720> those<00:01:29.870> teeny<00:01:30.200> variations

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
and by looking at those teeny variations

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.100 
and by looking at those teeny variations
we<00:01:31.010> are<00:01:31.100> able<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.490> say<00:01:31.880> whether<00:01:32.450> or<00:01:32.570> not<00:01:32.690> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
we are able to say whether or not the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.500 
we are able to say whether or not the
plant<00:01:33.350> is<00:01:33.590> in<00:01:33.890> good<00:01:34.100> health<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.700> as<00:01:35.210> long<00:01:35.450> as

can imagine we are applying a lot of

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.420 
can imagine we are applying a lot of
heat<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:09.019> this<00:03:09.140> Vento<00:03:09.560> we<00:03:09.680> need<00:03:09.830> we<00:03:10.100> need<00:03:10.130> some

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
heat to this Vento we need we need some

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.780 
heat to this Vento we need we need some
energy<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:11.510> we<00:03:11.630> use<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:12.110> solar<00:03:12.440> panel<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:13.640> is

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
energy so we use a solar panel that is

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.150 
energy so we use a solar panel that is
connected<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.690> battery<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:15.890> data

through that pipe is
to<00:04:30.139> understand<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.650> level<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:31.069> overall<00:04:31.490> use

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
to understand the level of overall use

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.770 
to understand the level of overall use
and<00:04:32.030> how<00:04:32.900> do<00:04:32.960> we<00:04:33.110> do<00:04:33.289> that<00:04:33.470> well<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:35.090> key<00:04:35.300> thing

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
and how do we do that well the key thing

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.150 
and how do we do that well the key thing
to<00:04:35.810> understand<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.560> we<00:04:36.830> are<00:04:36.889> going<00:04:37.039> to

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
to understand is that we are going to

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.400 
to understand is that we are going to
apply<00:04:37.340> heat<00:04:37.789> and<00:04:38.060> why<00:04:38.690> do<00:04:38.750> we<00:04:38.840> apply<00:04:39.139> heat

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
apply heat and why do we apply heat

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.460 
apply heat and why do we apply heat
because<00:04:39.830> as<00:04:40.039> water<00:04:40.250> moves<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:41.000> can<00:04:41.240> carry<00:04:41.479> heat

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
because as water moves it can carry heat

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.140 
because as water moves it can carry heat
with<00:04:42.949> it<00:04:43.569> so<00:04:44.569> we<00:04:45.440> use<00:04:45.620> those<00:04:45.800> sensors<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.880> are

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
with it so we use those sensors that are

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.909 
with it so we use those sensors that are
supplied<00:04:47.870> with<00:04:48.520> electricity<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:50.740> inside<00:04:51.740> the

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
supplied with electricity and inside the

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.029 
supplied with electricity and inside the
sensor<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.520> see<00:04:52.759> an<00:04:52.970> orange<00:04:53.270> sleeve<00:04:54.050> that<00:04:54.979> is

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
sensor you see an orange sleeve that is

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.360 
sensor you see an orange sleeve that is
actually<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.610> resistance<00:04:56.240> providing<00:04:56.900> heat

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
actually a resistance providing heat

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.879 
actually a resistance providing heat
around<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.819> stem<00:04:59.120> we<00:04:59.599> just<00:04:59.810> need<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.289> have

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
around the stem we just need to have

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.490 
around the stem we just need to have
some<00:05:01.360> thermocouple<00:05:02.360> here<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:02.960> can<00:05:03.110> see<00:05:03.320> them

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
some thermocouple here you can see them

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.700 
some thermocouple here you can see them
there<00:05:03.710> just<00:05:04.580> before<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:05.539> just<00:05:05.570> after<00:05:05.960> the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
there just before and just after the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.560 
there just before and just after the
heat<00:05:06.919> is<00:05:07.070> being<00:05:07.099> applied<00:05:07.460> along<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.090> path<00:05:08.300> of

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
heat is being applied along the path of

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.620 
heat is being applied along the path of
the<00:05:09.410> liquid<00:05:09.740> water<00:05:09.889> and<00:05:10.280> those<00:05:10.910> thermocouple

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
the liquid water and those thermocouple

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.020 
the liquid water and those thermocouple
are<00:05:11.870> touching<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:14.530> plant<00:05:15.530> so<00:05:16.370> as<00:05:16.580> we<00:05:16.820> can

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
are touching the plant so as we can

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.790 
are touching the plant so as we can
measure<00:05:17.389> simultaneously<00:05:18.259> the<00:05:18.410> amount<00:05:18.680> of

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
measure simultaneously the amount of

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.860 
measure simultaneously the amount of
heat<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.789> temperature<00:05:20.389> difference

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
heat and the temperature difference

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.230 
heat and the temperature difference
before<00:05:21.199> and<00:05:21.470> after<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.039> heat<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.370> applied<00:05:22.580> we

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
before and after the heat is applied we

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.920 
before and after the heat is applied we
can<00:05:23.380> calculate<00:05:24.380> how<00:05:24.590> much<00:05:24.740> heat<00:05:25.190> got<00:05:25.930> carried

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
can calculate how much heat got carried

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.379 
can calculate how much heat got carried
away<00:05:27.080> got<00:05:27.500> transported<00:05:28.250> by<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.729> plant<00:05:29.120> and

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
away got transported by the plant and

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.450 
away got transported by the plant and
that's<00:05:29.720> how<00:05:29.840> we<00:05:29.900> can<00:05:30.139> compute<00:05:30.349> from<00:05:31.069> a<00:05:31.220> heat

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
that's how we can compute from a heat

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.279 
that's how we can compute from a heat
measurement<00:05:32.030> but<00:05:32.750> offset<00:05:33.050> from<00:05:33.139> a

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
measurement but offset from a

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.990 
measurement but offset from a
temperature<00:05:33.860> difference<00:05:34.159> how<00:05:34.580> much<00:05:34.610> water

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
temperature difference how much water

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.570 
temperature difference how much water
flew<00:05:35.659> between<00:05:35.810> those<00:05:36.110> two<00:05:36.289> points<00:05:36.470> what<00:05:37.400> we

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
flew between those two points what we

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.129 
flew between those two points what we
notice<00:05:37.880> is<00:05:38.030> that<00:05:38.090> most<00:05:38.419> of<00:05:38.509> the<00:05:38.630> time<00:05:38.810> we<00:05:38.960> come

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
notice is that most of the time we come

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.689 
notice is that most of the time we come
in<00:05:39.169> and<00:05:39.530> we<00:05:40.009> help<00:05:40.280> people<00:05:40.639> saving<00:05:41.240> water<00:05:41.539> while

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
in and we help people saving water while

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.850 
in and we help people saving water while
improving<00:05:43.699> quality<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:44.570> not<00:05:45.259> reducing<00:05:45.710> their

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
improving quality and not reducing their

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.709 
improving quality and not reducing their
yield<00:05:46.070> so<00:05:46.280> everybody<00:05:47.000> is<00:05:47.300> a<00:05:47.330> win-win

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
yield so everybody is a win-win

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:49.600 
yield so everybody is a win-win
situation<00:05:47.750> for<00:05:48.229> everybody<00:05:48.530> I<00:05:48.889> think<00:05:48.919> so

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
situation for everybody I think so

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.779 
situation for everybody I think so
customer<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.659> environment<00:05:51.430> what<00:05:52.430> we<00:05:52.550> try<00:05:52.729> to

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
customer the environment what we try to

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.110 
customer the environment what we try to
induce<00:05:53.180> is<00:05:53.509> a<00:05:53.840> deficit<00:05:54.530> in<00:05:54.800> water<00:05:55.430> supply<00:05:55.849> to<00:05:55.909> a

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
induce is a deficit in water supply to a

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.490 
induce is a deficit in water supply to a
plant<00:05:56.449> so<00:05:56.900> then<00:05:57.080> it<00:05:57.770> accelerates<00:05:58.550> its

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
plant so then it accelerates its

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.959 
plant so then it accelerates its
maturation<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.710> makes<00:06:01.250> fruit<00:06:01.580> that<00:06:01.789> are

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:01.969 
maturation and makes fruit that are

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:03.820 
maturation and makes fruit that are
going<00:06:02.150> to<00:06:02.330> be<00:06:02.449> maybe<00:06:02.690> smaller<00:06:03.020> in<00:06:03.199> size<00:06:03.409> but

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
going to be maybe smaller in size but

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.189 
going to be maybe smaller in size but
more<00:06:04.039> concentrated<00:06:04.610> in<00:06:04.729> color<00:06:05.080> so<00:06:06.080> the

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
more concentrated in color so the

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.730 
more concentrated in color so the
winemaker<00:06:06.590> is<00:06:06.740> happier<00:06:07.479> the<00:06:08.479> plant<00:06:08.750> is

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
winemaker is happier the plant is

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.830 
winemaker is happier the plant is
designed<00:06:09.949> to<00:06:10.370> cope<00:06:10.639> pretty<00:06:11.090> well<00:06:11.360> through

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
designed to cope pretty well through

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.480 
designed to cope pretty well through
that<00:06:11.960> kind<00:06:12.110> of<00:06:12.229> strategy<00:06:12.409> you<00:06:12.919> know<00:06:13.039> escaping

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
that kind of strategy you know escaping

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.709 
that kind of strategy you know escaping
in<00:06:13.639> time<00:06:13.849> and<00:06:14.560> from<00:06:15.560> a<00:06:15.590> non-vegan<00:06:15.889> mental

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
in time and from a non-vegan mental

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.659 
in time and from a non-vegan mental
standpoint<00:06:17.719> it's<00:06:18.289> better<00:06:18.590> because<00:06:18.860> you<00:06:19.460> use

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
standpoint it's better because you use

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.839 
standpoint it's better because you use
only<00:06:20.030> the<00:06:20.479> wire<00:06:20.630> you<00:06:20.870> need<00:06:21.080> to<00:06:21.800> make<00:06:21.979> wine<00:06:22.610> that

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
only the wire you need to make wine that

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.790 
only the wire you need to make wine that
eventually<00:06:23.509> is<00:06:23.870> going<00:06:24.139> to<00:06:24.259> be<00:06:24.440> of<00:06:24.530> a<00:06:24.560> better

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
eventually is going to be of a better

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.310 
eventually is going to be of a better
quality
