00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 My people today I want to talk about it 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.330
 enlighten as such allofs despite four 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.859
 So oblivion better skyrim is therefore 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.860
 in the end, it's about that today 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.940
 I will compare scarione oblivion 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.590
 Ford be told I'm a little bit 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.590
 colds that will still hear a video 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.250
 two and a half years ago 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.080
 that my beloved xbox 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.980
 and with her my first 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980
 real open world roleplaying 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.750
 Oblivion oblivion were you damn good 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.250
 and unique to me because I became 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.210
 Never before with a game with such 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.520
 a playful freedom 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.720
 I'm confronted with skyrim 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.400
 Thanks to the trailer with a attitude 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.540
 approached because I expected 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.670
 that the game is just bombastic 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.170
 but it was terribly disappointed by 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.390
 Skyrim is just not that way anymore 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 how oblivion clearly wanted this is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.540
 not anymore but still it does 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.830
 big deviation from his predecessor 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.500
 First of all, enjoy the game faster 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.330
 I have a long time left 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.129
 asked me why that is so anyway 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.449
 I never came to an answer but then 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.460
 I ran it and both 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.960
 games played abusive again and am 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.479
 I came to an answer 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.530
 will tell you now 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.210
 skyrim clearly has the better graphics 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 but I like the whole setting 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.510
 oblivion a lot better 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.270
 the fantasy and fairytale easy 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.409
 more and better matches his game 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.030
 Moreover, the contrast of fairy tales is after 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.260
 too dark as it is often oblivion 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.270
 if you join a dungeon 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.250
 much better than skyrim 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.590
 In addition, diakonia are clearly uglier 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 when I have a look at who 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.079
 plays this crass voluntarily is also 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.770
 the whole world in oblivion easy 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.969
 much more my thing 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.680
 it is just much nicer and 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.060
 more varied is not in 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.560
 things graphic because there is hardly a 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.670
 true masterpiece we should in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.439
 direction of the architectures of the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.700
 age with all this roman 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.479
 touched things makes me the game 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.829
 full of grief 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.750
 you can just make sense of it 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.329
 Time use says Julian would be here 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.539
 Feel very well, you can do that too 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.539
 in sky 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.009
 oh yes and oblivion one still comes 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.420
 creating his own class is like that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.640
 my dark real not be dark eleven 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.829
 but as an agent should that I in the game 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.060
 I wrote wrong 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.619
 me another two years to the series 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.869
 but nevertheless sympathetic city brummer 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.240
 or at this ropes imperial city the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.350
 At some point, it will become your home 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.459
 Oblivion has always had this effect on you 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.750
 to tie up and not let go 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.550
 So far, really every fuck up front 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.319
 you want to kill everyone 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.489
 Quests are getting new equipment 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.940
 get or just better too 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.160
 become 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.870
 but what happens is different from that 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.730
 level luton system is completely unclear 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.290
 After about ten to fifty hours I would 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.120
 think to forge the dragon armor 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.739
 and thus the best armor game too 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.730
 receive 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.810
 For you have not again remained 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.430
 large selection of tens of hundreds 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.390
 Armor sets always different 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.500
 look and also always 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.540
 different values ​​and abilities 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.830
 have and therefore falls the largest 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.440
 motivation point of a role play 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.459
 water because if I do not play games now 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.170
 then I think why I do it all 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.140
 do because I think neither better 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.250
 equipment i still need more money 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.079
 and so interesting are the quest now 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.010
 does not have to constantly motivate 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.150
 with an atmosphere and the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.799
 you can see me there 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.000
 still lure 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.040
 besides, the level in skyrim is one 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.810
 disaster so many clips or wax 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.239
 I have never experienced a robust one 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.040
 so you could make his speech a man 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.329
 train are my wants 100 was only 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.440
 at my choice in which one has 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.150
 decide if a wine is good 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.769
 Tastes or if it is safe and the passports 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.359
 of master chiefs and so have 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.959
 your nullkommanix ten points to 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.660
 disposal 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.680
 for nothing, you can do the same 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.180
 By the way, with just about everyone 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.920
 other ability to do something honest 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.299
 said damn sad is because the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.920
 all the skills you play freely 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.150
 may have been rather simple 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.650
 what else in oblivion as 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.720
 of course is now one 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.970
 unlockable ability I had 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.530
 namely, never this feeling it is 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.870
 Christmas birthday easter and summer 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.819
 at the same time as it was in fallout 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.980
 just like a birthday when you get one 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.239
 level up in the same way 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.010
 Noble villas there you still have 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.209
 pleased that you will be stronger now 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.730
 just gets stronger and can be with you 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.290
 invest the larger opponents than pure 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.049
 this was necessary because the dragons were 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.709
 from the bottom up totally weak but now too 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.209
 the quests 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.430
 I remember my well 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.019
 I plead hero cards in the arena 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.370
 I feel she is spartacus 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.989
 how he fought one after the other 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.980
 massacred and so the sand under his 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.750
 feet with blood drives 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.220
 It was combative against a couple 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.430
 but I think it has to be for all 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.430
 purpose 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.050
 the fighting system is simple but 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.550
 requires a lot of skill and tactics 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.410
 so you have to perfect your bells 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.880
 vote or a strong evasion 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.530
 attack start when the monster the 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.359
 comes closer or a stormy one 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.290
 portal hit what actually even 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.090
 a little better in the little one 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.340
 works because it bends there 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.900
 not so much underpinned but also 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.760
 another quest like the ones in the past 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.010
 The dark brotherhood is just so blooming 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.389
 diversity and imaginativeness and around the 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.030
 It was all over the crown 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.139
 whole thing really scary for me what is 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.340
 today is still when you are 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.720
 in the evening without light in front of the screen 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.460
 squats and I know that one soon 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.660
 expected because the musical 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.330
 a background is as good as in hardly any 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.130
 We always have other role-playing games 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
 a dreamy melody in the ear if 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.310
 For example, we are visiting cities 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.630
 or extreme and well bring the music 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.919
 which comes when you look at the example of 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.800
 dark brotherhood and a schank 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.270
 and all these melodies he finds 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.680
 even houston loading screen worried 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.410
 I did not have to do that for years 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.430
 not forgotten 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.410
 but at sky environment does not really affect me 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.940
 the tune is positive on the example 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.800
 if the dragon is capable of music like that 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.720
 heroic that I'm just such a blatant 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.100
 action packed fight but wants the 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.850
 through this simple fighting mechanic I 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.860
 can experience 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.940
 but also ska tied really great quests 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.200
 and tunes to offer 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.030
 but unfortunately they are not as good as 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.039
 in oblivion of me simply lacks these 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.360
 magic moments is to be honest 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.580
 do not even know what it is in the 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.570
 The main thing at all goes 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.700
 comparatively enough I still have enough 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.470
 worth the whole quiz the bizkit 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.640
 or dark brotherhood or the 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.289
 This was the first time on the 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.970
 sound hits or the moments where that 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.770
 imperial empire is attacked sporadically 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.260
 or just every single city 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.539
 yourself or those huge monuments the 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.950
 just look so damn horny 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.310
 does not just mess with libya 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.870
 Fame 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.280
 because this oblivion worlds us 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.050
 such demon worlds for people that it 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.419
 did not know were just more than 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.100
 Annoying how many times I was already 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.300
 this dirty thing in it in this 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.590
 always look the same in the spa 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.539
 this always in the corridors 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.520
 and have the only stone at the end 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.169
 The tower only destroys a portal 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.240
 still has to destroy at least 100 to 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.090
 1000 there was one last mission 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.260
 anyway closed and also the 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.940
 Dungeons were all more than 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.979
 monotonous they looked as good as ever 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.430
 that's what makes it sky and clear 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.750
 better 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.580
 because there the dungeons just see 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.840
 unique and really cool from man 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.950
 To be honest, some could 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.900
 dungeons fall in love because they are so 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.870
 tell her amazingly and spend hours with her 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.669
 but also spend with animations 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.380
 he is very far ahead of me 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.330
 oblivion will 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.590
 you just notice that the game for the 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.390
 first person was developed 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.310
 I still have to cry because if I am 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.140
 you have to look at it you know 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.730
 it looks really damn good is 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.670
 It's a little harder to play though 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.960
 Looks like assembly though 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.700
 here my nostalgic feelings for 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.470
 to pronounce oblivion or if it is the 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.580
 opinion of many gamer is nevertheless 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.900
 i also love skyrim 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.460
 I really have a lot of time with that 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.980
 Unfortunately I did not spend much time playing games 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.390
 with oblivion in the sense, I say thank you 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.800
 for your attention and until the 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.010
 next time people have fun while 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.010
 suck
