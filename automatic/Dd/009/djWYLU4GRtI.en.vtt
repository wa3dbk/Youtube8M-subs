yeah<00:03:04.400> I'm<00:03:04.579> also<00:03:04.790> like<00:03:05.390> if<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:06.049> feel<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.829> maybe

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
yeah I'm also like if I feel that maybe

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.340

beer<00:03:07.639> pong<00:03:07.910> was<00:03:08.120> just<00:03:08.389> a<00:03:08.569> bit<00:03:09.019> too<00:03:09.049> athletic

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
beer pong was just a bit too athletic

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.009 
beer pong was just a bit too athletic
for<00:03:10.010> me<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.489> darts<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> next<00:03:11.420> best<00:03:11.569> thing<00:03:11.750> I

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
for me so darts is the next best thing I

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.509 
for me so darts is the next best thing I
think<00:03:12.319> maybe<00:03:12.500> dots<00:03:12.980> would<00:03:13.370> be<00:03:13.579> good<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:16.040> so

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
think maybe dots would be good and so

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.890 
think maybe dots would be good and so

bitterness<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.520> soundness<00:04:57.060> a<00:04:57.210> lot<00:04:57.630> so<00:04:58.289> I<00:04:58.320> say

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
bitterness and soundness a lot so I say

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.520 
bitterness and soundness a lot so I say
that<00:04:58.919> but<00:04:59.910> then<00:05:00.060> of<00:05:00.180> course<00:05:00.240> that's<00:05:01.110> often

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
that but then of course that's often

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.500 
that but then of course that's often
because<00:05:01.860> you're<00:05:02.039> given<00:05:02.370> people<00:05:02.849> have<00:05:03.180> often

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
because you're given people have often

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.440 
because you're given people have often
used<00:05:04.169> sugar<00:05:04.560> tomorrow<00:05:05.220> much<00:05:05.760> for<00:05:06.120> masks

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
used sugar tomorrow much for masks

things<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.080> aren't<00:05:07.289> well<00:05:07.440> cooked<00:05:07.770> because

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
things that aren't well cooked because

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.370 
things that aren't well cooked because
it<00:05:08.610> isn't<00:05:09.030> about<00:05:09.120> what<00:05:09.270> you<00:05:09.570> think<00:05:09.930> you<00:05:10.169> like

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
it isn't about what you think you like

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.350 
it isn't about what you think you like
it's<00:05:10.919> about<00:05:11.130> what<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.460> actually<00:05:11.700> like<00:05:12.180> and

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
it's about what you actually like and

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.560 
it's about what you actually like and
that's<00:05:12.510> why<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:12.690> think<00:05:12.840> food<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:13.950> always<00:05:14.570> such

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
that's why I think food is always such

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.190 
that's why I think food is always such
an<00:05:15.990> incredible<00:05:16.830> barometer<00:05:17.639> of<00:05:18.150> honesty<00:05:18.930> and

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
an incredible barometer of honesty and

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.430 
an incredible barometer of honesty and
authenticity<00:05:19.760> because

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
authenticity because

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.220 
authenticity because
you<00:05:22.620> like<00:05:23.100> eating<00:05:23.370> what<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.240> like<00:05:24.450> eating<00:05:24.900> and

you like eating what you like eating and

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.930 
you like eating what you like eating and
