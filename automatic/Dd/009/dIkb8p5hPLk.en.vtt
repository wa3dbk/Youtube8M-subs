took a bunch of picture along the way

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.150 
took a bunch of picture along the way
and<00:00:08.429> we'll<00:00:08.820> do<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.000> same<00:00:09.179> thing<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.809> down

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
and we'll do the same thing going down

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.780 
and we'll do the same thing going down
so<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.580> receive<00:00:12.330> an<00:00:13.139> inverted<00:00:13.710> macro<00:00:14.280> ring<00:00:14.549> in

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
so I receive an inverted macro ring in

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.029 
so I receive an inverted macro ring in
the<00:00:15.120> mail<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.630> long<00:00:16.260> ago<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.680> last<00:00:16.859> few

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the mail that long ago in the last few

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.550 
the mail that long ago in the last few
days<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.940> want<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> take<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.390> out<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:19.050> test

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
days and I want to take it out to test

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.670 
days and I want to take it out to test
it<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:20.070> how<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.160> work<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.750> ring<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.050> very

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
it see how it work so that ring is very

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.400 
it see how it work so that ring is very
good<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.189> take<00:00:23.369> allowed<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.539> take<00:00:24.720> macro<00:00:24.990> shots

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
good to take allowed to take macro shots

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.679 
good to take allowed to take macro shots
so<00:00:25.800> basically<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:26.910> work<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.510> take

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
so basically how it work is you take

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.660 
so basically how it work is you take
your<00:00:27.720> lens<00:00:28.230> which<00:00:28.439> would<00:00:28.680> know<00:00:29.070> me<00:00:29.250> put<00:00:29.490> on

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
your lens which would know me put on

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
your lens which would know me put on
your<00:00:29.849> SLR<00:00:30.269> camera<00:00:30.630> at<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> right<00:00:30.960> way<00:00:31.170> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
your SLR camera at the right way and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.370 
your SLR camera at the right way and
allow<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.850> invert<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.200> what

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
allow you to just invert it so what

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.590 
allow you to just invert it so what
happened<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.040> if<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.550> had<00:00:35.700> already<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.030> macular

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
happened is if you had already a macular

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.060 
happened is if you had already a macular
feature<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.170> could<00:00:37.320> actually<00:00:37.530> take<00:00:37.829> macro

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
feature or you could actually take macro

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.490 
feature or you could actually take macro
shots<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:38.790> lens<00:00:39.030> well<00:00:39.750> once<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
shots with your lens well once you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.160 
shots with your lens well once you
invert<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.010> your<00:00:41.790> lens<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.239> take<00:00:42.450> way<00:00:42.809> closer

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
invert it your lens will take way closer

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.209 
invert it your lens will take way closer
shots<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.280> if<00:00:44.309> you're<00:00:44.670> into<00:00:45.320> macro<00:00:46.320> insects<00:00:46.920> or

this will be mounted on a lance where

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.560 
this will be mounted on a lance where
you<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.740> mount<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> filter<00:01:23.790> anomaly<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you would mount like a filter anomaly so

is<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.630> mounted<00:01:52.110> properly<00:01:52.350> you'll<00:01:53.310> see

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
is this is mounted properly you'll see

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.280 
is this is mounted properly you'll see
there's<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.759> little<00:01:53.909> red<00:01:54.180> dot<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.110> is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
there's a little red dot here so this is

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.069 
there's a little red dot here so this is
a<00:01:55.320> canon<00:01:55.710> ring<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.759> fits<00:01:57.299> very<00:01:57.780> well<00:01:57.869> with

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
a canon ring so that fits very well with

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.600 
a canon ring so that fits very well with
your<00:01:58.649> SLR<00:01:59.159> body<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.320> we'll<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
your SLR body so what we'll do here is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.669 
your SLR body so what we'll do here is
we'll<00:02:02.880> take<00:02:03.829> this<00:02:04.909> tokina<00:02:05.909> lens<00:02:05.939> out<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:07.229> there

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.270 

and<00:02:10.679> we'll<00:02:11.069> replace<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.640> with<00:02:14.239> this<00:02:15.239> lens<00:02:15.540> so

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
and we'll replace it with this lens so

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.390 
and we'll replace it with this lens so
now<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.060> mounted<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.590> was<00:02:19.799> curious

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
now this is mounted and I was curious

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.759 
now this is mounted and I was curious
see<00:02:20.760> if<00:02:20.909> it<00:02:21.060> would<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.299> sturdy<00:02:21.870> lose<00:02:22.379> if<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
see if it would be sturdy lose if the

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.300 
see if it would be sturdy lose if the
light<00:02:22.950> will<00:02:23.129> go<00:02:23.250> through<00:02:23.609> and<00:02:23.909> it<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.510> perfect

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
light will go through and it is perfect

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.709 
light will go through and it is perfect
so<00:02:26.310> what<00:02:26.489> we'll<00:02:26.609> do<00:02:26.760> here<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.150> we'll<00:02:27.389> take<00:02:27.420> this

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
so what we'll do here is we'll take this

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.250 
so what we'll do here is we'll take this
gap<00:02:27.930> off<00:02:28.200> because<00:02:28.859> as<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.519> now<00:02:30.260> what

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
gap off because as you can see now what

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.160 
gap off because as you can see now what
would<00:02:31.500> have<00:02:31.650> been<00:02:31.889> before<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:33.569> part<00:02:33.930> would

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
would have been before that part would

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.800 
would have been before that part would
have<00:02:34.260> been<00:02:34.439> in<00:02:34.650> my<00:02:34.709> body<00:02:35.489> now<00:02:35.819> it's<00:02:36.150> going

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
have been in my body now it's going

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.420 
have been in my body now it's going
outside<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.409> want<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.620> be<00:02:37.650> careful<00:02:37.980> using

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
outside so you want to be careful using

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.849 
outside so you want to be careful using
your<00:02:39.030> lens<00:02:39.299> if<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.629> lose<00:02:39.840> using<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.409> good<00:02:40.620> lens

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
your lens if you lose using a good lens

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.819 
your lens if you lose using a good lens
that<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.220> are<00:02:41.750> using<00:02:42.750> like<00:02:43.079> I'm<00:02:43.230> daily<00:02:43.500> basis

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
that you are using like I'm daily basis

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.699 
that you are using like I'm daily basis
or<00:02:43.980> whatever<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:45.230> basically<00:02:46.230> what's<00:02:46.470> going

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
or whatever and basically what's going

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.179 
or whatever and basically what's going
on<00:02:46.859> is<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.310> would<00:02:47.870> just<00:02:48.870> recommend<00:02:49.019> testing<00:02:49.739> it

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
on is I would just recommend testing it

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.580 
on is I would just recommend testing it
first<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.730> take<00:02:50.939> a<00:02:50.970> look<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.419> how<00:02:52.079> far<00:02:52.439> you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
first to take a look like how far you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.860 
first to take a look like how far you
can<00:02:52.799> go<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.639> actual<00:02:54.090> depth<00:02:54.419> of<00:02:54.569> field

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
can go what is the actual depth of field

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.119 
can go what is the actual depth of field
and<00:02:55.109> so<00:02:55.319> on<00:02:55.579> because<00:02:57.680> we<00:02:58.680> won't<00:02:58.859> have<00:02:59.040> any

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
and so on because we won't have any

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.379 
and so on because we won't have any
information<00:02:59.519> that's<00:03:00.090> going<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.329> be

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
information that's going to be

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.929 
information that's going to be
transferred<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.739> body<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.250> camera<00:03:02.459> so

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
transferred to the body of the camera so

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.420 
transferred to the body of the camera so
you'll<00:03:03.629> see<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.049> put<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.319> manual<00:03:04.709> mode<00:03:04.980> here

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
you'll see if I put on manual mode here

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.209 
you'll see if I put on manual mode here
there's<00:03:05.969> no<00:03:06.180> F<00:03:06.389> stop<00:03:06.900> showing<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.709> shows

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
there's no F stop showing it just shows

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.490 
there's no F stop showing it just shows
00<00:03:08.939> so<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.209> need<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.569> really<00:03:09.780> do<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.079> work

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
00 so I need to really do that work

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.339 
00 so I need to really do that work
myself<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.549> take<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.819> look<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.989> closer

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
myself and take a look so the closer

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.979 
myself and take a look so the closer
I've<00:03:13.709> go<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.370> my<00:03:14.639> subject<00:03:15.150> with<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:15.449> lens<00:03:15.659> I

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
I've go to my subject with this lens I

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.289 
I've go to my subject with this lens I
find<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.500> depth<00:03:16.949> of<00:03:17.129> field<00:03:17.400> get<00:03:17.579> very<00:03:17.909> shallow

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
find the depth of field get very shallow

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.930 
find the depth of field get very shallow
so<00:03:18.629> it's<00:03:18.750> blurry<00:03:19.199> all<00:03:19.620> over<00:03:19.949> the<00:03:20.069> place<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.519> we

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
so it's blurry all over the place and we

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.420 
so it's blurry all over the place and we
have<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> little<00:03:21.449> little<00:03:22.260> zone<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.799> clarinets

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
have a little little zone of clarinets

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.289 
have a little little zone of clarinets
through<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.000> if<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:25.019> guys<00:03:25.169> are<00:03:25.500> into<00:03:26.299> like

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
through so if you guys are into like

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.530 
through so if you guys are into like
insects<00:03:27.900> or<00:03:28.739> even<00:03:29.220> acquire<00:03:29.609> a<00:03:29.849> macro

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
insects or even acquire a macro

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.170 
insects or even acquire a macro
photography<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:31.260> really<00:03:31.739> need<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:32.180> test

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
photography you really need to test

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.819 
photography you really need to test
maybe<00:03:33.389> different<00:03:33.659> lens<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.290> see<00:03:34.470> what<00:03:34.620> really

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
maybe different lens and see what really

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.729 
maybe different lens and see what really
works<00:03:35.489> for<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.909> but<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.870> lens<00:03:37.169> for<00:03:37.439> me<00:03:37.530> is

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
works for you but this lens for me is

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.830 
works for you but this lens for me is
perfect<00:03:38.189> that<00:03:38.699> give<00:03:38.849> me<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> little<00:03:39.299> range<00:03:39.569> i

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
perfect that give me a little range i

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.289 
perfect that give me a little range i
can<00:03:39.959> go<00:03:40.079> little<00:03:40.319> closer<00:03:40.560> or<00:03:40.919> further<00:03:41.159> and<00:03:41.549> play

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
can go little closer or further and play

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.360 
can go little closer or further and play
with<00:03:42.419> the<00:03:42.540> depth<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.049> field<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:43.590> i'll<00:03:44.009> show<00:03:44.280> you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
with the depth of field so i'll show you

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.860 
with the depth of field so i'll show you
some<00:03:44.519> example<00:03:44.909> afterwards<00:03:45.299> but<00:03:45.419> works<00:03:45.599> very

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
some example afterwards but works very

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.740 
some example afterwards but works very
good<00:03:46.549> this<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:47.729> cheap<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.180> dirty<00:03:48.299> tricks

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
good this is a cheap and dirty tricks

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.569 
good this is a cheap and dirty tricks
and<00:03:49.079> hopefully<00:03:49.470> work<00:03:49.709> fine<00:03:50.009> for<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.310> because

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
and hopefully work fine for you because

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.300 
and hopefully work fine for you because
for<00:03:50.790> me<00:03:50.939> to<00:03:51.150> hour<00:03:51.479> and<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.840> half<00:03:52.049> was<00:03:52.439> what<00:03:53.159> my
