00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
purple but there was something about it

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.749 
purple but there was something about it
i<00:01:54.850> really<00:01:55.210> liked<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.929> this<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.130> what<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.340> looks

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.879

like<00:01:58.030> sometimes<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.959> looks<00:01:59.109> almost<00:01:59.409> like<00:01:59.619> a

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
like sometimes it looks almost like a

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.129 
like sometimes it looks almost like a
gray<00:02:00.189> not<00:02:00.520> even<00:02:00.819> a<00:02:00.909> purple<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:01.899> it's<00:02:02.020> very

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
gray not even a purple so it's very

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.469 
gray not even a purple so it's very
interesting<00:02:02.829> how<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.609> color<00:02:03.969> can<00:02:04.450> be

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
interesting how the color can be

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.109 
interesting how the color can be
manipulated<00:02:05.229> depending<00:02:05.829> on<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.549> lighting
