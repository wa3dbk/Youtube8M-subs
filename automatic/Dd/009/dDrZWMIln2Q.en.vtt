aircraft<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.830> see<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.519> a<00:00:38.550> tip<00:00:38.760> dihedral

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
aircraft to see there's a tip dihedral

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.049 
aircraft to see there's a tip dihedral
see<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.379> 250<00:00:40.890> something<00:00:41.070> gives<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.580> vehicle

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
see it's 250 something gives the vehicle

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.880 
see it's 250 something gives the vehicle
stability<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.019> also<00:00:43.110> means<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.589> there's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
stability but also means that there's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
stability but also means that there's
more<00:00:44.370> clearance<00:00:45.000> between<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> tip<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.720> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
more clearance between the tip of the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020 
more clearance between the tip of the
wing<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.979> ground<00:00:47.369> if<00:00:47.670> you're<00:00:47.820> doing<00:00:47.909> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
wing and the ground if you're doing a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
wing and the ground if you're doing a
lot<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.269> low<00:00:48.449> tunes<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.470> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
lot of low tunes that can be a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.070 
lot of low tunes that can be a
life-saving<00:00:50.280> feature<00:00:50.970> so<00:00:51.629> let's<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.019> a

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
life-saving feature so let's have a

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.810 
life-saving feature so let's have a
close-up<00:00:52.320> look<00:00:52.470> at<00:00:52.650> this<00:00:52.830> thing<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.640> what

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
close-up look at this thing see what

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.859 
close-up look at this thing see what
makes<00:00:54.299> it<00:00:54.479> tick<00:00:54.540> now<00:00:56.269> up<00:00:57.269> front<00:00:57.540> here<00:00:57.750> we've

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
makes it tick now up front here we've

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.929 
makes it tick now up front here we've
got<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.080> taro<00:00:58.530> prop<00:00:58.860> engine<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.369> a<00:00:59.400> constant

00:00:59.929 --> 00:00:59.939 
got a taro prop engine with a constant

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.329 
got a taro prop engine with a constant
speed<00:01:00.299> prop<00:01:00.750> effect<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.589> variable<00:01:01.860> pitch<00:01:02.100> so

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
speed prop effect it's variable pitch so

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.250 
speed prop effect it's variable pitch so
they<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.970> actually<00:01:03.089> make<00:01:03.659> these<00:01:03.900> things<00:01:03.960> up

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
they can actually make these things up

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.750 
they can actually make these things up
they<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.530> reverse<00:01:04.860> them<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.280> need<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.489> by

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
they can reverse them if they need to by

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.390 
they can reverse them if they need to by
putting<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> reverse<00:01:06.630> pitch<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> spot

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
putting a reverse pitch on the spot

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.740 
putting a reverse pitch on the spot
hopefully<00:01:08.400> before<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.030> skies<00:01:09.270> I'll<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:09.600> some

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
hopefully before the skies I'll get some

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.870 
hopefully before the skies I'll get some
footage<00:01:10.080> showing<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.950> doing<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.640> there

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
footage showing one doing just there

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
footage showing one doing just there
backing<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.450> into<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.900> position<00:01:13.110> against

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
backing up into this position against

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.960 
backing up into this position against
them<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.250> drain<00:01:14.549> here

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
them the drain here

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.310 
them the drain here
three<00:01:15.360> bladed<00:01:15.630> pot<00:01:15.930> because<00:01:16.110> there's<00:01:16.259> an

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
three bladed pot because there's an

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
three bladed pot because there's an
awful<00:01:16.560> lot<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.979> power<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.610> need<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
awful lot of power there they need to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820 
awful lot of power there they need to
convert<00:01:18.150> their<00:01:18.299> comparative<00:01:18.720> thrust<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.410> you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
convert their comparative thrust and you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.650 
convert their comparative thrust and you
don't<00:01:19.950> want<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.250> too<00:01:20.910> much<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> way

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
don't want to have too much in the way

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.930 
don't want to have too much in the way
of<00:01:21.810> prop<00:01:22.530> diameter<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.550> it<00:01:23.640> limits<00:01:23.880> your

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
of prop diameter because it limits your

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
of prop diameter because it limits your
ground<00:01:24.210> clearance<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.720> when<00:01:24.840> you're

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
ground clearance and when you're

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.750 
ground clearance and when you're
operating<00:01:25.140> off<00:01:25.440> a<00:01:25.470> rough<00:01:26.130> field<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:26.640> whatever

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
you want as much ground clearance as you

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.399 
you want as much ground clearance as you

these<00:02:00.659> wings<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.350> let's<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.650> a<00:02:01.710> look

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
these wings and let's have a look

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.010 
these wings and let's have a look
underneath<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.340> they<00:02:02.540> agricultural<00:02:03.540> aspects

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
underneath it they agricultural aspects

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.530 
underneath it they agricultural aspects
now<00:02:04.979> here<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.220> go<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> pump<00:02:06.299> that's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
now here we go this is a pump that's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.080 
now here we go this is a pump that's
driven<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:08.009> airflow<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> plane<00:02:08.879> moves

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.279 
driven by the airflow as the plane moves
through<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.299> it's<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.539> centrifugal<00:02:09.929> pump

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
through the it's a centrifugal pump

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.619 
through the it's a centrifugal pump
leads<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.250> here<00:02:11.489> through<00:02:11.819> these<00:02:12.000> spray<00:02:12.360> booms

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
leads it here through these spray booms

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.820 
leads it here through these spray booms
and<00:02:12.840> each<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.080> these<00:02:13.170> booms<00:02:13.409> has<00:02:13.620> another

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
have a look around and you can see

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.429 
have a look around and you can see
they've<00:02:38.579> got<00:02:41.090> counterbalanced<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.439> fence

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
they've got counterbalanced this fence

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.630 
they've got counterbalanced this fence
is<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.829> on<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> end<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> linear

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
is that you on the end of the a linear

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.729 
is that you on the end of the a linear
stop<00:02:44.879> here<00:02:45.090> spilling<00:02:45.450> out<00:02:45.629> from<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.500> wing

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
stop here spilling out from the wing

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.170 
stop here spilling out from the wing
that's<00:02:47.129> who<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> get<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.849> would<00:02:47.939> otherwise

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
that's who the get that would otherwise

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.630 
that's who the get that would otherwise
be<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:49.049> huge<00:02:49.859> control<00:02:50.250> surfaces

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
be a huge control surfaces

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.460 
be a huge control surfaces
aerodynamically<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.629> aesthetically

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
aerodynamically and aesthetically

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.500 
aerodynamically and aesthetically
balanced<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.790> makes<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.090> easy<00:02:54.239> for<00:02:54.359> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
balanced so it makes it easy for the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.199 
balanced so it makes it easy for the
pilot<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.200> use<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.799> controls<00:02:56.099> flaps

quite<00:02:57.540> large<00:02:57.719> flaps<00:02:57.989> as<00:02:58.139> well<00:02:58.290> they<00:02:58.409> they<00:02:58.590> move

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
quite large flaps as well they they move

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.910 
quite large flaps as well they they move
out<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.489> they<00:02:59.639> come<00:02:59.819> down<00:03:00.379> in<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.560> back<00:03:01.680> here

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
out as they come down in the back here

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.679 
out as they come down in the back here
there<00:03:02.730> was<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.849> mess<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.120> hopper<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.480> here<00:03:03.629> you

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
there was a mess of hopper in here you

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.420 
there was a mess of hopper in here you
can<00:03:03.810> see<00:03:03.930> at<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.079> top<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:04.290> mess<00:03:05.069> of<00:03:05.250> hopper

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
can see at the top here mess of hopper

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.460 
can see at the top here mess of hopper
that<00:03:05.639> can<00:03:05.790> contain<00:03:06.239> all<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.689> spray<00:03:07.169> woody<00:03:07.349> but

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
that can contain all the spray woody but

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.059 
that can contain all the spray woody but
this<00:03:07.620> will<00:03:07.769> hold<00:03:08.269> 2.2<00:03:09.269> tons<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:10.349> spray<00:03:10.829> that's

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
this will hold 2.2 tons of spray that's

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.369 
this will hold 2.2 tons of spray that's
a<00:03:11.189> lot<00:03:11.549> of<00:03:11.579> weight<00:03:11.939> to<00:03:12.180> add<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.079> an<00:03:13.169> aircraft

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
a lot of weight to add to an aircraft

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.050 
a lot of weight to add to an aircraft
this<00:03:13.739> size<00:03:13.799> but<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.669> why<00:03:14.790> they<00:03:14.879> have<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
this size but that's why they have the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.490 
this size but that's why they have the
big<00:03:15.180> engine<00:03:15.419> up<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.599> front<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.019> all<00:03:16.379> this

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
big engine up the front and all this

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.360 
big engine up the front and all this
massive<00:03:16.919> wing<00:03:17.730> area<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.769> an<00:03:20.040> area

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
massive wing area so this is an area

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.190 
massive wing area so this is an area
where<00:03:20.489> they<00:03:20.549> can<00:03:20.579> store<00:03:20.970> stuff<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.540> even

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
where they can store stuff and even

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.119 
where they can store stuff and even
carry<00:03:22.530> people

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
carry people

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.500 
carry people
I<00:03:23.159> don't<00:03:23.370> know<00:03:23.430> if<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.579> lab<00:03:23.760> do<00:03:23.879> but<00:03:24.030> they<00:03:24.450> do

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
I don't know if a lab do but they do

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.599 
I don't know if a lab do but they do
carry<00:03:24.870> people<00:03:25.049> sometimes<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.189> move<00:03:26.370> down<00:03:26.459> the

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
carry people sometimes and move down the

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.839 
carry people sometimes and move down the
back<00:03:26.819> here<00:03:27.060> as<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.319> can<00:03:28.349> see<00:03:28.669> proudly<00:03:29.669> New

hard<00:03:35.069> life

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
hard life

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.080

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
not not peppered in anyway so they tend

think
and<00:04:08.220> you'll<00:04:08.400> notice<00:04:08.549> unusual<00:04:09.359> for<00:04:09.540> any

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199

and you'll notice unusual for any

aircraft they have mud flaps because as

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.629 
aircraft they have mud flaps because as
I<00:04:12.900> mentioned<00:04:12.930> before<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.470> think<00:04:13.650> we<00:04:14.040> get<00:04:14.159> mud

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
I mentioned before you think we get mud

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.490 
I mentioned before you think we get mud
and<00:04:14.849> all<00:04:15.479> sorts<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:15.780> things<00:04:15.870> picked<00:04:16.199> up<00:04:16.349> from

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
and all sorts of things picked up from

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.140 
and all sorts of things picked up from
those<00:04:16.650> wheels<00:04:16.859> as<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.159> land<00:04:17.459> on<00:04:17.609> sometimes

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
those wheels as you land on sometimes

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.509 
those wheels as you land on sometimes
quite<00:04:18.419> muddy<00:04:18.750> or<00:04:18.959> rotten<00:04:19.289> paddocks<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:20.370> that's

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
quite muddy or rotten paddocks so that's

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.060 
quite muddy or rotten paddocks so that's
quite<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.000> handy<00:04:21.449> feature<00:04:21.599> now<00:04:22.470> one<00:04:22.650> thing<00:04:22.889> I

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
quite a handy feature now one thing I

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.100 
quite a handy feature now one thing I
find<00:04:23.400> rather<00:04:23.880> surprising<00:04:24.659> for<00:04:24.870> an<00:04:24.960> aircraft

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
find rather surprising for an aircraft

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.589 
find rather surprising for an aircraft
like<00:04:25.289> this<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.740> tiny<00:04:26.099> tiny<00:04:26.940> rudder<00:04:27.360> look

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
like this is the tiny tiny rudder look

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.719 
like this is the tiny tiny rudder look
how<00:04:27.690> small<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.050> rudder<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.650> when<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.580> think

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
how small that rudder is when you think

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.939 
how small that rudder is when you think
about<00:04:29.849> it<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.210> get<00:04:30.990> off<00:04:31.139> has<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.470> be<00:04:31.560> extremely

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
about it you get off has to be extremely

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.620 
about it you get off has to be extremely
maneuverable<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.789> able<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.030> side<00:04:33.240> slip<00:04:33.479> into

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
maneuverable and able to side slip into

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.260 
maneuverable and able to side slip into
landings<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.289> so<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.400> there<00:04:35.550> isn't

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
landings and so but there isn't

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.880 
landings and so but there isn't
it'll<00:04:36.420> be<00:04:36.540> small<00:04:36.840> rudder<00:04:37.290> it's<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.710> tiny

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
it'll be small rudder it's a tiny

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.110 
it'll be small rudder it's a tiny
percentage<00:04:38.310> of<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.490> total<00:04:38.670> vertical

stabilizer<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:40.170> don't<00:04:40.590> know<00:04:40.680> what<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:40.950> is<00:04:41.010> and

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
stabilizer I don't know what that is and

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.370 
stabilizer I don't know what that is and
if<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.400> pilot<00:04:41.820> comes<00:04:42.000> back<00:04:42.210> I'll<00:04:43.020> try<00:04:43.260> and

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
if the pilot comes back I'll try and

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.290 
if the pilot comes back I'll try and
interview<00:04:43.830> them<00:04:43.980> and<00:04:44.070> get<00:04:44.250> some<00:04:44.430> insight<00:04:45.090> into

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
interview them and get some insight into

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.570 
interview them and get some insight into
how<00:04:45.750> these<00:04:45.900> things<00:04:46.110> handle<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.770> exactly

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
how these things handle and exactly

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
where that rudder is even effective hope

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.810 
where that rudder is even effective hope
it<00:04:50.100> would<00:04:50.250> be<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:52.350> as<00:04:53.100> I<00:04:53.250> was<00:04:53.370> saying<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.640> want

it would be and as I was saying you want

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.820

you're<00:05:18.240> going<00:05:18.480> now<00:05:19.100> this<00:05:20.100> piece<00:05:20.550> of<00:05:20.760> metal

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
you're going now this piece of metal

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.820 
you're going now this piece of metal
here<00:05:21.540> I'm<00:05:21.780> not<00:05:21.900> sure<00:05:21.960> what<00:05:22.200> that<00:05:22.230> is<00:05:22.380> but<00:05:22.500> it

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
here I'm not sure what that is but it

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.230 
here I'm not sure what that is but it
wouldn't<00:05:23.100> surprise<00:05:23.310> me<00:05:23.520> if<00:05:23.790> it<00:05:23.880> was<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.030> wire

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
wouldn't surprise me if it was a wire

I'm<00:05:40.980> just<00:05:41.390> suggesting<00:05:42.390> that<00:05:42.690> might<00:05:42.870> be<00:05:42.960> the

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
I'm just suggesting that might be the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.420 
I'm just suggesting that might be the
case<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.260> know<00:05:43.440> that's<00:05:43.770> what<00:05:43.950> they<00:05:44.040> used<00:05:44.220> on<00:05:44.340> the

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
case I know that's what they used on the

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.750 
case I know that's what they used on the
helicopters<00:05:45.680> and<00:05:46.680> how<00:05:47.010> much<00:05:47.190> fuel<00:05:47.490> will<00:05:47.670> is

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
helicopters and how much fuel will is

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.760 
helicopters and how much fuel will is
carry<00:05:48.030> well<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.690> seems<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:48.930> be<00:05:48.990> four<00:05:49.320> tanks

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
carry well it seems to be four tanks

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.990 
carry well it seems to be four tanks

that one's 141 the back tank front tank
is<00:05:56.910> 142<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:57.840> I<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.530> same<00:05:58.710> on<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:58.920> other<00:05:58.950> side

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
is 142 and I the same on the other side

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.160 
is 142 and I the same on the other side
there's<00:05:59.640> an<00:05:59.730> awful<00:06:00.300> lot<00:06:00.330> of<00:06:00.510> fuel<00:06:00.750> but<00:06:00.840> then

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
there's an awful lot of fuel but then

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.380 
there's an awful lot of fuel but then
again<00:06:01.410> a<00:06:01.620> powerful<00:06:02.370> gas<00:06:02.550> turbine<00:06:02.910> engine<00:06:03.210> will

again a powerful gas turbine engine will

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.870 
again a powerful gas turbine engine will

than a wet and a mirror a rear-vision
mirror<00:06:13.890> I<00:06:14.250> guess<00:06:14.430> this<00:06:15.150> one<00:06:15.360> I<00:06:15.510> don't<00:06:15.570> know

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
mirror I guess this one I don't know

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.330 
mirror I guess this one I don't know
where<00:06:15.900> it's<00:06:16.020> gonna<00:06:16.140> show<00:06:16.590> you<00:06:16.620> but<00:06:16.860> maybe<00:06:17.040> I

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
where it's gonna show you but maybe I

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
where it's gonna show you but maybe I
think<00:06:17.490> actually<00:06:17.880> gives<00:06:18.030> you<00:06:18.120> a<00:06:18.150> look<00:06:18.210> at<00:06:18.330> a

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
think actually gives you a look at a

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.970 
think actually gives you a look at a
pump<00:06:18.600> as<00:06:18.750> you're<00:06:18.900> in<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.080> cockpit<00:06:19.590> you<00:06:19.860> can

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
pump as you're in the cockpit you can

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.560 
pump as you're in the cockpit you can
look<00:06:20.130> down<00:06:20.250> here<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.700> see<00:06:21.030> I<00:06:21.300> don't<00:06:21.450> know

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
look down here and see I don't know

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.120 
look down here and see I don't know
maybe<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:21.870> wheels<00:06:22.050> maybe<00:06:22.350> the<00:06:22.500> pump<00:06:22.680> make

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
maybe the wheels maybe the pump make

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.200 
maybe the wheels maybe the pump make
sure<00:06:23.250> everything's<00:06:23.550> ticking<00:06:23.850> over<00:06:24.090> I<00:06:24.150> suppose

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
sure everything's ticking over I suppose

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.570 
sure everything's ticking over I suppose
but<00:06:25.050> you<00:06:25.200> don't<00:06:25.380> often<00:06:25.560> see<00:06:25.710> rearview<00:06:26.160> mirrors

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
but you don't often see rearview mirrors

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.080 
but you don't often see rearview mirrors
on<00:06:26.960> full-size<00:06:27.960> aircraft

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
on full-size aircraft

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.940 
on full-size aircraft
now<00:06:29.690> it<00:06:29.810> might<00:06:29.960> have<00:06:30.200> a<00:06:30.230> very<00:06:30.470> small<00:06:30.740> rudder

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
now it might have a very small rudder

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.310 
now it might have a very small rudder
but<00:06:31.639> they<00:06:31.790> have<00:06:31.940> a<00:06:31.970> massive<00:06:32.540> elevator<00:06:33.169> on

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
but they have a massive elevator on

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.740 
but they have a massive elevator on
these<00:06:33.560> aircraft<00:06:34.400> I<00:06:34.460> guess<00:06:34.610> they<00:06:34.760> need<00:06:34.970> lots<00:06:35.630> of

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
these aircraft I guess they need lots of

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.930 
these aircraft I guess they need lots of
pitch<00:06:35.960> control<00:06:36.290> because<00:06:36.590> the<00:06:36.820> when<00:06:37.820> you're

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
pitch control because the when you're

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.210 
pitch control because the when you're
flying<00:06:38.150> and<00:06:38.500> cramped<00:06:39.500> conditions<00:06:39.680> you<00:06:40.010> need

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
flying and cramped conditions you need

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.800 
flying and cramped conditions you need
to<00:06:40.400> have<00:06:40.550> a<00:06:40.580> responsive<00:06:41.120> aircraft<00:06:41.450> certainly

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
to have a responsive aircraft certainly

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.720 
to have a responsive aircraft certainly
and<00:06:41.930> pitch<00:06:42.200> so<00:06:42.470> that<00:06:42.500> you<00:06:42.680> can<00:06:42.830> avoid<00:06:43.460> the

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
and pitch so that you can avoid the

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.570 
and pitch so that you can avoid the
ground<00:06:44.090> then<00:06:45.020> you<00:06:45.110> can<00:06:45.230> see<00:06:45.380> here's<00:06:46.220> with<00:06:46.400> most

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
ground then you can see here's with most

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.430 
ground then you can see here's with most
things<00:06:46.730> a<00:06:47.090> lot<00:06:47.389> of<00:06:47.419> the<00:06:47.480> controls<00:06:47.840> and<00:06:48.290> the

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
things a lot of the controls and the

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.470 
things a lot of the controls and the
linkages<00:06:48.770> are<00:06:48.889> pretty<00:06:49.100> pretty<00:06:49.850> basic<00:06:50.150> pretty
