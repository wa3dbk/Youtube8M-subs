00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
the reason we wanted him on that is

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.849 
the reason we wanted him on that is
because<00:04:13.989> he<00:04:14.170> has<00:04:14.380> difficulties<00:04:15.299> focusing<00:04:16.299> and

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
because he has difficulties focusing and

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.700 
because he has difficulties focusing and
he's<00:04:21.330> he's<00:04:22.330> never<00:04:22.479> been<00:04:22.690> diagnosed<00:04:23.110> with<00:04:23.229> a<00:04:23.410> TD

he's he's never been diagnosed with a TD

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.339 
he's he's never been diagnosed with a TD
or<00:04:23.740> ADHD<00:04:24.099> but<00:04:24.760> yeah<00:04:25.060> he<00:04:25.390> would<00:04:25.599> be<00:04:25.840> he<00:04:26.260> would

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
or ADHD but yeah he would be he would

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:26.970 
or ADHD but yeah he would be he would
get<00:04:26.500> used

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
get used

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.220 
get used
distracted<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:29.370> was<00:04:30.370> tired<00:04:30.730> all<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.780> time

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
distracted and was tired all the time

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.990 
distracted and was tired all the time
would<00:04:32.530> wake<00:04:32.740> up<00:04:32.920> in<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.070> really<00:04:33.370> bad<00:04:33.520> mood<00:04:33.790> and

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
would wake up in a really bad mood and

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.550 
would wake up in a really bad mood and
would<00:04:34.210> probably<00:04:34.480> be<00:04:34.780> like<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.260> for<00:04:35.440> at<00:04:35.500> least

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
would probably be like that for at least

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.800 
would probably be like that for at least
two<00:04:35.890> hours<00:04:36.040> and<00:04:36.430> that's<00:04:36.550> not<00:04:36.880> that's<00:04:37.360> no<00:04:37.600> joke

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
two hours and that's not that's no joke

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.110 
two hours and that's not that's no joke
at<00:04:37.990> all<00:04:38.110> some<00:04:38.920> days<00:04:39.070> he<00:04:39.250> would<00:04:39.280> be<00:04:39.400> groggy<00:04:39.790> all

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120
