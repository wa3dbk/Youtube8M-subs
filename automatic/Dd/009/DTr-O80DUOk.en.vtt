our<00:00:29.189> monster<00:00:29.580> Hummer<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.060> try<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> back<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.109> up

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
our monster Hummer and try to back it up

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.840 
our monster Hummer and try to back it up
again<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:31.650> at<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> Dakar<00:00:32.130> Rally<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:34.850> think

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
again here at the Dakar Rally I think

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.060 
again here at the Dakar Rally I think
the<00:00:35.940> challenge<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> car<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.739> gotten

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the challenge of the car is it's gotten

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.860 
the challenge of the car is it's gotten
so<00:00:38.250> much<00:00:38.370> more<00:00:38.610> competitive<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.360> last<00:00:39.540> couple

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
so much more competitive the last couple

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.709 
so much more competitive the last couple
of<00:00:39.899> years<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.590> remember<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.550> 19<00:00:42.000> hours<00:00:42.329> into<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
of years I remember at 19 hours into the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.799 
of years I remember at 19 hours into the
race<00:00:42.860> there<00:00:43.860> was<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.850> five<00:00:45.210> or<00:00:45.239> six<00:00:45.570> cars

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
race there was I think five or six cars

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.150 
race there was I think five or six cars
separated<00:00:46.320> by<00:00:46.379> about<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.680> minute<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> half

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
separated by about a minute and a half

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
separated by about a minute and a half
so<00:00:47.760> we've<00:00:48.270> worked<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.570> hard<00:00:48.780> over<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
so we've worked really hard over the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.650 
so we've worked really hard over the
winter<00:00:49.920> time<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.430> our<00:00:50.460> Hummer<00:00:50.760> doing<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> lot

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
winter time with our Hummer doing a lot

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
winter time with our Hummer doing a lot
of<00:00:51.719> testing<00:00:52.140> we're<00:00:52.680> basically<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.100> run<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of testing we're basically we run the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.510 
of testing we're basically we run the
thing<00:00:53.610> wide<00:00:53.789> open

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.460 

after<00:00:59.270> Robbie<00:00:59.450> came<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.900> us<00:00:59.990> at<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.260> end<00:01:00.380> of

after Robbie came to us at the end of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.680 
after Robbie came to us at the end of

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
last year one a little more power we

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.049 
last year one a little more power we

a 50-hour durability package that we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.420 
a 50-hour durability package that we
completed<00:01:12.080> that<00:01:12.320> allows<00:01:12.560> Robbie<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.100> run<00:01:13.280> this

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
completed that allows Robbie to run this

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.070 
completed that allows Robbie to run this
thing<00:01:13.640> as<00:01:13.790> hard<00:01:14.000> as<00:01:14.120> he<00:01:14.180> wants<00:01:14.510> from<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.810> drop

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
open right along with them we also

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.200 
open right along with them we also
developed<00:01:53.130> specific<00:01:54.130> cam<00:01:54.369> for<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.820> air

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
developed specific cam for the air

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.670 
developed specific cam for the air
restrictor<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.050> deck<00:01:56.200> our<00:01:56.410> rules

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
restrictor that the deck our rules

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.469 
restrictor that the deck our rules
require<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.729> complete<00:01:58.090> air<00:01:58.240> induction

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
require and a complete air induction

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.870 
require and a complete air induction
system<00:01:58.720> with<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.650> high-pressure<00:02:00.040> intake<00:02:00.700> to

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
system with a high-pressure intake to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.150 
system with a high-pressure intake to
also<00:02:01.150> gain<00:02:01.360> some<00:02:01.600> more<00:02:01.720> power<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.380> probably<00:02:03.070> is

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
also gain some more power so probably is

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.620 
also gain some more power so probably is
really<00:02:03.369> looking<00:02:03.610> forward<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.450> really

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
really looking forward to this to really

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.440 
really looking forward to this to really
push<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:04.960> hard<00:02:05.170> for<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.500> entire<00:02:05.770> race

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
push it hard for the entire race

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.440 
push it hard for the entire race
got<00:02:07.869> my<00:02:08.020> pager<00:02:08.319> ringing

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
got my pager ringing

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.450 
got my pager ringing
Oh
