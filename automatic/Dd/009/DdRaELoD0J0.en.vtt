is<00:01:21.959> to<00:01:22.079> make<00:01:22.229> sure<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.469> have<00:01:22.619> enough<00:01:22.799> yarn<00:01:23.509> for

is to make sure you have enough yarn for

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.489 
is to make sure you have enough yarn for
the<00:01:24.569> project<00:01:24.719> you<00:01:25.079> don't<00:01:25.200> want<00:01:25.319> to<00:01:25.380> run<00:01:25.469> into

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
the project you don't want to run into

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:27.859 
the project you don't want to run into
garrn<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.789> gauges<00:01:26.999> off<00:01:27.359> you<00:01:27.719> know

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
garrn and if your gauges off you know

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.739 
garrn and if your gauges off you know
it's<00:01:28.049> possible<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.649> could<00:01:28.829> run<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> yarn

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
it's possible you could run out of yarn

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.989 
it's possible you could run out of yarn
to<00:01:30.749> make<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.929> gauge<00:01:31.229> swatch<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:32.249> want<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.759> look

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
to make a gauge swatch you want to look

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.609 
to make a gauge swatch you want to look
at<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.209> gauge<00:01:33.389> of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.659> yarn<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.289> the<00:01:34.380> gauge

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
at the gauge of the yarn and the gauge

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.910 
at the gauge of the yarn and the gauge
of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> yarn<00:01:35.069> says<00:01:35.399> four<00:01:35.789> stitches<00:01:36.240> per<00:01:36.539> inch

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
of the yarn says four stitches per inch

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.760 
of the yarn says four stitches per inch
so<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.609> want<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.969> cast<00:01:39.209> on<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.600> least<00:01:39.899> 16

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
so we want to cast on at least 16

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.039 
so we want to cast on at least 16
stitches<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:41.609> you<00:01:42.090> want<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> count<00:01:42.539> how

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
stitches and then you want to count how

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.949 
stitches and then you want to count how
many<00:01:43.109> stitches<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:44.219> in<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.359> inch<00:01:46.069> and<00:01:47.959> then

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
many stitches are in that inch and then

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.149 
many stitches are in that inch and then
similarly<00:01:49.969> you<00:01:50.969> want<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> count<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.840> Rose

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
similarly you want to count your Rose

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.519 
similarly you want to count your Rose
marking<00:01:53.159> off<00:01:53.340> an<00:01:53.520> inch<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.200> want<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.319> count

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:55.529 
marking off an inch you want to count

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:59.300 
marking off an inch you want to count
how<00:01:56.039> many<00:01:56.099> rows<00:01:56.759> are<00:01:57.599> little<00:01:58.349> v's<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.159> you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310

Brenda<00:05:48.469> now<00:05:48.620> what<00:05:48.770> you<00:05:48.860> said<00:05:49.099> about<00:05:49.630> you<00:05:50.630> made

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
Brenda now what you said about you made

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.890 
Brenda now what you said about you made
it<00:05:51.099> harder<00:05:52.099> than<00:05:52.130> it<00:05:52.279> seemed<00:05:52.789> I<00:05:53.150> think<00:05:53.690> that's

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
it harder than it seemed I think that's

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.459 
it harder than it seemed I think that's
my<00:05:54.380> problem<00:05:54.409> or<00:05:55.370> that's<00:05:55.909> been<00:05:56.180> my<00:05:56.469> pattern

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:57.469 
my problem or that's been my pattern

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:58.899 
my problem or that's been my pattern
with<00:05:57.680> knitting<00:05:58.039> is<00:05:58.159> that<00:05:58.279> I<00:05:58.310> always<00:05:58.669> think

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
with knitting is that I always think

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.339 
with knitting is that I always think
it's<00:05:59.089> going<00:05:59.330> to<00:05:59.419> be<00:05:59.570> harder<00:05:59.960> than<00:05:59.990> it<00:06:00.139> actually

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
it's going to be harder than it actually

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.640 
it's going to be harder than it actually
is<00:06:00.650> and<00:06:01.130> once<00:06:01.699> I<00:06:01.820> start<00:06:02.060> doing<00:06:02.510> it<00:06:02.690> it's<00:06:03.289> really

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
is and once I start doing it it's really

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.620 
is and once I start doing it it's really
easy<00:06:04.010> and<00:06:04.279> it<00:06:04.400> becomes<00:06:04.669> really<00:06:04.940> relaxing

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
easy and it becomes really relaxing

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.079 
easy and it becomes really relaxing
really<00:06:05.839> quickly<00:06:06.229> it's<00:06:06.710> just<00:06:07.039> new<00:06:07.250> things<00:06:07.669> I

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:08.089 
really quickly it's just new things I

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:10.089 
really quickly it's just new things I
seem<00:06:08.750> too<00:06:08.960> worried<00:06:09.199> that<00:06:09.800> they're<00:06:09.949> going<00:06:10.039> to

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
seem too worried that they're going to

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.570 
seem too worried that they're going to
be<00:06:10.190> difficult<00:06:10.430> I<00:06:10.969> don't<00:06:11.210> know<00:06:11.300> why<00:06:12.279> because<00:06:13.279> I

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
be difficult I don't know why because I

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.370 
be difficult I don't know why because I
haven't<00:06:13.789> run<00:06:14.240> into<00:06:14.419> anything<00:06:14.750> really<00:06:15.050> hard

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
haven't run into anything really hard

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.159 
haven't run into anything really hard
yet<00:06:15.680> but<00:06:16.099> once<00:06:16.279> I<00:06:16.400> start<00:06:16.639> doing<00:06:16.969> it<00:06:17.150> it<00:06:17.510> comes

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
yet but once I start doing it it comes

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.830 
yet but once I start doing it it comes
really<00:06:18.349> quickly<00:06:19.120> you<00:06:20.120> know<00:06:20.210> you<00:06:20.270> would<00:06:20.479> get
