one down the bottom side and another one
I<00:00:29.090> just<00:00:29.720> behind<00:00:29.989> this<00:00:30.230> AC<00:00:30.470> line<00:00:30.800> there<00:00:31.570> now

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
I just behind this AC line there now

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.360 
I just behind this AC line there now
next<00:00:32.870> before<00:00:33.290> I<00:00:33.530> start<00:00:33.800> removing<00:00:33.980> these<00:00:34.190> bolts

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
next before I start removing these bolts

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.729 
next before I start removing these bolts
what<00:00:34.610> I'll<00:00:34.700> do<00:00:34.820> is<00:00:34.940> I'll<00:00:35.059> remove<00:00:35.360> these

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
plugged in the back side here for the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.060 
plugged in the back side here for the
high<00:00:38.120> beam<00:00:38.330> low<00:00:38.480> beam<00:00:38.690> forcing<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.770> parking

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
high beam low beam forcing the parking

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.560 
high beam low beam forcing the parking
light<00:00:40.190> one<00:00:40.370> I<00:00:40.400> can't<00:00:40.730> exactly<00:00:40.940> act<00:00:41.210> this<00:00:41.360> right

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
light one I can't exactly act this right

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.970 
light one I can't exactly act this right
now<00:00:41.720> so<00:00:41.750> once<00:00:42.080> the<00:00:42.260> headlight<00:00:42.530> assembly<00:00:42.560> is

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
now so once the headlight assembly is

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.950 
now so once the headlight assembly is
out<00:00:43.160> I'll<00:00:43.370> remove<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:44.000> one<00:00:44.180> after<00:00:44.360> now<00:00:44.870> in

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
out I'll remove that one after now in

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
out I'll remove that one after now in
order<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:45.200> remove<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.470> wires<00:00:45.650> in<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:45.860> back

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
order to remove the wires in the back

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.260 
order to remove the wires in the back
here<00:00:46.190> basically<00:00:46.610> this<00:00:46.730> one<00:00:46.850> here<00:00:47.000> will<00:00:47.120> just

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
here basically this one here will just

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.360 
here basically this one here will just
have<00:00:47.360> a<00:00:47.390> spot<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:47.780> just<00:00:47.960> depress<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.950> Tang<00:00:49.160> on

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
have a spot you just depress the Tang on

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.000 
have a spot you just depress the Tang on
there<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.760> pull<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.120> straight<00:00:50.150> back<00:00:51.010> and

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
there and pull it straight back and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.620 
there and pull it straight back and
that's<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.310> other<00:00:52.400> one<00:00:52.520> here<00:00:52.790> you<00:00:53.420> want<00:00:53.600> to

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
that's the other one here you want to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.750 
that's the other one here you want to
simply<00:00:53.900> just<00:00:54.080> pull<00:00:54.500> back<00:00:54.530> on<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.070> Tang<00:00:55.340> here

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
simply just pull back on the Tang here

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.060 
simply just pull back on the Tang here
and<00:00:55.940> then<00:00:56.210> pull<00:00:56.720> it<00:00:56.810> straight<00:00:56.930> out<00:00:57.230> like<00:00:57.800> so

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
and then pull it straight out like so

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.680 
and then pull it straight out like so
now<00:00:58.550> once<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:58.790> remove<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.090> four<00:00:59.270> bolts<00:00:59.420> here

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
now once you remove the four bolts here

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.060 
now once you remove the four bolts here
now<00:00:59.840> there<00:01:00.020> are<00:01:00.079> different<00:01:00.410> sizes<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.920> ones

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
now there are different sizes the ones

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.590 
now there are different sizes the ones
in<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.220> top<00:01:01.400> are<00:01:01.640> smaller<00:01:02.000> diameter<00:01:02.450> than<00:01:02.570> the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
in the top are smaller diameter than the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.119 
in the top are smaller diameter than the
ones<00:01:02.780> on<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.930> bottom<00:01:02.960> now<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.680> ones<00:01:03.950> in<00:01:04.040> the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
ones on the bottom now the ones in the

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.350 
ones on the bottom now the ones in the
bottom<00:01:04.250> are<00:01:04.430> also<00:01:04.610> known<00:01:04.909> because<00:01:05.180> they<00:01:05.299> do

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
bottom are also known because they do

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.929 
bottom are also known because they do
have<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.950> torque<00:01:06.950> bit<00:01:07.130> face<00:01:07.340> on<00:01:07.549> them<00:01:07.700> as<00:01:07.759> well

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
have a torque bit face on them as well

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.349 
have a torque bit face on them as well
as<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:08.180> hex<00:01:08.659> head<00:01:08.899> bolt<00:01:09.969> now<00:01:10.969> in<00:01:11.030> order<00:01:11.149> to<00:01:11.210> gain

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 
as a hex head bolt now in order to gain

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:12.940 
as a hex head bolt now in order to gain
access<00:01:11.509> to<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.780> bottom<00:01:12.049> ones<00:01:12.170> -<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:12.469> is<00:01:12.590> handy

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
access to the bottom ones - it is handy

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.099 
access to the bottom ones - it is handy
if<00:01:13.039> you<00:01:13.159> have<00:01:13.189> a<00:01:13.399> six<00:01:13.880> inch<00:01:14.060> extension<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.749> I'm

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
if you have a six inch extension and I'm

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:16.539 
if you have a six inch extension and I'm
still<00:01:15.319> using<00:01:15.439> a<00:01:15.590> shallow<00:01:15.920> socket<00:01:16.399> for

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
still using a shallow socket for

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:17.559 
still using a shallow socket for
everything<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:17.119> order<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.420> move<00:01:17.479> the

everything in order to move the
headlight<00:01:17.810> assembly<00:01:17.840> here<00:01:18.319> you<00:01:18.409> just<00:01:18.469> simply

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
headlight assembly here you just simply

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.080 
headlight assembly here you just simply
grab<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.069> from<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.219> inside<00:01:19.549> here<00:01:19.789> by<00:01:19.909> where

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
grab it from the inside here by where

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.599 
grab it from the inside here by where
the<00:01:20.210> grille<00:01:20.420> side<00:01:20.689> is<00:01:21.249> you<00:01:22.249> want<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.460> pull

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
the grille side is you want to pull

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:23.770 
the grille side is you want to pull
straight<00:01:22.850> out<00:01:22.909> somebody's<00:01:23.329> evolved<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.659> little

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
straight out somebody's evolved a little

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.200 
straight out somebody's evolved a little
jiggling<00:01:24.229> here<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:25.130> can<00:01:25.219> see<00:01:25.429> once<00:01:25.969> you<00:01:26.060> have

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
jiggling here you can see once you have

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.120 
jiggling here you can see once you have
it<00:01:26.329> out<00:01:26.450> there<00:01:26.689> now<00:01:27.289> we<00:01:27.350> can<00:01:27.560> gain<00:01:27.770> access<00:01:27.950> to

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
it out there now we can gain access to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.800 
it out there now we can gain access to
the<00:01:28.249> last<00:01:28.460> wire<00:01:28.789> there<00:01:29.030> just<00:01:29.329> sliding<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:29.719> over

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the last wire there just sliding it over
