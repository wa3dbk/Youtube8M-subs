00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:59.610 
different tutorial so here's how the
intro<00:03:47.290> looks<00:03:47.470> 2<00:03:48.430> 3<00:03:49.090> 4<00:03:58.260> then<00:03:59.260> we're<00:03:59.410> into<00:03:59.530> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
intro looks 2 3 4 then we're into the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.110 
intro looks 2 3 4 then we're into the
verse<00:03:59.800> so<00:04:00.310> let's<00:04:00.460> start<00:04:00.670> by<00:04:00.790> getting<00:04:00.850> our

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
verse so let's start by getting our

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.330 
verse so let's start by getting our
fingers<00:04:01.390> on<00:04:01.570> this<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.870> power<00:04:02.110> chord<00:04:02.470> I'm<00:04:03.130> just

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
fingers on this a power chord I'm just

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.980 
fingers on this a power chord I'm just
going<00:04:03.490> to<00:04:03.550> be<00:04:03.670> focused<00:04:04.300> on<00:04:04.420> three<00:04:04.690> strings

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
going to be focused on three strings

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.710 
going to be focused on three strings
here<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.320> string<00:04:05.770> is<00:04:05.800> open<00:04:06.360> 2nd<00:04:07.360> fret<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.600> D

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
here the a string is open 2nd fret of D

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.480 
here the a string is open 2nd fret of D
2nd<00:04:08.350> for<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.590> G<00:04:08.800> all<00:04:08.950> with<00:04:09.100> our<00:04:09.190> pointer

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
2nd for the G all with our pointer

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.610 
2nd for the G all with our pointer
finger<00:04:09.520> and<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.780> we're<00:04:10.900> gonna<00:04:10.990> go<00:04:11.260> for<00:04:11.560> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
finger and so we're gonna go for the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.960 
finger and so we're gonna go for the
intro<00:04:11.980> 2<00:04:12.210> 3<00:04:13.210> 4<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:18.370> all<00:04:18.460> we're<00:04:18.610> doing<00:04:18.790> there<00:04:18.940> is

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
intro 2 3 4 so all we're doing there is

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.630 
intro 2 3 4 so all we're doing there is
getting<00:04:19.210> our<00:04:19.390> ring<00:04:19.570> finger<00:04:19.860> instead<00:04:20.860> of<00:04:21.100> the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
getting our ring finger instead of the

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.460 
getting our ring finger instead of the
2nd<00:04:21.940> fret<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.150> D<00:04:22.270> it's<00:04:22.450> on<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.630> 4th<00:04:22.870> fret<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.320> D

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
2nd fret of D it's on the 4th fret of D

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.470 
2nd fret of D it's on the 4th fret of D
and<00:04:23.890> we're<00:04:24.340> alternating<00:04:24.850> between<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.270> 4th

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
and we're alternating between the 4th

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.060 
and we're alternating between the 4th
fret<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.900> 2nd<00:04:26.230> fret<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.500> D<00:04:26.620> everything

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
fret and the 2nd fret of D everything

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.240 
fret and the 2nd fret of D everything
else<00:04:27.220> stays<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.460> same<00:04:27.670> so<00:04:28.600> one<00:04:28.690> more<00:04:28.840> time

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
else stays the same so one more time

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:41.370 
else stays the same so one more time
