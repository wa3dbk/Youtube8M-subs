00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.580
 do you have any idea how long it has been since the club has been messing with it 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.410
 an active football 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.310
 Yes 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:14.629
 the after years of that it would be much more amazing great i have i have 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.570
 not played football I have peaked I have performed from muscles over visual 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.850
 best and what do you think are the critical success factors of a no fly 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.810
 sation 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.409
 start then is my passion 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.539
 and passion that are not is not just the fire and the enthusiasm but especially 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.710
 also what the most important values ​​of a person are in his mind and in his 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.700
 but also with companies 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.190
 From that you see that people and organizations must have convinced 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.500
 to achieve those values ​​and a third point rule that they then draw up 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.060
 ultimately reach their father's goals through that conviction 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.900
 what that for the rest is needed here seems logical to you a lot 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.220
 energy goes in because especially and successful people are actually day and day 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.510
 busy for the night it is almost a living thing 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.020
 that they are strategically busy not being devoured by the delusion of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.200
 just the day 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.130
 staking now for 100 in two years and we are five years ahead 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.710
 In addition, it appears that zeb 6 full organizations and people also in order to 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.550
 are bridge builders and now still a relationship network and also know the people 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.590
 to get impey in their environment with which you cannot achieve it together 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.460
 and the last one it will not surprise you are that is that successful 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 people and organizations have good communication 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.010
 what they strive for is also visible to everyone 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.450
 audible and especially football and that is from the top twenty 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.750
 has run out of seats 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.910
 in the protocol 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.190
 who of you wants later during the final 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.480
 of the Olympic Games the decisive penalty ball a possible step to 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.480
 to become 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.970
 a dozen times 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.830
 but the three I say 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.770
 four years I want to try 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.930
 and the rest of the left 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.569
 with those that are sure to be sitting at the table 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.510
 we called them goalkeeper Ronald Jansen when the cards were added 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.120
 and often also why the men have to strike for your stupid people's chances 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.739
 to get 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.569
 he mentioned three positions 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.709
 ok from now on 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.999
 and what qualities should a good coach have 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.729
 I think that it must have the mandatory interest in people 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.259
 because it was driving 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:26.469
 what moves people because what do you want as a coach that people want that 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:27.409
 to do 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.119
 what is needed within doing the money 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:32.829
 as a child i was twelve years old 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.949
 I dreamed that I could end up anywhere and anytime 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:38.459
 and when that worked twenty years later it worked 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.349
 as a kind of their children 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.480
 of wishes and the application of suicide
