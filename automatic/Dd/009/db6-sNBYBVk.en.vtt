00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
web pull lower the resolution but let's

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.260 
web pull lower the resolution but let's
just<00:01:13.610> focus<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:14.390> on<00:01:14.570> working<00:01:15.439> with<00:01:15.470> print<00:01:16.270> so

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270

just focus in on working with print so
we<00:01:17.390> have<00:01:17.560> 314<00:01:18.560> PPI<00:01:19.159> pixels<00:01:19.850> per<00:01:20.060> inch<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:20.960> are

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
we have 314 PPI pixels per inch we are

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.919 
we have 314 PPI pixels per inch we are
our<00:01:21.590> image<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.250> nine<00:01:22.460> by<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:23.390> little<00:01:23.659> bit<00:01:23.750> over

pixels<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:50.799> we<00:03:51.040> can<00:03:51.519> come<00:03:51.730> on<00:03:51.760> in<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.180> work

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
pixels so we can come on in and work

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.270 
pixels so we can come on in and work
with<00:03:52.540> these<00:03:52.780> two<00:03:53.019> different<00:03:53.410> colors<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.769> blue

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
with these two different colors of blue

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.020 
with these two different colors of blue
and<00:03:54.580> we<00:03:55.030> have<00:03:55.209> our<00:03:55.510> magentas<00:03:56.519> okay<00:03:57.519> we<00:03:57.670> see<00:03:57.850> we

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
and we have our magentas okay we see we

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.699 
and we have our magentas okay we see we
have<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> lot<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.690> in<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.140> mouth<00:03:59.320> in<00:03:59.620> the

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
have a lot of that in the mouth in the

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.460 
have a lot of that in the mouth in the
lip<00:03:59.920> area<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.549> there<00:04:01.450> we<00:04:01.660> have<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.140> here<00:04:02.350> is

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
lip area and there we have it so here is

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.770 
lip area and there we have it so here is
our<00:04:02.590> first<00:04:02.890> way<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.519> go<00:04:04.030> about<00:04:04.150> creating<00:04:04.299> a

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
our first way to go about creating a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.050 
our first way to go about creating a
black<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.230> white<00:04:05.350> image<00:04:05.620> let's<00:04:06.580> take<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.790> look

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
black and white image let's take a look

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.240 
black and white image let's take a look
at<00:04:07.269> another<00:04:07.750> way<00:04:08.049> again<00:04:08.830> I'm<00:04:08.950> going<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.130> come

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
at another way again I'm going to come

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.340 
at another way again I'm going to come
to<00:04:09.310> file<00:04:09.670> open<00:04:10.060> I'm<00:04:10.540> going<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.720> open<00:04:10.900> up<00:04:11.140> this

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
to file open I'm going to open up this

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.990 
to file open I'm going to open up this
image<00:04:11.799> one<00:04:12.100> more<00:04:12.310> time

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
image one more time

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.340 
image one more time
file<00:04:13.840> open<00:04:15.570> let's<00:04:16.570> choose<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.810> different<00:04:17.080> image

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
file open let's choose a different image

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.469 
file open let's choose a different image
why<00:04:17.620> not<00:04:17.799> let's<00:04:18.010> choose<00:04:18.280> this<00:04:18.549> coco-cola

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
why not let's choose this coco-cola

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.330 
why not let's choose this coco-cola
image<00:04:20.109> right<00:04:20.320> here<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.530> come<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.769> file<00:04:21.040> open

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
image right here I come to file open

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.520 
image right here I come to file open
there<00:04:22.210> we<00:04:22.330> have<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.600> now<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.930> want<00:04:23.229> to<00:04:23.290> take<00:04:23.500> a

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
there we have it now I want to take a

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.900 
there we have it now I want to take a
look<00:04:23.680> at<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.950> image<00:04:24.220> size<00:04:24.370> here<00:04:24.610> because

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
look at the image size here because

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.950 
look at the image size here because
you're<00:04:25.000> going<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.180> find<00:04:25.390> that<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.600> image<00:04:25.840> size

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
you're going to find that the image size

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.230 
you're going to find that the image size
here<00:04:26.169> is<00:04:26.260> much<00:04:26.500> smaller<00:04:26.860> this<00:04:27.100> is<00:04:27.280> 72<00:04:27.850> PPI

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
here is much smaller this is 72 PPI

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.340 
here is much smaller this is 72 PPI
pixels<00:04:28.900> per<00:04:29.080> inch

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
pixels per inch

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.350 
pixels per inch
this<00:04:30.070> is<00:04:30.280> one<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.550> ready<00:04:30.790> it's<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.210> low

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
this is one is ready it's a low

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.300 
this is one is ready it's a low
resolution<00:04:31.930> image<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.290> it's<00:04:32.380> ready<00:04:32.560> for<00:04:32.650> the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
resolution image and it's ready for the

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.290 
resolution image and it's ready for the
web<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:34.150> it's<00:04:34.300> much<00:04:34.600> less<00:04:34.840> pixels<00:04:35.380> but<00:04:35.680> I<00:04:36.300> could

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
web so it's much less pixels but I could

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.510 
web so it's much less pixels but I could
also<00:04:37.419> come<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.870> image<00:04:38.229> mode<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.979> I<00:04:39.130> could<00:04:39.340> say

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
also come to image mode and I could say

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.880 
also come to image mode and I could say
a<00:04:39.729> grayscale<00:04:40.419> now<00:04:41.110> what<00:04:41.380> it's<00:04:41.530> saying<00:04:41.710> here

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
a grayscale now what it's saying here

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.870 
a grayscale now what it's saying here
though

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
though

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.000 
though
is<00:04:42.940> discard<00:04:43.480> color<00:04:43.750> information<00:04:44.320> it's<00:04:44.740> from<00:04:44.920> a

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
is discard color information it's from a

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
discard all this color information

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.150 
discard all this color information
because<00:04:49.000> once<00:04:49.660> you<00:04:49.840> do<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.560> can't<00:04:50.800> get<00:04:51.010> it

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
because once you do you can't get it

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.710 
because once you do you can't get it
back<00:04:51.340> but<00:04:51.640> we're<00:04:51.820> just<00:04:51.850> gonna<00:04:52.090> think<00:04:52.360> hey<00:04:52.510> who

discard<00:04:55.630> now<00:04:56.020> it<00:04:56.320> is<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.500> grayscale<00:04:57.190> image<00:04:57.220> if<00:04:58.090> I

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
discard now it is a grayscale image if I

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.940 
discard now it is a grayscale image if I
was<00:04:58.600> to<00:04:58.750> compare<00:04:59.140> it<00:04:59.230> what's<00:04:59.380> why<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.530> mean<00:04:59.710> well

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
was to compare it what's why I mean well

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.070 
was to compare it what's why I mean well
here<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.400> can<00:05:00.790> still<00:05:01.030> come<00:05:01.300> back<00:05:01.480> and<00:05:01.540> get<00:05:01.900> my

there<00:05:32.410> we<00:05:32.560> have<00:05:32.740> it

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
there we have it

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.270 
there we have it
I<00:05:33.130> could<00:05:33.790> also<00:05:34.060> come<00:05:34.390> to<00:05:34.510> image<00:05:35.280> adjustments

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
I could also come to image adjustments

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.820 
I could also come to image adjustments
now<00:05:36.400> once<00:05:37.090> you<00:05:37.240> come<00:05:37.450> into<00:05:37.840> here<00:05:38.170> this<00:05:38.350> is<00:05:38.530> yet

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
now once you come into here this is yet

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.640 
now once you come into here this is yet
another<00:05:38.980> way<00:05:39.490> to<00:05:40.360> create<00:05:41.290> an<00:05:41.530> adjustment

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
another way to create an adjustment

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.030 
another way to create an adjustment
layer<00:05:42.190> but<00:05:42.940> all<00:05:43.180> of<00:05:43.510> your<00:05:43.690> colors<00:05:44.140> and<00:05:44.530> such

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
layer but all of your colors and such

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.660 
layer but all of your colors and such
will<00:05:45.400> be<00:05:45.700> here<00:05:46.890> so<00:05:47.890> we<00:05:47.980> come<00:05:48.160> to<00:05:48.310> image

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
will be here so we come to image

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.490 
will be here so we come to image
adjustments<00:05:49.510> let's<00:05:49.690> hit<00:05:49.870> black<00:05:50.140> and<00:05:50.350> white

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
adjustments let's hit black and white

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.430 
adjustments let's hit black and white
and<00:05:50.830> again<00:05:51.580> we<00:05:51.700> get<00:05:51.850> that<00:05:52.030> same<00:05:52.390> window<00:05:53.110> we<00:05:53.290> can

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
and again we get that same window we can

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:02.730 
and again we get that same window we can
change<00:05:53.710> things<00:05:54.040> around<00:06:01.230> I'm<00:06:02.230> gonna<00:06:02.410> do<00:06:02.710> I

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
change things around I'm gonna do I

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:11.820 
change things around I'm gonna do I
think<00:06:03.010> there's<00:06:03.340> going<00:06:03.490> to<00:06:03.550> be<00:06:07.650> hmm<00:06:08.650> oh<00:06:10.830> there

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
think there's going to be hmm oh there

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.320 
think there's going to be hmm oh there
we<00:06:11.890> got<00:06:12.040> been<00:06:12.220> darken<00:06:12.610> up<00:06:12.670> that<00:06:12.850> background

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
we got been darken up that background

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.920 
we got been darken up that background
I'm<00:06:13.510> gonna<00:06:13.630> hit<00:06:13.900> okay<00:06:15.300> now<00:06:16.300> when<00:06:16.600> we<00:06:16.690> do<00:06:16.900> that

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
I'm gonna hit okay now when we do that

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.300 
I'm gonna hit okay now when we do that
through<00:06:17.650> there<00:06:17.950> though<00:06:18.250> we<00:06:18.760> do<00:06:18.970> not<00:06:19.000> have

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
through there though we do not have

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.400 
through there though we do not have
debris<00:06:21.310> of<00:06:21.430> three<00:06:21.610> different<00:06:21.730> options<00:06:22.410> option

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
debris of three different options option

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.050 
debris of three different options option
one<00:06:23.620> doing<00:06:24.130> it<00:06:24.250> through<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.520> adjustment

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
one doing it through the adjustment

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.930 
one doing it through the adjustment
window<00:06:25.180> and<00:06:25.600> again<00:06:26.200> we<00:06:26.500> get<00:06:26.650> this<00:06:26.920> extra<00:06:27.430> layer

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
window and again we get this extra layer

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.180 
window and again we get this extra layer
so<00:06:28.660> we<00:06:28.690> can<00:06:28.930> continually<00:06:29.440> go<00:06:29.650> back<00:06:29.680> to<00:06:30.070> our

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
so we can continually go back to our

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.750 
so we can continually go back to our
color<00:06:30.460> image<00:06:30.910> option<00:06:31.900> two<00:06:32.110> we<00:06:33.070> come<00:06:33.250> to<00:06:33.370> image

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
color image option two we come to image

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.330 
color image option two we come to image
mode<00:06:34.060> grayscale<00:06:34.780> and<00:06:35.020> we<00:06:35.740> just<00:06:35.950> have<00:06:36.130> the

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
mode grayscale and we just have the

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.300 
mode grayscale and we just have the
image<00:06:36.670> there<00:06:36.990> option<00:06:37.990> three<00:06:38.350> we<00:06:38.770> come<00:06:39.040> to

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
image there option three we come to

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.540 
image there option three we come to
image<00:06:39.960> adjustments<00:06:40.960> black<00:06:41.770> and<00:06:42.010> white<00:06:42.160> we<00:06:42.370> get

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
image adjustments black and white we get

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.730 
image adjustments black and white we get
that<00:06:42.730> window<00:06:43.150> and<00:06:43.390> then<00:06:43.840> we<00:06:44.170> we<00:06:44.620> actually<00:06:46.740> can

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
that window and then we we actually can

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.370 
that window and then we we actually can
what<00:06:48.130> can<00:06:48.280> we<00:06:48.340> do<00:06:48.490> we<00:06:48.670> can<00:06:49.020> turn<00:06:50.020> it<00:06:50.140> into<00:06:50.260> a

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
what can we do we can turn it into a

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.659 
what can we do we can turn it into a
black-white<00:06:50.740> image<00:06:51.010> but<00:06:51.220> what's<00:06:51.460> great<00:06:51.640> about

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
black-white image but what's great about

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.110 
black-white image but what's great about
going<00:06:52.330> that<00:06:52.630> way<00:06:52.900> is<00:06:53.229> we<00:06:53.979> still<00:06:54.400> can<00:06:54.729> come<00:06:54.940> on

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
going that way is we still can come on

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.640 
going that way is we still can come on
in<00:06:55.300> and

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
in and

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.219 
in and
work<00:06:56.800> with<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.400> distribution<00:06:58.090> of<00:06:58.240> value<00:06:58.780> on

00:06:59.219 --> 00:06:59.229 
work with the distribution of value on

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:04.350 
work with the distribution of value on
the<00:07:00.100> different<00:07:00.550> color<00:07:01.090> channels<00:07:01.830> so<00:07:02.830> I'll<00:07:03.699> end

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
the different color channels so I'll end

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.180 
the different color channels so I'll end
there<00:07:04.780> those<00:07:05.199> are<00:07:05.410> our<00:07:05.530> three<00:07:05.560> different<00:07:05.889> ways

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
there those are our three different ways

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.400 
there those are our three different ways
to<00:07:06.460> go<00:07:06.610> about<00:07:06.639> converting<00:07:07.419> a<00:07:07.750> black<00:07:08.080> and<00:07:08.320> white

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
to go about converting a black and white

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.150 
to go about converting a black and white
image<00:07:08.650> into<00:07:09.340> a<00:07:09.370> color<00:07:09.850> image
