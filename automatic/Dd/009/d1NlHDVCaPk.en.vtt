we've seen so far

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.559 
we've seen so far
and<00:03:18.379> while<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.489> change<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.939> made<00:03:20.150> won't<00:03:20.419> have

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
and while the change is made won't have

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.270 
and while the change is made won't have
a<00:03:20.599> dramatic<00:03:21.049> effect<00:03:21.319> on<00:03:21.439> the<00:03:21.500> game<00:03:21.739> we<00:03:22.099> still

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
a dramatic effect on the game we still

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.470 
a dramatic effect on the game we still
think<00:03:22.519> it's<00:03:22.639> a<00:03:22.700> great<00:03:22.909> way<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.090> improve

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
think it's a great way to improve

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.479 
think it's a great way to improve
immersion<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.200> it'll<00:03:24.709> only<00:03:24.799> take<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:25.099> second

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
immersion and it'll only take a second

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.009 
immersion and it'll only take a second
to<00:03:25.549> install<00:03:25.879> so<00:03:26.120> it's<00:03:26.269> definitely<00:03:26.629> worth<00:03:26.780> it

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
to install so it's definitely worth it

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.500 
to install so it's definitely worth it
