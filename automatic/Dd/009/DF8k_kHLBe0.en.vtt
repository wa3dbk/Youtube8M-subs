00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.869 

in<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:01.290> lesson<00:00:01.530> we'll<00:00:02.070> talk<00:00:02.340> about<00:00:02.520> real

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
in this lesson we'll talk about real

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.789 
in this lesson we'll talk about real
flows<00:00:03.149> seen<00:00:03.540> tree<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.440> it<00:00:04.589> can<00:00:04.620> be<00:00:04.770> used

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
flows seen tree and how it can be used

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.889 
flows seen tree and how it can be used
to<00:00:05.069> make<00:00:05.220> demons<00:00:05.580> affect<00:00:05.940> multiple<00:00:06.210> particle

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
to make demons affect multiple particle

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.720 
to make demons affect multiple particle
systems<00:00:07.290> as<00:00:07.529> well<00:00:07.890> as<00:00:08.099> making<00:00:08.400> different

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
systems as well as making different

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.330 
systems as well as making different
particles<00:00:09.330> interact<00:00:09.900> with<00:00:10.080> each<00:00:10.110> other<00:00:10.380> so

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
particles interact with each other so

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.799 
particles interact with each other so
let's<00:00:11.519> take<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.730> look<00:00:11.940> at<00:00:12.059> just<00:00:12.210> an<00:00:12.330> empty<00:00:12.450> scene

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
let's take a look at just an empty scene

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.049 
let's take a look at just an empty scene
and<00:00:13.200> I'm<00:00:13.980> going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.160> go<00:00:14.219> ahead<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.549> just<00:00:14.820> start

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
and I'm going to go ahead and just start

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.570 
and I'm going to go ahead and just start
off<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> circle<00:00:15.900> emitter<00:00:16.279> and<00:00:17.279> i'll<00:00:17.460> go

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
off with a circle emitter and i'll go

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.750 
off with a circle emitter and i'll go
ahead<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.910> rotate<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.960> up<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.760> whenever

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
ahead and rotate this up and whenever

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.599 
ahead and rotate this up and whenever
you<00:00:21.029> only<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.990> emitter<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.740> your<00:00:23.369> scene

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you only have one emitter in your scene

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
you only have one emitter in your scene
whenever<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.750> add<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> demon<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.529> will

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
whenever you add a demon it will

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.089 
whenever you add a demon it will
automatically<00:00:26.519> effect<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:28.080> emitter<00:00:28.380> so

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
automatically effect that one emitter so

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
automatically effect that one emitter so
by<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:29.820> adding<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> gravity<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.199> will<00:00:31.349> go

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
by just adding the gravity it will go

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.310 
by just adding the gravity it will go
ahead<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.800> fact<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.360> emitter

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
ahead and a fact just this one emitter

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.470 
ahead and a fact just this one emitter
but<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:36.149> several

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
but what if I actually have several

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.200 
but what if I actually have several
emitters<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.680> scene<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.820> let<00:00:38.969> me<00:00:39.059> go<00:00:39.180> ahead

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
emitters in my scene so let me go ahead

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.610 
emitters in my scene so let me go ahead
and<00:00:39.420> add<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.989> square<00:00:40.559> emitter<00:00:42.320> go<00:00:43.320> ahead<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and add a square emitter go ahead and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.080 
and add a square emitter go ahead and
select<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.850> I'll<00:00:45.539> move<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> over<00:00:47.090> okay

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
select this and I'll move this over okay

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.580 
select this and I'll move this over okay
and<00:00:48.300> maybe<00:00:48.480> rotate<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.809> also<00:00:51.809> let<00:00:52.379> me<00:00:52.410> go

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and maybe rotate this and also let me go

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.799 
and maybe rotate this and also let me go
ahead<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.829> add<00:00:53.070> another<00:00:53.789> bitter<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> just

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
ahead and add another bitter and just

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.540 
ahead and add another bitter and just
for<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.379> little<00:00:55.739> bit<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> change<00:00:56.250> i'll<00:00:56.460> go

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
for a little bit of a change i'll go

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.470 
for a little bit of a change i'll go
ahead<00:00:56.579> make<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> triangle<00:00:57.440> emitter<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> i'm

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
ahead make a triangle emitter so i'm

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
ahead make a triangle emitter so i'm
going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> go<00:01:00.719> ahead<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.379> rotate<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.309> up

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
going to go ahead and rotate this up

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.020 
going to go ahead and rotate this up
just<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:03.000> little<00:01:03.180> bit<00:01:03.270> differently<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:05.030> then

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
just a little bit differently and then

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.770 
just a little bit differently and then
move<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:06.540> place<00:01:10.130> okay<00:01:11.130> pull<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.490> down

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
move this into place okay pull this down

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.899 
move this into place okay pull this down
now<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.140> i<00:01:13.740> were<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.369> ahead<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.729> simulate

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
now if i were to go ahead and simulate

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.620 
now if i were to go ahead and simulate
this<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.610> my<00:01:17.700> gravity<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> only

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
this you can see that my gravity is only

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.520 
this you can see that my gravity is only
affecting<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:21.299> circle<00:01:21.960> emitter<00:01:22.229> it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
affecting this one circle emitter it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.200 
affecting this one circle emitter it's
not<00:01:22.799> affecting<00:01:23.369> these<00:01:23.490> other<00:01:23.729> two<00:01:23.970> emitters

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
not affecting these other two emitters

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.440 
not affecting these other two emitters
at<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:25.070> okay<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.130> how<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.790> actually<00:01:27.000> do

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
at all okay so how can I actually do

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.469 
at all okay so how can I actually do
this<00:01:27.630> well<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.380> method<00:01:28.770> would<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:30.329> go

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
this well one method would be to just go

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.039 
this well one method would be to just go
ahead<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.750> add<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.759> gravity<00:01:32.759> demons<00:01:33.119> which

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
ahead and add more gravity demons which

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.600 
ahead and add more gravity demons which
probably<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.310> slow<00:01:35.460> down

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
probably is actually going to slow down

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.890 
probably is actually going to slow down
your<00:01:35.790> scene<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> little<00:01:36.270> bit<00:01:36.479> more<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
your scene a little bit more so I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.770 
your scene a little bit more so I
probably<00:01:37.170> wouldn't<00:01:37.590> recommend<00:01:37.979> doing<00:01:38.040> that

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
probably wouldn't recommend doing that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.440 
probably wouldn't recommend doing that
the<00:01:39.780> most<00:01:39.990> efficient<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.520> comes<00:01:41.520> from<00:01:41.880> using

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the most efficient way comes from using

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.260 
the most efficient way comes from using
the<00:01:42.540> scene<00:01:42.780> tree<00:01:43.130> okay<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.880> scene<00:01:45.090> tree

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the scene tree okay and the scene tree

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.940 
the scene tree okay and the scene tree
can<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.479> accessed<00:01:45.720> by<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.350> tools<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
can be accessed by going to tools and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.370 
can be accessed by going to tools and
you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.790> find<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.119> scene<00:01:48.329> tree<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.049> want<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
you can find a scene tree if you want to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.960 
you can find a scene tree if you want to
use<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> shortcut<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> shortcuts<00:01:50.579> for<00:01:50.670> this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
use the shortcut the shortcuts for this

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.160 
use the shortcut the shortcuts for this
is<00:01:51.180> f11<00:01:52.939> okay<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.210> open<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.689> same<00:01:54.869> tree

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
is f11 okay so you open up the same tree

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.950 
is f11 okay so you open up the same tree
and<00:01:55.759> looking<00:01:56.759> at<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.479> doesn't

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and looking at this it really doesn't

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
and looking at this it really doesn't
look<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.100> anything<00:01:59.340> special<00:01:59.670> here

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
look like you have anything special here

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.450 
look like you have anything special here
okay<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.020> how<00:02:01.259> does<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.469> scene<00:02:01.890> tree<00:02:02.189> work

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
okay so how does this scene tree work

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.170 
okay so how does this scene tree work
what<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.219> on<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.549> side<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.820> have

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
what you have is on this side you have

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.080 
what you have is on this side you have
your<00:02:07.049> objects<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.759> what

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
your objects and then you can see what

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.059 
your objects and then you can see what
relation<00:02:09.629> these<00:02:10.050> objects<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.950> each

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
relation these objects have to each

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.190 
relation these objects have to each
other<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:12.000> see<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.209> now<00:02:12.480> really<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
other you can see right now really the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.000 
other you can see right now really the
only<00:02:13.319> relation

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
only relation

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.850 
only relation
you<00:02:14.099> have<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:15.420> gravity<00:02:15.900> demon<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.709> your

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
you have is this gravity demon to your

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.429 
you have is this gravity demon to your
circle<00:02:17.220> emitter<00:02:17.599> okay<00:02:18.599> on<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.110> other<00:02:19.319> side

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
circle emitter okay on this other side

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.679 
circle emitter okay on this other side
the<00:02:19.829> right<00:02:20.010> hand<00:02:20.250> side<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:20.909> all<00:02:21.269> the

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
the right hand side you have all the

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.380 
the right hand side you have all the
objects<00:02:22.079> in<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.200> scene<00:02:22.549> so<00:02:23.549> let's<00:02:24.000> say<00:02:24.150> for

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
objects in your scene so let's say for

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.020 
objects in your scene so let's say for
example<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.959> want<00:02:25.230> my<00:02:25.379> gravity<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.610> affect

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
example that I want my gravity to affect

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.809 
example that I want my gravity to affect
this<00:02:27.480> square<00:02:28.200> emitter<00:02:28.500> hey<00:02:29.159> this<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.489> actually

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
this square emitter hey this is actually

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.819 
this square emitter hey this is actually
really<00:02:30.060> simple<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.720> just<00:02:31.530> take<00:02:31.680> your

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
really simple to do just take your

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.430 
really simple to do just take your
gravity<00:02:32.390> demon<00:02:33.390> from<00:02:33.569> your<00:02:33.750> right<00:02:33.930> hand<00:02:34.200> side

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
gravity demon from your right hand side

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.550 
gravity demon from your right hand side
and<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:35.489> simply<00:02:36.000> drag<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.420> over<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:37.260> square

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and just simply drag it over to square

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.500 
and just simply drag it over to square
one<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.010> now<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:38.879> can<00:02:39.120> see<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.269> this

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
one and now you can see that this

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.190 
one and now you can see that this
gravity<00:02:39.989> has<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.379> relationship<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.190> square<00:02:41.700> one

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
gravity has a relationship to square one

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.640 
gravity has a relationship to square one
okay<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:43.829> if<00:02:44.099> i<00:02:44.459> hit<00:02:44.609> a<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.909> play<00:02:45.299> this<00:02:45.650> now

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
okay so now if i hit a to play this now

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.800 
okay so now if i hit a to play this now
you<00:02:47.069> can<00:02:47.220> see<00:02:47.459> how<00:02:47.609> the<00:02:47.670> gravity<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.209> affecting

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
you can see how the gravity is affecting

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.440 
you can see how the gravity is affecting
this<00:02:49.500> square<00:02:50.010> emitter<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:51.120> it's<00:02:51.269> not

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
this square emitter but it's not

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.390 
this square emitter but it's not
affecting<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.109> triangle<00:02:52.650> limiter<00:02:52.889> because

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
affecting this triangle limiter because

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.509 
affecting this triangle limiter because
we<00:02:53.519> haven't<00:02:53.790> set<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.980> i'm<00:02:56.280> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.459> go

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
we haven't set it to so i'm going to go

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.129 
we haven't set it to so i'm going to go
ahead<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:57.500> reset<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.739> i<00:02:59.780> want<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.840> show<00:03:01.109> you

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
ahead and reset this i want to show you

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.080 
ahead and reset this i want to show you
just<00:03:01.290> one<00:03:01.739> other<00:03:02.040> quick<00:03:02.549> little<00:03:02.819> thing<00:03:02.970> that

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
just one other quick little thing that

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.309 
just one other quick little thing that
we<00:03:03.180> can<00:03:03.329> do<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:05.180> scene<00:03:06.180> tree<00:03:06.480> before<00:03:07.019> we

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
we can do with the scene tree before we

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.280 
we can do with the scene tree before we
finish<00:03:07.590> up<00:03:07.739> this<00:03:07.889> lesson<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:09.750> if<00:03:10.109> i

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
finish up this lesson and that is if i

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.890 
finish up this lesson and that is if i
go<00:03:10.440> ahead<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.799> play<00:03:11.040> through<00:03:11.069> this<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:12.720> can

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
go ahead and play through this you can

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.020 
go ahead and play through this you can
see<00:03:13.109> that<00:03:13.319> for<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.159> triangle<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.819> this

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
see that for the triangle and this

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.750 
see that for the triangle and this
square<00:03:15.480> these<00:03:16.319> particles<00:03:16.859> are<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.190> passing

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
square these particles are just passing

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.490 
square these particles are just passing
right<00:03:18.150> through<00:03:18.209> each<00:03:18.599> other<00:03:18.810> they're<00:03:19.349> not

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
right through each other they're not

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.140 
right through each other they're not
interacting<00:03:19.829> with<00:03:20.280> each<00:03:20.310> other<00:03:20.549> at<00:03:20.819> all<00:03:20.910> which

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
interacting with each other at all which

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.409 
interacting with each other at all which
really<00:03:21.480> isn't<00:03:22.220> natural<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:24.060> I'm<00:03:24.120> going<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.329> go

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
really isn't natural so I'm going to go

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.229 
really isn't natural so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.720> reset<00:03:25.169> this<00:03:25.849> and<00:03:26.849> I'll<00:03:27.000> go<00:03:27.120> ahead

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
ahead and reset this and I'll go ahead

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.270 
ahead and reset this and I'll go ahead
and<00:03:27.359> just<00:03:27.540> remove<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.019> circle<00:03:28.379> emitter<00:03:28.620> from

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
and just remove this circle emitter from

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.559 
and just remove this circle emitter from
our<00:03:29.400> scene<00:03:29.870> ok<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:30.930> we<00:03:31.169> played<00:03:31.379> us<00:03:31.530> through<00:03:31.709> and

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
our scene ok so we played us through and

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.789 
our scene ok so we played us through and
they<00:03:33.569> just<00:03:33.780> pass<00:03:33.989> right<00:03:34.019> through<00:03:34.290> each<00:03:34.590> other

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
they just pass right through each other

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.849 
they just pass right through each other
no<00:03:35.099> interaction<00:03:35.669> whatsoever<00:03:36.470> again<00:03:37.470> we<00:03:37.680> can

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
no interaction whatsoever again we can

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.069 
no interaction whatsoever again we can
use<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.220> scene<00:03:38.519> tree<00:03:38.879> to<00:03:39.599> actually<00:03:39.930> generate

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
use this scene tree to actually generate

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.199 
use this scene tree to actually generate
a<00:03:40.319> relation<00:03:40.829> between<00:03:41.250> these<00:03:41.489> two<00:03:41.730> particle

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
a relation between these two particle

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.879 
a relation between these two particle
systems<00:03:42.599> so<00:03:42.989> let's<00:03:43.199> go<00:03:43.319> ahead<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.560> open<00:03:43.680> up

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
systems so let's go ahead and open up

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.000 
systems so let's go ahead and open up
the<00:03:44.040> scene<00:03:44.250> tree<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:46.530> like<00:03:46.709> we<00:03:46.889> were

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the scene tree and just like we were

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.589 
the scene tree and just like we were
able<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.310> take<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.639> gravity<00:03:48.060> from<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.389> side

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
able to take the gravity from this side

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.379 
able to take the gravity from this side
and<00:03:48.840> connect<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.919> square<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:51.180> could

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
and connect it to the square we could

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.050 
and connect it to the square we could
also<00:03:51.569> take<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.829> square<00:03:53.069> from<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.609> side<00:03:53.819> and

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
also take the square from this side and

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.020 
also take the square from this side and
let's<00:03:54.959> actually<00:03:55.169> connect<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.280> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
let's actually connect this to the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.319 
let's actually connect this to the
triangle<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:59.430> now<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.609> can<00:03:59.849> see<00:04:00.030> there<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.299> a

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
triangle so now you can see there is a

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.580 
triangle so now you can see there is a
relation<00:04:01.129> between<00:04:02.129> these<00:04:02.370> two<00:04:03.049> so<00:04:04.049> now<00:04:04.079> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
relation between these two so now the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.069 
relation between these two so now the
particles<00:04:05.069> from<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.430> triangle<00:04:06.000> should<00:04:06.840> be

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
particles from this triangle should be

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.309 
particles from this triangle should be
affected<00:04:07.919> by<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:08.099> square<00:04:08.989> so<00:04:09.989> now<00:04:10.139> when

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
affected by this square so now when

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.129 
affected by this square so now when
these<00:04:10.440> two<00:04:10.680> collide<00:04:11.569> now<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:12.629> can<00:04:12.900> see<00:04:13.109> how

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
these two collide now you can see how

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.599 
these two collide now you can see how
these<00:04:13.440> are<00:04:13.799> actually<00:04:14.400> affecting<00:04:15.239> each<00:04:15.359> other

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
these are actually affecting each other

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.879 
these are actually affecting each other
so<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.909> score<00:04:18.150> emitter<00:04:18.449> is<00:04:18.659> now<00:04:19.199> disrupting

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
so the score emitter is now disrupting

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.430 
so the score emitter is now disrupting
the<00:04:19.979> particles<00:04:20.400> from<00:04:20.579> this<00:04:20.789> triangle<00:04:21.440> but

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
the particles from this triangle but

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.529 
the particles from this triangle but
because<00:04:23.159> we<00:04:23.310> never<00:04:23.460> set<00:04:23.760> up<00:04:23.789> in<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.090> relation

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
because we never set up in the relation

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.690 
because we never set up in the relation
tree<00:04:24.810> or<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.349> scene<00:04:25.530> tree

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
tree or in the scene tree

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.910 
tree or in the scene tree
the<00:04:27.030> particles<00:04:27.930> from<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.080> square<00:04:28.470> are<00:04:28.680> not

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
the particles from the square are not

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.590 
the particles from the square are not
necessarily<00:04:29.580> being<00:04:29.820> affected<00:04:30.390> by<00:04:30.420> this

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
necessarily being affected by this

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.200 
necessarily being affected by this
triangle<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:32.160> you<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.400> see<00:04:32.550> these<00:04:32.700> particles

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
triangle so you can see these particles

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.970 
triangle so you can see these particles
from<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.420> square<00:04:33.780> really<00:04:34.140> just<00:04:34.380> passing

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
from the square really just passing

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.730 
from the square really just passing
right<00:04:35.100> through<00:04:35.720> so<00:04:36.720> let<00:04:37.050> me<00:04:37.110> go<00:04:37.230> ahead<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.560> set

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
right through so let me go ahead and set

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.950 
right through so let me go ahead and set
this<00:04:37.770> up<00:04:38.100> real<00:04:38.340> quick<00:04:38.550> let's<00:04:39.480> go<00:04:39.630> ahead<00:04:39.840> and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
this up real quick let's go ahead and

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.650 
this up real quick let's go ahead and
take<00:04:40.110> this<00:04:40.290> triangle<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.450> let's<00:04:42.450> also

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
take this triangle and let's also

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.960 
take this triangle and let's also
connect<00:04:43.230> it<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.560> square<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.700> that<00:04:44.730> way

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
connect it to the square so that way

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.240 
connect it to the square so that way
these<00:04:45.150> two<00:04:45.390> basically<00:04:45.840> are<00:04:46.230> now<00:04:46.560> interacting

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
these two basically are now interacting

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.430 
these two basically are now interacting
with<00:04:47.400> each<00:04:47.430> other<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:47.970> let's<00:04:48.900> take<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.140> look<00:04:49.350> at

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
with each other and let's take a look at

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.390 
with each other and let's take a look at
the<00:04:49.500> difference<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:51.510> if<00:04:51.600> I<00:04:51.690> play<00:04:51.900> this<00:04:52.050> through

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
the difference so if I play this through

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.790 
the difference so if I play this through
now<00:04:53.400> these<00:04:53.670> really<00:04:54.180> crash<00:04:54.480> together<00:04:54.750> in<00:04:55.590> a

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
now these really crash together in a

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.220 
now these really crash together in a
realistic<00:04:56.280> way<00:04:56.520> so<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.450> is<00:04:57.600> how<00:04:57.720> we<00:04:57.780> can<00:04:58.050> use

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
realistic way so this is how we can use

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.160 
realistic way so this is how we can use
the<00:04:58.410> scene<00:04:58.680> tree<00:04:59.040> to<00:05:00.000> really<00:05:00.660> start<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:01.050> add

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
the scene tree to really start to add

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.680 
the scene tree to really start to add
interactivity<00:05:02.040> to<00:05:02.400> our<00:05:03.000> different<00:05:03.330> particle

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
interactivity to our different particle

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.080 
interactivity to our different particle
systems<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.320> our<00:05:04.410> different<00:05:04.740> demons<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.400> also

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
systems to our different demons and also

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.620 
systems to our different demons and also
to<00:05:06.180> different<00:05:06.740> actual<00:05:07.740> pieces<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.250> geometry

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
to different actual pieces of geometry

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.410 
to different actual pieces of geometry
that<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:09.720> have<00:05:09.930> within<00:05:10.140> your<00:05:10.350> scene<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:11.420> this

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
that you have within your scene and this

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.990 
that you have within your scene and this
is<00:05:12.570> another<00:05:12.990> area<00:05:13.110> where<00:05:13.850> some<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:14.880> these

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
is another area where some of these

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.820 
is another area where some of these
different<00:05:15.240> particle<00:05:15.810> attributes<00:05:16.290> can<00:05:16.530> really

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
different particle attributes can really

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.820 
different particle attributes can really
come<00:05:16.980> in<00:05:17.100> handy<00:05:17.450> so<00:05:18.450> for<00:05:19.260> something<00:05:19.680> like<00:05:19.770> this

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
come in handy so for something like this

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.890 
come in handy so for something like this
square<00:05:20.310> emitter<00:05:20.580> if<00:05:21.210> we<00:05:21.360> were<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.570> take<00:05:21.780> the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
square emitter if we were to take the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.830 
square emitter if we were to take the
density<00:05:22.350> of<00:05:22.790> this<00:05:23.790> particle<00:05:24.090> down<00:05:24.480> quite<00:05:24.810> a

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
density of this particle down quite a

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.130 
density of this particle down quite a
ways<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.940> let's<00:05:26.940> take<00:05:27.210> this<00:05:27.450> sert<00:05:27.780> this<00:05:28.110> a

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
ways and let's take this sert this a

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.230 
ways and let's take this sert this a
triangle<00:05:29.040> I'll<00:05:29.640> go<00:05:29.760> ahead<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:29.970> leave<00:05:30.090> the

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
triangle I'll go ahead and leave the

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.560 
triangle I'll go ahead and leave the
density<00:05:30.630> out<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.750> thousand<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:32.360> i'll<00:05:33.360> go<00:05:33.540> ahead

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
density out a thousand and i'll go ahead

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.850 
density out a thousand and i'll go ahead
and<00:05:33.810> increase<00:05:34.230> this<00:05:34.560> speed<00:05:35.210> like<00:05:36.210> quite<00:05:36.450> a<00:05:36.480> bit

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
and increase this speed like quite a bit

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.370 
and increase this speed like quite a bit
maybe<00:05:37.860> not<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:38.070> much<00:05:38.430> maybe<00:05:38.730> six<00:05:39.230> so<00:05:40.230> that

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
maybe not that much maybe six so that

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.100 
maybe not that much maybe six so that
way<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.830> speed<00:05:41.360> that<00:05:42.360> these<00:05:42.570> particles<00:05:42.990> are

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
way the speed that these particles are

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.930 
way the speed that these particles are
moving<00:05:43.230> should<00:05:43.710> actually<00:05:44.010> disrupt<00:05:44.610> these

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
moving should actually disrupt these

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.440 
moving should actually disrupt these
particles<00:05:45.510> quite<00:05:45.780> a<00:05:45.810> bit<00:05:46.020> more<00:05:47.210> so<00:05:48.210> you've<00:05:48.420> got

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
particles quite a bit more so you've got

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.040 
particles quite a bit more so you've got
this<00:05:48.750> steady<00:05:49.050> stream<00:05:49.380> of<00:05:49.410> particles<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:51.050> you

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
this steady stream of particles and you

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.600 
this steady stream of particles and you
can<00:05:52.200> see<00:05:52.380> now<00:05:52.530> how<00:05:52.710> these<00:05:52.890> are<00:05:53.040> affecting<00:05:53.490> each

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
can see now how these are affecting each

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.950 
can see now how these are affecting each
other<00:05:55.790> so<00:05:56.790> i'll<00:05:57.000> go<00:05:57.120> ahead<00:05:57.150> and<00:05:57.360> simulate<00:05:57.600> this

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
other so i'll go ahead and simulate this

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.320 
other so i'll go ahead and simulate this
through<00:05:58.200> for<00:05:58.380> just<00:05:58.530> a<00:05:58.620> second<00:05:59.120> and<00:06:00.120> you<00:06:00.210> can

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
through for just a second and you can

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.120 
through for just a second and you can
see<00:06:00.480> because<00:06:00.630> of<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:00.960> heavy<00:06:01.140> speed<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:01.830> the

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
see because of the heavy speed and the

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.700 
see because of the heavy speed and the
heavier<00:06:02.430> weight<00:06:02.790> of<00:06:03.170> these<00:06:04.170> triangle

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
heavier weight of these triangle

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.190 
heavier weight of these triangle
particles<00:06:05.190> they're<00:06:06.180> pretty<00:06:06.840> much<00:06:06.870> just

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
particles they're pretty much just

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.060 
particles they're pretty much just
blowing<00:06:08.160> right<00:06:08.370> through<00:06:08.400> these<00:06:08.910> lighter

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
blowing right through these lighter

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.730 
blowing right through these lighter
slower<00:06:11.070> moving<00:06:11.400> particles<00:06:11.970> so<00:06:12.780> again<00:06:13.410> this<00:06:13.560> is

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
slower moving particles so again this is

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.050 
slower moving particles so again this is
how<00:06:13.860> you<00:06:13.920> can<00:06:14.130> start<00:06:14.370> to<00:06:14.460> use<00:06:14.550> some<00:06:14.880> of<00:06:14.970> these

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
how you can start to use some of these

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.210 
how you can start to use some of these
different<00:06:15.330> particle<00:06:15.840> attributes<00:06:16.320> to<00:06:17.040> get

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
different particle attributes to get

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.910 
different particle attributes to get
completely<00:06:17.790> different<00:06:18.920> interactions

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
completely different interactions

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.130 
completely different interactions
between<00:06:20.130> your<00:06:20.490> multiple<00:06:20.880> particle<00:06:21.780> systems

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
between your multiple particle systems

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.470 
between your multiple particle systems
so<00:06:23.130> in<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:23.580> next<00:06:23.700> lesson<00:06:23.970> we'll<00:06:24.270> start

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
so in the next lesson we'll start

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.700 
so in the next lesson we'll start
looking<00:06:24.750> at<00:06:24.900> some<00:06:24.930> more<00:06:25.290> advanced

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
looking at some more advanced

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.940 
looking at some more advanced
applications<00:06:26.340> for<00:06:27.210> some<00:06:28.050> of<00:06:28.140> these<00:06:28.230> multiple

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
applications for some of these multiple

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.630 
applications for some of these multiple
tools<00:06:29.160> that<00:06:29.670> you<00:06:29.760> have<00:06:29.910> within<00:06:30.090> realflow
