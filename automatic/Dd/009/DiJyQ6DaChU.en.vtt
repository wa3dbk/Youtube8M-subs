00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.170 

this<00:01:29.580> is<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.940> pretty<00:01:30.210> strong<00:01:30.509> branch<00:01:32.000> this<00:01:33.000> is

through mm I don't know Adrienne it
looks<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:38.970> natural<00:01:39.210> break<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.930> me<00:01:41.119> it's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
looks like a natural break to me it's

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.550
