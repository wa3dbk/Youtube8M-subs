over<00:02:52.920> his<00:02:53.130> arms<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.490> wear<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.910> backpack

over his arms to wear it like a backpack
and<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:55.500> has<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> little<00:02:55.890> clip<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:57.660> can

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and it has a little clip that you can

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.720

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
fold up and fold down so it doesn't

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.690

stick<00:03:00.240> into<00:03:00.390> his<00:03:00.540> back<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.310> clips<00:03:02.520> onto

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
stick into his back but it clips onto

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.700 
stick into his back but it clips onto
his<00:03:02.910> wrists<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.390> he<00:03:04.020> can<00:03:04.850> hold<00:03:05.850> onto<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.330> just

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
his wrists and he can hold onto it just

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.100 
his wrists and he can hold onto it just
like<00:03:07.710> that

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
like that

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.190 
like that
as<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.320> articulation<00:03:11.750> there's<00:03:12.750> quite<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:12.990> bit

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
as for articulation there's quite a bit

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.200 
as for articulation there's quite a bit
at<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.590> foot<00:03:14.030> pulls<00:03:15.030> up<00:03:15.210> and<00:03:15.510> down<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.200> then

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
at the foot pulls up and down and then

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.580 
at the foot pulls up and down and then
where<00:03:18.210> the<00:03:18.390> boot<00:03:18.600> meets<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.050> leg<00:03:19.230> there's<00:03:19.530> a

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
where the boot meets the leg there's a

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.700 
where the boot meets the leg there's a
joint<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.160> they<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.520> turn<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:22.020> knees<00:03:22.500> are

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
joint and they can turn the knees are

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.980 
joint and they can turn the knees are
double-jointed<00:03:23.450> they've<00:03:24.450> been<00:03:24.600> back<00:03:24.810> pretty

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
double-jointed they've been back pretty

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.580 
double-jointed they've been back pretty
far<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:26.010> what<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.160> don't<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.590> you

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
far but what I don't like is that you

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.200 
far but what I don't like is that you
get<00:03:28.740> that<00:03:28.950> weird<00:03:29.190> awkward<00:03:29.690> bend<00:03:30.690> forward<00:03:31.050> me

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
get that weird awkward bend forward me

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.470 
get that weird awkward bend forward me
it<00:03:33.210> should<00:03:33.810> not<00:03:33.960> happen<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:35.430> legs<00:03:35.640> at<00:03:36.360> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
it should not happen the legs at the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.470 
it should not happen the legs at the
hips<00:03:36.660> they're<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:37.800> ball<00:03:37.980> joints<00:03:38.480> they've

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
hips they're just on ball joints they've

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.890 
hips they're just on ball joints they've
been<00:03:39.750> out<00:03:39.960> a<00:03:40.580> little<00:03:41.580> bit<00:03:41.730> can<00:03:42.390> go<00:03:42.540> can't

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
been out a little bit can go can't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.230 
been out a little bit can go can't
really<00:03:43.080> go<00:03:43.200> back<00:03:43.470> much<00:03:43.710> some<00:03:44.580> reason<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.940> I

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
really go back much some reason the I

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.530 
really go back much some reason the I
guess<00:03:45.750> his<00:03:46.170> butt<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.800> way<00:03:47.030> but<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> does

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
guess his butt is in the way but a does

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.320 
guess his butt is in the way but a does
come<00:03:48.720> forward<00:03:49.050> like<00:03:49.200> all<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.500> way<00:03:50.330> straight

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
come forward like all the way straight

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.700 
come forward like all the way straight
up<00:03:51.920> like<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.870> he<00:03:54.870> actually<00:03:55.170> has<00:03:55.260> two<00:03:55.470> points

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
up like that he actually has two points

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.460 
up like that he actually has two points
of<00:03:55.770> articulation<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:57.570> it's<00:03:57.780> torso<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.410> I

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
of articulation and it's torso and I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.710 
of articulation and it's torso and I
know<00:03:58.530> some<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.160> them<00:03:59.280> some<00:03:59.880> of<00:03:59.970> these<00:04:00.060> figures

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
know some of them some of these figures

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.540 
know some of them some of these figures
in<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:00.960> line<00:04:01.170> do<00:04:01.380> not<00:04:01.410> they<00:04:01.860> only<00:04:02.010> have<00:04:02.220> one

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
in this line do not they only have one

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.020 
in this line do not they only have one
point<00:04:03.530> so<00:04:04.530> he<00:04:04.680> can<00:04:04.860> 360<00:04:05.490> at<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.390> waist<00:04:06.600> and

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
point so he can 360 at the waist and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.070 
point so he can 360 at the waist and
move<00:04:09.030> forward<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:10.370> back<00:04:11.600> right<00:04:12.600> there<00:04:12.810> and

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
move forward and back right there and

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.580 
move forward and back right there and
360<00:04:13.740> right<00:04:13.890> there<00:04:14.100> also<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:16.260> shoulder

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
360 right there also and the shoulder

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.960 
360 right there also and the shoulder
can<00:04:16.770> 360<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:18.000> bend<00:04:18.690> up<00:04:18.870> like<00:04:19.830> that<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.400> can't

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
can 360 and bend up like that I can't

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.570 
can 360 and bend up like that I can't
really<00:04:21.060> go<00:04:21.209> much<00:04:21.390> higher<00:04:21.420> than<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:22.580> but

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
really go much higher than that but

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.130 
really go much higher than that but
there's<00:04:23.730> another<00:04:23.910> joint<00:04:24.150> right<00:04:24.690> below<00:04:24.990> the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
there's another joint right below the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.460 
there's another joint right below the
shoulder<00:04:26.600> that<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.720> can<00:04:27.900> twist<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.320> whole

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
shoulder that you can twist the whole

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.360 
shoulder that you can twist the whole
arm<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.130> then<00:04:30.080> single<00:04:31.080> jointed<00:04:31.350> elbow<00:04:31.740> only

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
arm and then single jointed elbow only

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.879 
arm and then single jointed elbow only
bends<00:04:32.580> up<00:04:32.729> to<00:04:32.850> about<00:04:33.000> there

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
bends up to about there

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.939 
bends up to about there
and<00:04:34.150> it's<00:04:35.150> another<00:04:35.569> joint<00:04:35.870> where<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.710> glove

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
and it's another joint where the glove

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.170 
and it's another joint where the glove
meets<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:39.039> white<00:04:40.039> part<00:04:40.310> right<00:04:40.610> up<00:04:40.729> both

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
meets the the white part right up both

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.550 
meets the the white part right up both
are<00:04:41.479> right<00:04:41.719> in<00:04:41.840> front<00:04:41.960> of<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.110> elbow<00:04:42.349> there

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
are right in front of the elbow there

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.330 
are right in front of the elbow there
that<00:04:43.280> that<00:04:43.460> turns<00:04:43.759> 360<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.860> then<00:04:45.979> the<00:04:46.159> head<00:04:46.310> is

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
that that turns 360 and then the head is

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.779 
that that turns 360 and then the head is
on<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.580> ball<00:04:46.789> joint<00:04:46.819> so<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.750> can<00:04:47.960> go<00:04:48.050> 360<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.039> up

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
on a ball joint so it can go 360 and up

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.100 
on a ball joint so it can go 360 and up
and<00:04:49.969> down<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.090> little<00:04:50.270> bit<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:50.659> you<00:04:50.810> can<00:04:50.930> pop

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
and down a little bit and you can pop

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.800 
and down a little bit and you can pop
that<00:04:51.139> off<00:04:53.050> but<00:04:54.050> yeah<00:04:55.030> that's<00:04:56.030> about<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:56.449> for

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
that off but yeah that's about it for

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.459 
that off but yeah that's about it for
these<00:04:56.930> for<00:04:57.379> this<00:04:57.500> figure<00:04:57.849> I<00:04:58.870> was<00:04:59.870> looking<00:05:00.169> at<00:05:00.259> a

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
these for this figure I was looking at a

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.360 
these for this figure I was looking at a
whole<00:05:00.889> bunch<00:05:00.919> of<00:05:01.189> these<00:05:01.280> at<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.550> store<00:05:01.610> and

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
whole bunch of these at the store and

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.709 
whole bunch of these at the store and
there<00:05:04.370> are<00:05:04.789> some<00:05:05.060> that<00:05:05.180> are<00:05:05.240> much<00:05:05.449> better<00:05:05.599> than

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
there are some that are much better than

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:06.570 
there are some that are much better than
others

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
others

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.809 
others

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
as far as gulps go as far as

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.219 
as far as gulps go as far as
articulation<00:05:11.389> goes<00:05:11.539> most<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:11.930> them<00:05:12.050> were<00:05:12.110> the

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
articulation goes most of them were the

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.019 
articulation goes most of them were the
same<00:05:12.259> the<00:05:12.620> only<00:05:12.770> real<00:05:12.949> difference<00:05:13.699> that<00:05:14.000> I

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:14.029 
same the only real difference that I

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.330 
same the only real difference that I
noticed<00:05:14.569> was<00:05:14.779> that<00:05:14.810> some<00:05:15.620> of<00:05:15.740> them<00:05:15.889> seemed<00:05:16.219> to

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
noticed was that some of them seemed to

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.550 
noticed was that some of them seemed to
have<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.699> joint<00:05:17.029> at<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.300> waist<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.169> allows<00:05:18.319> into

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
have a joint at the waist it allows into

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.330 
have a joint at the waist it allows into
360<00:05:19.039> there<00:05:19.189> and<00:05:19.340> some<00:05:19.520> of<00:05:19.550> them<00:05:19.729> do<00:05:19.909> not<00:05:21.340> and

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
360 there and some of them do not and

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.589 
360 there and some of them do not and
most<00:05:22.460> of<00:05:22.610> them<00:05:22.699> come<00:05:22.849> with<00:05:22.879> some<00:05:23.330> sort<00:05:23.569> of

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
most of them come with some sort of

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:24.249 
most of them come with some sort of
accessory

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
accessory

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.379 
accessory
I<00:05:24.439> think<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.430> only<00:05:25.580> one<00:05:25.699> that<00:05:25.849> really<00:05:26.000> didn't

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
I think the only one that really didn't

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.350 
I think the only one that really didn't
was<00:05:26.509> the<00:05:26.870> Hulk<00:05:27.020> figure<00:05:27.469> but<00:05:27.740> I<00:05:28.270> could<00:05:29.270> be

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
was the Hulk figure but I could be

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.269 
was the Hulk figure but I could be
mistaken<00:05:29.479> on<00:05:29.930> that<00:05:30.080> I<00:05:30.110> didn't<00:05:30.500> look<00:05:30.830> at<00:05:30.979> it<00:05:31.009> too

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:31.279 
mistaken on that I didn't look at it too

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.360 
mistaken on that I didn't look at it too
hard<00:05:31.310> they<00:05:32.240> had<00:05:32.389> a<00:05:32.419> really<00:05:32.629> weird<00:05:32.870> head<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:34.340> uh

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
hard they had a really weird head but uh

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.119 
hard they had a really weird head but uh
they're<00:05:34.969> pretty<00:05:35.180> nice<00:05:35.300> figures<00:05:35.740> I<00:05:36.740> mean

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
they're pretty nice figures I mean

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.969 
they're pretty nice figures I mean
they're<00:05:37.310> pretty<00:05:37.550> comparable<00:05:37.759> to<00:05:38.319> like<00:05:39.319> GI

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
they're pretty comparable to like GI

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.950 
they're pretty comparable to like GI
Joes<00:05:42.159> shipwreck<00:05:43.159> does<00:05:43.370> not<00:05:43.580> have<00:05:43.960> waist

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
Joes shipwreck does not have waist

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.709 
Joes shipwreck does not have waist
articulation<00:05:45.139> but<00:05:45.830> it's<00:05:46.610> almost<00:05:46.969> the<00:05:47.210> exact

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
articulation but it's almost the exact

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.579 
articulation but it's almost the exact
same<00:05:47.839> thing<00:05:48.639> double<00:05:49.639> join<00:05:49.789> at<00:05:49.969> the<00:05:50.060> knee<00:05:50.589> the

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:51.589 
same thing double join at the knee the

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:52.899 
same thing double join at the knee the
only<00:05:51.800> real<00:05:51.949> difference<00:05:52.099> is<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.430> foot<00:05:52.759> isn't

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
only real difference is the foot isn't

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:57.279 
only real difference is the foot isn't
on<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.300> hinge<00:05:54.879> it<00:05:55.879> doesn't<00:05:56.360> do<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:57.050> weird

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
on the hinge it doesn't do that weird

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.559 
on the hinge it doesn't do that weird

Marvel line does have a hole in the

Marvel line does have a hole in the
bottom<00:06:13.849> of<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.120> feet<00:06:14.360> so<00:06:15.279> they<00:06:16.279> can<00:06:16.849> stand<00:06:17.389> on

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:18.339 
bottom of the feet so they can stand on

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.070 
bottom of the feet so they can stand on
some<00:06:19.339> of<00:06:19.430> these<00:06:19.520> things<00:06:19.629> if<00:06:20.629> you<00:06:20.719> can<00:06:20.870> find

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
some of these things if you can find

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.980 
some of these things if you can find
something<00:06:21.259> to<00:06:21.439> fit<00:06:21.740> the<00:06:21.919> feet<00:06:23.139> like<00:06:24.139> that

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:36.230 

and<00:06:27.990> I<00:06:28.259> think<00:06:28.319> it's<00:06:32.629> this<00:06:33.629> guy<00:06:33.839> here<00:06:34.669> no<00:06:35.669> yes<00:06:36.119> it

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
and I think it's this guy here no yes it

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.769 
and I think it's this guy here no yes it
wasn't<00:06:37.699> some<00:06:38.699> of<00:06:38.819> them<00:06:38.939> our<00:06:39.029> heads<00:06:39.179> are<00:06:39.389> you

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
wasn't some of them our heads are you

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.449 
wasn't some of them our heads are you
can<00:06:39.959> pop<00:06:40.259> off<00:06:40.469> and<00:06:40.679> put<00:06:40.830> different<00:06:40.919> heads<00:06:41.249> on

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:41.459 
can pop off and put different heads on

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:44.989 
can pop off and put different heads on
from<00:06:42.330> the<00:06:42.779> other<00:06:42.929> figures<00:06:43.459> so<00:06:44.459> I<00:06:44.490> guess<00:06:44.849> that's

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:44.999 
from the other figures so I guess that's

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:47.179 
from the other figures so I guess that's
kind<00:06:45.270> of<00:06:45.300> cool<00:06:45.449> for<00:06:45.479> customization<00:06:46.349> if<00:06:47.009> you

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:47.189 
kind of cool for customization if you

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.999 
kind of cool for customization if you
wanted<00:06:47.399> to<00:06:48.229> get<00:06:49.229> some<00:06:49.409> of<00:06:49.499> these<00:06:49.589> and<00:06:49.830> make

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
wanted to get some of these and make

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.079 
wanted to get some of these and make
some<00:06:50.189> of<00:06:50.279> your<00:06:50.369> own<00:06:50.779> or<00:06:52.249> do<00:06:53.249> some<00:06:53.429> customizing

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:54.089 
some of your own or do some customizing

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:56.659 
some of your own or do some customizing
but<00:06:54.330> for<00:06:55.319> 9<00:06:55.469> bucks<00:06:55.679> a<00:06:56.039> three<00:06:56.550> and

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:56.669 
but for 9 bucks a three and

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.969 
but for 9 bucks a three and
three-quarter<00:06:57.089> inch<00:06:57.209> figure<00:06:57.589> it's<00:06:58.589> kind<00:06:58.860> of

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
three-quarter inch figure it's kind of

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.669 
three-quarter inch figure it's kind of
ridiculous<00:06:59.339> to<00:06:59.669> me<00:06:59.819> I<00:07:00.169> don't<00:07:01.169> think<00:07:01.439> I'll<00:07:01.559> be

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:01.679 
ridiculous to me I don't think I'll be

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:05.359 
ridiculous to me I don't think I'll be
getting<00:07:01.769> any<00:07:02.039> more<00:07:02.249> in<00:07:02.459> this<00:07:02.610> series<00:07:04.189> at<00:07:05.189> least
