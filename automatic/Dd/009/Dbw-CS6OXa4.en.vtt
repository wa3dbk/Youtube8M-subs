that's the bag I'm going to take a look
at<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.560> actual<00:03:15.650> hydration<00:03:16.280> pack<00:03:16.489> itself<00:03:16.880> now

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
at the actual hydration pack itself now

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.059 
at the actual hydration pack itself now
as<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.900> said<00:03:18.019> it's<00:03:18.200> three<00:03:18.440> litre<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:18.890> has<00:03:18.980> an

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
as I said it's three litre so has an

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.660 
as I said it's three litre so has an
incredible<00:03:19.640> size<00:03:19.880> we<00:03:20.660> simply<00:03:21.049> unzip<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:22.400> so

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
incredible size we simply unzip like so

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.539 
incredible size we simply unzip like so
and<00:03:23.510> on<00:03:23.720> here<00:03:23.930> do<00:03:24.049> you<00:03:24.109> see<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.380> little<00:03:24.950> buckle

pack then the tuned feeds out from
inside<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.130> bag<00:04:01.340> comes<00:04:01.819> down<00:04:02.060> here<00:04:02.359> like<00:04:02.660> I

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
inside the bag comes down here like I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.849 
inside the bag comes down here like I
said<00:04:02.900> before<00:04:03.019> as<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:03.319> can<00:04:03.410> see<00:04:03.500> we've<00:04:03.620> clicked

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
said before as you can see we've clicked

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:04.479 
said before as you can see we've clicked
it<00:04:03.950> into<00:04:04.130> there

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
it into there

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.880 
it into there
there's<00:04:04.819> also<00:04:05.060> clips<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.140> hooks<00:04:06.380> on<00:04:06.590> both

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
there's also clips and hooks on both

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.500 
there's also clips and hooks on both
sides<00:04:07.160> so<00:04:07.370> you<00:04:07.400> can<00:04:07.489> just<00:04:07.819> put<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.090> either<00:04:08.209> side

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
sides so you can just put it either side

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.360 
sides so you can just put it either side
you<00:04:08.780> can<00:04:08.900> also<00:04:09.019> put<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:09.500> through<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.829> clips

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
you can also put it through the clips

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.280 
you can also put it through the clips
and<00:04:10.640> down<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.090> bottom<00:04:11.390> here<00:04:11.600> they<00:04:12.049> just<00:04:12.079> do

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
and down the bottom here they just do

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.599 
and down the bottom here they just do
everything<00:04:12.319> basically<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.250> make<00:04:13.370> sure<00:04:13.489> it's

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
everything basically to make sure it's

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:14.590 
everything basically to make sure it's
not<00:04:13.700> going<00:04:13.819> to<00:04:13.910> swing<00:04:14.090> around<00:04:14.180> Marshall

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
not going to swing around Marshall

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.620 
not going to swing around Marshall
walking<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:16.120> finally<00:04:17.120> just<00:04:17.180> taking<00:04:17.479> a<00:04:17.510> look

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
walking and finally just taking a look

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.659 
walking and finally just taking a look
at<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.019> valve<00:04:18.229> itself<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.889> lot<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.459> efforts

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
at the valve itself a lot of efforts

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:20.920 
at the valve itself a lot of efforts
gone<00:04:19.820> into<00:04:19.970> designing<00:04:20.269> this<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.660> make<00:04:20.780> sure

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
gone into designing this to make sure

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.150 
gone into designing this to make sure
that<00:04:21.049> it's<00:04:21.200> not<00:04:21.350> going<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.590> leak<00:04:21.799> whilst

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
that it's not going to leak whilst

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.920 
that it's not going to leak whilst
you're<00:04:22.400> walking<00:04:22.729> around<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.539> you<00:04:23.600> see<00:04:23.900> right

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
you're walking around so you see right

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.170 
you're walking around so you see right
now<00:04:24.169> it's<00:04:24.620> locked<00:04:24.919> in<00:04:25.159> place<00:04:25.190> no<00:04:25.789> liquids<00:04:26.120> are

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
now it's locked in place no liquids are

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.820 
now it's locked in place no liquids are
going<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.360> pass<00:04:26.510> through<00:04:26.690> there<00:04:26.960> if<00:04:27.409> you<00:04:27.560> twist

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
going to pass through there if you twist

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.080 
going to pass through there if you twist
the<00:04:28.010> yellow<00:04:28.159> valve<00:04:28.370> on<00:04:28.520> top

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
the yellow valve on top

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.110 
the yellow valve on top
open<00:04:29.389> that's<00:04:30.080> now<00:04:30.290> open<00:04:30.680> fluid<00:04:31.100> can<00:04:31.220> now<00:04:31.340> come

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
open that's now open fluid can now come

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.250 
open that's now open fluid can now come
out<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.449> that's<00:04:32.600> how<00:04:32.720> you'd<00:04:32.900> have<00:04:33.050> it<00:04:33.139> when

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
out so that's how you'd have it when

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.970 
out so that's how you'd have it when
you're<00:04:33.350> drinking<00:04:33.500> it

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
you're drinking it

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.710 
you're drinking it
when<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:34.340> finish<00:04:34.580> of<00:04:34.699> it<00:04:34.820> you<00:04:35.150> simply<00:04:35.300> lock<00:04:35.600> it

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
when you finish of it you simply lock it

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.890 
when you finish of it you simply lock it
back<00:04:35.900> into<00:04:36.139> place<00:04:36.380> nice<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.520> simple<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.030> then

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
back into place nice and simple and then

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.850 
back into place nice and simple and then
what<00:04:39.020> they've<00:04:39.139> got<00:04:39.320> as<00:04:39.410> well<00:04:39.530> when<00:04:39.770> you're

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
what they've got as well when you're

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.860 
what they've got as well when you're
using<00:04:40.100> it<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:40.460> would<00:04:40.550> bite<00:04:40.790> down<00:04:41.090> on<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.630> blip

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
using it you would bite down on the blip

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.110 
using it you would bite down on the blip
here<00:04:42.139> that<00:04:42.740> opens<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.340> valve<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:43.820> drink

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
here that opens the valve so you drink

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.790 
here that opens the valve so you drink
