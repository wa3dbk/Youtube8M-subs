00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:24.380
 Good day to all in touch 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.380
 Nakroshaev Oleg and photoshopsunduchok site 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:30.839
 today we will study with you 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.730
 insert a photo in frame format 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.829
 jpeg 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.340
 How to determine that we have a frame format 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.399
 jeeppeg 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.530
 when we open it to Photoshop, you can 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.390
 look at the tab and you can see 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 next to the name of the photo that is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.920
 photo title29 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.070
 worth it. and then comes the expansion of this 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.679
 jeep in such a frame we will today 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.609
 insert a photo I took the most 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:58.760
 difficult option why suppose if 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.800
 open in png frame 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.300
 again we define how png will see 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.760
 top 71 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.420
 this means the name of the photo next. and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.680
 png 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 so on the png frame is already a place for 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.980
 future photos we have already cut 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 look at such a chess game here 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.380
 there is it means transparent 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.230
 here in this place is with us 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.260
 transparent place of this frame 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.640
 png format works very simple very 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.340
 just embed such 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 photo frames let me quickly 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.220
 I will show you how to do it. 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.730
 Here is a photo format 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.780
 cooked choose tools 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.630
 move click anywhere 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 photos held his mouse button 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.660
 I drag on the tab 71 png 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.700
 she opens i hold my left 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:02.430
 mouse button and move the mouse over 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.980
 photo 71 png and then only 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.850
 I release the left key husband is ours 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.330
 the photo is here 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.020
 open the layers palette 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:18.550
 and just simply swap the layers 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.870
 now apply free 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.910
 transform push control t 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:33.130
 holding shift key for any corner 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:37.270
 marker we stretch the photo inside for 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.520
 move the mouse cursor and move a little 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.620
 This is the photo because we need to 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.620
 like this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.050
 apply the transformation here 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.320
 all the work we have inserted a photo 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.070
 in png format 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:57.010
 but with the frame format jpeg us with you 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.520
 it won't work that way because here 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.110
 in the center this place is necessary 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.860
 pre cut that is to do 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.510
 its as if in the framework of the png format 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.090
 that is, we should have this place 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.090
 transparent let's learn how to do it 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:20.070
 select the quick selection tool 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.070
 rather big magic wand 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.950
 restore the tool with the right button 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.380
 mouse click in the upper left corner 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.110
 there is such a list of two 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:39.400
 points and restore the tool click 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:43.060
 over the white field and see what we have 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.060
 it turns out that together with us 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.590
 stood out the central part that is 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.810
 which we need where we will be 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.660
 insert a photo with us you share and 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.580
 a lot others 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:00.660
 then the pixels around the frame are not us 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:06.100
 need in this case well what are we doing with you 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.630
 in this case, we just simply cancel 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:14.140
 selection control-d 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:19.709
 and the tolerance of the magic wand reduce well 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.709
 let's set an example somewhere 15 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:27.210
 enter click and now click on any 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.820
 the place of the white field here we have stood out 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.570
 only future place under the frame 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.150
 under the photo is already our best 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.110
 option 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.690
 the next thing we have to do with you 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.860
 this 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.910
 feather the selection so that we donâ€™t 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.530
 there were sharp transitions between photos and 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.160
 frame we have to shade the selection 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:54.370
 so we go into the selection 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.420
 modification and select feathering here 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.010
 we introduce quite a lot of value 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.270
 so that we have a soft translation well to 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.220
 for example let's introduce 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:12.160
 30 pixels click ok now we will open 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:15.610
 palette layers unlock this layer for 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.920
 of this i just have two times left 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.370
 mouse buttons click on the background layer 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.610
 a new layer window appears nothing here 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.460
 we don't push just ok and 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.650
 see we lock the estate gone 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.520
 means that in layer 1 blocks like 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:38.280
 unlocked now we press the key 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:40.840
 david see with us already 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.690
 white color was cut and appeared 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.170
 chess that is what is top what are we 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:51.520
 sought to push control-d remove 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:54.900
 allotment we are all ready for placement 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.800
 photos go to our photo 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:02.130
 we select the tool of moving 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.540
 click anywhere in the photo 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.320
 drag the tab wait until she 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:12.250
 the tab opens 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:17.440
 drag the photo onto the frame and 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:21.300
 let go of the left mouse button so the palette 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.300
 glory open and swap 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:29.080
 that's what we got so far 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:34.729
 apply free transform 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:38.560
 control t and a little can be reduced 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:42.020
 photograph and post it more successfully 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:47.020
 how about something like this will do click next 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:50.979
 enter here and we all posted 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.750
 jpeg photo frame 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.180
 use this method thanks for 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.990
