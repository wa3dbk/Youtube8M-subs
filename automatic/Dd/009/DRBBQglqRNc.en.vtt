everyone loves sliding down a fire pole
but<00:00:39.510> there's<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:39.839> not<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.050> many<00:00:40.290> chances

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
but there's really not that many chances

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.319 
but there's really not that many chances
in<00:00:41.070> everyday<00:00:41.309> life<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.699> do<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.970> it's<00:00:42.180> called

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
in everyday life to do it it's called

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.850 
in everyday life to do it it's called
birth<00:00:42.570> canal<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.170> idea<00:00:43.470> is<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.739> go

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
birth canal and the idea is to go

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.000 
birth canal and the idea is to go
through<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.489> very<00:00:44.970> small<00:00:45.269> tight<00:00:45.659> channel<00:00:46.079> where

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
through a very small tight channel where

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.530 
through a very small tight channel where
compressed<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.699> sides<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.449> you

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
compressed on all sides and then you

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.740 
compressed on all sides and then you
bird<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.769> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.040> other<00:00:50.280> side<00:00:50.600> hence<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
bird out of the other side hence the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.570 
bird out of the other side hence the
name<00:00:51.869> birth<00:00:52.260> canal<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.159> a<00:00:53.220> kid<00:00:53.250> my

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
brother used to pin me down like that

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.090 
brother used to pin me down like that
you'd<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.229> throw<00:00:55.409> a<00:00:55.440> blanket<00:00:55.589> over<00:00:55.830> me<00:00:56.040> and

press it down all sides and have to try

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.899 
press it down all sides and have to try
to<00:00:57.689> squirm<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.309> terrifying<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.489> think<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.820> have

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
to squirm out terrifying I think we have

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:00.890 
to squirm out terrifying I think we have
the<00:00:59.970> opportunity<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.540> same<00:01:00.689> thing<00:01:00.869> about

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
the opportunity to the same thing about

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.869 
the opportunity to the same thing about
participants<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.710> definite<00:01:02.369> think<00:01:02.519> ever<00:01:02.670> says

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
participants a definite think ever says

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.850 
participants a definite think ever says
the<00:01:02.970> spot<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.540> 2015<00:01:04.049> menu<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the spot in the 2015 menu if we want to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.260 
the spot in the 2015 menu if we want to
take<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> next<00:01:05.280> level<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
take you to the next level we have to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.580 
take you to the next level we have to
change<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> profile<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> obstacle

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
change the profile of the obstacle

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
change the profile of the obstacle
something<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> waterfall<00:01:08.549> actually

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
something like a waterfall actually

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.700 
something like a waterfall actually
coming<00:01:09.270> off<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> top<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> obstacle<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
coming off the top of the obstacle and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.350 
coming off the top of the obstacle and
what<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:10.920> thinking<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.549> try<00:01:12.299> two

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
what I'm thinking is we try two

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.359 
what I'm thinking is we try two
different<00:01:12.540> profiles<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.439> curved<00:01:14.040> back

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
different profiles like a curved back

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.380 
different profiles like a curved back
feet<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.790> never<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.150> you're<00:01:15.270> actually

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
feet are never so you're actually

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.520 
feet are never so you're actually
running<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.350> reach

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
running up and you have to reach

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
running up and you have to reach
overhead<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.549> grab<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.119> second<00:01:18.479> feature

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
overhead to grab it the second feature

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.270 
overhead to grab it the second feature
is<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> rounded<00:01:19.500> top<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
is going to be a rounded top so you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920 
is going to be a rounded top so you
actually<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> go<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> crown<00:01:21.689> over

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
actually have to go up and crown over

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929 
actually have to go up and crown over
the<00:01:22.020> top<00:01:22.200> slightly<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.609> your<00:01:23.700> team

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the top slightly and then have your team

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.789 
the top slightly and then have your team
help<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> what<00:01:24.869> you're<00:01:24.990> suggesting<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
help you that what you're suggesting is

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.520 
help you that what you're suggesting is
there's<00:01:26.039> no<00:01:26.249> ledge<00:01:26.780> this<00:01:27.780> round<00:01:28.079> yeah

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
there's no ledge this round yeah

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.499 
there's no ledge this round yeah
basically<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:29.460> recommendation<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.240> walk<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
basically my recommendation for walk the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.980 
basically my recommendation for walk the
plank<00:01:30.689> iteration<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:32.009> rope<00:01:32.820> swing<00:01:32.850> off<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
plank iteration is a rope swing off of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.989 
plank iteration is a rope swing off of
it<00:01:34.109> taking<00:01:34.499> that<00:01:34.649> same<00:01:34.920> obstacle<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> we

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
it taking that same obstacle that we

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:37.580 
it taking that same obstacle that we
have<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> walk<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.569> plank<00:01:36.810> adding<00:01:37.530> an

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
have and walk the plank adding an

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
have and walk the plank adding an
element<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.009> both<00:01:38.460> fun<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.149> tough<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.899> it

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
element of both fun and tough to it

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
element of both fun and tough to it
never<00:01:40.499> done<00:01:40.619> anything<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.039> before<00:01:41.219> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
never done anything like this before and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.789 
never done anything like this before and
nobody's<00:01:42.810> doing<00:01:42.990> anything<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.770> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
nobody's doing anything like this and I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.929 
nobody's doing anything like this and I
think<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> lot<00:01:44.039> of<00:01:44.219> people<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.789> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
think a lot of people want the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
experience of what being tear gas is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.270 
experience of what being tear gas is
like<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.750> long-term<00:02:25.280> somewhat

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
like that the long-term somewhat

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.940 
like that the long-term somewhat
dangerous

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
dangerous

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.680 
dangerous
first<00:02:27.640> things<00:02:27.819> first<00:02:27.879> we<00:02:28.180> got<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.360> find<00:02:28.540> that

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
first things first we got to find that

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.420 
first things first we got to find that
gas<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.379> we<00:02:29.410> have<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.770> find<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.099> gas<00:02:30.250> we're

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
gas so we have to find the gas we're

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.070 
gas so we have to find the gas we're
going<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.610> use<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.150> we<00:02:31.300> could<00:02:31.420> find<00:02:31.989> a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
going to use and then we could find a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.360 
going to use and then we could find a
way<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.260> make<00:02:32.349> this<00:02:32.470> thing<00:02:32.769> work<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.220> goal

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
way to make this thing work the goal

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.520 
way to make this thing work the goal
really<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.730> get<00:02:34.120> into<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.450> air<00:02:34.569> get<00:02:35.140> into<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
really is get into the air get into a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.080 
really is get into the air get into a
visible<00:02:35.890> cloud<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.250> smoke<00:02:36.400> you're

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
visible cloud of smoke you're

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.030 
visible cloud of smoke you're
essentially<00:02:37.660> saying<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:38.200> want<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.500> continue

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
essentially saying you want to continue

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.009

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
to call yourself a tough mudder we're

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.990 
to call yourself a tough mudder we're
going<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.200> have<00:02:41.379> this<00:02:41.709> new<00:02:42.010> thing<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.580> tear

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
going to have this new thing this tear

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.370 
going to have this new thing this tear
gas<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.630> you're<00:02:43.720> going<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.930> have<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.110> make<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
gas and you're going to have to make the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.290 
gas and you're going to have to make the
same<00:02:44.590> decision<00:02:45.190> when<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.519> hit<00:02:45.700> electroshock
