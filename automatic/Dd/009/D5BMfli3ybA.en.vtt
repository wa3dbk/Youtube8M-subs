00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
find out what these problems are as I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.430 
find out what these problems are as I
said<00:02:50.000> earlier<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.569> not<00:02:50.599> normal<00:02:51.079> for<00:02:51.109> a<00:02:51.260> cat

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
said earlier it's not normal for a cat

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.380 
said earlier it's not normal for a cat
to<00:02:51.470> vomit<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.129> unfortunately<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.910> vomiting

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
to vomit and unfortunately the vomiting

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.780 
to vomit and unfortunately the vomiting
oftentimes<00:02:54.260> doesn't<00:02:55.040> really<00:02:55.190> make<00:02:55.430> your<00:02:55.549> cat

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
oftentimes doesn't really make your cat

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.119 
oftentimes doesn't really make your cat
act<00:02:56.060> abnormal<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:56.900> oftentimes<00:02:57.349> we<00:02:57.739> delay

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
act abnormal so oftentimes we delay

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.550 
act abnormal so oftentimes we delay
doing<00:02:59.120> any<00:02:59.269> tests<00:02:59.569> or<00:02:59.810> figuring<00:03:00.260> out<00:03:00.319> what<00:03:00.470> the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
doing any tests or figuring out what the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.190 
doing any tests or figuring out what the
problem<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.099> because<00:03:01.609> the<00:03:02.000> cat<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.480> by<00:03:03.049> and

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
problem is because the cat is by and

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.530 
problem is because the cat is by and
large<00:03:03.260> acting<00:03:03.739> normally<00:03:04.310> sometimes<00:03:05.209> we<00:03:05.390> see

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
large acting normally sometimes we see

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.030 
large acting normally sometimes we see
these<00:03:05.690> cats<00:03:05.959> primarily<00:03:06.470> because<00:03:06.859> they're

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
these cats primarily because they're

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.460 
these cats primarily because they're
making<00:03:07.400> too<00:03:07.579> many<00:03:07.670> stains<00:03:08.060> on<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.390> carpet<00:03:08.569> but

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
making too many stains on the carpet but

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.740 
making too many stains on the carpet but
it's<00:03:09.769> not<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.459> not<00:03:10.700> good<00:03:11.000> for<00:03:11.030> your<00:03:11.359> cat<00:03:11.569> to

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
it's not it's not good for your cat to

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.970 
it's not it's not good for your cat to
continue<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.260> have<00:03:12.409> chronic<00:03:12.680> vomiting

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
continue to have chronic vomiting

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.949 
continue to have chronic vomiting
because<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.579> problem<00:03:14.030> could<00:03:14.269> potentially<00:03:14.840> be

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
because the problem could potentially be

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.619 
because the problem could potentially be
getting<00:03:15.230> worse<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:16.609> also<00:03:16.760> sometimes<00:03:17.450> will

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
getting worse and it also sometimes will

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.849 
getting worse and it also sometimes will
cause<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:19.599> kind<00:03:20.599> of<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.780> chain<00:03:21.019> reaction<00:03:21.230> for

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
cause a kind of a chain reaction for

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.470 
cause a kind of a chain reaction for
other<00:03:22.040> problems<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.669> start<00:03:23.000> showing<00:03:23.329> up

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
other problems to start showing up

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.180 
other problems to start showing up
because<00:03:23.630> we<00:03:23.930> never<00:03:24.139> really<00:03:24.440> got<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.620> the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
because we never really got the the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.030 
because we never really got the the
original<00:03:25.579> problem<00:03:25.910> under<00:03:26.090> control<00:03:26.859> so<00:03:27.859> how<00:03:27.980> we

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
original problem under control so how we

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.699 
original problem under control so how we
go<00:03:28.220> about<00:03:28.250> diagnosing<00:03:28.579> these<00:03:29.150> kitties<00:03:29.540> and

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
go about diagnosing these kitties and

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.809 
go about diagnosing these kitties and
finding<00:03:30.709> out<00:03:30.799> what<00:03:31.010> their<00:03:31.160> problem<00:03:31.519> is<00:03:31.609> so

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
finding out what their problem is so

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.879 
finding out what their problem is so
that<00:03:31.849> we<00:03:32.030> can<00:03:32.180> fix<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.810> by<00:03:33.290> doing<00:03:33.500> a

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
that we can fix it is by doing a

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.069 
that we can fix it is by doing a
stepwise<00:03:34.489> workup<00:03:35.180> at<00:03:35.359> this<00:03:35.540> particular

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
stepwise workup at this particular

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.680 
stepwise workup at this particular
practice<00:03:36.549> we<00:03:37.549> start<00:03:37.849> with<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.030> normal<00:03:38.510> blood

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
practice we start with a normal blood

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.220 
practice we start with a normal blood

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
potentially make it so that we stop

potentially make it so that we stop
doing<00:04:56.930> testing<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:57.620> we<00:04:58.130> start<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.490> treat<00:04:58.790> the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
doing testing and we start to treat the

doing testing and we start to treat the
actual<00:04:59.450> problem<00:05:00.610> oftentimes<00:05:01.610> what<00:05:02.480> we<00:05:02.600> end<00:05:02.750> up

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
actual problem oftentimes what we end up

actual problem oftentimes what we end up
finding<00:05:03.230> is<00:05:03.380> that<00:05:03.410> these<00:05:03.800> test<00:05:04.400> results<00:05:04.790> are

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
finding is that these test results are

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.990 
finding is that these test results are
normal<00:05:05.120> or<00:05:05.540> inconclusive<00:05:06.280> which<00:05:07.280> makes<00:05:07.700> it<00:05:07.880> so

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
normal or inconclusive which makes it so

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.580 
normal or inconclusive which makes it so
that<00:05:08.030> we<00:05:08.240> have<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.570> proceed<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.140> next<00:05:09.290> step

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
that we have to proceed to the next step

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.420 
that we have to proceed to the next step
I<00:05:09.919> should<00:05:10.250> say<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.700> some<00:05:10.940> of<00:05:11.060> these<00:05:11.320> problems

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
I should say that some of these problems

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.640 
I should say that some of these problems
for<00:05:13.430> for<00:05:14.240> instance<00:05:14.540> the<00:05:14.750> exocrine<00:05:15.169> pancreatic

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
for for instance the exocrine pancreatic

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.890 
for for instance the exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency<00:05:15.889> is<00:05:16.639> really<00:05:17.000> not<00:05:17.150> diagnosed

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
insufficiency is really not diagnosed

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.350 
insufficiency is really not diagnosed
any<00:05:18.740> other<00:05:18.860> way<00:05:19.040> than<00:05:19.250> doing<00:05:19.460> this<00:05:19.610> blood<00:05:20.180> test

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
any other way than doing this blood test

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.590 
any other way than doing this blood test
that<00:05:20.570> I'm<00:05:20.660> referring<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:22.550> we<00:05:22.729> can<00:05:22.910> do

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
that I'm referring to so we can do

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.840 
that I'm referring to so we can do
biopsies<00:05:24.229> of<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.470> intestines<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.220> biopsies

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
biopsies of the intestines and biopsies

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.060 
biopsies of the intestines and biopsies
of<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.210> pancreas<00:05:27.020> and<00:05:27.229> things<00:05:27.440> like<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:27.830> and

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
of the pancreas and things like that and

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.830 
of the pancreas and things like that and
not<00:05:28.340> find<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.880> problem<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:29.360> then<00:05:29.479> have<00:05:29.690> to

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
not find the problem and then have to

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.330 
not find the problem and then have to
come<00:05:30.050> back<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:30.470> do<00:05:30.590> these<00:05:30.740> cheaper<00:05:31.160> easier

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
come back and do these cheaper easier

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.210 
come back and do these cheaper easier
tests<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:32.870> this<00:05:33.050> is<00:05:33.229> why<00:05:33.380> we<00:05:33.530> do<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.680> step<00:05:34.010> weighs

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
tests so this is why we do a step weighs

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.400 
tests so this is why we do a step weighs
stepwise<00:05:34.940> workup<00:05:35.419> so<00:05:35.570> that<00:05:35.690> we<00:05:35.840> are<00:05:35.960> doing<00:05:36.260> the

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
stepwise workup so that we are doing the

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.529 
stepwise workup so that we are doing the
least<00:05:36.740> invasive<00:05:37.100> least<00:05:37.610> expensive<00:05:38.180> tests

least invasive least expensive tests

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.170 
least invasive least expensive tests

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
first and if those tests do not give us

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.490 
first and if those tests do not give us
the<00:05:41.210> answer<00:05:41.630> that<00:05:41.780> we're<00:05:41.930> looking<00:05:42.020> for<00:05:42.200> we

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
the answer that we're looking for we

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.350 
the answer that we're looking for we
proceed<00:05:42.919> to<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.190> next<00:05:43.370> step<00:05:43.850> which<00:05:44.060> may

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
proceed to the next step which may

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.580 
proceed to the next step which may
potentially<00:05:44.660> be<00:05:45.020> a<00:05:45.050> little<00:05:45.289> bit<00:05:45.410> more

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
potentially be a little bit more

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.390
