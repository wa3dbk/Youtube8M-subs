00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.480
 day more to my channel and today I bring you a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.480
 new video about new information that 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.889
 just come out about how u2 whites 3 and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.019
 this information that I bring you today 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.540
 guys is really information that 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.390
 many people but many people I 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.210
 I had asked during these months and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.939
 as premiere in the title guys finally 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.369
 finally finally deigned to 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.560
 confirm that call of duty black ops 3 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.070
 will come out so much for the platform 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.130
 playstation 3 like for 360 the foot that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.960
 will come out in the yen have confirmed that 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.930
 this version is being made by 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.670
 studio of box and merchandise technology is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.469
 of certain different studies or what 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.590
 they would be activision and although it would be 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.870
 treyarch so you can relax or 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.360
 guys and breathe deeply were 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.850
 very much because as I said I do a 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.280
 month in a video that I uploaded to my channel was 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.859
 obvious that they would take him out yes or yes no 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.930
 well and you will ask why we had 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.930
 skipped because such a big company 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.000
 as activision and as real is not going to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.980
 dignar it was obvious that he is not going to deign to 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.770
 to lose 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.070
 with all playstation 3 users 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.500
 and xbox360 it was very obvious that he was going to 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.450
 end up taking out for listeners not the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.580
 studio activision and treyarch but yes 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.020
 some studies of videogame design 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.900
 different as already mentioned 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.580
 previously in this same video well 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.260
 that once said this great news 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.700
 I will comment on several things that 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.010
 they are also quite pretty 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.410
 important one of them is the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.410
 exclusivity that you currently have with 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.570
 the root and with microsoft as you know 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.500
 always take them out of times a month before 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.110
 on xbox 360 and on xbox one that jenson is 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.480
 say in prison 4 and playstation 3 but 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.030
 as you will know the gray color always as 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.580
 so to speak it resembles a brand 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.570
 of food as they are crimes or the brand of 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.640
 bobby is how is mtn new or another brand of 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.140
 things to promote codes and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.140
 supplies in the case of advanced 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.480
 warfare and 777 well as you are seeing in 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.270
 This year's screen is going to be 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.700
 the diu that is a brand divided almost 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.800
 oysters for sports in which yes 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.350
 we get into your page appears 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.360
 do you have now before the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.270
 initial of the drink and up as 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.670
 we can check we see the initial of the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.090
 logo of the drink that gets m 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.430
 I see it next to hard and then more 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.910
 on the right we see the inscription of 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.370
 play station four guys playstation 4 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.280
 does not put teams one my team 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.920
 you can simply playstation 4 and so 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.800
 which we could already confirm 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.750
 almost 100% safe but yes confirm that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.480
 in exclusivity possibly no longer 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.480
 belongs to friends or from color 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.670
 beauty white 3 great news for 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.170
 all of us have to wait a month 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.390
 to get out those of the e3 guys and 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.080
 well they also commented a little thing that 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.780
 it's very good that very very interesting that 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.120
 we should leave adwords 10 posted on your 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.300
 twitter a tweet and in which he said that 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.490
 there was possibly going to be a new base 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.100
 at the video game convention 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.980
 apart from the e3 and the gamescom in the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.370
 which was going to sponsor or pacific what 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.819
 judge 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.250
 exclusively to the combis ie a 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.739
 exclusive event for the zombies of 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.030
 call of duty skinny test and because they have 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.950
 you will ask then simply 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.310
 because they have finally realized that 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.590
 the zombies of cordiplan 1 2 and 3 have 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.440
 been the ones who have thrown most of the saga 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.269
 so having said all this about the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.069
 exclusivity what they know or 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.110
 well what about the new convention that 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.879
 possibly be between the e3 and the 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.569
 gamescom if it would not be after the 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.310
 gamescom 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.989
 Well, guys, I hope you have 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.030
 liked all this new information then 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.349
 I just entered the channel that I hit a 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.200
 huge line since it 's pretty 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.989
 complicated to find it and nothing guys we 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.989
 we see tomorrow with the following video 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.989
 goodbye
