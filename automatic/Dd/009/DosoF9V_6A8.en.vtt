00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
up a x-games slope cell he looks at the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.190 
up a x-games slope cell he looks at the
jump<00:01:40.290> he's<00:01:41.220> excited<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.690> looking<00:01:43.020> really

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
jump he's excited it's looking really

00:01:43.200 --> 00:03:12.720

nice<00:01:44.150> yeah

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.070 

well<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.150> was<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.390> quick<00:03:14.630> little<00:03:14.900> run-through

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
well that was a quick little run-through

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.500 
well that was a quick little run-through
of<00:03:15.350> what<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.920> course<00:03:16.130> looks<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.580> right<00:03:17.150> now

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.930 
of what the course looks like right now
not<00:03:17.690> 100%<00:03:18.050> down<00:03:18.440> but<00:03:18.710> I<00:03:18.740> think<00:03:18.980> why<00:03:19.100> this

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
not 100% down but I think why this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.480 
not 100% down but I think why this
afternoon<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.800> should<00:03:21.800> be<00:03:21.890> almost<00:03:22.040> done<00:03:22.310> and
