00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
looking at the camera quality of the

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.930 
looking at the camera quality of the
iPhone<00:00:03.480> 5s<00:00:04.049> so<00:00:04.319> Apple<00:00:04.920> did<00:00:05.100> increase<00:00:05.700> some

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
iPhone 5s so Apple did increase some

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.849 
iPhone 5s so Apple did increase some
things<00:00:06.210> here<00:00:06.420> on<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.690> camera<00:00:07.049> they<00:00:07.470> made<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.770> a

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
things here on the camera they made it a

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.589 
things here on the camera they made it a
little<00:00:08.040> bit<00:00:08.189> better<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.519> both<00:00:08.880> ends<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.330> front

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
little bit better on both ends the front

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.180 
little bit better on both ends the front
and<00:00:09.809> back<00:00:10.019> so<00:00:10.230> let's<00:00:10.410> go<00:00:10.530> ahead<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.950> take<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and back so let's go ahead and take a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.950 
and back so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.910> picture<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.480> showing<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
look this picture is showing you the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.049 
look this picture is showing you the
true<00:00:13.200> tone<00:00:13.410> flash<00:00:13.440> which<00:00:14.040> basically<00:00:14.429> mixes<00:00:15.030> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
true tone flash which basically mixes a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.599 
true tone flash which basically mixes a
white<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.630> amber<00:00:16.080> LED<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.190> looked<00:00:17.340> pretty

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
white and amber LED and it looked pretty

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.880 
white and amber LED and it looked pretty
decent<00:00:17.880> i<00:00:18.180> guess<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.900> low-light<00:00:19.320> picture<00:00:19.710> is

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
decent i guess this low-light picture is

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.070 
decent i guess this low-light picture is
okay<00:00:20.189> as<00:00:20.550> well<00:00:20.820> but<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.449> when<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:21.720> go<00:00:21.869> outside

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
okay as well but then when we go outside

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.740 
okay as well but then when we go outside

good<00:00:49.500> image<00:00:49.770> stabilization<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.090> thing

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
good image stabilization but one thing

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.090 
good image stabilization but one thing
that<00:00:51.300> still<00:00:51.719> hasn't<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.320> been<00:00:52.559> improved

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that still hasn't really been improved

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.580 
that still hasn't really been improved
is<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.940> still<00:00:54.480> had<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> tap<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> focus<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
is that I still had a tap to focus the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.229 
is that I still had a tap to focus the
video<00:00:55.829> when<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.309> moving<00:00:56.520> around<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.059> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
video when I was moving around a lot it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.939 
video when I was moving around a lot it
wouldn't<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:57.629> autofocus<00:00:58.379> while<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> was

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
wouldn't really autofocus while I was

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950 
wouldn't really autofocus while I was
recording<00:00:59.280> which<00:00:59.609> was<00:00:59.760> kind<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.090> annoying<00:01:00.300> but

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
recording which was kind of annoying but

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.360
