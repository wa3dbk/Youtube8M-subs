did at capo at third or fourth fret and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.700 
did at capo at third or fourth fret and
and<00:00:41.150> really<00:00:41.600> just<00:00:41.720> kind<00:00:41.809> of<00:00:42.019> randomly<00:00:42.350> picks

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
and really just kind of randomly picks

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.590 
and really just kind of randomly picks
through<00:00:43.070> some<00:00:43.760> some<00:00:44.180> Travis<00:00:44.900> picking<00:00:45.230> styles

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
so you really just have to develop the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.709 
so you really just have to develop the
ability<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.550> keep<00:00:49.879> an<00:00:50.030> alternating<00:00:50.480> bass

ability to keep an alternating bass

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.410

going<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:51.320> play<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:51.770> couple<00:00:52.129> of<00:00:52.520> notes<00:00:53.090> in

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
going and play a couple of notes in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.689 
going and play a couple of notes in
between<00:00:53.480> with<00:00:54.170> occasional<00:00:54.469> pinches<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:55.670> I

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
between with occasional pinches so I

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.459 
between with occasional pinches so I
have<00:00:55.879> students<00:00:56.180> work<00:00:56.329> on<00:00:56.510> other<00:00:56.809> songs<00:00:57.140> that

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469
