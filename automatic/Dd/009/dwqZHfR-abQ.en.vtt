00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.049
 what's up with the xoom? 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.220
 yourself 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.679
 digital cameras have in contrast to the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.809
 Most smartphones have an optical zoom 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.610
 when picking up the motive 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.420
 worsened in contrast to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.449
 smartphone 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.850
 The picture quality is not the zoom factor 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.670
 a camera is the relationship between 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.869
 larger and smallest focal length he is 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.669
 usually printed as a number on the housing 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.860
 after the camera on at 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.750
 smallest focal length results in a 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.290
 more or less strong wide angle 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.110
 effect 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.300
 The picture angle is pretty big 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.449
 and new objects become disproportionate 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.780
 big picture compared to ours 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.280
 normal visual impression zooms with one 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.620
 2 times zoom zoom 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.839
 you reach about the normal focal length 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.540
 and doubles the size of the picture 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.769
 motivs here the effect of the zooms at 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.769
 a real motive 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.620
 appear at five times the zoom range 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.240
 Five times as many cameras are off 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.860
 Ten times the zoom range is called 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.410
 usually super zoom 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.310
 They have a very strong tele effect 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.540
 and bring distant close up 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.550
 is again doubles the figure 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.140
 size with a 20x zoom 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.160
 so you save yourself already 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.130
 binoculars also cameras with 50 and 60 times 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.620
 zoom, there is already the disadvantage ever 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.810
 the more you zoom in the shorter you have to 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.150
 the shutter speed is still around 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.630
 blurred without a tripod taking pictures too 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.210
 can 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.670
 So you need a lot for telephoto 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:48.880
 light also helps the image stabilizer 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.860
 here only a limited amount of zoom helps 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.729
 not only for a long time to the motive 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.890
 to save 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.200
 you can change the focal length 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.479
 also use for image design here 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.150
 the same motive for the same kind of education 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:06.100
 size once from names with wide angle 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:12.280
 recorded then at normal focal length 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:17.590
 and medium recording distance and 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.300
 with great distance in the halls with the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.970
 tele foto leaves the background 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.489
 by blurred pictures the so-called 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.560
 largely hide bucchi 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.290
 the normal focal length gives the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.630
 visual impression of our eyes again and that 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.790
 wide angle is very much environment with 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.990
 and distort the proportions of 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.209
 motive something 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.090
 a test of superzoom cameras with 10 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.709
 There are 22 times the zoom range in the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.080
 september edition of the magazine test 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.080
