00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
this video on the Google piano so let me

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.100 
this video on the Google piano so let me

go ahead and show you what the mother

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.650 
go ahead and show you what the mother
position<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> Yuko<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.330> it<00:00:12.330> basically

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
position of the Yuko is it basically

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.709 
position of the Yuko is it basically
starts<00:00:13.050> off<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.349> white<00:00:13.559> playing<00:00:13.800> e4<00:00:14.280> e5

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
starts off with white playing e4 e5

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.470 
starts off with white playing e4 e5
Knight<00:00:15.719> f3<00:00:15.750> knight<00:00:16.230> c6<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.220> 3<00:00:17.550> Bishop<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.970> c4

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.450 

now<00:00:21.480> black<00:00:21.750> replies<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.349> Bishop<00:00:22.649> to<00:00:22.770> c5<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
now black replies with Bishop to c5 and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.540 
now black replies with Bishop to c5 and
after<00:00:23.880> c3<00:00:24.329> we<00:00:24.540> reach<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.899> Kiko<00:00:25.230> piano<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:26.220> idea

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
after c3 we reach to Kiko piano the idea

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.880 
after c3 we reach to Kiko piano the idea
of<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.790> Kiko<00:00:27.090> piano<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.919> very<00:00:28.919> old-school

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
of the Kiko piano is very old-school

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.889 
of the Kiko piano is very old-school
basically<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.640> we'd<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.510> after

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
basically what we'd like to do is after

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
basically what we'd like to do is after
Knight<00:00:34.500> f6<00:00:35.600> white<00:00:36.600> plays<00:00:36.899> d4<00:00:37.219> pawn<00:00:38.219> takes<00:00:38.640> pawn

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
Knight f6 white plays d4 pawn takes pawn

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.729 
Knight f6 white plays d4 pawn takes pawn
takes<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.449> white<00:00:39.629> strategy<00:00:40.289> is<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.589> have

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
takes and white strategy is to have

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.279 
takes and white strategy is to have
greater<00:00:41.070> control<00:00:41.280> over<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.820> center<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.870> at

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
greater control over the center but at

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.720 
greater control over the center but at
the<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:43.980> opening<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.489> being

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the time that this opening was being

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
the time that this opening was being
developed<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.750> concept<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.440> controlling

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
developed the concept of controlling

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.319 
developed the concept of controlling
Center<00:00:47.429> was<00:00:47.789> very<00:00:48.390> two-dimensional<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.320> was

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
Center was very two-dimensional it was

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
Center was very two-dimensional it was
basically<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.600> ponds<00:00:52.140> right<00:00:52.769> pawns<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
basically with ponds right pawns are the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
basically with ponds right pawns are the
soul<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.850> chess<00:00:54.089> control<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.170> center<00:00:55.530> etc<00:00:55.649> etc

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
soul of chess control the center etc etc

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.259 
soul of chess control the center etc etc
so<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:58.769> idea<00:00:59.129> behind<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.879> these

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
so the idea behind this is that these

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.930 
so the idea behind this is that these
pawns<00:01:00.659> have<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.170> crippling<00:01:01.559> effect<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
pawns have a crippling effect so the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.610 
pawns have a crippling effect so the
classical<00:01:03.390> Center<00:01:03.690> cripples<00:01:04.110> blacks<00:01:04.350> pieces

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
classical Center cripples blacks pieces

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.770 
classical Center cripples blacks pieces
and<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.400> result<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.000> will<00:01:06.120> stop<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.420> white

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
and as a result it will stop that white

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
and as a result it will stop that white
would<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> decisive<00:01:07.530> advantage<00:01:07.799> but

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
would have a decisive advantage but

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
would have a decisive advantage but
eventually<00:01:08.549> chess<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.570> walls<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.049> theory

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
eventually chess of walls and theory

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.399 
eventually chess of walls and theory
evolves<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.189> technique<00:01:11.579> evolves<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.409> there

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
evolves and technique evolves and there

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
evolves and technique evolves and there
were<00:01:13.530> many<00:01:14.159> methods<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.030> defense<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.659> were

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
were many methods of defense that were

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.679 
were many methods of defense that were
found<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.829> black<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.670> give<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.240> highly

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
found for black that give them a highly

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.920 
found for black that give them a highly
satisfactory<00:01:19.140> position<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
satisfactory position so in this

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.620 
satisfactory position so in this
position<00:01:22.170> Bishop<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.219> b4<00:01:23.610> check<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.090> either<00:01:24.270> at

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
position Bishop to b4 check is either at

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.170 
position Bishop to b4 check is either at
the<00:01:24.960> theoretical<00:01:25.380> main<00:01:26.070> move<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.030> also

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the theoretical main move but it's also

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.850 
the theoretical main move but it's also
important<00:01:27.719> to<00:01:27.750> show<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.140> after<00:01:28.259> Bishop<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
important to show that after Bishop to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.139 
important to show that after Bishop to
d6<00:01:30.469> white<00:01:31.469> shows<00:01:31.740> his<00:01:31.920> advantage<00:01:32.399> after<00:01:32.549> d5

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
d6 white shows his advantage after d5

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:40.069 
d6 white shows his advantage after d5

basically capturing what he can at the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.310 
basically capturing what he can at the
moment<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:05.820> obviously<00:02:06.119> he's<00:02:06.659> smothering

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
said going back that's a good example of

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.559 
said going back that's a good example of
