00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:06.920

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:16.430

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.250
 there were wet warm sawdust 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.740
 I spilled sawdust well with hot water 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.159

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.159

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.390

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.960
 somewhere at a distance of 2 centimeters friend 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.960
 from friend 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:34.480
 set aside now I take some sawdust 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:36.580
 in another bowl and also pour them 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:45.580
 warm with this hot water so that they 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:49.900
 steel warm shed water need 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.300
 good and because cucumbers they love 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.420
 moisture 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:00.070

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.570
 I have such hot sawdust 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:09.130

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.430

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:16.450
 centimeter to a depth of 1 centimeter 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:19.710

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.670
 sawdust pretty hot they 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.440
 cucumber seeds are very warm and 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.770
 cucumbers will ascend faster I think that through 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.170
 three four five days already need to watch 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:42.070
 that's about one centimeter somewhere 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:47.920
 above we are sawdust not just tamping 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:53.430
 so well laid on top all landing 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.360
 cucumber seed on seedlings we have finished 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.820
 I signed 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:04.290
 name cucumber cucumber f1 prima donna 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.290
 I do it on sticky paper 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.280
 and stick the name on our jar 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.280
 so you can know what kind of cucumber 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.100
 Now we send it polyethylene 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:30.310
 the package will now wait when they come up 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:34.350
