but<00:00:44.010> guess<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> shuttered<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.239> mirror

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
but guess what the shuttered and mirror

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.330 
but guess what the shuttered and mirror
flipped<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:46.950> nothing's

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
flipped out of the way but nothing's

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.250 
flipped out of the way but nothing's
happening<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.629> shutter<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.960> still

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
happening right now the shutter is still

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.850 
happening right now the shutter is still
open<00:00:49.850> until<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.910> let<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.570> finger<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
open until I let go of my finger on the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.080 
open until I let go of my finger on the
on<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> shutter<00:00:53.370> release<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.789> what<00:00:53.940> they're

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
on the shutter release so what they're

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
on the shutter release so what they're
telling<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> mirror<00:00:55.140> whatever<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
telling you or the mirror whatever is

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.799 
telling you or the mirror whatever is
working<00:00:56.160> inside<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.760> perfectly<00:00:57.539> sure

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
working inside I'm not perfectly sure

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.599 
working inside I'm not perfectly sure
but<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:58.710> said<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> me<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
but what they said to me is that you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
but what they said to me is that you
take<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> picture<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:00.989> duck<00:01:01.320> out

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
take the picture and then you duck out

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.410 
take the picture and then you duck out
of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.309> silent<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.270> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
of the way to make it more silent or you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.450 
of the way to make it more silent or you
walk<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.170> room<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.650> make<00:01:04.860> sure<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
walk out of the room to make sure that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
walk out of the room to make sure that
nobody<00:01:05.640> hears<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> noise<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.780> problem<00:01:07.590> with

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
nobody hears the noise the problem with

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.370 
nobody hears the noise the problem with
that<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.880> fact<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.659> most<00:01:10.020> noise

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that is the fact that the most noise

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.240 
that is the fact that the most noise
happens<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> beginning<00:01:12.830> that's<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
happens at the beginning that's a lot of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.390 
happens at the beginning that's a lot of
noise<00:01:14.630> that's<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> lot<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.290> noise<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.979> this

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
noise that's not a lot of noise so this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340 
noise that's not a lot of noise so this
kind<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> doesn't<00:01:18.000> make<00:01:18.330> any<00:01:18.659> sense<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.320> me

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
kind of doesn't make any sense to me

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499 
kind of doesn't make any sense to me
what<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> point<00:01:20.549> let's<00:01:21.060> listen<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
what is the point let's listen to it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.859 
what is the point let's listen to it
regular<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.590> regular<00:01:23.340> shutter<00:01:24.299> shutter

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
regular this is regular shutter shutter

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.520 
regular this is regular shutter shutter
mode<00:01:25.909> okay<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.170> thing<00:01:28.409> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
mode okay so it's that one thing of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.010 
mode okay so it's that one thing of
noise<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.000> closes<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:30.960> you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
noise and then it closes and then you

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.899 
noise and then it closes and then you
move<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> next<00:01:31.710> shot<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.310> let's<00:01:32.790> go

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
move on to the next shot and let's go

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
move on to the next shot and let's go
into<00:01:33.090> quiet<00:01:34.820> okay<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> let<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.409> so

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
into quiet okay and then I let it go so

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.249 
into quiet okay and then I let it go so
now<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:38.549> noise<00:01:38.880> happening<00:01:39.259> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
now you have more noise happening the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.390 
now you have more noise happening the
other<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.250> done

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
other one is just you get it done

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
other one is just you get it done
quicker<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.880> when<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.060> get<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> needle

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
quicker it's like when you get a needle

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.690 
quicker it's like when you get a needle
in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> arm<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:43.320> don't<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.740> stab<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.549> with

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
in the arm they don't like stab you with

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910 
in the arm they don't like stab you with
it<00:01:44.759> wait<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> couple<00:01:45.689> seconds<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:46.740> press

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it wait a couple seconds and then press

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.679 
it wait a couple seconds and then press
the<00:01:47.189> plunger<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.939> put<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.540> arm

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the plunger they put it in your arm

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.749 
the plunger they put it in your arm
press<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> plunger<00:01:49.259> take<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> out<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.610> if

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
press the plunger take it out that's if

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.630 
press the plunger take it out that's if
they're<00:01:50.909> good<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.200> think<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.770> point<00:01:53.100> here

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
they're good so I think the point here

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.630 
they're good so I think the point here
is<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.420> fact<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.990> shouldn't<00:01:55.640> motor

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
is the fact that you shouldn't motor

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.240 
is the fact that you shouldn't motor
drive<00:01:57.180> when<00:01:58.020> you're<00:01:58.140> making<00:01:58.619> when<00:01:59.100> you're

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
drive when you're making when you're

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.609 
drive when you're making when you're
taking<00:01:59.549> pictures<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.060> quiet<00:02:00.360> areas<00:02:00.869> pick<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
taking pictures in quiet areas pick and

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260 
taking pictures in quiet areas pick and
choose<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.219> images<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.670> you're<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.149> to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
choose the images that you're going to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.389 
choose the images that you're going to
take<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.960> think<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.500> quiet<00:02:04.890> mode<00:02:05.219> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
take but I think that this quiet mode is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.940 
take but I think that this quiet mode is
a<00:02:05.430> bunch<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.969> bull<00:02:06.270> Archy<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.049> doesn't<00:02:07.710> do

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
a bunch of bull Archy it doesn't do

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.150 
a bunch of bull Archy it doesn't do
anything<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.550> still<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.479> loud<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:10.160> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
anything it's still just as loud as a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
anything it's still just as loud as a
regular<00:02:11.640> shutter<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.120> my<00:02:12.270> opinion<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:12.840> least

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
regular shutter in my opinion at least

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.940 
regular shutter in my opinion at least
with<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.470> da

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
with this da

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.880 
with this da
100<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.690> moral<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> story<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.590> if

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
100 so the moral of the story is if

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.339 
100 so the moral of the story is if
you're<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.220> quiet<00:02:17.430> area<00:02:17.790> take<00:02:18.569> less<00:02:18.870> photos

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
you're in a quiet area take less photos

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.710 
you're in a quiet area take less photos
don't<00:02:19.980> motor<00:02:20.310> drive<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:21.090> become<00:02:21.480> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
don't motor drive so that you become a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.110 
don't motor drive so that you become a
major<00:02:22.260> issue<00:02:22.459> we've<00:02:23.459> seen<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.879> happen

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
major issue we've seen that happen

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.740 
major issue we've seen that happen
before

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
before

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.710 
before
so<00:02:25.260> that's<00:02:25.470> really<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.340> don't<00:02:26.879> get<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.390> but

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
so that's really it I don't get it but

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960 
so that's really it I don't get it but
