00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
the best one so far

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.450 
the best one so far
origins<00:03:51.590> will<00:03:51.710> always<00:03:51.890> have<00:03:52.070> a<00:03:52.100> bit<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.370> a

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
origins will always have a bit of a

sentimental<00:03:53.150> place<00:03:53.420> but<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:53.990> can<00:03:54.320> see<00:03:54.560> that

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
sentimental place but I can see that

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.460 
sentimental place but I can see that
Inquisition<00:03:55.460> is<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:56.180> better<00:03:56.390> game<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.960> just

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
Inquisition is the better game and just

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.560 
Inquisition is the better game and just
probably<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.160> best<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.550> series<00:03:58.700> so<00:03:59.300> as<00:03:59.540> a

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
probably the best in the series so as a

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.630
