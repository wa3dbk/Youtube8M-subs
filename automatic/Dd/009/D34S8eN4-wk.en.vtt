definitely help with battery life so the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.160 
definitely help with battery life so the
next<00:00:49.920> thing<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> disabling<00:00:51.180> Google<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.660> just

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
next thing is disabling Google now just

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.439

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.410 
swipe up to get to Google now and go
into<00:00:54.600> settings<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.640> go<00:00:56.730> ahead<00:00:56.789> disable

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
into settings you can go ahead disable

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.270 
into settings you can go ahead disable
it<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.530> does<00:00:58.649> run<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> background

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it because it does run in the background

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.520 
it because it does run in the background
so<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> does<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.149> resources<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.989> go<00:01:01.410> ahead

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so it does take up resources so go ahead

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.969 
so it does take up resources so go ahead
and<00:01:01.620> disable<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.430> don't<00:01:02.550> use<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
and disable that if you don't use it and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
and disable that if you don't use it and
that<00:01:04.979> should<00:01:05.159> definitely<00:01:05.280> help<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.299> next

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that should definitely help out the next

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.740 
that should definitely help out the next
