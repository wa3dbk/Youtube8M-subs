00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.230
 we continue 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.309
 you were back after a cut 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.200
 commercial in wii without tv we are going to do it 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.960
 when the two recipes we started that 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.710
 it seems by our portobello mushrooms 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.510
 very simple first the most important 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.660
 because I know it is not forgotten is going to be 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.929
 grease our mold and grease very 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.780
 well our refractory does not leave the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.760
 butter over here to me always like 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 I told them I like to have some transit 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.300
 to go throwing the garbage and I can 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.039
 put to avoid having to walk 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.090
 moving us to the boat every 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.770
 let's have it like this I'll leave it here and these 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.570
 portobello mushrooms I already have them 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.629
 washed them and remove the lightning as they 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.379
 I said I can already accommodate them in my 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.379
 fractal time yo 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.210
 I'm going to put some time here so that 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.150
 can see the following procedure 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.900
 What am I going to do? I am going to take my years of 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.030
 portovelo and I'll chop them 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.610
 this is going to get rid of me very easily 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.190
 but we are going to chop as if we were 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.820
 chopping tomato onion checkered 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.220
 little ones 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.890
 although at the time of being them itching 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.040
 they almost come apart in pieces more 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.110
 little ones do not have to have like that the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.360
 exact picture not that we could think 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.190
 which is that they all have to be of 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.470
 same size the squares because 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.170
 posts are ghost or two cocks are not 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.900
 regular are irregularly shaped 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.330
 we have minced this 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.340
 I'm going to put it back to whoever 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.300
 bothered to make it easier at the time 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.300
 to take it to the stop 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.899
 then it seems we're going to the stove 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.259
 with our chopped ingredients I'm going to 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.090
 take the stems of the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.429
 mushrooms the onion the tomato and the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.240
 cilantro which is what I will need and 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.189
 Oil 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.060
 and I already have I'm starting to 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:14.030
 heat my pan I put a splash of 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.550
 oil I am using olive so that 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.140
 no problem if I overdo it 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.110
 contrary , olive oil is very 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.090
 good for your health remember 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.880
 I have told friends that if we are 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.280
 using our good arts of 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.170
 aluminum try not to use for those of 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.420
 aluminum because we can damage them 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.370
 we can scratch me here I have my sticks 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.970
 in wood or at home many people have 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.530
 the plastic pallets do not like these I 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.480
 in this case I like to use those from 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.980
 wood i like a lot 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.500
 I'm waiting here that starts to me 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.360
 heat the oil a little I start to 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.750
 hear that it heats then now 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.550
 yes I will put my onion 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.810
 I always like to start with the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.210
 onion because the onion is the one 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.360
 You need a little more time 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:03.070
 cooking we are waiting for it to be 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.070
 put a little transparent 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.500
 and start taking a transparent color 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.760
 in our onion I will add my 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.209
 years chopped 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.079
 of my portobello mushrooms now I come 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.079
 for my tomato 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.090
 and the long yes 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.519
 you can already see start to see why this 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.590
 recipe is called Portobello mushrooms 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.860
 Mexican because it is that we are 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.060
 studying onion tomatoes and cilantro not 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.890
 like a good Mexican pico de gallo 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.010
 I think that of the most 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.400
 classics is a cock rooster but 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.120
 scrambled with the roosters of mushrooms 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.010
 portobello 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.670
 let's let this cook well 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.690
 but we will take to salpimentar 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.690
 we have our salt 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.980
 pepper black pepper freshly ground 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.960
 freshly ground fresh is always better 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:14.670
 than buying the already milled package 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:17.580
 we are reasoning this does not need much 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.740
 time approximately 23 minutes because 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.500
 Remember that it will take another short time in 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.020
 the oven to melt the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.810
 cheese and will finish cooking these 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.910
 ingredients 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.550
 but if we need at least the 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.250
 onion will remove the strong flavor if 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.840
 we leave it totally fresh is going to have 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.440
 a strong flavor only 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.870
 in what we are ready this I think 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.180
 I'm going to turn it off, I'm going to 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.960
 bring the ports here to see 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.960
 like the fillings 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:55.330
 and once again the cheese better because 

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:58.599
 I'm going to need it right now 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.030
 What am I going to do with this mixture? 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.830
 put 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.570
 over my eyes 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.570
 in the center in you like 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.350
 distributed to all 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:18.680
 how 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.680
 reach for all I have for this 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.199
 I think in this case I'm going to do three 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.379
 mushrooms I'll leave one pending because 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:31.500
 I do not want them to look almost the same 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:33.930
 I'm not going to say one and I used to be a 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.199
 little mix no 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.870
 I want everyone to have enough is 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.630
 that in this case the recipe I 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.699
 had put in cuisine for two 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.440
 people the body I have little but 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.940
 as there were two other eyes that I'm going 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.590
 to take advantage to see if something should 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.139
 When I reach the four 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.639
 I'm here 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:59.380
 and mixtures we can look like nothing 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.290
 I put everything 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.009
 we can not with the case of cheese here 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.620
 is well grated 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.810
 let's put on 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.940
 Well, it's not the champignon, it's true 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.650
 being stirring that like 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.160
 following recipes were mushrooms 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.889
 this is a short veil remember there is 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.949
 many types of mushrooms there in mochis 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.620
 is that the loin portovelo the homo 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.650
 champignon the white is that we know 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.410
 more normally 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.639
 and in this case we are going to cook two types 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.100
 of bombs today 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.640
 we have already then 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.560
 these mushrooms ready I will not put them 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.570
 still baked because right here I'm going to 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.180
 take advantage to put the fungi of the 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.880
 next recipe here I will have 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.400
 ready for the next what do you think 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.780
 so if we go to a commercial cut and 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.080
 we go back to wisin 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.080
 dv 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.300
 in a moment we return
