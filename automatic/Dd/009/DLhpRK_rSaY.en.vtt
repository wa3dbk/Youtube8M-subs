00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.300
 duarte jÃ¡ques knew you want to know 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.790
 if someone is a leader of these 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.070
 inspiring levels that motivate you to move 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.259
 to the world with this what you have to see 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.930
 you have to see the lobes of those eyes 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.750
 this part turns out to be a study 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.029
 what did the leaders inspire 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.070
 they have the lobes slightly 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.890
 asymmetric and those are the typical 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.779
 leaders like mandela that make 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.840
 people abandon their interests 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.540
 for the good of the group according to 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.750
 a study that was made people the 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.270
 adults only see a child can 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.070
 identify if this child is smart 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.620
 or not and we have quite a chance of 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.660
 insert instead if the same person 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.000
 see an adult has less 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.390
 odds of hitting if it is 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.280
 intelligent or not and curiously our 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.730
 Probability rate with a teenager 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.590
 or an elder is 0% or not 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.470
 we are nobody else in a matter of 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.930
 intelligence in these two ages 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.890
 according to a study that was made in germany 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.540
 the best quarterfinals of the nfl are 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.970
 the most beautiful and how did this 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.070
 I study how they got to this point 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.960
 they turned out to be that they grabbed 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.350
 several women from germany who did not have 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.270
 I know nothing of him nfl 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.580
 merge the photos of the players and 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.550
 They told them that ordered the most 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.740
 handsome to the less handsome and it turned out that 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.600
 curiously what they considered 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.990
 what they considered the most 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.260
 handsome were the best players of the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.570
 nfl according to the journal of the chip or sexual and 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.250
 gamer men when they feel 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.950
 attraction or when you find a woman 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.759
 attractive you can hold your gaze 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.979
 on average 8 seconds while it is not 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.650
 attractive they consider it a little 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.440
 graceful can only sustain the 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.200
 4 seconds look a study was done 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.540
 to detect how long it takes people 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.270
 or if we are able to people from 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.149
 detecting a person is psychopath or not 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 and that was done with study with 40 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.430
 people who were 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.510
 and prisons and good it turned out that with so 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.880
 only 5 to 10 seconds the normal person 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.860
 which is able to detect if a person 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.710
 is like a psychopath or that there is not something 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.110
 very well in this person's head and 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.690
 that only with a normal conversation like that 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.150
 that the next time you feel a bad 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.310
 thorn with a person listen to him and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.650
 get away from her according to a study 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.140
 published in the sex medical journal in 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.160
 2011 women who have the lip 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.950
 higher a thick tend to have higher 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.140
 amount of vaginal orgasms that 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.390
 those that have thin lips are 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.150
 found that people with more face 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.340
 wide tend to abuse trust 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.920
 of other people while the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.750
 people tend to trust more in 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.800
 those people who have the most 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.840
 narrow 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.170
 women who do not take pills 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.480
 contraceptives at the moment when 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.720
 they are fertile they walk so 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.220
