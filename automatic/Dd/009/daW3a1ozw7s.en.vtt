00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 you thought you were done with the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.410
 secrets and well think again after 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.769
 several days looking for the slightest 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.230
 little suspicious detail I got to 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.929
 this hypothesis and if the trip in the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.119
 time was present on scenic gta 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.850
 so certainly this new secret solved 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.550
 is not perfect but it's a new 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.150
 on new generation and I hope 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.150
 you will like it 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.070
 our adventure leads us this time 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.829
 far north to palaiseau bay 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.600
 specifically at the entrance to this 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.329
 city ​​is a sign that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.780
 constrain 9 am inside a 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.180
 clock a little detail certainly but who 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 will have a lot of importance by the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.890
 continuation in this same city now 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.460
 there is a pulley factory with a 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.190
 huge chickens at the entrance of it 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.190
 so first question where are 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.399
 chickens at birth in eyes 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.700
 actually this chicken is also facing 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.970
 in the world xi'an it does not remind you anything 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.450
 and yes the fresco of the world chili yade 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.039
 with the broken egg then is this ratio 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.020
 or any chance 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.080
 I'll let you tell me more about it 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.729
 in the comments finally it is 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.800
 written on it is 1917 and that's it 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.360
 our work 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.520
 7:17 pm the time we are going 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.830
 take the train to the trip is ok you 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.099
 are in the blur and reassure you 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.259
 it's normal as if all that was 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:57.619
 just chance behind the machined 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.379
 there is a railroad so is back 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:05.000
 to the future mac fly needs to arrive 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:06.770
 at 88 mph to push his car into the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.440
 time 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.989
 coincidence or not there is at the beginning of the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.050
 park a sign board with writing seventy 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.860
 eight and ten which is good if we 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.140
 adds 88 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.550
 finally if we get on the rails near 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.440
 an electric pole at 19:17 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.800
 exactly a train will come to us 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.800
