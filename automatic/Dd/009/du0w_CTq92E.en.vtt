00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.139 

okay<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.890> new<00:00:02.040> ceramics<00:00:02.610> wanna<00:00:02.820> try

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
okay this is the new ceramics wanna try

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.280 
okay this is the new ceramics wanna try
see<00:00:03.780> if<00:00:03.810> it<00:00:04.020> removes<00:00:04.380> chlorine<00:00:04.980> or<00:00:05.430> chloramine

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
see if it removes chlorine or chloramine

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.780 
see if it removes chlorine or chloramine
this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.589> additive<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.280> would<00:00:08.550> tell<00:00:08.760> us

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
this is the additive that would tell us

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.490 
this is the additive that would tell us
what<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.840> water<00:00:10.019> has<00:00:11.929> if<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.080> has<00:00:13.290> those

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
what the water has if it has those

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
what the water has if it has those
contaminants<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.700> should<00:00:14.880> turn<00:00:15.150> near<00:00:15.389> bot

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
contaminants and I should turn near bot

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.519 
contaminants and I should turn near bot
I<00:00:17.600> think<00:00:18.600> that's<00:00:18.810> enough<00:00:19.550> you<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> yellow

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
I think that's enough you see the yellow

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.359 
I think that's enough you see the yellow
that<00:00:22.529> means<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.980> contains<00:00:25.369> chemicals

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that means it contains chemicals

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.759 
that means it contains chemicals
additives<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.330> chloramine<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.380> yellow

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
additives like chloramine it's yellow

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.859 
additives like chloramine it's yellow
does<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.099> show<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.580> video<00:00:29.699> ghosts<00:00:30.240> as<00:00:30.449> well

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
does it show in the video ghosts as well

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.580 
does it show in the video ghosts as well
do<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.890> see<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.510> it<00:00:33.510> shows<00:00:33.750> over<00:00:33.960> there<00:00:34.200> okay

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
do you see it it shows over there okay

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.940 
do you see it it shows over there okay
now<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.700> tool<00:00:35.940> right<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.800> want

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
now this is the tool right here you want

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
now this is the tool right here you want
to<00:00:38.010> follow<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.309> focus<00:00:38.820> oh<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> tool

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to follow this focus oh this is the tool

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.000 
to follow this focus oh this is the tool
and<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.500> has<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:42.300> ceramics<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and it has the ceramics here but of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.520 
and it has the ceramics here but of
course<00:00:44.250> those<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.940> any<00:00:45.120> ceramics<00:00:45.690> we

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
course those are not any ceramics we

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.110 
course those are not any ceramics we
call<00:00:46.739> them<00:00:46.860> ceramics<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.610> actually<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.090> are

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
call them ceramics but actually they are

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.000 
call them ceramics but actually they are
all<00:00:48.239> minerals<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:51.300> this

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
all minerals and then we put it in this

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.420 
all minerals and then we put it in this
kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.070> tube<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.699> then<00:00:54.530> when<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.710> put<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.129> C

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
kind of tube and then when we put the C

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.240 
kind of tube and then when we put the C
in<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> cup<00:00:57.680> that<00:00:58.680> yellow<00:00:59.070> should

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
in in the cup that yellow should

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.810 
in in the cup that yellow should
disappear<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.090> means<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.780> has<00:01:01.430> attacked<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
disappear that means it has attacked the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.080 
disappear that means it has attacked the
chloramine<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.250> chlorine<00:01:05.640> which<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
chloramine and or the chlorine which is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.090 
chloramine and or the chlorine which is
combination<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.869> chlorine<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.650> ammonia

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
combination of chlorine and ammonia

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.130 
combination of chlorine and ammonia
which<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.400> makes<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.850> chloramine<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
which is makes it chloramine and all the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050 
which is makes it chloramine and all the
chlorine<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.920> should<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.310> clear<00:01:11.820> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
chlorine and this should be clear and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.840 
chlorine and this should be clear and
this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> our<00:01:13.020> test<00:01:13.439> our<00:01:13.680> first<00:01:14.130> test<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.700> this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
this is our test our first test of this

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.590 
this is our test our first test of this
product<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:16.430> we<00:01:17.430> might<00:01:17.670> be<00:01:17.820> manufacturing

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
product that we might be manufacturing

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:33.740 
product that we might be manufacturing
on<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.490> tear<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> up

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.520 

let's<00:01:34.750> see<00:01:34.960> if<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.170> does<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:37.810> 10<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.200> 15

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
let's see if it does it about 10 to 15

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.020 
let's see if it does it about 10 to 15
seconds<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.799> keep<00:01:41.799> on<00:01:41.979> doing<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.490> if<00:01:42.880> it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
seconds and keep on doing it if it

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.149 
seconds and keep on doing it if it
requires<00:01:43.570> very<00:01:43.780> heavy<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.409> might<00:01:44.799> require

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
requires very heavy and might require

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.430 
requires very heavy and might require
more<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.440> just<00:01:47.710> want<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.009> sort<00:01:48.190> all<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.520> it

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
more so I just want to sort all of it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.010 
more so I just want to sort all of it
it's<00:01:50.440> almost<00:01:50.619> like<00:01:50.920> 20<00:01:51.250> seconds<00:01:51.759> or<00:01:51.909> maybe<00:01:52.149> 25

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
it's almost like 20 seconds or maybe 25

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.230 
it's almost like 20 seconds or maybe 25
seconds<00:01:53.530> but<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:54.119> will<00:01:55.119> stop<00:01:55.420> now<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:58.030> did

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
seconds but I will stop now and it did

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.550 
seconds but I will stop now and it did
clear<00:01:58.509> it<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.430> did<00:02:00.640> do<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.060> job<00:02:01.560> this

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
clear it so it did do the job this

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.730 
clear it so it did do the job this
product<00:02:03.250> might<00:02:03.520> replace<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:05.229> carbon

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
product might replace actually carbon

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.790 
product might replace actually carbon
and<00:02:06.179> might<00:02:07.179> be<00:02:07.210> more<00:02:07.420> effective<00:02:07.929> than<00:02:08.170> carbon

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
and might be more effective than carbon

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.250 
and might be more effective than carbon
and<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.660> far<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:12.459> results<00:02:12.610> are<00:02:13.060> excellent<00:02:13.570> it

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
and so far the results are excellent it

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.480 
and so far the results are excellent it
does<00:02:14.560> work<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.300> is
