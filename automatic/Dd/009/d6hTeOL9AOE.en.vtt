00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.320

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.560
 A little of my kitchen I do not have 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.449
 by the kitchen agent maria apartamento e 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.869
 a very small kitchen so there is a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:27.960
 video very small but I hope very much 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:32.520

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.649
 good then so the kitchen was when 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.649
 people arrived here kitchen was ready 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.260
 We made some adjustments, okay? 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.550
 so for example this part here is all 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.890
 open that he asks for 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:53.399
 put this step support 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.230
 So, these are so close and close. 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.350
 because this whole match then opened 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.660
 I was pots is here but I asked for 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.760
 he put this here to post if 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.920
 close put this effect 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.780
 Okay, no, this was an idea I 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 I had afterwards we were adapted and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.420
 It's best to be all right here, Mario. 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:18.390
 normal cabinet closet pick up this part 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.580
 that it was not the father who had nothing and 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.850
 I asked to make this adaptation to the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.850
 new bottles because we pretty much 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.820
 party ' and here with an adaptation also 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.860
 we made this little door to O 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.860
 Hey guys, look how cool this idea is. 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.390
 and it's calls if we only have four is and bag 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.840
 risk 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.450
 from there we just pull and 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.039
 keep the food as it is there 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:58.409
 world is part of the beginning of the film 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:02:01.950
 I like mine another classic movie 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.850
 The film is an aluminum foil and I do 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.239
 It was even the English capital. 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.829
 so here, too, now this 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.470
 low and informal 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.209
 This low part here is just go, no husband. 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.530
 You'll see that it's not good, it 's not tidy. 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.380
 Are you still kidding about something else? 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.329
 we also did this part here 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.280
 was another adaptation also his son 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.370
 look how cool people 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.760
 Oh I asked him to put this support 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.400
 none is to be held when pulling by 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.840
 that part was not that part but 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.510
 I did not have this business to run then 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.389
 I'll get you deep down there and here. 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.579
 Do not just pull and pick up condiments 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.380
 I found it very practical that helped me 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.250
 very very much 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.940

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:02.579
 It's here in the microwave, it's already here. 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:06.299
 it's just the door how much a mouthpiece 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:10.769

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.799
