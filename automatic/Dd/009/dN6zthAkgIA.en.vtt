 the judicial auction was unified in 2007 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.200
 in the bay 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.290
 labor debts and tax foreclosures 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.360
 which were not paid spontaneously

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.080
 money we pay the worker and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.380
 consequently the company benefits 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.500
 also because success reads on sale 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.350
 and meet and cover the total value of the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.820
 there is also a write-off in the process to 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.670

 all employers pay their

 debts without the pressure of justice 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.979
 but if there is only one way to solve this
