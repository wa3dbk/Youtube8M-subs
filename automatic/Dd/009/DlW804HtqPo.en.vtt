00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.819
 here I bring an episode nostalgic and 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.440
 good since you see me a lot with the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.450
 sniper and never usually bring that 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.700
 that this time, I'm going to do another 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.250
 clean with the sniper I do not know if in 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.660
 call of duty 4 says one recently 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.460
 game modes consign themselves well as well 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.000
 how good you want to take a game 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.770
 normal with sniper 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.090
 Well, everything by teams because maybe 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.820
 on Sundays they make it very heavy in this 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.310
 playing so you go for an interest 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.260

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.780

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.860

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.910

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.910

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.360
