00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.790
 I here imagined how in the company 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.190
 matt cuts come up with new headphones 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.140
 then shorter mutim design your favorite 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.630
 Fiver style aha and need so with all 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.200
 driverless platforms are both accurate and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.630
 graves 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.130
 and the microphone will not be seen stupidly hide 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.820
 add vibrations to the bass and 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.980
 Yes, and they will dress in reverse 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.840
 so it happens because all this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.380
 have headphones from maads 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.050
 phreak 4d design and true in their favorite 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.660
 style but what's even stranger dress 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.850
 and vice versa, it would seem 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.370
 fuck people have ears look different 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.100
 Aside this not can be convenient and those 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.620
 no less this is convenient i don't know either 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.260
 why but so much more comfortable they sit 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.239
 visible on the head dudes from bts something 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.739
 there in America know the frame 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 metal and everything else 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 plastic weight loss think 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.250
 it is right no matter what 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.530
 reliable headphones if they are heavy then 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.750
 long time to sit in them will not work as well 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.800
 how 4 dani fluffs such an approach 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.170
 over will not be 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.569
 how much can I sit in them somewhere 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.700
 hours two three without problems sow then 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.509
 other people are already beginning to push 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.420
 which is less 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.179
 headband and ear cushions soft for their shape 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.920
 Well, it's clear that your ear is completely 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.679
 placed in a bowl and to enhance 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.929
 sound insulation made such ear cushions bowls 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.479
 swivel to make it more comfortable to wear on 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.849
 neck you from external noise they cut off 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.979
 as soon as the music starts playing 

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:33.979
 nobody will hide from your music 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:42.450
 control everything on the headphone volume 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.520
 here is the microphone button and here is this two 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.459
 equalizer button it has three modes 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.259
 for games with reinforced bass for 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.630
 conversations with enhanced mean 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.520
 frequencies and for music here sound 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.619
 becomes balanced and more 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.190
 natural the most interesting button 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.800
 button on vevita 4d function it 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.739
 adds vibration to the bass and as soon as 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.869
 you press this button the sound is transformed 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.940
 vibration gives a very cool effect in 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.770
 games and movies feel so much 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.989
 cool thing you don't want 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.690
 turn off if you like e 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.430
 music that I think you will like it too but 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.320
 other genres of music I think this 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.930
 the function will be not so good microphone 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.930
 embedded in the right bowl it does not slide out 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.250
 in space does not look so you can safely 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.010
 walk in them down the street 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.720
 Although with this design in my opinion 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.910
 see him or not he himself is fine 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.040
 picks up the voice but the problem is that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.140
 he is omnidirectional so if in another 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.080
 end of the room talking or don't let 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.480
 god tv your teammates you 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.790
 damn not deprived of these headphones and 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.830
 mobility bundled second wire with 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.930
 volume slider and receive button 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.180
 calls with these headphones want 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.700
 play something big and cool 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.360
 where so many metal clanging explosions and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.880
 etc 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.730
 good option to chop into battles or 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.590
 titanfall and other games sound no worse 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.260
 but I think you understand what I wanted to say 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.450
 By the way in addition to white and black colors have 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.240
 and a special version branded under 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.580
 titanfall looks better than usual 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.830
 in short if not for the design which 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.530
 casual you would not name if not the price 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.900
 which is also not small then headphones 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.050
 themselves very, very cheerfully showed in 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.720
 games and movies just nyashka not want 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.180
 shoot besides this in them and talk 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.489
 you can listen to music and everything for this 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.860
 there is very cool that you don't need any 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.959
 Drivers hooked on yusb and all 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.200
 It works with all platforms 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.120
 by and large it's cool with you 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.950
