00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that as a measurement as well and then

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.060 
that as a measurement as well and then
you<00:00:58.410> need<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.890> strips<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.670> paper<00:01:00.590> I'm<00:01:01.590> just

need<00:01:04.260> some<00:01:04.350> strips<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> paper<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.159> use<00:01:05.489> them

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
need some strips of paper I use them

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.600 
need some strips of paper I use them
about<00:01:05.880> 12<00:01:06.119> centimeters<00:01:06.390> long<00:01:06.840> oh<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:08.280> all

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
about 12 centimeters long oh it's all

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.210 
about 12 centimeters long oh it's all
ribbons<00:01:08.909> obviously<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:11.010> going

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
ribbons obviously and and you get going

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.890 
ribbons obviously and and you get going

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
so these are four of those and I've also

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.899 
so these are four of those and I've also
prepared<00:01:13.290> some<00:01:13.439> tape<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.310> side<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.760> good

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
prepared some tape on this side is good

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.820 
prepared some tape on this side is good
it's<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.210> easier<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.140> start<00:01:16.380> off<00:01:16.530> with

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it's a bit easier so you start off with

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
it's a bit easier so you start off with
taking<00:01:17.189> two<00:01:17.759> pieces<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.409> paper<00:01:20.210> here<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.360> go

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
taking two pieces of paper here we go

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.260 
taking two pieces of paper here we go
and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> cross<00:01:22.409> them<00:01:22.650> over<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.460> put

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and you cross them over like this put

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.730 
and you cross them over like this put
them<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> Middle's<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> cross<00:01:25.229> you

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
them in the Middle's you do a cross you

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.130 
them in the Middle's you do a cross you
want<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> cross<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> middle<00:01:26.729> and

want the cross to be in the middle and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.870 
want the cross to be in the middle and
what<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.520> tuck

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
those around like that and turn it and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.050 
those around like that and turn it and
stick<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.400> place<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.880> where<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
stick it in place now this is where I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.859 
stick it in place now this is where I
think<00:01:36.329> papers

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
think papers

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
think papers
easier<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.680> ribbons<00:01:38.369> prevent<00:01:38.970> symptoms

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
easier in ribbons prevent symptoms

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.780 
easier in ribbons prevent symptoms
warble<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.259> over<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> place<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.130> because

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
warble all over the place just because

going to just add a bit of table of
course

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
course

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.220

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
just to make sure you get right up to

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.440 
just to make sure you get right up to
the<00:02:14.350> edge<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.010> secure<00:02:15.460> it<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.640> bit<00:02:15.850> now<00:02:16.300> like

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
the edge and to secure it a bit now like

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.720 
the edge and to secure it a bit now like
I<00:02:16.540> said<00:02:16.600> paper<00:02:16.930> won't<00:02:17.140> last<00:02:17.350> as<00:02:17.620> long<00:02:17.800> but<00:02:18.130> it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
I said paper won't last as long but it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.980 
I said paper won't last as long but it
still<00:02:18.970> works<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.240> now<00:02:19.360> you've<00:02:19.480> got<00:02:19.630> about<00:02:19.810> that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
still works so now you've got about that

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.590 
still works so now you've got about that
turn<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.590> round<00:02:20.710> again<00:02:20.920> quite<00:02:21.610> your<00:02:21.730> eggs<00:02:21.910> then

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
turn it round again quite your eggs then

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.760 
turn it round again quite your eggs then
you<00:02:22.660> take<00:02:22.840> your<00:02:22.870> contrast<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.440> color<00:02:23.560> often

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
you take your contrast and color often

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.950 
you take your contrast and color often
the<00:02:23.980> same<00:02:24.250> color<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.610> bonus<00:02:24.880> put<00:02:25.600> them<00:02:25.750> at<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
the same color to bonus put them at the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.650 
the same color to bonus put them at the
top<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.770> this<00:02:26.940> now<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.000> important<00:02:28.420> thing<00:02:28.450> is

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
top like this now the important thing is

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.240 
top like this now the important thing is
is<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.050> they<00:02:29.170> don't<00:02:29.350> interfere<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.070> X

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
is that they don't interfere with the X

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.310 
is that they don't interfere with the X
okay<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.660> see<00:02:31.870> they're<00:02:32.020> kind<00:02:32.170> of

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
okay so you can see they're kind of

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.980 
okay so you can see they're kind of
sticking<00:02:32.560> out<00:02:32.740> that<00:02:32.890> way<00:02:33.070> I'm<00:02:33.580> going<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.210> tuck

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
sticking out that way I'm going to tuck

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.310 
sticking out that way I'm going to tuck
this<00:02:35.200> over<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:35.770> this<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.420> tuck<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:37.870> over

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
this over like this and tuck this over

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.090 
this over like this and tuck this over
you<00:02:39.280> see<00:02:39.520> I'm<00:02:40.120> no<00:02:40.690> sorry<00:02:41.050> tuck<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.530> under<00:02:41.830> and

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
you see I'm no sorry tuck it under and

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.540 
you see I'm no sorry tuck it under and
then<00:02:43.030> I'm<00:02:43.150> going<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.300> turn<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.600> all<00:02:43.750> over

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
then I'm going to turn it all over

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.940 
then I'm going to turn it all over
carefully<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:46.350> have<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:48.040> rearrange<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.970> again

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
carefully I have to rearrange it again

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.770 
carefully I have to rearrange it again
so<00:02:50.950> what<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.730> again<00:02:52.030> why<00:02:52.270> find<00:02:52.570> paper

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
so what the this is again why find paper

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.930 
so what the this is again why find paper
easier<00:02:53.290> because<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.220> can<00:02:54.340> make<00:02:54.550> sure<00:02:54.790> it's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
easier because you can make sure it's

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.330 
easier because you can make sure it's
definitely<00:02:55.090> lined<00:02:55.510> up<00:02:55.780> properly<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.410> you

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
definitely lined up properly and you

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.450 
definitely lined up properly and you
take<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.580> down<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.360> it's<00:02:59.110> one<00:02:59.460> and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
take that down like that it's one and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.880 
take that down like that it's one and
make<00:03:00.700> sure<00:03:00.730> it's<00:03:01.060> lined<00:03:01.330> up<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:02.200> we<00:03:02.320> go

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
make sure it's lined up here we go

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.910 
make sure it's lined up here we go
you<00:03:03.730> want<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:03.970> nice<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.150> straight<00:03:04.750> I'm<00:03:05.710> just

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
you want it nice and straight I'm just

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.380 
you want it nice and straight I'm just
looking<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.340> gaps<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.910> see<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.240> it's

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
looking in the gaps to see that it's

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.840 
looking in the gaps to see that it's
lined<00:03:07.570> up<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:08.320> get<00:03:08.470> my<00:03:08.620> bit<00:03:08.800> of<00:03:08.830> tape<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:11.850> stick

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
lined up to get my bit of tape and stick

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.340 
lined up to get my bit of tape and stick
it<00:03:12.970> down<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.330> like<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.600> go<00:03:13.750> too<00:03:13.810> close<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.260> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
it down I like to go too close to the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.930 
it down I like to go too close to the
edge<00:03:14.470> as<00:03:14.500> possible<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.610> make<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.790> extra

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
edge as possible just to make it extra

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.930 
edge as possible just to make it extra
secure<00:03:17.580> okay

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
secure okay

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.220 
secure okay
now<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.840> turn<00:03:19.990> it<00:03:20.140> around<00:03:20.200> again<00:03:20.410> at<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:22.230> and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
now you turn it around again at this and

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.030 
now you turn it around again at this and
you<00:03:23.350> tuck<00:03:23.710> this<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:24.610> there<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.770> tuck

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
you tuck this on there so that you tuck

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.320 
you tuck this on there so that you tuck
that<00:03:27.610> on<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:29.280> then<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.430> flip<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:34.030> then

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
that on that then you flip it and then

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:44.540 
that on that then you flip it and then
