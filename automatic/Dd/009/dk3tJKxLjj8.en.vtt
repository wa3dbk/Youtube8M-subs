pretty odd where's the whole focus the
whole<00:02:45.450> focus<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:46.049> me<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> whole<00:02:46.410> time

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
whole focus is on me the whole time

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.789 
whole focus is on me the whole time
which<00:02:47.099> gives<00:02:47.549> my<00:02:48.180> partner<00:02:48.540> plenty<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.290> time<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
which gives my partner plenty of time to

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.970 
which gives my partner plenty of time to
dot<00:02:50.040> them<00:02:50.250> both<00:02:50.400> up<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.989> zig<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.680> hunter

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
dot them both up and a zig the hunter

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.490 
dot them both up and a zig the hunter
down<00:02:53.129> first<00:02:53.459> since<00:02:53.940> he's<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.569> lot<00:02:54.780> more<00:02:54.930> squishy

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
down first since he's a lot more squishy

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.390 
down first since he's a lot more squishy
than<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.610> death<00:02:56.819> knight<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:58.400> was

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
than the death knight and that was

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.750 
than the death knight and that was
pretty<00:02:59.760> damn<00:02:59.970> easy<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:01.160> hope<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.340> guys<00:03:02.459> enjoyed
