 bumper is one of the optically important 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.300
 car parts which makes it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.250
 completed which emphasizes 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.460
 lines in the end which does 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.439
 beautiful car but after all 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 crash and at high speeds first 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:32.579
 all that suffers car bumper 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:34.920
 let's talk on this topic did not want a bumper 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.590
 this is the most vulnerable part of the car and its 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.160
 need to protect only the question of how and what 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.680
 quite right 99 percent of all 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.590
 car gets bumper damage 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.289
 we are not talking about the crash namely small 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.539
 scratch stones or small 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.010
 any dents them here but there are 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.079
 great way out namely this 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.910
 anti-gravel damaged film 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.800
 venture shield if this film 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.050
 installed on the bumper bypass all 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.120
 troubles you can forget besides 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.519
 there are lots of other benefits 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.409
 the film is completely transparent and thanks 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.299
 patterns that go millimeter in 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.360
 millimeter it does not violate the aesthetics 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.299
 bumper and completely invisible on it all 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.850
 the film does not fade and if you allow 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.250
 your hood is not covered and the bumper is covered 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.680
 after 5 years you remove the film of the difference in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.119

 the film is more yellow and ultraviolet 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.920
 the most important thing does not protect at all 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.420
 painted parts of the vehicle and 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.829
