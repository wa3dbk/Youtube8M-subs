00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
underwater and they were using things

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.350 
underwater and they were using things

and things like that in order to do

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.930 
and things like that in order to do
those<00:00:39.620> what<00:00:40.220> you<00:00:40.340> have<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:40.489> do<00:00:40.610> is<00:00:40.699> you<00:00:40.760> have<00:00:40.850> to

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
those what you have to do is you have to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.430 
those what you have to do is you have to
come<00:00:41.090> up<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.269> like<00:00:41.390> a<00:00:41.540> wall<00:00:41.870> let<00:00:42.170> me<00:00:42.230> see<00:00:42.350> if<00:00:42.410> I

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
come up to like a wall let me see if I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.540 
come up to like a wall let me see if I
can<00:00:42.559> find<00:00:42.649> a<00:00:42.770> wall<00:00:42.950> here<00:00:43.160> really<00:00:43.309> quick

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
can find a wall here really quick

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.310 
can find a wall here really quick
hopefully<00:00:44.149> I<00:00:44.210> don't<00:00:44.270> die<00:00:44.540> just<00:00:44.960> trying<00:00:45.170> to

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
hopefully I don't die just trying to

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.920 
hopefully I don't die just trying to
breathe<00:00:45.680> underwater<00:00:45.950> here<00:00:46.630> but<00:00:47.630> if<00:00:47.719> we<00:00:47.780> come

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
breathe underwater here but if we come

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.450 
breathe underwater here but if we come
up<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.200> wall<00:00:48.530> or<00:00:48.800> something<00:00:49.130> here<00:00:49.250> with<00:00:49.370> the

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
up to a wall or something here with the

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.520 
up to a wall or something here with the
torch<00:00:49.730> obviously<00:00:50.630> if<00:00:50.690> I<00:00:50.750> set<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.050> down<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:51.380> can

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
torch obviously if I set it down you can

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.630 
torch obviously if I set it down you can
see<00:00:51.649> that<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:51.829> makes<00:00:51.950> a<00:00:52.010> little<00:00:52.219> pocket<00:00:52.370> of

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
see that it makes a little pocket of

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.549 
see that it makes a little pocket of
water<00:00:52.820> it'll<00:00:53.420> break<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:53.870> off<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:54.170> then<00:00:54.290> I<00:00:54.379> can

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
water it'll break it off and then I can

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.470 
water it'll break it off and then I can
keep<00:00:54.680> moving<00:00:54.890> underwater<00:00:55.329> however<00:00:56.329> that's

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
keep moving underwater however that's

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.940 
keep moving underwater however that's
not<00:00:56.600> really<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.079> most<00:00:57.170> convenient<00:00:57.680> way<00:00:57.920> to

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
not really the most convenient way to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.380 
not really the most convenient way to
breathe<00:00:58.250> underwater<00:00:58.550> right<00:00:59.000> like<00:00:59.149> there's<00:00:59.329> a

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
breathe underwater right like there's a

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.630 
breathe underwater right like there's a
lot<00:00:59.570> more<00:00:59.920> convenient<00:01:00.920> ways<00:01:01.250> to<00:01:01.489> breathe

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
lot more convenient ways to breathe

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.069 
lot more convenient ways to breathe
underwater<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.480> way<00:01:02.629> is<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:02.840> use<00:01:02.960> a

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
underwater and that way is to use a

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.210 
underwater and that way is to use a
bucket<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:03.680> if<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:03.800> just<00:01:03.920> have<00:01:04.070> an<00:01:04.129> empty

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
bucket so if you just have an empty

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.249 
bucket so if you just have an empty
bucket<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.820> you<00:01:04.879> just<00:01:05.089> click<00:01:05.630> anywhere<00:01:06.110> in

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
bucket and you just click anywhere in

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.600 
bucket and you just click anywhere in
the<00:01:06.289> water<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.800> can<00:01:06.979> see<00:01:07.130> there<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.369> get<00:01:07.520> an

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
the water you can see there you get an

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.910 
the water you can see there you get an
instant<00:01:08.030> bubble<00:01:08.450> of<00:01:08.570> air<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.080> now<00:01:09.680> obviously

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
instant bubble of air and now obviously

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.620 
instant bubble of air and now obviously
you<00:01:10.280> can<00:01:10.430> keep<00:01:10.610> moving<00:01:10.880> along<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.330> you<00:01:11.390> can<00:01:11.420> go

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
you can keep moving along and you can go

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.060 
you can keep moving along and you can go
all<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.930> way<00:01:12.020> across<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.500> ocean<00:01:12.530> using<00:01:12.979> this

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
all the way across the ocean using this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.309 
all the way across the ocean using this
technique<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.670> don't<00:01:14.660> need<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.869> be<00:01:14.959> next<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.289> a

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
technique you don't need to be next to a

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.410 
technique you don't need to be next to a
wall<00:01:15.679> or<00:01:16.130> anything<00:01:16.700> like<00:01:16.910> that<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.149> just<00:01:17.300> be

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
wall or anything like that you just be

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.309 
wall or anything like that you just be
right<00:01:17.569> here<00:01:17.720> in<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.869> middle<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.170> ocean

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
right here in the middle of the ocean

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:19.870 
right here in the middle of the ocean
then<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:18.709> can<00:01:18.830> just<00:01:18.950> empty<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.399> bucket<00:01:19.789> on

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
then you can just empty the bucket on

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.669 
then you can just empty the bucket on
any<00:01:20.569> surface<00:01:21.080> obviously<00:01:21.470> because<00:01:21.619> you're

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
any surface obviously because you're

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:22.690 
any surface obviously because you're
underwater<00:01:22.039> it<00:01:22.220> doesn't<00:01:22.399> really<00:01:22.520> matter

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
underwater it doesn't really matter

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.340 
underwater it doesn't really matter
where<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.000> put<00:01:23.209> it<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.810> can<00:01:24.050> just<00:01:24.200> keep

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
where you put it and you can just keep

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.690 
where you put it and you can just keep
on<00:01:24.500> walking<00:01:24.709> obviously<00:01:25.250> it's<00:01:25.340> pretty<00:01:25.369> dark

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
on walking obviously it's pretty dark

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.760 
on walking obviously it's pretty dark
underwater<00:01:26.149> because<00:01:26.479> I<00:01:26.539> am<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:27.110> guess<00:01:27.590> what

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
underwater because I am I guess what

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.529 
underwater because I am I guess what
underwater<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:28.789> anyway<00:01:29.090> if<00:01:29.179> I<00:01:29.240> just<00:01:29.390> keep

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
underwater so anyway if I just keep

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.120 
underwater so anyway if I just keep

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.680 
you can see we are almost to the other
side<00:01:40.280> we<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:40.700> walked<00:01:40.940> all<00:01:41.209> the<00:01:41.330> way<00:01:41.420> across

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
side we just walked all the way across

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.839 
side we just walked all the way across
the<00:01:41.959> ocean<00:01:41.990> there's<00:01:42.979> my<00:01:43.220> house<00:01:43.429> over<00:01:43.759> there

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
the ocean there's my house over there

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.040 
the ocean there's my house over there
and<00:01:44.030> it's<00:01:44.119> probably<00:01:44.209> not<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.479> ocean<00:01:44.690> like

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
and it's probably not the ocean like

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.930 
and it's probably not the ocean like
this<00:01:45.170> little<00:01:45.349> Lake<00:01:45.560> Pend<00:01:45.920> River<00:01:46.340> thing<00:01:46.729> and

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
this little Lake Pend River thing and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.059 
this little Lake Pend River thing and
we're<00:01:47.479> now<00:01:47.690> across<00:01:48.080> and<00:01:48.470> we<00:01:48.649> are<00:01:48.770> good<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.039> go

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
we're now across and we are good to go

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.710 
we're now across and we are good to go
so<00:01:49.399> anyway<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:49.819> can<00:01:49.910> use<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:50.479> little

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
so anyway you can use this little

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.020 
so anyway you can use this little
breathing<00:01:51.649> underwater<00:01:51.979> tip<00:01:52.489> in<00:01:52.610> your<00:01:52.640> world

breathing underwater tip in your world

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.339 
breathing underwater tip in your world
especially<00:01:53.360> like<00:01:53.630> an<00:01:53.750> Hunger<00:01:54.050> Games<00:01:54.229> and

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 
especially like an Hunger Games and

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:55.630 
especially like an Hunger Games and
stuff<00:01:54.530> like<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.830> is<00:01:54.920> where<00:01:55.069> I<00:01:55.099> use<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.459> a<00:01:55.520> lot
