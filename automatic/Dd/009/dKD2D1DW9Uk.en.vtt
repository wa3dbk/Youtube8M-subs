00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
level this year I think and don't like I

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.329 
level this year I think and don't like I
say<00:00:53.870> it's<00:00:53.989> only<00:00:54.140> two<00:00:54.320> weeks<00:00:54.350> away<00:00:54.679> and<00:00:54.799> symptom

say it's only two weeks away and symptom

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.160 
say it's only two weeks away and symptom
relief<00:00:55.489> as<00:00:55.699> well<00:00:55.850> that's<00:00:56.000> plain<00:00:56.239> but<00:00:56.479> they

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
relief as well that's plain but they

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.020 
relief as well that's plain but they
will<00:00:57.350> looking<00:00:58.280> forward<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.670> challenge

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
will looking forward to the challenge

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.060 
will looking forward to the challenge
and<00:00:59.119> no<00:00:59.780> it's<00:00:59.960> a<00:01:00.049> big<00:01:00.199> gaming<00:01:00.469> a<00:01:00.530> sense<00:01:00.829> they're

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
and no it's a big gaming a sense they're

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.999 
and no it's a big gaming a sense they're
not<00:01:01.420> no<00:01:02.420> fair<00:01:02.600> way<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:02.750> kick<00:01:03.049> it<00:01:03.109> off<00:01:03.229> we're

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
not no fair way to kick it off we're

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.410 
not no fair way to kick it off we're
going<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.220> say<00:01:04.339> with<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.549> one-time<00:01:05.119> winner<00:01:05.239> all

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
going to say with a one-time winner all

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.179 
going to say with a one-time winner all
the<00:01:05.449> trophies<00:01:05.659> I<00:01:06.380> don't<00:01:06.950> think<00:01:07.009> it's

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
the trophies I don't think it's

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.950 
the trophies I don't think it's
unrealistic<00:01:07.490> for<00:01:08.119> us<00:01:08.390> because<00:01:08.630> I<00:01:08.720> think<00:01:08.899> we

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
unrealistic for us because I think we

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.020 
unrealistic for us because I think we
can't<00:01:09.140> do<00:01:09.289> it<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.399> obviously<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.880> gun

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
can't do it so and obviously the gun

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.399 
can't do it so and obviously the gun
fires<00:01:11.270> in<00:01:11.450> me<00:01:11.539> when<00:01:11.689> they'll<00:01:11.840> fall<00:01:12.110> in<00:01:12.140> at<00:01:12.350> the

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
fires in me when they'll fall in at the

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.740 
fires in me when they'll fall in at the
last<00:01:12.500> hurdle<00:01:12.679> sways<00:01:13.039> the<00:01:13.069> last<00:01:13.429> two<00:01:13.580> years

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
last hurdle sways the last two years

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.690 
last hurdle sways the last two years
maybe<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.899> man<00:01:15.049> wanna<00:01:15.200> think<00:01:15.409> hopefully<00:01:16.310> it's

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
maybe the man wanna think hopefully it's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.730 
maybe the man wanna think hopefully it's
you<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.420> learn<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.659> little<00:01:17.960> bit<00:01:18.080> more<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.590> you

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
you you learn a little bit more in you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.520 
you you learn a little bit more in you
