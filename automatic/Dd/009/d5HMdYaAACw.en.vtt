00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
through so now I'm going to hold my

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
through so now I'm going to hold my
knitting<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.079> little<00:01:40.290> more<00:01:40.439> naturally<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
knitting a little more naturally so you

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
knitting a little more naturally so you
can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.090> looks<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.540> me<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.960> how<00:01:45.960> fast

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
can see how it looks to me and how fast

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.590 
can see how it looks to me and how fast
it<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:49.560> knit<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:50.970> I'm<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.270> even

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
it is to knit and that's I'm not even

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.899 
it is to knit and that's I'm not even
going<00:01:51.840> particularly<00:01:52.200> fast<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:53.040> hopefully

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
going particularly fast but hopefully

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
going particularly fast but hopefully
you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> sense<00:01:54.659> they're<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.350> it's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you can get a sense they're just it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.490 
you can get a sense they're just it's
just<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:56.189> small<00:01:56.430> movements<00:01:57.200> which<00:01:58.200> means

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
just really small movements which means

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
just really small movements which means
you're<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.920> doing<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.310> whole<00:01:59.520> lot<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.790> screwing

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
you're not doing a whole lot of screwing

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.319 
you're not doing a whole lot of screwing
around<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.890> wrapping<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.219> unwrapping<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
around with wrapping and unwrapping and

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.499 
around with wrapping and unwrapping and
etc<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.469> again<00:02:05.090> one<00:02:06.090> more<00:02:06.240> time

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
etc so again one more time

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.770 
etc so again one more time
front<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.560> back<00:02:07.849> there's<00:02:08.849> Monica<00:02:09.149> if<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.599> saw

just pick up that yarn and pull it
through<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.410> loop<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.290> position

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
through the loop now this is a position

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.740 
through the loop now this is a position
I'd<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.550> knit<00:02:20.820> with<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.150> yarn<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.600> the
