number two let's go ahead and unbox the
monster<00:01:44.820> water<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.970> in<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.180> box

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.260 

then<00:01:58.770> mini<00:01:58.950> figure<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.610> right<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.820> this

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
then mini figure out all right so this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.389 
then mini figure out all right so this
one<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.780> almost<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.100> same<00:02:03.680> except<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:05.100> one

one is almost the same except this one
is<00:02:05.640> different<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.719> doesn't<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
