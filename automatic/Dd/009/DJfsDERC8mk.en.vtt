00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.170
 to the brave guys and girls I'm 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:10.419
 here again and good 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.009
 today I bring a video that really no no 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:15.160
 I knew what video to do because good 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.370
 I was between one another but good 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.410
 in the end I decided and good as today is 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.990
 my birthday 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.510
 You can decide to make a cake 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.140
 microwave that maybe some already 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.450
 you have seen through other channels or me that 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.360
 I know by some page and well already this 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.740
 I saw a video of a boy doing 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.750
 this cake and I thought 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.970
 super good idea because I to do 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.090
 things 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.740
 in the oven and that's never like I'm doing well 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 so it's super easy my sister 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.750
 and I do it many times and good that 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 I hope you like the video and now 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.110
 let's move on to the ingredients good 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.720
 The first thing we are going to use is a 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.720
 cup or a bowl so deep is worth 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.100
 you can use the one that gives you the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.560
 win to me it seems much more comfortable 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.010
 use a container so deep does not 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.380
 I'm doing much better and good that you can 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.590
 do in any in any one is left 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.770
 well I use this but good and good 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.670
 this second thing that we are going to use 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.670
 It is an egg 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.840
 the next thing that we're going to use 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.350
 the oil you can use corn oil 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.240
 like sunflower oil worth can not be 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.189
 use olive oil so good 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.189
 one of the two milk 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.120
 to sugar 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.470
 the following nesquik squid power 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.740
 you can use any type of 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.600
 chocolate that you want me what I know I'm going to 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.970
 use the nesquik because I like the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.980
 flavor you can use any 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.630
 chocolate powder that pleases you 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.840
 ok and good this last 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.590
 let's use flour that add up to normal 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.940
 ok I use this that is flour for 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.830
 sponge cake is worth it and I like it very much 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.100
 because it is I come with the yeast 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.800
 incorporated so it's much more comfortable 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.700
 and I like it a lot more but if not 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.700
 you have this flour we are going to use 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.700
 wheat flour and baking powder 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.390
 and finally to decorate I have chosen 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.370
 nothing you can use anything and in 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.900
 this case has used cream and 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.159
 colored noodles that I love and 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.989
 good as all are already 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.590
 ingredients let's start making the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.590
 Biscuit 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.940
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.430
 catch an egg and what we are going to do is 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.170
 break it and what we're going to do is 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.170
 beat it very very well 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.560
 when we have it super smoothie 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.220
 to take the oil we are going to take a 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.220
 tablespoon 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.230
 and the next thing we're going to do is 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.349
 take the milk and take two tablespoons of 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.349
 milk 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.170
 and we beat 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.980
 when we have it super smoothie we are going to 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.980
 take two tablespoons of sugar 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.910
 Now let's add 2 tablespoon of 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.350
 nesquik remember that you can use 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.690
 any type of chocolate 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.690
 and we're going to mix super good 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.510
 Mix until you can not more 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.670
 good when we have it super mixed 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.950
 let's add 2 tablespoons of flour yo 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.780
 I recommend that you use flour to 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.239
 biscuit because it is super more 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.010
 spongy and I do not know I like it 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:24.380
 much more and we mix again and in 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.900
 this part you have to mix a lot 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.120
 so that lumps do not form because 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.230
 first lumps are formed but then if 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.940
 mixes quite well since they already fall apart 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.460
 and it does not have to be 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.310
 well of liquid and we will take it to the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.080
 microwave for two minutes and sometimes 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.080
 of 22 minutes or 3 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:04.750
 well then let it sit for 2 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.360
 minutes and then we're going to take out the cake or 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.110
 the cake and we're going to put it in a 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.290
 dish then to decorate then for 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.730
 decorating I was going to use cream but I 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.250
 I was left with nothing so I'm going to throw 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.700
 icing sugar and I'll take noodles 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.700
 colors 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.870
 and you can decorate it as you wish 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.990
 It's super super good, I like it 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.290
 a lot and good that that is super 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.290
 good 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.580
 and here the video as you see the 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.950
 Sponge cake is super super easy to make 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.510
 is super super good and good that 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.040
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.040

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.349

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:20.810
