00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
been collaborating from the start really

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.590 
been collaborating from the start really
i<00:00:16.310> think<00:00:17.310> pop-up<00:00:17.850> shops<00:00:18.060> are<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.180> clever

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
i think pop-up shops are really clever

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.450 
i think pop-up shops are really clever
because<00:00:18.779> if<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.410> sort<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.650> suddenly<00:00:20.039> appear

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
because if you sort of suddenly appear

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
because if you sort of suddenly appear
somewhere<00:00:20.820> you'll<00:00:21.180> catch<00:00:21.359> somebody's<00:00:21.779> eye

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
somewhere you'll catch somebody's eye

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.630 
somewhere you'll catch somebody's eye
and<00:00:22.289> then<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> creates<00:00:22.800> new<00:00:23.130> interest<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and then it creates new interest for the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.980 
and then it creates new interest for the
brand<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.939> an<00:00:24.029> area<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.300> perhaps<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.689> work

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
before that could be translated online

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.470 
before that could be translated online
afterwards<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.320> creates<00:00:28.650> Brent<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.480> was

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
