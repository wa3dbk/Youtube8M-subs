 done does not seem to dance is the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.489
 symbolism of how important it is to 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.480
 we women sure of each other 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.170
 same 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.909

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.159
 of life that in this great track of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.640
 dance that is the world we can feel 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.939

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.459

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.179
 to achieve the success with which 

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:26.929
 we have always dreamed friend the subject of 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:30.030
 Women especially women entrepreneurs 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:33.209
 is very fashionable but the question that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.539
 we should do is because in full 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:39.629
 21st century some sectors question 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.179
 what the woman is capable of doing and not 

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:44.219
 make the reality that is that we 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.819
 we have so much capacity to 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.739
 perform in the business world 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.799
 as in all areas of our 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.629
 lives starting from this premise we have 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.359
 to see that those famous and 

00:01:54.629 --> 00:02:01.229
 pre-granted myths are already part of the 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:03.689
 past we have fought and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.270
 We have to proudly say that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.500
 we have won 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.879
 Now what is important is to talk about 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.420
 our realities as safe women 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:19.970
 generous independent balanced 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.000
 businesswomen and warriors of life we go 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.940
 to focus on this step for us 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.879
 and how we have to work on everything 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.540
 if we have to play several roles to 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:35.989
 the time without losing the passion attention 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.260
 and the responsibility towards each of 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.099
 they always remember women do not stop 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.099
 to dance
