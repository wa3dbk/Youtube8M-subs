it was like 1099 there and then the
other<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.370> got<00:00:59.670> from<00:01:00.239> CVS<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.320> was<00:01:01.469> like

other one I got from CVS and it was like
10<00:01:01.890> 49<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.270> depends<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> store<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
10 49 so it just depends on the store so

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960 
10 49 so it just depends on the store so

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.270 
then a lighter pink one but I don't
think<00:03:43.930> I'll<00:03:44.110> be<00:03:44.230> picking<00:03:44.440> those<00:03:44.680> colors<00:03:45.070> up

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
think I'll be picking those colors up

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.790 
think I'll be picking those colors up
because<00:03:45.760> if<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.330> peach<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:46.810> dark<00:03:47.050> mean<00:03:47.380> coral

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
because if this peach is dark mean coral

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.830 
because if this peach is dark mean coral
I<00:03:47.920> keep<00:03:48.160> saying<00:03:48.520> peachy<00:03:48.820> but<00:03:49.060> it's<00:03:49.240> coral<00:03:49.600> if

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
I keep saying peachy but it's coral if

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.650 
I keep saying peachy but it's coral if
this<00:03:50.200> coral<00:03:50.590> one<00:03:50.860> looks<00:03:51.460> darker<00:03:52.090> in<00:03:52.360> the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
this coral one looks darker in the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.210 
this coral one looks darker in the
packaging<00:03:53.140> than<00:03:53.320> those<00:03:53.470> other<00:03:53.710> two<00:03:53.980> then

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
packaging than those other two then

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.980 
packaging than those other two then
those<00:03:54.430> other<00:03:54.670> two<00:03:54.910> would<00:03:55.120> definitely<00:03:55.750> not

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
those other two would definitely not

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.740 
those other two would definitely not
work<00:03:56.200> as<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.470> blush<00:03:56.860> for<00:03:57.040> me<00:03:57.190> maybe<00:03:57.850> if<00:03:58.300> I<00:03:58.450> was<00:03:58.630> in

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
work as a blush for me maybe if I was in

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.360 
work as a blush for me maybe if I was in
the<00:03:58.870> market<00:03:59.200> for<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.410> highlighting<00:04:00.010> powder<00:04:00.220> I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
the market for a highlighting powder I

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.220 
the market for a highlighting powder I
would<00:04:00.490> pick<00:04:00.880> up<00:04:01.030> one<00:04:01.270> of<00:04:01.390> those<00:04:01.540> too<00:04:01.870> because

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
would pick up one of those too because

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.650 
would pick up one of those too because
I'm<00:04:02.860> definitely<00:04:03.130> sure<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.580> those<00:04:03.790> will<00:04:04.390> show

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
I'm definitely sure that those will show

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.570 
I'm definitely sure that those will show
up<00:04:04.780> more<00:04:05.110> as<00:04:05.290> highlighters<00:04:05.890> on<00:04:06.070> my<00:04:06.250> skintone

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
up more as highlighters on my skintone

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.180 
up more as highlighters on my skintone
but<00:04:07.020> definitely<00:04:08.020> for<00:04:08.290> darker<00:04:08.650> skin<00:04:08.950> tones

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
but definitely for darker skin tones

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.130 
but definitely for darker skin tones
like<00:04:09.520> mine<00:04:09.790> or<00:04:09.820> even<00:04:10.510> darker<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:10.960> would

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
like mine or even darker I would

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.710 
like mine or even darker I would
recommend<00:04:11.710> the<00:04:12.190> mob<00:04:12.880> shade<00:04:13.240> because<00:04:13.600> it

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
recommend the mob shade because it

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.680 
recommend the mob shade because it
really<00:04:14.020> does<00:04:14.230> show<00:04:14.530> up<00:04:14.740> like<00:04:15.400> POW<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:16.450> it

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
really does show up like POW like it

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.979 
really does show up like POW like it
just<00:04:16.989> gives<00:04:17.230> your<00:04:17.410> cheeks<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.220> nice<00:04:18.660> flush<00:04:19.660> and

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
just gives your cheeks a nice flush and

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.570 
just gives your cheeks a nice flush and
plus<00:04:20.230> it<00:04:20.380> highlights<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.130> look<00:04:21.250> it's<00:04:21.460> a

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
plus it highlights and look it's a

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.730 
plus it highlights and look it's a
little<00:04:21.850> bit<00:04:21.970> shimmery<00:04:22.240> but<00:04:22.990> for<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.320> lighter

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
little bit shimmery but for the lighter

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.230 
little bit shimmery but for the lighter
colors<00:04:24.220> if<00:04:24.400> you're<00:04:24.550> in<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.760> market<00:04:24.880> for<00:04:25.180> a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
colors if you're in the market for a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.060 
colors if you're in the market for a
highlighter<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:25.990> also<00:04:26.230> works

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
highlighter this also works

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.220 
highlighter this also works
and<00:04:27.160> it<00:04:27.490> gives<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.790> that<00:04:28.000> nice<00:04:28.270> highlighted

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
and it gives you that nice highlighted

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.340 
and it gives you that nice highlighted
glow<00:04:29.620> on<00:04:29.800> your<00:04:29.980> face<00:04:30.310> but<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:31.180> think<00:04:31.840> that<00:04:32.050> the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
glow on your face but I think that the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.220 
glow on your face but I think that the
coral<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.430> rose<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.300> then<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.600> lighter<00:04:34.840> pink

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
coral the rose and then the lighter pink

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.160 
coral the rose and then the lighter pink
are<00:04:35.470> more<00:04:36.220> suited<00:04:36.820> for<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.210> lighter<00:04:37.660> skin

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
are more suited for the lighter skin

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.410 
are more suited for the lighter skin
tone<00:04:38.200> people<00:04:38.800> if<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.640> want<00:04:39.820> to<00:04:39.880> use<00:04:40.030> them<00:04:40.240> as<00:04:40.390> a

tone people if you want to use them as a

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.870 
tone people if you want to use them as a
blush<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:41.230> I<00:04:41.530> guess<00:04:42.190> that's<00:04:42.400> what<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.550> think

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880
