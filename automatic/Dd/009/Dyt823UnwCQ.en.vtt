rapid fire attachment adds a little bit
of<00:01:30.600> recoil<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.259> makes<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> gun<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> little<00:01:31.860> less

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
of recoil and makes it gun a little less

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.620 
of recoil and makes it gun a little less
accurate<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.470> yeah<00:01:34.470> um<00:01:35.180> another<00:01:36.180> thing<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.479> want

never use it again I mean I don't know I

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.910 
never use it again I mean I don't know I
might<00:01:51.570> slap<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> few<00:01:52.290> once<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> while

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
might slap it on a few once in a while

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.550 
might slap it on a few once in a while
but<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.630> seems<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.229> hit<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.470> miss

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
but it just seems like it's hit or miss

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.649 
but it just seems like it's hit or miss
on<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.250> map<00:01:56.490> depending<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.390> where<00:01:57.540> they

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
on this map depending on where they

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.270 
on this map depending on where they
swollen<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.380> spawn<00:01:58.619> over<00:01:58.950> here

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
swollen like if they spawn over here

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.249 
swollen like if they spawn over here
like<00:01:59.640> somewhere<00:02:00.149> outside<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.840> yeah<00:02:01.079> you're

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
like somewhere outside then yeah you're

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.550 
like somewhere outside then yeah you're
good<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:02.570> there's<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:04.079> one<00:02:04.380> big

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
good but there's just like one big

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.230

building<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.250> Windows<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.939> can't

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
building with Windows that you can't

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.119 
building with Windows that you can't
squeeze<00:02:06.479> squeeze<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.320> Reaper<00:02:07.680> missiles<00:02:08.009> in

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
squeeze squeeze the Reaper missiles in

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.880 
squeeze squeeze the Reaper missiles in
so<00:02:08.399> i<00:02:08.970> don't<00:02:09.780> recommend<00:02:10.020> using<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.470> Reaper<00:02:10.830> on

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so i don't recommend using the Reaper on

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.690 
so i don't recommend using the Reaper on
this<00:02:11.099> map

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
this map

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.510 
this map
and<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.660> really<00:02:12.930> don't<00:02:13.050> recommend<00:02:13.410> using<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:14.160> lot

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
and I really don't recommend using a lot

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.150 
and I really don't recommend using a lot

in<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.669> recent<00:04:37.000> patch<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.300> couple<00:04:37.600> days<00:04:37.720> ago<00:04:37.750> i

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
in a recent patch a couple days ago i

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.529 
in a recent patch a couple days ago i
think<00:04:39.100> was<00:04:39.190> four<00:04:39.370> or<00:04:39.400> five<00:04:39.550> days<00:04:39.729> ago<00:04:39.910> i'm<00:04:40.360> not

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
think was four or five days ago i'm not

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.960 
think was four or five days ago i'm not
sure<00:04:40.660> exactly<00:04:40.750> what<00:04:41.199> day<00:04:41.350> but<00:04:41.680> they<00:04:42.250> made<00:04:42.430> made

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
sure exactly what day but they made made

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.400 
sure exactly what day but they made made
it<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.389> dog<00:04:43.630> tags<00:04:43.870> disappeared

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
it so that the dog tags disappeared

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.020 
it so that the dog tags disappeared
really<00:04:44.680> quick<00:04:44.919> i<00:04:45.130> was<00:04:45.280> just<00:04:45.400> killing<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:45.880> bunch

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
really quick i was just killing a bunch

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.469 
really quick i was just killing a bunch
of<00:04:46.150> guys<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.690> i<00:04:47.590> would<00:04:48.430> wait<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.880> couple<00:04:49.090> i

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
of guys and i would wait a couple i

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.170 
of guys and i would wait a couple i
would<00:04:49.750> wait<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:49.960> good<00:04:50.199> I<00:04:50.470> don't<00:04:51.280> know<00:04:51.340> 10

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
would wait a good I don't know 10

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.480 
would wait a good I don't know 10
seconds<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:52.810> they<00:04:53.530> were<00:04:53.590> gone<00:04:53.860> by<00:04:54.130> then<00:04:54.310> I

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
seconds and they were gone by then I

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.950 
seconds and they were gone by then I
think<00:04:54.759> that's<00:04:54.910> how<00:04:55.060> long<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.509> takes<00:04:55.750> for<00:04:55.870> them

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
think that's how long it takes for them

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.560 
think that's how long it takes for them
to<00:04:56.020> disappear<00:04:56.380> now<00:04:56.800> 10<00:04:57.070> seconds<00:04:57.550> so<00:04:57.759> I<00:04:57.940> mean

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
to disappear now 10 seconds so I mean

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.060 
to disappear now 10 seconds so I mean
you<00:04:58.840> want<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.080> give<00:04:59.199> it<00:04:59.289> a<00:04:59.349> couple<00:04:59.530> seconds

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
you want to give it a couple seconds

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.529 
you want to give it a couple seconds
before<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.580> just<00:05:00.789> run<00:05:00.970> straight<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.270> it

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
before you just run straight to it

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.839 
before you just run straight to it
especially<00:05:01.720> if<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.410> know<00:05:02.560> there's<00:05:03.520> other

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
especially if you know there's other

especially if you know there's other
people<00:05:04.330> around<00:05:04.449> i<00:05:04.900> know<00:05:04.960> i<00:05:05.110> mentioned<00:05:05.590> this<00:05:05.650> in

here<00:05:12.940> it's<00:05:13.150> a<00:05:13.930> from<00:05:14.740> here<00:05:14.889> i<00:05:14.919> think<00:05:15.400> i<00:05:15.430> only<00:05:15.610> got

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
here it's a from here i think i only got

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.900 
here it's a from here i think i only got
like<00:05:15.880> four<00:05:16.180> or<00:05:16.270> five<00:05:16.300> more<00:05:16.630> kills<00:05:16.930> um<00:05:17.759> but<00:05:18.759> yeah

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
like four or five more kills um but yeah

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.360 
like four or five more kills um but yeah
once<00:05:19.180> again<00:05:19.449> just<00:05:19.930> to<00:05:19.990> read<00:05:20.229> reinstate<00:05:21.039> what<00:05:21.340> I

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
once again just to read reinstate what I

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.879 
once again just to read reinstate what I
said<00:05:21.669> before<00:05:21.820> using<00:05:22.630> my<00:05:22.840> entire<00:05:23.169> surroundings

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
said before using my entire surroundings

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.310 
said before using my entire surroundings
as<00:05:24.039> cover<00:05:24.340> look<00:05:25.120> this<00:05:25.419> corner<00:05:25.810> right<00:05:25.930> here<00:05:25.990> is

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
as cover look this corner right here is

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.520 
as cover look this corner right here is
perfect<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.130> this<00:05:28.030> spot<00:05:28.360> up<00:05:28.630> on<00:05:28.990> on<00:05:29.229> top<00:05:29.380> of

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
perfect and this spot up on on top of

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.379 
perfect and this spot up on on top of
this<00:05:29.590> escalator<00:05:30.190> is<00:05:30.370> really<00:05:30.699> good<00:05:30.880> because

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
this escalator is really good because

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.779 
this escalator is really good because
you<00:05:32.020> have<00:05:32.139> a<00:05:32.169> high<00:05:32.409> vantage<00:05:32.710> point<00:05:33.159> which

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
you have a high vantage point which

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.610 
you have a high vantage point which
means<00:05:34.060> that<00:05:34.270> you're<00:05:34.690> shooting<00:05:34.870> down<00:05:35.199> on<00:05:35.409> them

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
means that you're shooting down on them

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.159 
means that you're shooting down on them
and<00:05:35.940> they<00:05:36.940> have<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.180> shoot<00:05:37.389> up<00:05:37.599> at<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.930> and

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
and they have to shoot up at you and

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.350 
and they have to shoot up at you and
it's<00:05:38.349> always<00:05:38.590> easier<00:05:39.070> to<00:05:39.130> shoot<00:05:39.430> down<00:05:39.669> you

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
it's always easier to shoot down you

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.210 
it's always easier to shoot down you
have<00:05:40.479> a<00:05:40.510> much<00:05:40.810> better<00:05:40.990> angle<00:05:41.560> and<00:05:41.770> much<00:05:42.039> better

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
have a much better angle and much better

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.159 
have a much better angle and much better
chance<00:05:42.520> of<00:05:42.729> getting<00:05:42.789> the<00:05:43.090> kill<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.510> not<00:05:43.870> dying

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
chance of getting the kill and not dying

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.700 
chance of getting the kill and not dying
so<00:05:44.530> whenever<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.460> can<00:05:45.699> i<00:05:46.000> would<00:05:46.330> suggest<00:05:46.710> try

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
so whenever you can i would suggest try

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.890 
so whenever you can i would suggest try
to<00:05:47.770> get<00:05:47.979> an<00:05:48.099> upper<00:05:48.430> upwards<00:05:48.940> angle<00:05:49.389> on<00:05:49.539> someone

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
to get an upper upwards angle on someone

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.260 
to get an upper upwards angle on someone
when<00:05:50.680> you<00:05:50.800> have<00:05:50.949> a<00:05:50.979> kind<00:05:51.520> of<00:05:51.639> sloped<00:05:51.909> hill
