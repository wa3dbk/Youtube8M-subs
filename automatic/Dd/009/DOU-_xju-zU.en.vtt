00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
thing is is that the information we have

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.700 
thing is is that the information we have
supersedes<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.049> lot<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> other

get<00:03:30.850> hooked<00:03:31.120> these<00:03:31.540> energies<00:03:32.080> they're

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
get hooked these energies they're

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.259 
get hooked these energies they're
they're<00:03:32.739> more<00:03:32.890> like<00:03:33.070> parasites<00:03:33.670> and

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
they're more like parasites and

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.840 
they're more like parasites and
predators<00:03:35.049> basically<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.519> pretty<00:03:36.730> much

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
predators basically it's pretty much

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.360 
predators basically it's pretty much
what<00:03:36.910> our<00:03:37.209> government<00:03:37.360> is<00:03:37.720> too<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:38.350> they<00:03:38.560> it's

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
what our government is too so they it's

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.520 
what our government is too so they it's
like<00:03:39.610> like<00:03:39.850> mine<00:03:40.180> do<00:03:40.630> they<00:03:40.750> try<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.049> reach<00:03:41.320> out

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
like like mine do they try to reach out

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.759 
like like mine do they try to reach out
to<00:03:41.680> us<00:03:41.769> oh<00:03:42.480> definitely<00:03:43.480> then<00:03:43.930> there's<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.440> mass

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
right now and they are clean out the

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.580 
right now and they are clean out the
regenerative<00:03:52.060> teas<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.780> they're<00:03:52.900> also<00:03:53.080> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
regenerative teas and they're also the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.220 
regenerative teas and they're also the

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
and they can't maintain it because the

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:06.870 
and they can't maintain it because the
earth<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.160> going<00:04:06.489> through

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
earth is going through

of where we're going to be seeing it

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.380 
of where we're going to be seeing it
it's<00:04:22.480> going<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.720> go<00:04:22.870> on<00:04:22.900> until<00:04:23.550> 2016<00:04:24.550> it's<00:04:24.970> part

of<00:04:25.510> this<00:04:25.720> ship<00:04:26.050> whenever<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.740> increase<00:04:27.310> the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
of this ship whenever you increase the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.450 
of this ship whenever you increase the
energies<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.180> bring<00:04:28.480> you<00:04:29.260> know<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.680> huge<00:04:30.160> surge

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
energies and bring you know a huge surge

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.580 
energies and bring you know a huge surge
of<00:04:30.640> energy<00:04:30.760> into<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.480> system<00:04:31.990> there's<00:04:32.380> going<00:04:32.530> to

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
of energy into a system there's going to

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.070 
of energy into a system there's going to
be<00:04:32.650> chaos<00:04:33.100> for<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.430> little<00:04:33.520> while<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.660> then<00:04:34.720> it

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
be chaos for a little while and then it

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.990 
be chaos for a little while and then it
moves<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.560> next<00:04:35.650> level<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.700> search

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
moves to the next level and you search

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.760 
moves to the next level and you search
it<00:04:37.210> again<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.140> chaos<00:04:38.380> that

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
it again and you have chaos that

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.290 
it again and you have chaos that
improves<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.280> next<00:04:39.580> level<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:39.940> what<00:04:39.970> do<00:04:40.240> you

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
improves the next level is what do you

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.600 
improves the next level is what do you
suspect<00:04:40.510> will<00:04:41.020> happen<00:04:41.410> specifically<00:04:42.370> in<00:04:42.550> the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
suspect will happen specifically in the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.910 
suspect will happen specifically in the
next<00:04:42.880> two<00:04:42.970> months<00:04:43.210> well<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:44.200> kind<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.710> see

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
next two months well I kind of see

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.470 
next two months well I kind of see
between<00:04:45.340> now<00:04:45.580> and<00:04:46.680> march<00:04:47.680> i<00:04:48.070> think<00:04:48.460> March<00:04:48.820> we

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
between now and march i think March we

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.500 
between now and march i think March we
are<00:04:49.860> hopefully<00:04:50.860> have<00:04:51.730> a<00:04:51.760> peaceful<00:04:52.360> transition

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
are hopefully have a peaceful transition

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.350 
are hopefully have a peaceful transition
but<00:04:53.290> I<00:04:53.320> kind<00:04:53.920> of<00:04:54.010> see<00:04:54.190> America<00:04:54.910> going<00:04:55.180> through

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
but I kind of see America going through

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.470 
but I kind of see America going through
