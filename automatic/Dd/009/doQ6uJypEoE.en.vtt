00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
bring their voices up to where you can

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.440

actually<00:01:56.590> fucking<00:01:56.920> hear<00:01:57.219> them<00:01:57.429> and<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:58.329> know

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
actually fucking hear them and you know

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.969 
actually fucking hear them and you know
maybe<00:01:58.659> change<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.140> voice<00:01:59.320> is<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.590> little<00:01:59.649> bit

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
maybe change the voice is a little bit

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.380 
maybe change the voice is a little bit

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
so all the characters kind of have their

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.959 
so all the characters kind of have their
own<00:02:01.450> identifiable<00:02:02.409> voice<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:03.729> you're<00:02:03.880> not

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
own identifiable voice so you're not

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
characters on screen they have the same

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.150 
characters on screen they have the same
voice<00:02:07.319> there<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:08.590> know<00:02:08.830> you're<00:02:09.069> getting

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160

for the first time and chocolate rain
here<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:20.920> mean<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.550> at<00:03:21.730> this<00:03:21.850> point<00:03:21.940> you

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
here but I mean do at this point you

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.960 
here but I mean do at this point you
didn't<00:03:22.900> even<00:03:23.050> have<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> name<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:24.640> was<00:03:24.850> just

like and that's the green elite neighbor
and<00:03:28.230> it's<00:03:29.230> surprising<00:03:29.800> because<00:03:29.860> do<00:03:30.250> is<00:03:30.430> in

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580
