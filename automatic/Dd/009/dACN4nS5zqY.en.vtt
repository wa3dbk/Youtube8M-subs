00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
you know I honestly feel like it was

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.309 
you know I honestly feel like it was
sort<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.180> test<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:29.080> know<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:30.840> actually<00:02:31.840> liked

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
sort of a test you know I actually liked

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.670 
sort of a test you know I actually liked
it<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.860> thought<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.370> helped<00:02:33.580> me<00:02:33.790> slow<00:02:34.150> down<00:02:34.680> and

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
it I thought it helped me slow down and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.470 
it I thought it helped me slow down and
think<00:02:35.709> about<00:02:36.099> every<00:02:36.670> bite<00:02:36.879> instead<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.360> just

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
think about every bite instead of just

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.420 
think about every bite instead of just
devouring<00:02:38.049> it<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.440> then<00:02:38.590> realizing<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.280> was

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
devouring it and then realizing it was

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.559 
devouring it and then realizing it was
gone

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
gone

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.780

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.920 
so I really enjoyed it and it brought

much as I like eating food so I like
together<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:56.049> know<00:02:56.170> it's<00:02:56.799> hard<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:56.950> separate

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
together you know it's hard to separate

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:07.410 
together you know it's hard to separate
them<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:05.680> know<00:03:05.769> how<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.010> story<00:03:07.000> goes<00:03:07.390> he

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
them you know how the story goes he

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.080 
them you know how the story goes he
started<00:03:08.170> eating<00:03:08.410> breakfast<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.340> silence<00:03:09.849> I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
started eating breakfast in silence I

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.759 
started eating breakfast in silence I
think<00:03:10.120> eating<00:03:10.540> breakfast<00:03:11.140> would<00:03:11.319> be<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.500> little

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
think eating breakfast would be a little

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.400 
think eating breakfast would be a little
bit<00:03:11.860> more<00:03:12.099> of<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:13.180> know<00:03:13.299> stepping<00:03:13.750> stone<00:03:14.170> as

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
bit more of a you know stepping stone as

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.680 
bit more of a you know stepping stone as
opposed<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:14.920> four<00:03:15.190> course<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:16.239> know<00:03:16.329> meal

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
opposed to a four course you know meal

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:30.430 
opposed to a four course you know meal
at<00:03:17.049> home

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.480 

since<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.530> came<00:03:31.680> back<00:03:31.830> from<00:03:31.920> India<00:03:32.070> which<00:03:32.340> was

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
since I came back from India which was

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.690 
since I came back from India which was
eight<00:03:33.030> years<00:03:33.060> ago<00:03:33.830> I've<00:03:34.830> always<00:03:35.100> been<00:03:35.490> looking

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
eight years ago I've always been looking

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.680 
eight years ago I've always been looking
for<00:03:36.030> ways<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.180> incorporate<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:38.450> things<00:03:39.450> I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
for ways to incorporate the things I

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.190 
for ways to incorporate the things I
learned<00:03:39.960> and<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.620> ways<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.520> was<00:03:41.660> being<00:03:42.660> there

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
learned and the ways I was being there

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.490 
learned and the ways I was being there
into<00:03:43.980> American<00:03:44.820> life<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.180> it's<00:03:45.320> damn<00:03:46.320> near

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
into American life and it's damn near

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.280 
into American life and it's damn near
impossible<00:03:46.530> but<00:03:47.660> I'm<00:03:48.660> glad<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.050> have<00:03:49.110> found

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
impossible but I'm glad to have found

00:03:49.290 --> 00:04:00.980 
impossible but I'm glad to have found
this<00:03:49.440> at<00:03:50.370> least<00:03:50.520> smaller<00:03:51.000> integration<00:03:59.990> it's

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
this at least smaller integration it's

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.260 
this at least smaller integration it's
like<00:04:01.250> when<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.310> take<00:04:02.490> a<00:04:02.550> piece<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:03.060> lettuce

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
like when you take a piece of lettuce

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
like when you take a piece of lettuce
and<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.020> put<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.320> against<00:04:04.770> your<00:04:04.890> lips<00:04:05.040> there<00:04:05.850> a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
and you put it against your lips there a

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.320 
and you put it against your lips there a
an<00:04:07.290> incredible<00:04:07.800> number<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:08.120> sensations<00:04:09.120> going

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
an incredible number of sensations going

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.070 
an incredible number of sensations going
on<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.510> we're<00:04:09.630> not<00:04:09.690> paying<00:04:09.870> any<00:04:10.020> attention

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
on that we're not paying any attention

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.460 
on that we're not paying any attention
to<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.740> I<00:04:10.800> think<00:04:10.980> that's<00:04:11.870> just<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:13.020> microcosm

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
to and I think that's just a microcosm

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.400 
to and I think that's just a microcosm
of<00:04:13.680> our<00:04:13.800> entire<00:04:14.040> experience<00:04:14.220> in<00:04:14.790> which<00:04:14.940> our

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
of our entire experience in which our

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.960 
of our entire experience in which our
perception<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.560> our<00:04:16.709> consciousness<00:04:17.609> are

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
perception in our consciousness are

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.740 
perception in our consciousness are
always<00:04:18.950> confronting<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.580> world<00:04:20.609> with<00:04:21.180> the

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
always confronting the world with the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.450 
always confronting the world with the
five<00:04:21.930> faculties<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.530> senses<00:04:22.950> plus<00:04:23.250> the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
five faculties of the senses plus the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.230 
five faculties of the senses plus the
mental<00:04:23.910> activity<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:25.010> to<00:04:26.010> actually<00:04:26.940> have<00:04:27.120> an

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
mental activity and to actually have an

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.770 
mental activity and to actually have an
opportunity<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:29.040> engage<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:30.210> explore

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
opportunity to so engage that to explore

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.070 
opportunity to so engage that to explore
that<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.320> just<00:04:32.100> be<00:04:32.340> with<00:04:32.550> that<00:04:32.730> is<00:04:33.300> really<00:04:33.840> rare

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
that to just be with that is really rare

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.800 
that to just be with that is really rare
and<00:04:34.110> it's<00:04:34.410> definitely<00:04:34.880> not<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.060> most<00:04:36.090> present

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
and it's definitely not the most present

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.850 
and it's definitely not the most present
thing<00:04:36.960> when<00:04:37.110> you're<00:04:37.230> sitting<00:04:37.500> watching<00:04:37.650> TV

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
thing when you're sitting watching TV

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.580 
thing when you're sitting watching TV
because
