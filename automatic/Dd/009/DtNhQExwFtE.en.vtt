now<00:00:04.980> many<00:00:05.160> people<00:00:05.250> ask<00:00:05.640> me<00:00:05.819> what's<00:00:06.090> the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
now many people ask me what's the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.299 
now many people ask me what's the
difference<00:00:06.390> between<00:00:06.779> mind<00:00:07.590> mapping<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:08.040> paper

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
difference between mind mapping on paper

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.880 
difference between mind mapping on paper
and<00:00:08.820> line<00:00:09.000> mapping<00:00:09.360> on<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> computer<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.590> I

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:10.890 
and line mapping on a computer and I

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.520 
and line mapping on a computer and I
think<00:00:11.130> one<00:00:11.670> has<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:12.050> understand<00:00:13.050> that<00:00:13.200> both

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
think one has to understand that both

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.429 
think one has to understand that both
have<00:00:13.940> their<00:00:14.940> their<00:00:15.269> positives<00:00:15.840> and<00:00:16.109> it's

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
have their their positives and it's

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.560 
have their their positives and it's
using<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.400> right<00:00:17.580> tool<00:00:17.849> at<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> right<00:00:18.180> time

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
using the right tool at the right time

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.600 
using the right tool at the right time
which<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> most<00:00:19.080> important<00:00:19.710> thing<00:00:19.890> now

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
which is the most important thing now

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.200 
which is the most important thing now
computers<00:00:21.600> are<00:00:21.770> brilliant<00:00:22.770> in<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.029> we<00:00:24.029> have

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
computers are brilliant in that we have

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.300 
computers are brilliant in that we have
a<00:00:24.240> never-ending<00:00:24.630> piece<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.230> paper<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.010> go

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
a never-ending piece of paper we can go

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.370 
a never-ending piece of paper we can go
back<00:00:26.520> we<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.730> edit<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.449> change<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.350> can

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
back we can edit we can change we can

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.710 
back we can edit we can change we can
link<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.189> other<00:00:29.220> pieces<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.760> information<00:00:29.939> we

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
link to other pieces of information we

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.410 
link to other pieces of information we
can<00:00:30.900> add<00:00:31.230> underlying<00:00:32.039> notes<00:00:32.489> images<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
can add underlying notes images of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.809 
can add underlying notes images of
videos<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.019> sounds<00:00:34.409> to<00:00:34.469> branches<00:00:35.069> so<00:00:35.280> it

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:35.819 
videos and sounds to branches so it

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:38.540 
videos and sounds to branches so it
gives<00:00:36.300> us<00:00:36.479> almost<00:00:37.260> another<00:00:37.769> dimension<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
gives us almost another dimension to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.250 
gives us almost another dimension to
mind<00:00:38.729> that<00:00:38.969> thing<00:00:39.179> but<00:00:39.479> sometimes<00:00:39.960> when<00:00:40.229> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
mind that thing but sometimes when you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.689 
mind that thing but sometimes when you
just<00:00:40.499> need<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.799> mind<00:00:41.039> map<00:00:41.190> things<00:00:41.460> very

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
just need to mind map things very

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.610 
just need to mind map things very
quickly<00:00:41.909> let's<00:00:42.749> say<00:00:42.899> you're<00:00:43.049> not<00:00:43.139> in<00:00:43.319> front<00:00:43.499> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
quickly let's say you're not in front of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.619 
quickly let's say you're not in front of
your<00:00:43.769> computer<00:00:43.889> or<00:00:44.489> you're<00:00:44.639> traveling<00:00:44.969> or

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
your computer or you're traveling or

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.139 
your computer or you're traveling or
you're<00:00:45.870> talking<00:00:46.109> to<00:00:46.530> somebody<00:00:46.739> else<00:00:47.149> paper

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you're talking to somebody else paper

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.000 
you're talking to somebody else paper
based<00:00:48.420> mind<00:00:48.659> mapping<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.139> be<00:00:49.260> very<00:00:49.739> effective

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
based mind mapping can be very effective

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.349 
based mind mapping can be very effective
and<00:00:50.719> one<00:00:51.719> thing<00:00:51.959> that<00:00:52.139> we<00:00:52.260> always<00:00:53.030> make<00:00:54.030> people

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
and one thing that we always make people

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.509 
and one thing that we always make people
aware<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.959> that<00:00:55.219> never<00:00:56.219> allow<00:00:56.459> the

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
aware of is that never allow the

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.279 
aware of is that never allow the
computer<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.059> become<00:00:57.389> a<00:00:57.420> barrier<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.109> if

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
computer to become a barrier so if

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.719 
computer to become a barrier so if
you're<00:00:58.649> having<00:00:58.889> a<00:00:59.039> conversation<00:00:59.369> with

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
you're having a conversation with

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.419 
you're having a conversation with
somebody<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.409> you<00:01:01.409> want<00:01:01.619> to<00:01:01.739> mind<00:01:02.010> map<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
somebody and you want to mind map that

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.210 
somebody and you want to mind map that
conversation<00:01:03.209> having<00:01:03.779> a<00:01:03.929> computer<00:01:04.650> screen<00:01:04.979> in

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
conversation having a computer screen in

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.880 
conversation having a computer screen in
front<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.850> laptop<00:01:06.539> that's<00:01:06.810> open<00:01:07.320> often

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
front of you a laptop that's open often

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.859 
front of you a laptop that's open often
becomes<00:01:08.219> a<00:01:08.369> barrier<00:01:08.789> so<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.659> situation

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
becomes a barrier so in that situation

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
becomes a barrier so in that situation
where<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> communication<00:01:11.219> is<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.490> important

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
where the communication is so important

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.230 
where the communication is so important
capture<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.079> on<00:01:13.170> paper<00:01:13.469> first<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.969> then

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
capture it on paper first but and then

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
capture it on paper first but and then
move<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.719> to<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:15.990> computer<00:01:16.530> afterwards<00:01:17.070> so

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
move it to the computer afterwards so

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.099 
move it to the computer afterwards so
it's<00:01:17.640> using<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:18.359> tool<00:01:18.719> at<00:01:18.929> the<00:01:19.079> right

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
it's using the right tool at the right

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's using the right tool at the right
time

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

why is iMac different than than other

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.529 
why is iMac different than than other
thinking<00:01:22.710> software<00:01:23.130> tools<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.939> different

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
thinking software tools it's different

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.959 
thinking software tools it's different
because<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.350> technology<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.399> doesn't<00:01:26.700> get

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
because it's technology that doesn't get
