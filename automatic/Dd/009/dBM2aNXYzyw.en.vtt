00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.650
 the marigold is a delicious flowering plant 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.740
 that with its colors and solar can 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.259
 brighten up our balcony or terrace 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.060
 It is an easy plant to cultivate with 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.380
 prolonged blooms from the summer 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.880
 autumn 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.820
 let us see together the care he has 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.190
 need once you have bought the seedlings 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.860
 generally found in nursery gardones 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.230
 in the spring we're going to bounce them in 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.540
 larger size base e 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.030
 we fill the pot with the soil 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.700
 specific for the blue plants and flowers 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.940
 man thor fi where previously we have 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.530
 put on the bottom of the expanded clay for 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.530
 precisely to avoid waterlogging 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.899
 then we help each other with lady teramano 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.820
 we supply holes more or less than 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.750
 dimension of the pal and of earth of the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.600
 seedlings that we are going to transplant 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.719
 and in this case we have chosen three 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:12.460
 different colors depending on the taste of 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:12.460
 everyone and let's go to position in the vase 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:27.909
 we cover with high soil le 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.909
 seedlings 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:02:01.520
 we wait water to encourage 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.790
 the rooting of seedlings treat 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.730
 the ground and the seedlings with the gateau 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.160
 specialty based on seaweed in 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.350
 this way we will therefore favor 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.580
 the rooting of the seedlings in the vase 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.660
 and growth in the early stages 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.850
 vegetative we dilute the content the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.190
 dosage indicated on the label in water 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.610
 to count the solutions points we find the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.610
 ground 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.910
 we are going to place the marigold in a 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.160
 corner of the balcony of the terrace 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.730
 sunny also bears the sun 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.830
 direct 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.500
 possibly we choose a corner 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.230
 sheltered from currents and wind 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.020
 maybe we put the vase near the wall 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.019
 in case of poor light the plant 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.560
 the flowers will not have an optimal development 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.209
 they will have bright colors they ca n't stand 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.180
 temperatures below 10 degrees 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.830
 remove high temperatures instead 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.380
 let's remember these plants anyway 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.380
 they are grown as annuals then in 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.380
 general after autumn tend to 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.510
 drying very important for irrigation 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.540
 as the marigold despite having a certain 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.610
 drought and resistance moments 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.459
 summer heat instead is a land 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.530
 fresh and offense daily 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.080
 it is therefore advisable to keep the ground 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.780
 slightly damp between an irrigation e 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.280
 the next 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.560
 avoid when the call to wet 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.900
 the leaves we also avoid the ponds of 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.870
 water in the saucer because they can 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.790
 lead to the development of and rot the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.190
 little dog is a plant that needs 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.120
 nutrients to promote growth and 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.090
 enhances beauty and flowering is 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.489
 very important and provide them and through 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.430
 we can do the fertilization with the 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:54.410
 large green liquid fertilizer for plants 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.020
 flower diluting the dose of half a cap 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:02.140
 measuring cup in a liter 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.140
 and a half of water here is the solution 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.400
 we find the tender in the ground or 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.500
 wishing we can also nebulize with 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.030
 a sprayer on the leaves 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.030
 or we can also use the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.730
 fertilizer in powder soluble geraniums and per 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.500
 geraniums and flowering plants of the line 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.260
 water-soluble in this way yes 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.910
 provide the necessary elements 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.460
 avoiding the appearance of yellowing 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.100
 foliar also in the case of use 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.470
 of the soluble powder just dilute with 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.790
 the content of the measuring cup at 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.450
 dosage is shown on the label in 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.850
 water and spray the soil into the plant 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.160
 3 parasites the marigold suffers the attack 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.480
 infections of the aphids in general 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.090
 they start in spring 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.810
 therefore it is advisable to check often 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.660
 plants and when we notice that presence 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.150
 we can see the insects below 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.310
 the leaves near the flowers or near the ai 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.470
 buds these you entrust what they do 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.660
 suck gives sap and make the plant 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.460
 sticky following the issue of 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.500
 honeydew they produce during precisely 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.950
 to bites in the presence of these 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.720
 annoying insects we use the 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.730
 ready to use insecticide c for 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.460
 very easy block therefore use why 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.590
 it is already diluted to always have 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.810
 beautiful plants and stimulate the emission 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.710
 always with new flowers we will go to 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.230
 eliminate the flowers as and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.260
 the leaves stand out and now a curiosity 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.990
 of tagetes and is rubbed or broken 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.730
 year not of gold and very pungent and for 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.440
 some even unpleasant for this 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.780
 reason the plant is also known with the 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.780
 common name of puzzola or stink li na
