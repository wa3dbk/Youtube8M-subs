was in the dinghy when we got one of the
drops<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.280> see<00:01:23.549> we've<00:01:23.729> got<00:01:23.850> four

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
drops as you can see we've got four

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.499 
drops as you can see we've got four
items<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.150> four

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
items or you will see in one of the four

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.039 
items or you will see in one of the four
items<00:01:27.740> he<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.909> gave<00:01:30.299> away<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.630> bit

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
items he was in it so we gave away a bit

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.760 
items he was in it so we gave away a bit
but<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.670> our<00:01:32.820> own<00:01:32.970> money<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:34.350> yeah<00:01:34.590> but

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
but like from our own money but yeah but

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.440 
but like from our own money but yeah but
that<00:01:35.159> would<00:01:35.310> affect<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> price<00:01:35.850> check<00:01:36.150> due<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that would affect the price check due to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.490 
that would affect the price check due to
the<00:01:36.540> fact<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.990> were<00:01:37.079> doing<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the fact that we were doing it for the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.410 
the fact that we were doing it for the
Serie<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> series<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.909> want<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> item

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
Serie is in the series we want the item

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420 
Serie is in the series we want the item
so<00:01:39.960> he<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.229> basically<00:01:40.380> gave<00:01:40.740> him<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.189> money

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
so he just basically gave him some money

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
so he just basically gave him some money
to<00:01:41.610> compensate<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> split<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:42.960> gave

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to compensate for the split so we gave

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.020 
to compensate for the split so we gave
him<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> splits<00:01:43.710> worth<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.250> cash<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:44.850> our

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
him the splits worth in cash from our

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.170 
him the splits worth in cash from our
own<00:01:45.590> banks<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.680> guess<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.759> price<00:01:47.970> check

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
own banks I guess so the price check

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.969 
own banks I guess so the price check
which<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.689> will<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.020> four<00:01:49.380> hundred

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
which you see will be the four hundred

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859 
which you see will be the four hundred
kills<00:01:50.189> ya<00:01:50.759> next<00:01:51.000> act<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.270> worth<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.570> that's<00:01:51.750> all

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
kills ya next act is worth it that's all

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.870 
kills ya next act is worth it that's all
we<00:01:52.110> really<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> say<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.250> 100<00:01:53.640> kills

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
we really have to say we got 100 kills

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.770 
we really have to say we got 100 kills
we<00:01:54.090> thought<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> nice<00:01:54.630> round<00:01:54.930> number<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
we thought was a nice round number and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.270 
we thought was a nice round number and
we<00:01:57.780> weren't<00:01:58.079> sure<00:01:58.409> we<00:01:58.799> weren't<00:01:58.979> really

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
we weren't sure we weren't really

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.480 
we weren't sure we weren't really
confident<00:02:00.030> we'd<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.479> any<00:02:00.630> hex<00:02:00.960> items<00:02:01.490> but

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
confident we'd get any hex items but

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.190 
confident we'd get any hex items but
thankfully<00:02:03.060> we've<00:02:03.210> got<00:02:03.329> four<00:02:03.570> items<00:02:03.780> which

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
thankfully we've got four items which

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.350 
thankfully we've got four items which
should<00:02:04.439> give<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> reasonable<00:02:05.219> idea<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
should give you a reasonable idea as to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.699 
should give you a reasonable idea as to
how<00:02:06.780> much<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.079> expect<00:02:09.170> 400<00:02:10.170> hundred<00:02:10.319> neck

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
how much you can expect 400 hundred neck

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.369 
how much you can expect 400 hundred neck
skills<00:02:11.039> because<00:02:11.910> even<00:02:12.810> though<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:12.989> got<00:02:13.140> four

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
skills because even though we got four

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.760 
skills because even though we got four
items

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
items

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.340 
items
I<00:02:13.860> believe<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> bit<00:02:14.910> luckier<00:02:15.750> than<00:02:15.780> average

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
I believe is a bit luckier than average

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.220 
I believe is a bit luckier than average
very<00:02:16.980> slightly<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:18.600> items<00:02:19.020> weren't

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
very slightly the items weren't

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.440 
very slightly the items weren't
massively<00:02:19.980> expensive<00:02:20.580> or<00:02:20.880> anything<00:02:21.240> they

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
massively expensive or anything they

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.270 
massively expensive or anything they
want<00:02:21.630> lettuce<00:02:21.870> ones<00:02:22.170> or<00:02:22.320> anything<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.890> can

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
want lettuce ones or anything as you can

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.060 
want lettuce ones or anything as you can
see<00:02:23.490> so<00:02:24.210> they<00:02:24.990> would<00:02:25.350> give<00:02:25.500> much<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.620> room

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
see so they would give much more room

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.030 
see so they would give much more room
for<00:02:26.580> profit<00:02:26.820> as<00:02:27.150> well<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.620> could<00:02:28.800> get

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
for profit as well as you could get

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.150 
for profit as well as you could get
cheaper<00:02:29.340> items<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.760> guess<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.660> know<00:02:31.160> okay

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
cheaper items I guess but you know okay

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.310 
cheaper items I guess but you know okay
guys<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.640> are<00:02:32.760> two<00:02:32.940> pros<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.420> apparently<00:02:33.930> we

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
hey guys this is everything we got so we

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.010 
hey guys this is everything we got so we
countered<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:48.090> looked<00:02:48.360> through<00:02:48.540> every<00:02:48.870> single

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
countered we looked through every single

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.560 
countered we looked through every single
clip<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.680> every<00:02:50.010> single<00:02:50.190> kill<00:02:50.550> we<00:02:50.700> got<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.540> we

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
clip of every single kill we got and we

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.360 
clip of every single kill we got and we
counted<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.140> extremely<00:02:52.560> accurately<00:02:53.130> there

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
counted this extremely accurately there

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.610 
counted this extremely accurately there
shouldn't<00:02:53.610> be<00:02:53.640> any<00:02:53.880> mistakes<00:02:54.300> whatsoever

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
shouldn't be any mistakes whatsoever

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.890 
shouldn't be any mistakes whatsoever
yeah<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.520> exactly<00:02:57.030> everything<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.720> got

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
yeah this is exactly everything we got

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.180 
yeah this is exactly everything we got
also<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:59.280> took<00:02:59.310> away<00:02:59.760> some<00:03:00.030> stuff<00:03:00.380> when<00:03:01.380> we<00:03:01.410> try

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
also we took away some stuff when we try

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.690 
also we took away some stuff when we try
out<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.570> was<00:03:03.690> only<00:03:03.870> probably<00:03:04.440> at<00:03:05.010> maximum

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
out so that was only probably at maximum

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.110 
out so that was only probably at maximum
five<00:03:06.060> or<00:03:06.300> maybe<00:03:06.840> seven<00:03:07.320> kills<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.820> we<00:03:08.970> took

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
five or maybe seven kills so we took

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.030 
five or maybe seven kills so we took
away<00:03:09.390> some<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.780> splits<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:10.800> gave

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
away some of the splits that we gave

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.280 
away some of the splits that we gave
away<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.370> our<00:03:11.670> friend<00:03:12.030> but<00:03:12.780> that's<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.110> very

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
away to our friend but that's a very

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.840 
away to our friend but that's a very
small<00:03:13.590> amount<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.370> should<00:03:14.550> be<00:03:14.580> very

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
small amount so this should be very

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.020 
small amount so this should be very
accurate<00:03:15.060> guys<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:16.040> as<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.370> see<00:03:17.400> we

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
accurate guys and as you can see we

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.550 
accurate guys and as you can see we
didn't<00:03:18.240> get<00:03:18.330> too<00:03:18.510> many<00:03:18.660> onyx<00:03:18.930> bolts<00:03:19.200> as<00:03:19.320> can

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
didn't get too many onyx bolts as can

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.710 
didn't get too many onyx bolts as can
man<00:03:19.709> was<00:03:19.860> saying<00:03:20.130> earlier<00:03:20.250> we<00:03:21.209> only<00:03:21.450> have<00:03:21.690> one

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
man was saying earlier we only have one

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.350 
man was saying earlier we only have one
125<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.740> that's<00:03:23.130> around<00:03:23.700> usually<00:03:24.240> you'd

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
125 so that's around usually you'd

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.240 
125 so that's around usually you'd
expect<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.810> get<00:03:24.959> much<00:03:25.170> more<00:03:25.650> than<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:25.980> now

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
expect to get much more than that now

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.160 
expect to get much more than that now
hundred<00:03:26.520> kills<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> previous<00:03:27.720> episodes

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
hundred kills in the previous episodes

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.500 
hundred kills in the previous episodes
we<00:03:28.260> go<00:03:28.500> around<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.920> we<00:03:29.670> got<00:03:29.820> that<00:03:30.150> amount

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
we go around that we got that amount

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.640 
we go around that we got that amount
every<00:03:31.290> episode<00:03:32.280> maybe<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:33.180> yeah<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.410> each

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
every episode maybe but yeah in each

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.170 
every episode maybe but yeah in each
episode<00:03:34.770> would<00:03:35.040> normally<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:35.490> run<00:03:35.640> 30<00:03:35.880> kills

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
episode would normally do run 30 kills

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.090 
episode would normally do run 30 kills
yeah<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.959> gives<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.230> an<00:03:37.320> idea<00:03:37.410> maybe<00:03:37.830> we

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
yeah so that gives you an idea maybe we

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.260 
yeah so that gives you an idea maybe we
should<00:03:38.220> have<00:03:38.310> got<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.459> few<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.820> few<00:03:38.910> more

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
should have got a few a few more

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.530 
should have got a few a few more
unexposed<00:03:40.020> yeah<00:03:40.680> if<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.160> was<00:03:41.310> I'm<00:03:42.150> not<00:03:42.209> really

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
unexposed yeah if it was I'm not really

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.120 
unexposed yeah if it was I'm not really
sure<00:03:42.630> about<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.080> averages<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.709> others

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
sure about the averages on the others

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.180 
sure about the averages on the others
but<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.400> do<00:03:44.550> believe<00:03:45.500> Green<00:03:46.500> Dragon<00:03:46.860> height<00:03:47.010> is

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.420
