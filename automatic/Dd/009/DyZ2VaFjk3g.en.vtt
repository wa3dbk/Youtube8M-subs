00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
the original that was a core development

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.249 
the original that was a core development
principle<00:01:21.789> for<00:01:21.970> us<00:01:22.149> as<00:01:22.330> this<00:01:22.509> game<00:01:22.690> needed<00:01:23.140> to

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
principle for us as this game needed to

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.350 
principle for us as this game needed to
play<00:01:23.440> exactly<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.580> way<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:24.880> did<00:01:25.030> ten<00:01:25.330> years

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
play exactly the way it did ten years

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.120 
play exactly the way it did ten years
ago<00:01:25.599> I<00:01:25.959> mean<00:01:26.110> this<00:01:26.679> is<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.920> game<00:01:27.099> that

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
ago I mean this is the game that

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.460 
ago I mean this is the game that
launched<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.789> generation<00:01:28.330> of<00:01:28.420> shooters<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.349> we

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
launched a generation of shooters so we

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.050 
launched a generation of shooters so we
had<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.740> make<00:01:29.890> sure<00:01:30.099> that<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.369> feeling<00:01:30.940> was

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
had to make sure that that feeling was

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.460 
had to make sure that that feeling was
identical<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.750> experience<00:01:32.319> that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
identical to that experience that

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.809 
identical to that experience that
everybody<00:01:32.800> remembered<00:01:33.220> ten<00:01:33.459> years<00:01:33.670> ago

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
everybody remembered ten years ago

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.370 
everybody remembered ten years ago
because<00:01:34.060> this<00:01:34.509> is<00:01:34.630> really<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.929> gift<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.289> the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.499 
because this is really a gift to the
fans<00:01:35.590> this<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:36.099> way<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.360> relive<00:01:37.360> the

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
fans this is a way to relive the

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.029 
fans this is a way to relive the
experience<00:01:37.690> of<00:01:38.050> playing<00:01:38.229> halo<00:01:38.530> one<00:01:38.770> for<00:01:38.979> the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
experience of playing halo one for the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.469 
experience of playing halo one for the
first<00:01:39.190> time<00:01:39.429> so<00:01:39.670> we<00:01:39.759> really<00:01:40.000> wanted<00:01:40.239> to<00:01:40.330> make

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
first time so we really wanted to make

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.330 
first time so we really wanted to make
sure<00:01:40.509> it<00:01:40.690> was<00:01:40.780> identical<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:42.009> way<00:01:42.099> we<00:01:42.220> did

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
sure it was identical and the way we did

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.219 
sure it was identical and the way we did
that<00:01:42.520> was<00:01:42.580> actually<00:01:43.179> a<00:01:43.390> fun<00:01:43.569> technical<00:01:44.050> trick

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
that was actually a fun technical trick

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.660 
that was actually a fun technical trick
we're<00:01:44.410> actually<00:01:44.530> running<00:01:44.860> portions<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.520> two

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
we're actually running portions of two

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.729 
we're actually running portions of two
engines<00:01:46.000> at<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.209> same<00:01:46.420> time<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:47.619> the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:47.739 
engines at the same time so the

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:49.410 
engines at the same time so the
underlying<00:01:48.130> code<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.550> code<00:01:48.729> controlling<00:01:49.330> how

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
underlying code the code controlling how

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.180 
underlying code the code controlling how
the<00:01:49.479> game<00:01:49.720> feels<00:01:49.989> how<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.229> AI<00:01:50.440> reacts<00:01:51.009> all<00:01:51.099> of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
the game feels how the AI reacts all of

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.979 
the game feels how the AI reacts all of
that<00:01:51.340> stuff<00:01:51.610> is<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.179> lot<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:52.569> it's<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.899> original

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
that stuff is a lot of it's the original

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.930 
that stuff is a lot of it's the original
halo<00:01:53.470> 1<00:01:53.709> code<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.280> was<00:01:54.399> really<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.700> best

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
halo 1 code and that was really the best

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.309 
halo 1 code and that was really the best
way<00:01:55.060> for<00:01:55.360> us<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.479> ensure<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.170> game

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
way for us to ensure that the game

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.020 
way for us to ensure that the game
played<00:01:56.590> exactly<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.250> same<00:01:57.429> as<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.700> did<00:01:57.819> 10

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
played exactly the same as it did 10

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.999 
played exactly the same as it did 10
years<00:01:58.060> ago<00:01:58.300> but<00:01:59.170> on<00:01:59.289> top<00:01:59.440> of<00:01:59.500> that<00:01:59.679> we've

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
years ago but on top of that we've

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.040 
years ago but on top of that we've
layered<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.550> new<00:02:00.670> graphics<00:02:00.910> engine<00:02:01.270> that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
layered a new graphics engine that

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.540 
layered a new graphics engine that
allows<00:02:02.140> us<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.709> you<00:02:02.950> know<00:02:03.069> make<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.399> game<00:02:03.520> look

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
allows us to you know make the game look

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.100 
allows us to you know make the game look
fantastic<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.450> look<00:02:04.569> like<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.780> current

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
fantastic and look like a current

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.600 
fantastic and look like a current
generation<00:02:05.560> title<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:05.979> it's<00:02:06.129> really<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:06.520> great

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
generation title so it's really a great

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.940 
generation title so it's really a great
mix<00:02:07.209> of<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.509> two<00:02:07.539> so<00:02:08.410> at<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.560> end<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.830> day

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
mix of the two so at the end of the day

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.290 
mix of the two so at the end of the day
you<00:02:09.009> know<00:02:09.190> your<00:02:09.340> halo<00:02:09.520> fan<00:02:09.700> gets<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:10.030> game<00:02:10.179> that

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
plays exactly like they remember but

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.760 
plays exactly like they remember but
looks<00:02:12.879> like<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.120> current<00:02:13.450> generation<00:02:13.870> title<00:02:14.200> we

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
looks like a current generation title we

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.050 
looks like a current generation title we
get<00:02:14.920> some<00:02:15.069> other<00:02:15.160> benefits<00:02:15.640> from<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.880> as
