make its decision which one it will put
in<00:02:05.640> our<00:02:05.729> squad<00:02:06.030> thought<00:02:06.930> fuck<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.229> I'll<00:02:08.009> give

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
in our squad thought fuck it I'll give

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.119 
in our squad thought fuck it I'll give
you<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> five<00:02:08.580> man<00:02:08.819> squad<00:02:09.530> okay<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.830> didn't

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
you a five man squad okay so this didn't

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.530 
you a five man squad okay so this didn't
give<00:02:11.220> us<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.370> massive<00:02:11.700> advantage<00:02:11.819> when<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.450> were

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
give us a massive advantage when we were

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.400 
give us a massive advantage when we were
defending

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
defending

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500 
defending
but<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:14.310> did<00:02:14.460> come<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.820> attacking<00:02:15.180> this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
but when we did come to attacking this

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.630 
but when we did come to attacking this
did<00:02:15.720> provide<00:02:16.050> us<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.470> big<00:02:16.740> big<00:02:17.010> advantage

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
did provide us with a big big advantage

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.030 
did provide us with a big big advantage
and<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.510> simple<00:02:18.870> reason<00:02:19.020> behind<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.590> was

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
and the simple reason behind that was

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.650 
and the simple reason behind that was
that<00:02:20.070> instead<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.790> having<00:02:21.030> three<00:02:21.420> mobile

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
that instead of having three mobile

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.380 
that instead of having three mobile
spawn<00:02:22.140> points<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> battlefield<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:24.120> ended

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
spawn points on the battlefield we ended

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
spawn points on the battlefield we ended
up<00:02:24.480> hanging<00:02:24.660> for<00:02:24.960> mobile<00:02:25.320> spawn<00:02:25.620> points<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.250> big

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
up hanging for mobile spawn points a big

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.820 
up hanging for mobile spawn points a big
big<00:02:26.820> advantage<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.450> us<00:02:27.480> there<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.380> did<00:02:28.620> feel

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
big advantage to us there it did feel

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.040 
big advantage to us there it did feel
like<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.760> little<00:02:29.910> bit<00:02:30.150> like<00:02:30.300> we<00:02:30.480> were<00:02:30.600> cheating

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
like a little bit like we were cheating

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.110 
like a little bit like we were cheating
because<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.380> did<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.830> advantage<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.880> I

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
because we did have that advantage but I

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.330 
because we did have that advantage but I
wasn't<00:02:33.690> too<00:02:33.930> concerned<00:02:33.960> because<00:02:34.620> both<00:02:35.040> times

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
wasn't too concerned because both times

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.010 
wasn't too concerned because both times
we<00:02:35.580> played<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.940> particular<00:02:36.300> team<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.870> this

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
we played this particular team on this

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.980 
we played this particular team on this
map<00:02:37.290> they<00:02:38.010> turned<00:02:38.460> them<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.640> kb<00:02:39.270> hungry

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
map they turned them to kb hungry

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.110 
map they turned them to kb hungry
rookies<00:02:40.410> who<00:02:40.860> wouldn't<00:02:41.340> play<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.610> objectives

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
rookies who wouldn't play the objectives

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.270 
rookies who wouldn't play the objectives
at<00:02:42.270> all<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.750> for<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.530> reason<00:02:43.590> i<00:02:43.980> didn't

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
at all so for that reason i didn't

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.450 
at all so for that reason i didn't
really<00:02:44.400> feel<00:02:44.520> too<00:02:44.850> bad<00:02:45.530> right<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:47.040> my<00:02:47.220> son
