00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.619
 and what's up I'm bernard and we're here 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.420
 in a new video in this case a 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.490
 promotion of a server that can fly 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.470
 a lot so well welcome I'm going 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.880
 to comment a little bit how the three 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.880
 game modes that the server has in 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.170
 this case skyworks factions web team 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.849
 they will explain it a little 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.500
 entering each one of them so if 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.030
 you cool you can stay to see it for 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.440
 start when we enter we will be in the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.180
 spot we just have to 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.280
 register by registering register bars 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.600
 space password space and password 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.060
 then every time we enter then 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.560
 Password login bar is that easy 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.750
 once we enter, we can choose 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.309
 our favorite game modes in 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.109
 this case must enter sky war as 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.449
 first game mode we enter and we 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.949
 it is enough to transport already to the first place 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.750
 not this would be like the back is that there 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.129
 websites that the truth is pretty cool and 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.019
 you can do the following if it is to come 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.390
 around here you can send yourself a ticket for 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.769
 chain would gain out WLANs os 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.810
 you launch and you will enter a sand 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.520
 skyworks here you have the kit and well this 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.530
 it would be one of the sands of sky guard I know 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.900
 that is pretty cool is cool I'm not going 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.480
 to play, but this is it, we can go back 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.400
 to put a spawn bar, it will take a while 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.470
 second and we come back out here in the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.720
 good spot once we will be here in 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.050
 spam we can choose our new 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.690
 fashion 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.820
 in this case we will go to pvp factions 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.560
 here we entered well and this would be the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.420
 faction espanyol I think that many 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.190
 of you know what is faction 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.590
 so I do not have to tell you either 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.170
 wars today look around here they throw things at me 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.670
 are wars between clans and such what 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.650
 gave us on this server is the type 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.720
 hit you right click and here 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.370
 we have the kit voucher night is very much 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.290
 the truth gives us many things around here 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.570
 you can see what he gives us are minerals 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.730
 Okay, I'll put it on if it organizes a 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.130
 little bit and then because here we have 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.740
 to heal us to store things online 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.390
 there chest and here we have the rules 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.580
 so to speak more basic you have 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.050
 what to know to play is worth some 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.810
 questions some doubts 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.640
 the bits and such to get it then 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.320
 barrabÃ­ you can see what we have for 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.390
 here and then over here because we have the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.330
 rules that are basically very simple 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.580
 it is not to say not ips not to cry if 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.110
 you lose things or respect is that easy 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.610
 you know that if you did this, you are not going 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.250
 to have any problem on the server 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.990
 said this and when we want to leave already 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.580
 Well, here we can see that it is very broad 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.710
 this area what we have to do is 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.870
 go down to the bottom and get away 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.830
 about 80 to 90 blocks and we can 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.810
 begin to 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.580
 and create our faction I remind you that 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.890
 if you do not know the faction commands 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.270
 you can put efe bar in the chat and you 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.440
 they will be able to leave all 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.120
 you can use help two or three or 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.160
 that you want and the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.870
 commands and even if it's in English it 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.100
 understands everything very easily so no 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.560
 I think there is no problem 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.210
 Now we can put bars with another 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.740
 We will wait for a second 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.570
 without moving it and obviously we going to 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.120
 teleport bound Alex bound we will be 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.250
 here to go to the simple pvp kit voucher 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.540
 let's move on and we'll be here in the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.340
 web team server 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.170
 well here we will have the combat kit and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.580
 then the archer kit I have put the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.650
 combat kit you can see I've already 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.510
 released and it's going out here we have 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.700
 what would be the spam that here does not 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.860
 there is power and once we leave this area 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.390
 support all this map is pvp the truth 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.030
 is that it is pretty cool as you can 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.830
 see there are caves there are hidden things 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.260
 that can fly and apart you can 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.850
 practice then to fine tune your pvp 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.950
 in case you want to play factions 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.260
 I at least see it that way so good 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.720
 Also, the escort said that 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.610
 you will have my mother my english to the 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.500
 right as you can see either from menu 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.160
 they tell you what you have the people there 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.690
 on-line 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.520
 the deaths and the kills that you take me 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.920
 this case and it did not kill anyone but I see 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.870
 there people who can kill you I can 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.190
 kill so well said this I hope 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.750
 that the server has moved 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.520

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.230

 just like the game modes so 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.680
