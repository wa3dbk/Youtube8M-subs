00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.280
 Hi, I 'm Benavidez, and this is a 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.960
 advice over practical natural cooking 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.119
 this time we are going to do some 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.480
 oatmeal cookies for christening or baby 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.880
 shower 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.960
 at a time when you can live with 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.060
 your family 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.520
 you can put certain other children the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.529
 you can ask them to help you 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.230
 some things we have the oven 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.910
 preheated to 180 degrees obviously to 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.040
 children are not going to involve them in 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.980
 process of the oven but they can help you 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.570
 we have this several ingredients that you 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.280
 they can go by what they can do 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.030
 balls of 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.440
 and cookie before cooking and at the end 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.329
 they can also since once they are 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.030
 made them put them in bags 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.250
 bows in the end this is advice for you 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.930
 you live with your family at that time 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.449
 so cute that you're waiting for your baby or 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.870
 that you just had the ingredients 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.470
 for our cookies are 125 grams of 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.280
 butter 125 grams of brown sugar 125 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.790
 grams of white sugar 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.220
 150 grams of oatmeal 1 egg a pinch of 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:22.340
 baking a pinch of salt 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.410
 50 grams of flour nut are going to be 90 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.950
 90 grams the flour we are going to make it 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:33.579
 at the time of incorporating it into the bowl 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.469
 The first thing we are going to do is beat the 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.469
 butter with sugar 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.270
 or 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.540
 we incorporate the white sugar 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.070
 we are going to incorporate at this moment the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.070
 egg 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.569
 and once these elements are incorporated 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.790
 the sugar and the butter we are going to put 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.790
 the sifted flour 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.450
 along with the pinch of bicarbonate and the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.450
 pinch of salt 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.480
 perfect now we also incorporate the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.480
 oats 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.920
 and the times 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.170
 this will be incorporated with one with one 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.340
 shovel a spatula what you have already what 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.340
 we will use the blender 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.310
 once we have the prepared dough 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.770
 We will use a tray for 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.590
 bake or in this case a bayrex we put 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.020
 waxed paper and I'm going to put a little 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.310
 of butter the waxed paper for 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.310
 that the cookies do not stick 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.010
 since we have this we can move on to 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.890
 make the balls these balls are going to 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.040
 grow then I suggest that so 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.349
 least between cookies and cookies 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.040
 is a centimeter or so is a few 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.900
 balls of this size approximately 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.000
 this put them doing the children 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.000
 love to put your hands to the dough 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.440
 as I mentioned to you at the beginning we already have 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.849
 the oven preheated to 180 degrees and a 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.640
 Once you get it, it's very easy. 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:10.770
 only 15 minutes 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.750
 and we put cookies in the oven 15 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.200
 minutes 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.200
 ah 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.519
 and after 15 minutes we take out 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.519
 our cookies 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.760
 and we hope they cool to dismantle it 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:33.300
 if we have ready to our dessert or 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.879
 souvenir for baptism or baby shower 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.360
 I am Benavides level and remember that we are 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.360
 what we eat
