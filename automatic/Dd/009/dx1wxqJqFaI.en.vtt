00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.930
 Do you have specialists to put in cars and trains pretty much like 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.150
 flat in my life 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.389
 and they are already available 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.649
 only difficult to work in gosselies 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:14.349
 I don't know how the cloud starts 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.529
 divide and rule start creating a design 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.529
 we have the computer all models that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 cram the delivery van with a 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.880
 photo epa cancÃºn 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 all drawings all sizes only products yes 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.610
 otherwise there was well I am a tunnel tube the weekly stop the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.460
 have a car 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.420
 we're going to get rid of our design 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.280
 he makes a number of proposals to you and then I actually choose the nicest ones 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060
 I think 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.180
 asked the neighborhood to make a design for our new camera cars 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.240
 after design the design became a kind of stabbing much cut this happens 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.230
 or full automatically 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.920
 the self-adhesive foil is treated with an application layer 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.630
 This ensures that the sneaky has maximum to the car but away 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.680
 imagine that and that is a bit 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.630
 the disciples stab into the world 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.570
 in certain domains as a man 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.910
 I want my wife 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.930
 on the hood 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230
 arcam yes that's no problem 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.350
 following the text you can stand where you are 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.840
 the footballer of the year 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.540
 music life a mistake with you 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.460
 through this year old 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.200
 the sticker material 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.330
 and not just from Thursday to Friday 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.030
 the final in life 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.280
 she is still walking 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.520
 extreme wind don't pay too much attention to go one step further 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.350
 we can't catch it late 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.750
 In the battlefield, digital printing allows people to pass through 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.240
 but we can also pack quite a few completely 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.800
 that's why I don't have enough 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.280
 that means we do 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.700
 the elderly woman who now stands black change color 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.760
 want to make Rome 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.690
 so you don't really see cyclists having those tickets 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.380
 locked up 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.310
 The barrels are rare for those who say they spoke 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.760
 reportedly 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.110
 an advantage of course that is 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.340
 brought out 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.630
 update the scary man overboard work crazy idea 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.630
 do the month of April as an autorama at biella 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.880
 we now have some nice applications 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.629
 naturally good with him 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.359
 other applications such as 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.849
 for example, the tents of the hammer 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.829
 the rear window and side windows 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.639
 no not officially about the neighborhood branches but I do get you a bit 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.099
 weird 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.729
 well that seems to me so 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:40.879
 that lady of 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.879
 peel off car 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.359
 the battle between sun protection 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.409
 burglary 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.559
 secure for all at the rear 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.559
 his role in recent weeks has been pointed out 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.539
 throw dark cap 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.909
 is drawn up verbally in the city 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.809
 and still take a look 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.959
 and it is also difficult, of course, to include David 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.409
 and there will say my job starts competent I think it is quiet 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.719
 Zeebrugge but I am already a busy time to extinguish but we 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.939
 Have this round to go back to a thank you 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.939
 therefore helps 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.169
 well know 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.219
 thank you 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:33.279

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.379
 acid to us
