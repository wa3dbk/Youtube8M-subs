terms with what their options really are

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.290 
terms with what their options really are
now<00:00:28.560> because<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:29.100> know<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.790> some<00:00:29.910> people<00:00:29.970> it's

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
now because I know for some people it's

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.940 
now because I know for some people it's
just<00:00:30.330> another<00:00:30.750> camera<00:00:31.200> but<00:00:31.350> for<00:00:31.380> other<00:00:31.619> people

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
just another camera but for other people

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.740 
just another camera but for other people
if<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.190> were<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.910> really<00:00:33.090> banking<00:00:33.630> on

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
if you were you know really banking on

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.479 
if you were you know really banking on
getting<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.260> these<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.830> had<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.160> hopes

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
getting one of these and had your hopes

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.850 
getting one of these and had your hopes
and<00:00:35.790> cash<00:00:36.330> saved<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> them

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and cash saved up to get one of them

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.010 
and cash saved up to get one of them
then<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.270> disappointing<00:00:39.900> when

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
then it can be really disappointing when

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.470 
then it can be really disappointing when
it<00:00:40.140> doesn't<00:00:40.500> live<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> your<00:00:41.070> expectations

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
it doesn't live up to your expectations

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.790 
it doesn't live up to your expectations
so<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.690> both<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.020> these<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.559> want<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
so for both of these I just want to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.580 
so for both of these I just want to
point<00:00:43.980> out<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.460> whilst<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.510> understand<00:00:46.230> that

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
point out that whilst I understand that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.290 
point out that whilst I understand that
I<00:00:46.620> think<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.949> lot<00:00:47.220> of<00:00:47.370> people<00:00:47.670> were<00:00:47.790> hoping<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
I think a lot of people were hoping it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.170 
I think a lot of people were hoping it
was<00:00:48.449> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.720> be<00:00:48.840> awarded<00:00:49.440> down<00:00:49.620> d800<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.670> 5d

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
was going to be awarded down d800 or 5d

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660 
was going to be awarded down d800 or 5d
mark<00:00:51.420> 3<00:00:51.620> basically<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:53.070> reducing<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
mark 3 basically just reducing the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.030 
mark 3 basically just reducing the
resolution<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.870> retaining<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.530> whole<00:00:55.739> heap<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
resolution but retaining a whole heap of

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.790 
resolution but retaining a whole heap of
those<00:00:56.190> features<00:00:57.019> while<00:00:58.019> saving<00:00:58.470> a<00:00:58.559> lot<00:00:58.650> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
those features while saving a lot of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.610 
those features while saving a lot of
money<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.610> not<00:01:00.000> realistic<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.809> course

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
money it's just not realistic of course

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.020 
money it's just not realistic of course
there<00:01:01.890> was<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.159> to<00:01:02.220> be<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.339> pair<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.790> in

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
there was going to be a pair down in

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.030 
there was going to be a pair down in
features<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.720> whilst<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.290> understand<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.830> lot

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
features and whilst I understand a lot

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.440 
features and whilst I understand a lot
of<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.370> being<00:01:05.519> quite<00:01:05.729> vocal<00:01:05.970> about<00:01:06.300> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
of you are being quite vocal about the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.910 
of you are being quite vocal about the
fact<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.720> you're<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.050> happy<00:01:07.440> with<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> way

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
fact that you're not happy with the way

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.670 
fact that you're not happy with the way
that<00:01:08.130> they've<00:01:08.280> pare<00:01:08.580> down<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.790> features<00:01:09.390> I

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
that they've pare down the features I

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.539 
that they've pare down the features I
think<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.740> need<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> distinguish<00:01:11.490> between

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
think we need to distinguish between

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.360 
think we need to distinguish between
what<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.450> wish<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.960> had<00:01:13.140> been<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.620> what<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
what we wish it had been and what it

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.060 
what we wish it had been and what it
actually<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.909> positioned<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.260> then<00:01:16.799> look

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
actually is positioned as and then look

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.560 
actually is positioned as and then look
at<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.280> feature<00:01:17.520> set<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:17.880> think<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
at the feature set and think have the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.600 
at the feature set and think have the
camera<00:01:18.960> companies<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.830> made<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> mistake

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
camera companies actually made a mistake

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.850 
camera companies actually made a mistake
in<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> way<00:01:21.000> they<00:01:21.210> position<00:01:21.720> these<00:01:21.899> I<00:01:22.229> think

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
in the way they position these I think

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.660 
in the way they position these I think
people<00:01:23.280> wanted<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:24.049> lower-cost<00:01:25.049> alternative

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
people wanted a lower-cost alternative

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.120 
people wanted a lower-cost alternative
for<00:01:26.670> an<00:01:26.969> upper<00:01:27.360> enthusiast<00:01:28.049> /<00:01:28.289> professional

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
my opinion move frame cameras but aimed

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.160 
my opinion move frame cameras but aimed

likewise<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.780> d800<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.160> people

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
likewise with the d800 you know people

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.940 
likewise with the d800 you know people
we're<00:02:11.910> really<00:02:12.180> hoping<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.930> d600

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
we're really hoping that the d600

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
we're really hoping that the d600
would<00:02:14.400> retain<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:15.120> lot<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.480> those<00:02:15.690> higher-end

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
would retain a lot of those higher-end

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.930 
would retain a lot of those higher-end
features<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> end<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.640> day<00:02:17.760> they

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
features but at the end of the day they

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.760 
features but at the end of the day they
have<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.360> take<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.960> stuff<00:02:19.319> out<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
have to take some of that stuff out the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.680 
have to take some of that stuff out the
build<00:02:20.010> quality<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.790> I've<00:02:21.030> pointed<00:02:21.240> out<00:02:21.480> is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
build quality as I've pointed out is

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.020 
build quality as I've pointed out is
nowhere<00:02:22.230> near<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.680> same<00:02:22.860> as<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.190> d800<00:02:23.940> and

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
nowhere near the same as the d800 and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.480 
nowhere near the same as the d800 and
you<00:02:24.900> know<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.230> resolution<00:02:25.830> has<00:02:26.010> dropped<00:02:26.310> them

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
you know the resolution has dropped them

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.740 
you know the resolution has dropped them
there's<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> couple<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.120> other<00:02:27.240> features<00:02:27.510> that

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
there's a couple of other features that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.290 
there's a couple of other features that
are<00:02:27.960> emitted<00:02:28.350> there<00:02:28.910> potentially<00:02:29.910> there's

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
are emitted there potentially there's

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.850 
are emitted there potentially there's
more

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
more

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.520 
more

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
but left in in the d800e 600 than there

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.950 
but left in in the d800e 600 than there
is<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.980> 16<00:02:34.700> because<00:02:35.270> it's<00:02:35.510> still<00:02:35.660> got<00:02:35.840> the

watered down beyond the resolution and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.370 
watered down beyond the resolution and
they<00:02:46.460> aimed<00:02:46.760> at<00:02:47.030> social<00:02:47.360> media<00:02:47.990> or<00:02:48.140> social

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
Australia there is quite a big

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.290

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
and the 800 a good $900 and I think in

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.380 
and the 800 a good $900 and I think in

out<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.690> cash<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.200> will<00:03:15.410> be<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> bigger

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
out the cash that will be a bigger

out the cash that will be a bigger
deterrent<00:03:16.430> than<00:03:16.550> people<00:03:16.880> realize<00:03:17.270> that<00:03:17.630> big

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
deterrent than people realize that big

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.870 
deterrent than people realize that big
of<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.350> difference<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.770> know<00:03:18.830> in<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.130> UK<00:03:19.489> it's<00:03:19.790> a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
of a difference I know in the UK it's a

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.850 
of a difference I know in the UK it's a
pitifully<00:03:20.360> small<00:03:20.510> amount<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.680> actually

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
pitifully small amount and I actually

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.520 
pitifully small amount and I actually
raised<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.610> we<00:03:23.450> tried<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.930> raise<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.290> with

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530
