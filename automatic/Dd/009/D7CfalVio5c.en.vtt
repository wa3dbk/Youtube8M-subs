00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
actually a harmony that kicks in with it

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.520 
actually a harmony that kicks in with it
I'm<00:02:20.170> going<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.350> show<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.800> melody<00:02:25.530> so

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
I'm going to show you the melody so

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.600 
I'm going to show you the melody so
first<00:02:26.950> finger<00:02:27.280> five<00:02:27.520> g<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:29.260> go<00:02:29.440> five<00:02:30.340> D

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
first finger five g and then go five D

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.560 
first finger five g and then go five D
after<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.120> just<00:02:31.330> kind<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.600> shifted<00:02:31.959> up<00:02:32.080> okay

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
after that just kind of shifted up okay

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.949 
after that just kind of shifted up okay
then<00:02:34.570> right<00:02:34.750> back<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.080> five<00:02:35.260> G<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:37.240> go<00:02:37.420> seven

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
then right back to five G then go seven

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:49.620 
then right back to five G then go seven
g<00:02:38.610> 5d<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.260> then<00:02:44.410> back<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.740> seven<00:02:45.130> G<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:48.630> there's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
g 5d and then back to seven G so there's

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.670 
g 5d and then back to seven G so there's
different<00:02:49.720> ways<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.110> think<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.590> your

it'll go again with the overdub guitar
in<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.190> back<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.699> they<00:05:06.300> do<00:05:06.419> that<00:05:06.600> stuff<00:05:06.810> from

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
in the back and they do that stuff from

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.240 
in the back and they do that stuff from
the<00:05:07.020> recording<00:05:07.410> studio<00:05:07.770> unless<00:05:07.979> you<00:05:08.130> have

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
the recording studio unless you have

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.249 
the recording studio unless you have
three<00:05:08.460> guitar<00:05:08.759> players<00:05:09.000> which<00:05:09.810> is<00:05:09.840> usually

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
three guitar players which is usually

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.540 
three guitar players which is usually
overkill<00:05:10.680> but<00:05:10.860> that's<00:05:11.070> why<00:05:11.220> I<00:05:11.250> like<00:05:11.460> the

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
overkill but that's why I like the

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.460 
overkill but that's why I like the
recording<00:05:11.910> studio<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:12.210> much<00:05:12.539> you<00:05:12.660> can<00:05:12.840> track

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
recording studio so much you can track

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.379 
recording studio so much you can track
so<00:05:13.710> many<00:05:13.889> guitars<00:05:14.220> and<00:05:14.490> just<00:05:14.789> get<00:05:15.000> this<00:05:15.150> bigger

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
so many guitars and just get this bigger

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.390 
so many guitars and just get this bigger
and<00:05:15.479> bigger<00:05:15.690> sound<00:05:15.990> but<00:05:16.199> live<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:17.250> know

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
and bigger sound but live you know

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.490 
and bigger sound but live you know
sometimes<00:05:17.789> if<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.000> can't<00:05:18.180> back<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.389> up<00:05:18.660> then

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
sometimes if you can't back it up then

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.040 
sometimes if you can't back it up then
you<00:05:20.009> feel<00:05:20.490> this<00:05:20.610> emptiness<00:05:20.880> in<00:05:21.360> there<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:21.990> it

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
you feel this emptiness in there and it

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.629
