00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.359
 hey 

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:15.359
 [Music] 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.620
 [Music] 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.610
 how much 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.850
 all right 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.360
 [Music] 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.490
 tiel 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.350
 were we have nothing camera focused on 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.330
 alexander police today he speaks 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.230
 no English, let alone Dutch 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.970
 can you describe what for 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.770
 soccer player it's you got it right 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.050
 could follow or it was hard to catch up 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.420
 because he is of course incredibly 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.640
 fast it's a player that 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.290
 who plays left winger but crazy 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.239
 babies it and it's a boy 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.760
 can cause a lot of danger 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.400
 very witty wants to have all the balls and 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.530
 they very quickly and well I think so 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.059
 a weapon is the trend for the team in 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.670
 the depth can search for you full of 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.140
 on the left also a nice cross and yes 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.570
 if I come another first pole then 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.850
 I can always be so many greenhouses 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.930
 think currently problem natural 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.530
 selection yourself true 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.150
 statin very deficient and you speak and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.670
 of course not at all 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.619
 so communication is still quite difficult 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.140
 but it is a boy who is whole 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.430
 like to learn 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.750
 he says every time for the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.000
 give my shit matches 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.020
 but then we have to wait 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.800
 14 for a moment no hear yes what you say 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.800
 Playing announce pm 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.140
 a light very well in the group so that 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.859
 makes it easier for us in the beginning 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.530
 little searching 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.229
 now i have to say he ears too 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.299
 dressing room movie jamin things for good 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.200
 I have not, then you mark off 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.090
 such a boy 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.899
 somewhat established and gradually 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.140
 can sit down in the group 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.140
 apply 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.940
 he is of course here up to 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.210
 The end of the season is that one 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.240
 fairly short period of course on him 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.759
 as much as possible to see it 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.440
 like today he had you had the chance 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.510
 to play and I have way too often 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.970
 [Applause] 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.210
 [Music] 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.850
 [Applause] 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.040
 of course a problem that the child is in 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.350
 A 10 hour player is not the one 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.450
 so there is automatic the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.090
 price tag that they end up with 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.760
 comes naturally to the club decide whether 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.379
 I that water is yes yes then no and therefore 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.519
 He also has those 6 months 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.230
 show themselves and walked outside that fish 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.819
 so not a very young p 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.430
 and you can see that a bit from them 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.650
 play sometimes a little twist strong eh 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.390
 sometimes you lose the overview in a bit 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.819
 despite the fact that immediately little risk 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.079
 beatbox its very other links 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.010
 only in that you can do a lot 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:04.159
 make steps and the geocache 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.870
 top each other in two legs being round it 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.030
 defenders even more difficult and 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.069
 it is even easier for the self- 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.849
 a boy with me I think a lot 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.769
 potency my hands on shadows 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.159
 is of course also among all those boys 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.459
 U.S 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.670
 when young to give them a try 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.670
 further 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.080
 [Applause] 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.110
 here doctors acceptance oh bubble butt 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.420
 met 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.709
 He said that his nickname was back 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.120
 his name is research alex 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.250
 alexander and 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.959
 our team manager alex my name is alex and 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.489
 he would then get me to drink and then 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.250
 we have another player alexander 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.810
 jacobsen it must also be alex social 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.640
 have a little yes for everyone 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.989
 we have to fit what and measure how 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.379
 he would definitely be quick 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.379
 today
