00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
let's get straight into it so to counter

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.280 
let's get straight into it so to counter
-<00:00:11.639> you're<00:00:11.940> just<00:00:12.059> gonna<00:00:12.179> be<00:00:12.389> basically<00:00:12.750> needing

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
- you're just gonna be basically needing

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.039 
- you're just gonna be basically needing
your<00:00:13.830> opponent<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.700> do<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.089> first<00:00:15.389> move

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
your opponent to do the first move

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.349 
your opponent to do the first move
once<00:00:16.470> there<00:00:16.680> -<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.550> kind<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.850> predict

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
once there - you have to kind of predict

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.840 
once there - you have to kind of predict
well<00:00:19.050> what's<00:00:19.560> gonna<00:00:19.710> happen<00:00:20.100> next<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.550> what's

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
well what's gonna happen next so what's

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.429 
well what's gonna happen next so what's
the<00:00:20.939> time<00:00:21.150> they're<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.570> gonna<00:00:21.689> stagger<00:00:22.020> or

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
the time they're just gonna stagger or

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.040 
the time they're just gonna stagger or
deep<00:00:22.710> fly<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.970> depends<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.420> which<00:00:24.779> way<00:00:24.990> you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
deep fly so it depends on which way you

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.019 
deep fly so it depends on which way you
can't<00:00:25.410> attack<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:26.010> either<00:00:26.189> jump<00:00:26.640> over

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
can't attack you can either jump over
