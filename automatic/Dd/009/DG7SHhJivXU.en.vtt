00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.219 
different song I don't even know where
it<00:02:03.200> came<00:02:03.289> from<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:04.070> he<00:02:04.310> plays<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.119> slowly<00:02:05.450> with

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
it came from but he plays it slowly with

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.050 
it came from but he plays it slowly with
just<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.649> chords<00:02:06.890> played<00:02:07.189> pretty<00:02:07.579> much<00:02:07.820> on

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
just the chords played pretty much on

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.809 
just the chords played pretty much on
half<00:02:08.450> notes<00:02:09.009> little<00:02:10.009> variations<00:02:10.459> at<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.670> end

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
half notes little variations at the end

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.440 
half notes little variations at the end
but<00:02:11.390> then<00:02:11.660> he<00:02:12.080> turns<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.530> into<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:13.450> ragtime

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
but then he turns it into a ragtime

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.910 
but then he turns it into a ragtime
finger-picking<00:02:14.930> piece<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.500> would<00:02:15.590> be<00:02:15.709> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
finger-picking piece it would be the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:30.500 
finger-picking piece it would be the
same<00:02:16.160> as<00:02:16.310> doing<00:02:16.489> something<00:02:16.730> like<00:02:16.849> this

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.970

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
starting it like that and then turning

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:45.260 
starting it like that and then turning
it<00:02:33.099> into<00:02:33.219> this

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.050
