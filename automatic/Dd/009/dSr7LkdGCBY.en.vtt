 lyrian 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.599
 with the hand in which splashes 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.040
 and adds that in the room saer similar 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.789
 facebook and mines 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.150
 we no longer have to address the issue of sexuality with his daughter the weathervane and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.159
 do it with the most appropriate way 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:24.579
 I know that you will feel very much and only apart as a mother because as a midwife 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.609
 you are on this topic then 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.109
 let's see how you could p if you wanted signal from e some errors that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.109
 they committed and that we have seen in the videos 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.550
 when your daughter enters laws 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.000
 we need to talk 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.520
 in haiti it is that to speak with me is to say in a way intui xinhua 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.260
 and above all they also use a non-verbal kessel language of gestures 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.999
 which is when you the gardens 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.490
 the intimate brochures of it and that denotes therefore a 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.600
 she said humiliation is difficult because if karate of strong than that of 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.520
 She also gives you a great base of whole wheat flours 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.990
 we can not try to be very good defense more 'lass' diarrhea is low more 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.990
 lower than the average 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.210
 or the camera 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.210
 thank you for coming on the beaches 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.380
 Michigan 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.810
 good I love you 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.049
 say what it is and would not like us to do as a kind of 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.970
 let's say simulation to see how you can talk about the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.970
 more positive way in the price explained also in principle if not no 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.850
 I would be here in manizales industry 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.180
 or that project that obligation 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.450
 that it would come out if indeed what it was raining down so they continue 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.670
 taking into account those projects 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.350
 and you think how is it that he went out to look for him that he had 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.890
 today you could teach 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.659
 I think it's better one of the things that there are and that's the feeling that 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.060
 is that you would like to have more 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.640
 not with more content pilots to tell you 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.240
 in that line is the highest part marginalization did not come out of shape 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.190
 positive 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.410
 when your mother see that puts that interest in quito also to the morrÃ³n 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.370
 they took here also more open 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.520
 to be able to receive effort that what sum is doing now is a subject 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.059
 quite complex filled in this period 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.919
 so 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.519
 yes i would like williams 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.139
 to point at the blackboard 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.180
 the way in which a phrase with which you could isis 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 endesa 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.459
 yes i would like to improve classes with something positive positive something you know 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.379
 her age we did not have something more or less positive and tell her that what you 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.439
 would like 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.439
 really bad and we are going to put it here I would like 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:47.950
 continue 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.049
 Continuous stores when the mandate of the chairlift emile heskey ends 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.449
 so 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.379
 let's take another attitude 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.599
 open and effective and then if you want a yes or a I will not think then 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.319
 you are going to choose and lower the reason why they believe that what you propose 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 Your mother, well, you can use elm rifles 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.519
 obvious thought 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.519
 because in them you also have to think about them little by little 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.760
 nor our 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.569
 if you want manuel aguilera and years 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.759
 if they are reduced 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.199
 decent type and budgets 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.399
 Well, I wanted to tell you that I would like 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.769
 who get family planning that exclusive 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.229
 more and more tactically without turning on the tracks 2 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.049
 if you have to trust me 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.010
 That's why I can accompany Kirchner who demands permanent jorge 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.379
 but there is more 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.939
 do not let it get lost was this the development 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.849
 because the 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.219
 as well as teachers much more at ease because 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.889
 ep I do not know 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.779
 it is comfortable steam another taking as such the atlante visitor utn keep 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:58.699
 with you 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.119
 in love everyone has been with me 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:07.339
 and none but it would also be good to point out that almost always something remains 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.669
 these proposals 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.669
 in greater adhesions to the speaker 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.189
 the answer does not bend 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:21.150
 after the company sncf network 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.909
 Spain 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.940
 I want to see in him a man undressed very well tired of manuela as tamara 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.229
 xavi was too 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.259
 guatemala is a first step in a very positive way 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.680
 pretended to be in canada emilio growing sun does not have hers of 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.560
 be together 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.630
 I think there are many daughters who are going to feel for hundreds who would want to be one 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.830
 how many times 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.430
 Your mother would have explained the same sources and at this point in time 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.909
 where you need these moments of concern 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.909
 thank you very much for coming to parent school 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.059
 ips 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:05.719
 Manolita Mar have listened to the advice of our psychologist but they will get 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:06.749
 hereinafter 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:11.259
 address sexual issues in a less confrontational way or continue to clash 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.979
 frontally let's see how they do after passing through our school of 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.979
 parents 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.199
 so much time and in family planning 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.719
 espn3 that you leave that accompanies you 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:35.759
 14s 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.259
 it is not that I would think about it accompanied them yes they have given their vote 13 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.169
 apples is not true that is a big step 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.550
 what happens is that I would like you to have more confidence with me in these 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.550
 topics but you have to talk calmly 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.479
 the fermentation 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.930
 Well, I'm staying with Zamorano Borja 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.050
 nothing has changed 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.490
 I accompany you to take something 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.830
 fuck you stay there and we do not want to talk about the boxes no one there 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.830
 nobody processed 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.400
 Peace 28 Mar 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.530
 what would you say to your daughter as well as manuel people and is too young 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.539
 to have sex 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:24.860
 I would ask him what worries him about sex 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.979
 two 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.530
 I would say that if those responsible for theirs is not for sex either 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.710
 I'd say he's too young to be exposed to x-rays the answer 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.190
 correct is the one that worries you 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.940
 in sexual relations it is very important that you are demonstrating 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.290
 accessible to our children and our daughters and it is also to start talking about 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.610
 full sexuality way after quite on the street and especially doing a lot 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.940
 emphasize those concerns and their feelings and not so much use 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.110
 the talks and the sermons in order to get what we want 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.750
 chile lived that number if you wanted to be well informed about sex 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.770
 the apathy of the messes that can be put if you do not listen to their parents 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:11.219
 2 I would suggest if we went together to a family planning center 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:16.160
 I would ask that before looking for information out there I should talk 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:17.300
 with their parents 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.589
 the right answer 

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:22.719
 isolated companies once together to a family planning center 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:27.729
 If you do not know how to approach the subject, it is very important to inform you if you can 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:30.529
 go to a family planning center together there was a 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:31.770
 advisory 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.160
 It is very important that they talk not only about the risks but also the 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.570
 most positive part of sexuality that the float parties traps Messi in a 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:41.719
 way to the irresponsible 

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:43.080
 and above all 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.740
 one thing yes 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.530
 you think that talking about sex or can encourage them to have sex 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.770
 today even before the before time do not stop to be unique that you are going to do 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.839
 is to protect 

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:58.689
 the same ones that I would not hesitate to tell you that they became serious 

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:03.469
 seatbelt when they get they ride in a car one of them say 

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:06.919
 who use a contraceptive method to protect themselves, such as 

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:07.219
 preservative
