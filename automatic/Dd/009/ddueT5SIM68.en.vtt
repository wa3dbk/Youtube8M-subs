00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.880
 for ten years but Beck the Sonderburger must also have one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.539
 Sterilization forth as the Mistelbacher he was the grandson work 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.440
 or at the Korando more of the tub just 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.900
 yes love to Switzerland welcome to the 3000 very good programs around the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 Sports 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.430
 yes this week I have like him the bike action game Turkey against Belgium 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.230
 Selected he reports I believe that there really is something to be fetched there 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.079
 Turkey he is a guest at JEC Minden Belgium and for both 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.240
 Teams are about a lot 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.060
 Helpers with the odds two goals 30 the odds for a win of Belgium to 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.280
 Home a draw at Coburg here and there Turkey wins 3 2 times 20 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.680
 In order for him to become the handicap the sweater bookmakers become federal 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.830
 So Turkey started the game and Turkey gave birth to a 1 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.630
 0 leadership should win despite this handicap leadership Berlin lies the odds 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.380
 at 4 point 2 in the handicap draw 3com a4 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.100
 and should Turkey win with their handicap as a draw would be him 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.740
 then the quota fails at 1 point 6 the crossing quota 1 0 85 the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.810
 under scoring also 1 85 because the audience will be the bookmakers like the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.960
 Turkey as he is on the outside side of the reason for this is the catastrophic 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.760
 He bade out that all the Turks have the Turks playing the last six 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.260
 5 lost only one won 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.390
 the mountains around at home 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.510
 not really bad is really strong two wins two draws two 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.460
 Defeats and meanwhile when the Turks acted as outsiders and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.690
 so red of 3 Thomas Weik I personally believe but they do not work 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.340
 substantially stronger team 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.030
 if you look at the players where the shell man-makers Hamit Altintop 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.960
 This time, though, Hermann percent only hurt so they know which one 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.280
 Player Dahlmann Percent who is involved 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.049
 The bus should either run directly on the day before Frankfurt to Gaziantep Sport 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.520
 The church again offers many good players to Norbert Roeder 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.190
 Woerth given breeding season inside the bypass does not know who Diegos not 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.829
 Upper clubs 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.420
 So the church the church team, the substance is very well placed 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.580
 Mimi Tillich forgot sorry 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.780
 it really is going to be what he puts up very much at the he set up at home 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.690
 could also show that the strong and he just have to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.980
 this matter strengthened them in percent so thought this just has to knock it down 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.389
 and I think it is 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.680
 It is five to twelve 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.800
 it's all about Turkey is third with nine points Belgium with ten 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.230
 Points second Germany ahead with 15 points so they must now on 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.780
 Second place then he still somehow percent of it with a duel 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.710
 to play and personally I believe marry the strength of 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.529
 Turkish team I do not want to talk to them at all 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.809
 Top teams parents with with the healthy mix of payouts 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:40.620
 a few players and experienced players r Listen is a term Lukaku 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.750
 But whoever has also really says a strong team is strong 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.290
 by standards but I believe that Kusterdinger is the old fox of the city 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.220
 Open teams such as Australia or Russia are quite high 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.639
 who push up 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.340
 he really has now with the material water he has around 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.790
 Who really likes the media as a kita- and you like to create one 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.560
 Kickstart and I personally believe here in a victory of the Turks 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.749
 further what does the Quote 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.199
 who wants to make sure a foul 85 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.920
 and if you then still the German game with the most profound 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.349
 but clearly he continues to formulate Kazakhstan if he can play one 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.719
 really a great guy to fill out 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.499
