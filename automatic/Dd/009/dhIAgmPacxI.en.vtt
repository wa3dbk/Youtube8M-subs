00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.820
 memory 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.519
 it does not make sense 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.760
 and for the world my lost steps 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.300
 all right 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.619
 understanding 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.619
 the night of the end 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.489
 and say goodbye 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.870
 I liked the arrangements they made 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.790
 this song let's see what my 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.890
 Carlos is not something new and I 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.870
 the kind of number that I'm looking for 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.520
 in any case 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.860
 indifferent what is not qualifies the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.200
 number as bands are very good 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.350
 tight are very well concentrated are 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.470
 they look good on stage 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.840
 only 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.060
 I would reserve the subject of 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.260
 originality not to me the proposal 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.260
 it seems interesting 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.670
 what I would do is lower a tone to 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.870
 that you can get a little bit more 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.260
 comfortable otherwise I like it 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.390
 it is good final verdict good carlos 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.830
 for me it is one 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:54.600
 I'm going to leave on the yes for me 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.600
 yes yes I say yes 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.970
 welcome to but has talent 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.030
 thank you very much thank you very much for being 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.170
 here and ahead welcome to the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.170
 next stage that has no talent
