tell you why the reason you want to chop
these<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.600> because<00:01:21.930> we've<00:01:22.170> hooded<00:01:22.470> eyes

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
these up is because we've hooded eyes

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
these up is because we've hooded eyes
there<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.130> great<00:01:23.430> potential<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> hood

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
there is great potential that the hood

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.149 
there is great potential that the hood
of<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:24.659> eye<00:01:24.780> will<00:01:25.320> kind<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.590> tend<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> push

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
of your eye will kind of tend to push

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.190 
of your eye will kind of tend to push
against<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> lashes<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.330> what<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.020> do

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
against the lashes and what that can do

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080 
against the lashes and what that can do
is<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.710> kind<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> weaken<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> lashes<00:01:29.880> weak

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
is it can kind of weaken the lashes weak

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
is it can kind of weaken the lashes weak
in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> glue<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> you'll<00:01:31.259> find<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.650> either

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
in the glue and you'll find that either

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
in the glue and you'll find that either
being<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.640> corner<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> eyelashes<00:01:33.509> will

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
being in a corner of the eyelashes will

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.149 
being in a corner of the eyelashes will
start<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> ping<00:01:34.290> off<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.860> strip

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
eyelashes will be kind of hanging off

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.990 
eyelashes will be kind of hanging off
and<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.350> looks<00:01:37.560> kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.920> tacky<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.790> very

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.660 
used mine last night to chop sticky tape
and<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.560> course<00:01:52.770> now<00:01:52.950> they're<00:01:53.159> lost<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670

and of course now they're lost and I
cannot<00:01:53.909> find<00:01:54.149> them<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.689> I'm<00:01:54.750> gonna<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
cannot find them so I'm gonna have to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
cannot find them so I'm gonna have to
use<00:01:55.259> these<00:01:55.560> household<00:01:56.100> scissors<00:01:56.490> instead<00:01:56.790> if

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149

you have nail scissors use them cause

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
you have nail scissors use them cause
they're<00:01:59.070> smaller<00:01:59.310> easier<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.030> maneuver<00:02:00.240> right

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
they're smaller easier to maneuver right

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
about two to three millimeters in little

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.280 
about two to three millimeters in little
segments<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.360> wherever<00:02:21.570> there's<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.930> gap<00:02:22.140> in

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
segments so wherever there's a gap in

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
chop so I'm basically making individual

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.820 
chop so I'm basically making individual
lashes<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.970> bigger<00:02:27.510> segments<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.650> they're

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
lashes but bigger segments so they're

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.260 
lashes but bigger segments so they're
not<00:02:28.950> individual<00:02:29.400> lashes<00:02:29.640> they're<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> little
