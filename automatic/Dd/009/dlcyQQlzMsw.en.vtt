works 18t and the other carriers have
found<00:01:36.810> out<00:01:36.960> about<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.380> already<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.130> they're

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
found out about this already and they're

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.490 
found out about this already and they're
warning<00:01:38.970> people<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:39.869> they

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
warning people not to do it because they

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.660 
warning people not to do it because they
say<00:01:40.740> they're<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> charge<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.490> when

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
say they're going to charge you when

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
say they're going to charge you when
they<00:01:41.759> find<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.420> you're<00:01:42.810> tethering

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
they find out that you're tethering

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.990 
they find out that you're tethering
without<00:01:43.380> paying<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> plan<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
without paying for the plan so this is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
without paying for the plan so this is
probably<00:01:45.240> what's<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> happen<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.350> they

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
probably what's going to happen but they

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.380 
probably what's going to happen but they
probably<00:01:47.340> won't<00:01:47.520> catch<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.240> ahead<00:01:48.299> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
probably won't catch you so go ahead and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.410 
probably won't catch you so go ahead and
do<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.710> also<00:01:49.710> some<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.700> new<00:01:50.909> things<00:01:50.939> that

actually<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.700> way<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.910> get<00:03:03.180> mms<00:03:03.570> now<00:03:03.780> but<00:03:04.290> i

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
actually is a way to get mms now but i

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.960 
actually is a way to get mms now but i
don't<00:03:04.739> recommend<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.160> because<00:03:05.280> yeah<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:05.910> a

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
don't recommend it because yeah it's a

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.640 
don't recommend it because yeah it's a
lot<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.420> actually<00:03:06.660> pretty<00:03:06.750> difficult<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.290> go

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
lot it's actually pretty difficult so go

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.780 
lot it's actually pretty difficult so go
google<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.130> if<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.340> want<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.520> learn<00:03:08.580> how<00:03:08.670> to
