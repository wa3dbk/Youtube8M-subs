but they like slide off my teeth and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469 
but they like slide off my teeth and
they<00:01:07.770> make<00:01:07.950> me<00:01:07.979> feel<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> rabid<00:01:09.330> animal

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
they make me feel like a rabid animal

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.940 
they make me feel like a rabid animal
because<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.229> foaming<00:01:10.560> at<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.830> mouth

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
because I'm like foaming at the mouth

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.460 
because I'm like foaming at the mouth
and<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.939> usually<00:01:12.150> can't<00:01:12.540> keep<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.960> bottom<00:01:13.260> ones

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and I usually can't keep the bottom ones

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.840 
and I usually can't keep the bottom ones
on<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.100> slip<00:01:14.369> right<00:01:14.400> off<00:01:14.580> my

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
on because they just slip right off my

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.190 
on because they just slip right off my
teeth<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.450> teeth<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> bottom<00:01:15.990> are

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
teeth because my teeth on the bottom are

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.070 
teeth because my teeth on the bottom are
pretty<00:01:16.439> tiny<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> anyways<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.930> not

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
pretty tiny so anyways that just was not

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.170 
pretty tiny so anyways that just was not
a<00:01:19.110> good<00:01:19.320> solution<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.860> me<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.850> had<00:01:21.000> never

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
a good solution for me and I had never

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.270 
a good solution for me and I had never
tried<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.900> teeth<00:01:22.110> whitening<00:01:22.350> pen<00:01:22.650> before<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.250> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
tried a teeth whitening pen before and I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.980 
tried a teeth whitening pen before and I
got<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> opportunity<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:24.240> try<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
got the opportunity to try this one and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.749 
got the opportunity to try this one and
