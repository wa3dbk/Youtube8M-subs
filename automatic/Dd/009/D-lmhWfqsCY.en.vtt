00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.170
 element 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.000
 mariana radial are already a mistake was not 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.730
 enough for you to address something 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.610
 different I just know that I'm fine with 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.360
 my people we continue with the best with my 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.510
 mind only one mistake was enough to 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.490
 that you want something different I just know 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.120
 I 'm fine with me 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.370
 his name no longer talk to you about me better 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.070
 tell him that you do not exist that one day he arrives 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.080
 I saw everything and then I left like that 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.150
 tell him that I was a child and that only 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.310
 I thought about music and never take care of you 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.620
 tell him the moments were numbered 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.810
 happy that he did not trust me that never 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.120
 I knew what I wanted that I was never here 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.010
 when the days were gray you are not going to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.959
 think of me when that place times 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.209
 because you do not tell him how our 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.640
 last appointment that you put beyond being 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.800
 another pretty face that I do not have plans 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.840
 from the past an addict who Serbian is a 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.849
 conflict and I always live in benito 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.680
 what do you know I could do things for 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.989
 instinct and when everything got dark 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.269
 you preferred something different I still doubt 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.450
 that you understand what he recited love is 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.040
 for wise to fail nobody is exempt 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.900
 immemorial or your memory a monument 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.970
 out of this notebook the hours are 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.280
 they go slow and they are right 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.500
 I'm the worst thing if you do not call 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.110
 music I do not assure you love but the future 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.489
 will already take care of our bodies only 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.340
 it's a matter of time for us to come back 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.170
 to see us I also know that it was a punishment 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.120
 know me I no longer believe in luck 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.640
 since I got to lose you and you do not 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.500
 Excuse me, you did not lose so much that 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.500
 I only have charm when my lyrics 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.630
 He sang meanwhile I must disappear 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.420
 because it's not on my agenda to come back from 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.489
 be known in that sooner or later 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.440
 will erase my name and you will write another one with 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.019
 the one that you are more satisfied I will follow 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.000
 rapping with the same uniform there are people 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.099
 in the studio waiting for rhymes to form 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.200
 let me sing that is the only thing that 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.329
 fancy and until today was the only thing in 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.340
 where it does not appear to you that until today I am the 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.049
 only one that really deserves it but the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.299
 destination does not exist so it's better not 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.530
 come back because maybe oblivion is the 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.970
 who wants to burn 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.460
 maybe it's the future the good the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.620
 happiness saves unique hiphop weapon 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.450
 no love as my weapon to me already found me 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.720
 the rap but you to see who saves you 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.660
 just one mistake was enough to 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.730
 that you did something different, I just 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.130
 I know I'm fine with my people 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.370
 we continue with man play with my mind 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.310
 only one error is enough to 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.380
 that you mean something different, I just 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.810
 I know I 'm fine with my people 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.810
