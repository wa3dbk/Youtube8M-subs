00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.850 
this one a lot now what I do with this
BB<00:01:49.759> cream<00:01:50.150> is<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.600> think<00:01:50.930> minimal<00:01:51.350> amount

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
BB cream is that I think minimal amount

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.040 
BB cream is that I think minimal amount
and<00:01:52.250> then<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.759> used<00:01:53.240> my<00:01:54.490> Beauty<00:01:55.490> Blender

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
and then I used my Beauty Blender

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.480 
and then I used my Beauty Blender
because<00:01:57.050> you<00:01:57.229> dependent<00:01:57.740> gives<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.100> nice

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
because you dependent gives you a nice

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.870 
because you dependent gives you a nice
airbrush<00:01:59.330> kind<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.960> look<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:01.070> want<00:02:01.700> to

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
airbrush kind of a look so you want to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.060 
airbrush kind of a look so you want to
keep<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.360> natural<00:02:02.630> for<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:03.740> would

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
keep it natural for that I would

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.279
