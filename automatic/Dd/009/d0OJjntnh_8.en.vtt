00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
moral in my previous videos and I'm

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.700 
moral in my previous videos and I'm
going<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.820> attempt<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:19.410> I'm<00:00:19.529> not<00:00:19.650> very

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
going to attempt it but I'm not very

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.080 
going to attempt it but I'm not very
good<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.070> teaching<00:00:20.189> I'll<00:00:20.490> tell<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.880> now

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
good at teaching I'll tell you that now

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.759 
good at teaching I'll tell you that now
I'm<00:00:21.330> very<00:00:21.779> bad<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:22.080> explaining<00:00:22.500> things

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
I'm very bad at explaining things

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.870 
I'm very bad at explaining things
especially<00:00:23.039> when<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.430> comes<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.670> drawing

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
especially when it comes to drawing

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.689 
especially when it comes to drawing
because<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.330> your<00:00:24.480> technique<00:00:24.990> right<00:00:25.640> so<00:00:26.640> I'm

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
because it's your technique right so I'm

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.800 
because it's your technique right so I'm
going<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.880> try<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.029> best<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:29.599> yeah<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> decided

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
going to try my best and yeah I decided

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.479 
going to try my best and yeah I decided
to<00:00:31.230> develop<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.800> technique<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.369> own

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
to develop a technique of your own

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.450 
to develop a technique of your own
basically<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:33.270> you'll<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:33.570> fine<00:00:33.870> just

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
basically and then you'll do fine just

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
basically and then you'll do fine just
so<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.489> will<00:00:35.820> try<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.750> teach<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.170> very

try the show we hope you guys can see
everything<00:00:47.090> what's<00:00:48.090> easiest<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.780> me<00:00:49.489> is

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
everything what's easiest for me is

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:02.250 
everything what's easiest for me is
assert<00:00:51.230> with<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.739> top<00:00:55.640> so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.570 

do<00:01:03.260> as<00:01:03.380> a<00:01:03.410> permanent<00:01:03.710> marker<00:01:04.130> so<00:01:04.340> it's<00:01:04.489> going

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
do as a permanent marker so it's going

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.630 
do as a permanent marker so it's going
to<00:01:04.670> be<00:01:04.790> really<00:01:05.030> rough<00:01:05.180> at<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.510> end<00:01:05.690> just

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
to be really rough at the end just

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.800 
to be really rough at the end just
letting<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:08.420> know<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:12.520> then<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:14.360> like<00:01:14.540> start

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
letting you know and then you like start

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.990 
letting you know and then you like start
flaking<00:01:15.050> off<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:15.500> start<00:01:15.740> at<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.920> top<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:19.000> you

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
flaking off you start at the top and you

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.860 
flaking off you start at the top and you
draw<00:01:20.450> like<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.780> okay<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.660> one's<00:01:23.810> a

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
draw like that okay and that one's a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.300 
draw like that okay and that one's a
little<00:01:23.900> bit<00:01:24.140> longer<00:01:24.320> but<00:01:24.620> I<00:01:24.680> deserve<00:01:25.010> a<00:01:25.130> matter

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
little bit longer but I deserve a matter

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.290 
little bit longer but I deserve a matter
today<00:01:25.490> should<00:01:25.670> be<00:01:26.500> any<00:01:27.500> size<00:01:28.490> because<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:29.180> can

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
today should be any size because it can

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.880 
today should be any size because it can
be<00:01:29.390> any<00:01:29.540> size<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:29.930> want<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:31.300> well<00:01:32.300> I<00:01:32.800> have<00:01:33.800> a

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
be any size you want and well I have a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.490 
be any size you want and well I have a
body<00:01:34.130> here<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.630> if<00:01:35.750> you're<00:01:35.900> trying<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.170> connect

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
body here so if you're trying to connect

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.870 
body here so if you're trying to connect
it<00:01:36.710> with<00:01:36.740> something<00:01:37.220> then<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.580> should<00:01:37.760> have

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
it with something then you should have

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.140 
it with something then you should have
something<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.270> connect<00:01:38.479> connect<00:01:39.080> with<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.790> I

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
something to connect connect with and I

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.040 
something to connect connect with and I
want<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.390> wing<00:01:44.570> there<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:46.550> I'll<00:01:46.850> do<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:50.540> I

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
want a wing there so I'll do that and I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
want a wing there so I'll do that and I
guess<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.350> answer<00:01:51.590> will<00:01:51.710> be<00:01:51.770> somewhere

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
guess the answer will be somewhere

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.780 
guess the answer will be somewhere
around<00:01:52.130> there<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.630> then<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.960> start<00:01:54.790> going

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
around there and then you start going

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.100 
around there and then you start going
with<00:01:56.000> as<00:01:56.119> many<00:01:56.240> wings<00:01:56.509> as<00:01:56.690> you<00:01:56.720> want<00:01:56.960> you

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
with as many wings as you want you

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.170 
with as many wings as you want you
should<00:01:57.259> make<00:01:57.410> them<00:01:57.530> longer<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:58.360> get<00:01:59.360> the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
should make them longer to get the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.700 
should make them longer to get the
effect<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.360> want<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.440> keep

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
effect you want to and you just keep

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.200 
effect you want to and you just keep
going<00:02:04.929> it's<00:02:05.929> really<00:02:06.080> matter

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.250 

how<00:02:10.870> long<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.970> really<00:02:13.240> make<00:02:13.480> them<00:02:13.750> because

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
how long you really make them because

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:22.410 
how long you really make them because
it's<00:02:14.530> really<00:02:14.710> all<00:02:14.830> your<00:02:15.220> choice<00:02:21.210> they<00:02:22.210> should

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
it's really all your choice they should

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.560 
it's really all your choice they should
be<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.570> lot<00:02:22.840> longer<00:02:23.020> than<00:02:27.120> stay<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.300> hunt<00:02:28.450> at

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
be a lot longer than stay in the hunt at

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.190 
be a lot longer than stay in the hunt at
the<00:02:28.600> bottom<00:02:33.360> should<00:02:34.360> be<00:02:34.510> longer<00:02:34.750> than<00:02:35.080> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the bottom should be longer than the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:45.050 
the bottom should be longer than the
ones<00:02:35.350> on<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> top<00:02:35.590> that's<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:37.920> given<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.070> hope

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
want one here unless you're connect and

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:37.550 
want one here unless you're connect and
on<00:03:28.950> there<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:35.780> just<00:03:36.780> basically<00:03:36.990> do<00:03:37.380> whatever

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
on there you just basically do whatever

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.380 
on there you just basically do whatever
you<00:03:37.770> feel<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.930> proper<00:03:39.930> what<00:03:40.230> will<00:03:41.220> look<00:03:41.550> good

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.240 

you<00:03:45.390> just<00:03:45.570> keep<00:03:45.810> spreading<00:03:46.440> off<00:03:46.770> you<00:03:47.130> know

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
you just keep spreading off you know

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.750 
you just keep spreading off you know
just<00:03:47.280> make<00:03:48.090> wings<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:50.160> then<00:03:50.400> once<00:03:50.520> again<00:03:50.580> you

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
just make wings and then once again you

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.790 
just make wings and then once again you
start<00:03:53.810> like<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.200> just<00:03:55.380> go<00:03:55.470> bigger<00:03:55.650> and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
start like that you just go bigger and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.770 
start like that you just go bigger and
bigger<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.550> since<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:56.940> made<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.120> line<00:03:57.330> here<00:03:57.540> -

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
bigger and since I made a line here -

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.190 
bigger and since I made a line here -
I'll<00:03:57.900> make<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.110> wing<00:03:59.630> worked<00:04:00.630> out<00:04:00.780> better<00:04:00.930> that

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
I'll make a wing worked out better that

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.770 
I'll make a wing worked out better that
way

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
way

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.090 
way
you<00:04:03.780> can<00:04:03.960> because<00:04:04.200> monies<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.590> one<00:04:04.710> as<00:04:04.830> long

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
you can because monies and one as long

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:19.940 
you can because monies and one as long
as<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.460> want

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.730

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
mm and then from here he makes them

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.050 
mm and then from here he makes them
really<00:04:23.040> long<00:04:23.340> because<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.880> want<00:04:24.150> length

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
really long because you want length

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.580 
really long because you want length
makes<00:04:27.060> them<00:04:27.150> look<00:04:27.240> like<00:04:27.360> real<00:04:27.570> angel<00:04:28.350> wings

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
I'm terrible at teaching things I'm

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.200 
I'm terrible at teaching things I'm
actually<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:31.580> other<00:05:31.670> thing<00:05:31.730> I'm<00:05:31.910> really<00:05:32.000> good

actually the other thing I'm really good
at<00:05:32.300> teaching<00:05:32.450> is<00:05:33.730> math<00:05:34.730> and<00:05:35.210> like<00:05:35.390> and<00:05:35.540> you

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
at teaching is math and like and you

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.410 
at teaching is math and like and you
guys<00:05:35.810> really<00:05:35.990> care<00:05:36.410> I<00:05:36.880> can<00:05:37.880> actually<00:05:38.120> explain

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
guys really care I can actually explain

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.570 
guys really care I can actually explain
that<00:05:41.170> and<00:05:42.170> you<00:05:42.950> just<00:05:43.100> do<00:05:43.370> whatever

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
that and you just do whatever

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.580 
that and you just do whatever
kind<00:05:43.790> of<00:05:43.940> look<00:05:44.030> you<00:05:44.060> want<00:05:47.020> like<00:05:48.020> okay

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
kind of look you want like okay

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.550 
kind of look you want like okay
if<00:05:48.980> you<00:05:49.100> want<00:05:49.250> to<00:05:49.340> make<00:05:49.460> your<00:05:49.670> wings<00:05:49.850> figures

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
if you want to make your wings figures

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.990 
if you want to make your wings figures
you<00:05:51.560> make<00:05:51.800> this<00:05:52.100> part<00:05:52.430> that<00:05:52.610> I'm<00:05:52.700> doing<00:05:52.820> right

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
you make this part that I'm doing right

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.360 
you make this part that I'm doing right
now<00:05:53.060> you<00:05:53.240> make<00:05:53.570> more<00:05:54.350> feathers<00:05:54.740> on<00:05:54.980> that<00:05:55.130> part

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
now you make more feathers on that part

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.760 
now you make more feathers on that part
so<00:05:55.580> it's<00:05:55.730> easier<00:05:56.090> to<00:05:56.150> spread<00:05:56.480> off<00:05:56.720> so<00:05:57.710> that

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
so it's easier to spread off so that

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.590 
so it's easier to spread off so that
they<00:05:58.040> added<00:05:58.340> two<00:05:58.490> more<00:05:58.520> you'd<00:05:58.850> probably<00:05:59.210> get

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
they added two more you'd probably get
