00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
when you've created a Gundam kit you

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.980 
when you've created a Gundam kit you
always<00:04:48.120> have<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.300> little<00:04:48.509> sense<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:48.840> ownership

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
and when you do a custom kit like this

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.200 
and when you do a custom kit like this
it<00:04:52.050> gets<00:04:52.169> even<00:04:52.560> better<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:53.610> can<00:04:53.669> see<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:53.910> kept

part<00:05:02.940> is<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.150> rifle<00:05:03.840> here<00:05:04.229> I<00:05:04.380> just<00:05:04.680> did<00:05:04.979> a

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
part is the rifle here I just did a

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.670 
part is the rifle here I just did a
straight<00:05:05.370> black<00:05:05.639> here<00:05:06.000> nothing<00:05:06.330> fancy<00:05:06.780> but<00:05:06.990> a

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
straight black here nothing fancy but a

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.140 
straight black here nothing fancy but a
little<00:05:07.919> red<00:05:08.099> in<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.340> scope<00:05:08.669> man<00:05:08.910> that's

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
little red in the scope man that's

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.300 
little red in the scope man that's
pretty<00:05:09.360> much<00:05:09.479> it<00:05:09.720> but<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.710> thought<00:05:10.979> it<00:05:11.039> turned

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
pretty much it but I thought it turned

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.589 
pretty much it but I thought it turned
out<00:05:11.610> pretty<00:05:11.820> nice<00:05:13.880> now<00:05:14.880> there<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.270> can<00:05:15.419> see<00:05:15.570> a

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
out pretty nice now there you can see a

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.439 
out pretty nice now there you can see a
little<00:05:15.960> better<00:05:16.169> picture<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:17.039> decals<00:05:17.550> you

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
little better picture of the decals you

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.210 
little better picture of the decals you
don't<00:05:18.599> get<00:05:18.720> many<00:05:18.870> huge<00:05:19.320> decals<00:05:19.800> than<00:05:19.979> doing

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
don't get many huge decals than doing

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.969 
don't get many huge decals than doing
Gundam<00:05:20.550> kits<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:22.169> that's<00:05:22.349> kind<00:05:22.560> of<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.680> reason

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
Gundam kits so that's kind of the reason

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.800 
Gundam kits so that's kind of the reason
I<00:05:23.070> wanted<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.460> use<00:05:23.610> Monster<00:05:24.210> decals<00:05:24.599> let's

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
I wanted to use Monster decals let's

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.860 
I wanted to use Monster decals let's
make<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:24.990> huge<00:05:25.590> and<00:05:25.919> outlandish<00:05:26.570> it's<00:05:27.570> a<00:05:27.690> bit

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
make it huge and outlandish it's a bit

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.770 
make it huge and outlandish it's a bit
overkill<00:05:28.349> but<00:05:28.650> I<00:05:28.830> liked<00:05:29.099> it<00:05:29.419> but<00:05:30.419> like<00:05:30.570> I<00:05:30.720> said
