issue with the brick caliper really on
them<00:01:32.329> are<00:01:32.539> pretty<00:01:33.350> close<00:01:33.679> to<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.130> wheel<00:01:34.340> back

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
them are pretty close to the wheel back

them are pretty close to the wheel back
side<00:01:35.149> of<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.390> wheel<00:01:35.539> so<00:01:37.899> it's<00:01:38.899> gonna<00:01:39.079> take<00:01:39.229> a

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
side of the wheel so it's gonna take a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:46.820 
side of the wheel so it's gonna take a
little<00:01:39.439> grinding

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.450

for a while so I get these wheels on

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.560 
for a while so I get these wheels on
here<00:02:01.890> ground<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:03.220> little<00:02:03.490> weight<00:02:03.700> Ridge

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
here ground this little weight Ridge

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.010 
here ground this little weight Ridge
down<00:02:04.900> on<00:02:05.170> here<00:02:05.440> not<00:02:06.070> all<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.430> way<00:02:07.020> because

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
like I said I'm sure this adds to some

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:52.210 
like I said I'm sure this adds to some
support<00:02:10.420> or<00:02:10.630> strength<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:12.420> caliper

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.430

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
the handle on their new patch wrenches

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.950 
the handle on their new patch wrenches
get<00:02:54.650> hot<00:02:57.730> well<00:02:58.730> right<00:02:58.970> here<00:02:59.240> in<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.450> corners

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
get hot well right here in the corners

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.540 
get hot well right here in the corners
in<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.200> bottom<00:03:00.530> corner<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.040> fenders<00:03:01.400> is

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
in the bottom corner of the fenders is

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.170

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.970 
either on top of all the clearance I got
there<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.690> just<00:03:17.690> turn<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:17.990> wheel<00:03:18.290> see<00:03:18.770> what<00:03:18.920> it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
there so just turn the wheel see what it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:29.890 
there so just turn the wheel see what it
looks<00:03:19.130> like

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.170 

might<00:03:30.410> be<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.620> little<00:03:30.800> issue<00:03:31.190> once<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.819> let<00:03:32.030> it

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
might be a little issue once I let it

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.330 
might be a little issue once I let it
down<00:03:32.390> in<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.900> springs<00:03:33.440> compress<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.010> little

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
down in the springs compress a little

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.570 
down in the springs compress a little
bit<00:03:34.700> but<00:03:35.110> I'm<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.319> little<00:03:36.470> dremel<00:03:36.950> tool<00:03:37.190> fix

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
bit but I'm a little dremel tool fix

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:50.190 
bit but I'm a little dremel tool fix
