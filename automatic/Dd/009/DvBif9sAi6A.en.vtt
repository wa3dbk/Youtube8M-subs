00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
that's the tricky part I'm still using

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.510 
that's the tricky part I'm still using
my<00:01:04.180> two<00:01:04.239> fingers<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.830> I<00:01:05.950> skip<00:01:08.070> skip<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.220> string

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
my two fingers but I skip skip a string

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:19.200 
my two fingers but I skip skip a string
here<00:01:09.759> every<00:01:10.149> every<00:01:10.780> other<00:01:10.899> turn<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.439> I'll<00:01:11.500> go

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.929 

so<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:19.840> can<00:01:19.990> see<00:01:20.170> me<00:01:20.350> go<00:01:22.170> skipping

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:37.640 

and<00:01:27.939> then<00:01:28.180> come<00:01:28.420> back<00:01:28.450> down<00:01:28.630> for<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.079> B<00:01:29.229> so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.780 

see<00:01:38.650> if<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:38.830> can<00:01:38.920> get<00:01:39.010> closer

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.940 

so<00:01:44.690> then<00:01:44.840> all<00:01:44.870> together<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.620> should<00:01:45.800> sound

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
so then all together it should sound

00:01:45.950 --> 00:02:01.060 
so then all together it should sound
like<00:01:46.220> this

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:38.150

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.770 

so<00:02:39.160> anyway<00:02:39.490> these<00:02:39.790> are<00:02:39.970> like<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.300> hope<00:02:40.570> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
so anyway these are like that hope that
