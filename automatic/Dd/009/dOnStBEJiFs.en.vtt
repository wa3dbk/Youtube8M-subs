00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.800
 as you always leave at home with sunglasses 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.659
 a large fire known everywhere to get going 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.799
 nowadays that is also possible according to the selection 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.069
 so you can negotiate these engines 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.670
 the team 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.170
 mitchell 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.710
 I am crazy about the sunglasses in the past year 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.780
 I want to get away with it 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.010
 learn that or have the whole car do it to the rear of the Netherlands 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.010
 because if you only tan on the back during these colors and before 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.270
 color name is getting worse because it has to follow the rules that is 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.160
 want to stay nice 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 that can only be behind but you want to do well 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.540
 This behind an example should serve for viewing a transition and then it appears 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.240
 a bit on March 30 yet you also have more options and it is also 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.159
 also safe it is painful already 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.530
 so if there is still a lot of south 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.890
 that left the shards no less so as to protect and thereby stoke 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.890
 burglar-resistant 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.570
 9 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.229
 you can still pick it up yourself yes that has to be done by a 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.289
 professional appearance 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.289
 because then you also get it completely sleek that the extremely awkward 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.430
 why only behind the dark is on the side us too much 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.990
 cooler that requires 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.840
 by working according to the legal guidelines 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.480
 that is why we can only produce dark colors behind and light colors 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.620
 color so that you can singh under all circumstances as a driver 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.729
 it is also not really on a mobile 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.259
 he is like to feed 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.899
 and 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.669
 much calmer yourself too 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:23.519
 so kind of
