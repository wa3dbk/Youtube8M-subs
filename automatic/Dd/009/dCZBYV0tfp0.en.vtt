and Lily Belle I really like this bag I
know<00:00:09.389> it's<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:10.290> pattern<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.280> most<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.759> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
know it's this pattern is most of a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.299 
know it's this pattern is most of a
white<00:00:12.150> pattern<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.410> will<00:00:13.530> probably<00:00:13.799> get

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
white pattern so it will probably get

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.840 
white pattern so it will probably get

a<00:01:19.320> matter<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.799> 10<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.850> had<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.240> concern

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
a matter of 10 because I had one concern

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.850 
a matter of 10 because I had one concern
I<00:01:22.619> got<00:01:23.220> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.580> mad<00:01:23.790> since<00:01:24.540> they<00:01:25.080> shorten<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
I got kind of mad since they shorten the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.080 
I got kind of mad since they shorten the
strap<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:28.220> see<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.460> how<00:01:29.640> long<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.060> goes

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
strap and see that's how long it goes

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.440 
strap and see that's how long it goes
it's<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.409> think<00:01:31.909> 53<00:01:32.990> inches<00:01:33.990> instead<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.890> 56<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
it's I think 53 inches instead of 56 the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.499 
it's I think 53 inches instead of 56 the
old<00:01:36.689> mini<00:01:37.140> hipster<00:01:37.619> had<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> 56<00:01:38.909> inch<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
old mini hipster had a 56 inch and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
old mini hipster had a 56 inch and
everybody<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:40.049> tying<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.650> at<00:01:40.860> their<00:01:41.040> shoulder

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
everybody was tying it at their shoulder

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.780 
everybody was tying it at their shoulder
but<00:01:42.210> personally<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.280> left<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
but personally I think I like left it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090 
but personally I think I like left it
untied<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.540> was<00:01:45.689> fine<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.710> one's<00:01:46.920> fine

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
untied and it was fine this one's fine

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.850 
untied and it was fine this one's fine
on<00:01:47.250> me<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:48.030> other<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.780> tall<00:01:49.140> people<00:01:49.619> I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
on me but for other like tall people I

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 
on me but for other like tall people I
think<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.970> they<00:01:51.420> should<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.659> kept<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
think that they should have kept it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.139 
think that they should have kept it
where<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.619> was<00:01:52.710> still<00:01:52.920> adjustable<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.060> it

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
where it was still adjustable but it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.230 
where it was still adjustable but it
could<00:01:54.270> adjust<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.689> 56<00:01:55.350> inches<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.759> that's<00:01:57.090> why

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
could adjust the 56 inches so that's why

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.630 
could adjust the 56 inches so that's why
I<00:01:57.270> give<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> 9<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.140> 10<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:59.009> personally<00:01:59.610> I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
I give it a 9 out of 10 but personally I

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.060 
I give it a 9 out of 10 but personally I
I<00:01:59.850> would<00:02:00.299> give<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> 10<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> 4<00:02:01.229> except<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
I would give it a 10 a 4 except for the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.200 
I would give it a 10 a 4 except for the
strap<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.909> bye<00:02:03.360> guys<00:02:03.570> thank<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.020> watching
