00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.590
 Talk about superclubs or patricks 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.590
 blogs and today I'm going to teach music 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.450
 brunette version of marcelo camelo class of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.099
 today a simplified version for 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.870
 who is starting to play the guitar is well 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.940
 cool I'll start playing the song 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:45.720
 all and then I explain 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:54.450
 a brunette 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:59.300
 It's okay, serene, it's the one who has the peace of 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.300
 be odd 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:19.790
 I can laugh now that the thread of evil 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:24.300
 no ball for us all the love in the world 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.470
 to them the other side I say bad to me 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.229
 would you like 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:37.560
 nobody escapes the burden of living like this 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:43.800
 It will be so I do not prefer it with you. 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.700
 close together headless imagine until 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.310
 end 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.730
 the brunette 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.490
 it's ok 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.860
 Will be 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:04.470
 and I tried to 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.470
 He is at peace with God. 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:14.940
 can go now that the thread of evil without 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.940
 clothes 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 ah 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:28.410
 For us, you took everyone for them. 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:34.030
 on the other hand the red one hardly wants me 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.660
 nobody escapes the weight of him to see thus be 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.660
 like this 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:47.610
 I prefer it with you together without 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:54.740
 hair of imagining to the end 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.740
 oh my god, everything's fine 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.890
 the chords of the introduction of the first 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.630
 only those here 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.630
 the ninth refinement 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.510
 the smaller 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:17.060
 only with fifth only with fifth and seventh 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:21.019
 higher there with 71 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.019
 make it bigger 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:32.360
 if even seventh major and minor and I am 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.360
 smaller with seventh 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.409
 so look at it 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:56.400
 by emma everything is fine 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:04:00.000
 serene is the one who has the peace of being in peace 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.000
 with God 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:18.870
 can go now that the thread of evil without 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:22.430
 roll the rhythm we use to play 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.430
 All this music here 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:39.230
 We play two down afterwards. 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.230
 Upside down Upside up one more time 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.440
 Now I'm going to play a little bit slower. 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.430
 sequence of the first part for you 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.430
 follow along with me 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.080
 then this sequence of the first part 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.760
 in the second part we will use these 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.760
 chords were minor 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.970
 is greater fear with seventh there with 71 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:53.440
 Are you scared of a minute? 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.440
 seventh 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.020
 smaller than the smaller 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:11.100
 the pace is the same as I already signed 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:16.040
 just look for us around the world love to 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:21.660
 they the other side I say ill want me 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:23.310
 nobody escaped price to live so to be 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:30.169
 like this 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:35.520
 I do not like it with you together 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:38.880
 100k bay to imagine to the end 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.979
