00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
which would be what Lumina basically to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.150 
which would be what Lumina basically to
make<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:53.720> same<00:02:54.350> play<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.740> you<00:02:54.800> go<00:02:54.920> for

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
make this same play that you go for

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160 
make this same play that you go for
which<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.700> alumina<00:02:56.060> into<00:02:56.360> writing<00:02:56.630> into

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
which is alumina into writing into

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.900 
which is alumina into writing into
basically<00:02:57.950> make<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:58.310> car<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:58.700> get<00:02:58.820> to

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
basically make this car and you get to

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.820 
basically make this car and you get to
also<00:02:59.180> mill<00:02:59.330> two<00:02:59.480> cars<00:02:59.690> with<00:02:59.840> right<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.170> during

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
also mill two cars with right and during

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.980 
also mill two cars with right and during
that<00:03:00.890> process<00:03:01.160> but<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.670> feel<00:03:01.850> like<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.750> cart

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
that process but I feel like this cart

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.930 
that process but I feel like this cart
since<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.410> can't<00:03:03.620> be<00:03:03.770> like<00:03:03.920> activated<00:03:04.730> when

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
since it can't be like activated when

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.430 
since it can't be like activated when
it's<00:03:05.090> milled<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.660> feel<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:05.960> if<00:03:06.110> they<00:03:06.230> have

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
it's milled I feel like if they have

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.020 
it's milled I feel like if they have
that<00:03:06.590> effect<00:03:06.920> this<00:03:07.130> card<00:03:07.340> will<00:03:07.400> be<00:03:07.460> on<00:03:07.760> some

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
that effect this card will be on some

huge usually do not have back row

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.320 
huge usually do not have back row
therefore<00:05:05.190> you<00:05:05.580> can<00:05:05.730> just<00:05:05.880> be<00:05:05.970> like<00:05:06.090> oh<00:05:06.210> you

backfield<00:05:08.070> therefore<00:05:08.400> eyes<00:05:08.580> hand<00:05:08.880> can't<00:05:09.180> you

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
backfield therefore eyes hand can't you

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.760 
backfield therefore eyes hand can't you
know<00:05:09.510> pop<00:05:09.930> something<00:05:10.170> therefore<00:05:10.530> it<00:05:10.590> can't

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
know pop something therefore it can't

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.470

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.440 
you know this is just like bad in a
sense<00:05:14.370> because<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.700> gives<00:05:14.730> ice<00:05:15.030> hand<00:05:15.300> at

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.420 
would try to drag you just have to
remove<00:07:12.780> two<00:07:12.990> counters<00:07:13.350> from<00:07:13.530> you<00:07:13.950> know<00:07:14.040> itself

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
remove two counters from you know itself

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.070 
remove two counters from you know itself
but<00:07:14.610> if<00:07:14.760> you<00:07:14.880> like<00:07:15.030> again<00:07:15.419> it<00:07:15.600> just<00:07:15.630> doesn't

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.320
