00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
not saying that doesn't mean you can't

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850 
not saying that doesn't mean you can't
do<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.229> healthy<00:01:46.530> because

like I said everyone is different but I

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.240 
like I said everyone is different but I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
believe like for me listening to my body

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.690 
believe like for me listening to my body
is<00:01:53.909> key<00:01:54.689> some<00:01:55.530> people<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.829> hear<00:01:56.130> say<00:01:56.399> like

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
is key some people I hear say like

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.789 
is key some people I hear say like
they're<00:01:56.909> starving<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> other<00:01:57.899> night<00:01:58.170> but

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
they're starving at the other night but

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
they're starving at the other night but
they<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.430> no<00:01:59.670> more<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.180> they've<00:02:00.360> used<00:02:00.600> up

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
they have no more like they've used up

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.469 
they have no more like they've used up
all<00:02:00.899> their<00:02:01.020> calories<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:02.430> me<00:02:02.610> that's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
all their calories and for me that's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.080 
all their calories and for me that's
when<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.869> gets<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.229> unhealthy<00:02:04.740> because

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
when it gets to be unhealthy because

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.190 
when it gets to be unhealthy because
clearly<00:02:06.090> your<00:02:06.329> body<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.719> telling<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.110> that

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
then I'll try to eat a lot of protein

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.530 
then I'll try to eat a lot of protein
earlier<00:03:16.169> in<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.349> day<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.519> can<00:03:17.729> still

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
earlier in the day so that I can still

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.539 
earlier in the day so that I can still
have<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.780> balanced<00:03:19.260> throughout<00:03:19.530> my<00:03:20.010> day<00:03:20.069> of

have a balanced throughout my day of

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.449 
have a balanced throughout my day of
protein<00:03:21.329> fats<00:03:21.659> carbohydrates<00:03:22.159> so<00:03:23.159> I<00:03:23.190> mean<00:03:23.400> if

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
protein fats carbohydrates so I mean if

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.250 
protein fats carbohydrates so I mean if
you<00:03:23.609> really<00:03:23.639> think<00:03:24.060> about<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.359> I<00:03:24.540> kind<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.930> am

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260

able<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.280> eat<00:04:20.549> some<00:04:20.850> foods<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.299> love<00:04:21.540> but

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
able to eat some foods that you love but

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.350 
able to eat some foods that you love but
i<00:04:22.440> think<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.220> you're<00:04:23.490> starting<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.270> get

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
i think that if you're starting to get

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.180 
i think that if you're starting to get
to<00:04:24.509> the<00:04:24.630> point<00:04:24.840> where<00:04:25.110> you're<00:04:25.350> starving<00:04:26.039> at

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
to the point where you're starving at

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.350 
to the point where you're starving at
night<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.639> you're<00:04:26.910> not<00:04:27.060> letting<00:04:27.270> yourself

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
night and you're not letting yourself

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.790 
night and you're not letting yourself
eat<00:04:27.750> because<00:04:27.990> you've<00:04:28.139> used<00:04:28.410> up<00:04:28.590> all<00:04:28.770> your

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
eat because you've used up all your

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.100 
eat because you've used up all your
calories<00:04:29.340> then<00:04:29.970> that's<00:04:30.300> getting<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:31.080> a

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
calories then that's getting to a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.890 
calories then that's getting to a
disordered<00:04:31.860> eating<00:04:32.039> pattern<00:04:32.580> that's<00:04:32.900> that's

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
disordered eating pattern that's that's

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.370 
disordered eating pattern that's that's
just<00:04:34.110> had<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.259> healthy<00:04:34.680> mindset<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:36.840> believe

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
just had a healthy mindset and I believe

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.719 
just had a healthy mindset and I believe
in<00:04:37.500> listening<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:37.979> your<00:04:38.100> body<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.430> believe

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
in listening to your body I believe

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.960 
in listening to your body I believe
everything<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.270> moderation<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:40.430> I<00:04:41.430> think

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
everything in moderation and I think

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.939 
everything in moderation and I think
that<00:04:42.300> if<00:04:42.630> your<00:04:43.080> body<00:04:43.289> telling<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.770> it's

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
that if your body telling you it's

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.730 
that if your body telling you it's
hungry<00:04:44.220> then<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.639> should<00:04:44.870> be<00:04:45.870> eating<00:04:46.050> so

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
hungry then you should be eating so

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.670 
hungry then you should be eating so
