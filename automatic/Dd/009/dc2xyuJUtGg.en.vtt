really important to qualifications girls

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.300 
really important to qualifications girls
are<00:04:05.610> more<00:04:05.790> likely<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:06.420> choose<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:07.140> do<00:04:07.310> subjects

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
are more likely to choose to do subjects

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.850 
are more likely to choose to do subjects
that<00:04:08.550> are<00:04:08.790> sometimes<00:04:09.269> seen<00:04:09.540> as<00:04:09.600> boys<00:04:10.019> subjects

that are sometimes seen as boys subjects

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.920 
that are sometimes seen as boys subjects
so<00:04:11.040> they're<00:04:11.220> more<00:04:11.400> likely<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.850> study<00:04:12.269> physics

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
so they're more likely to study physics

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.819

more<00:04:26.729> likely<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.180> study<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:33.300> this<00:04:33.479> gives<00:04:33.720> them

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
more likely to study and this gives them

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.770 
more likely to study and this gives them
more<00:04:34.110> choices<00:04:34.440> of<00:04:34.889> careers<00:04:35.430> in<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.880> future<00:04:36.060> so

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
more choices of careers in the future so

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.740 
more choices of careers in the future so
it's<00:04:36.930> really<00:04:37.200> about<00:04:37.910> equipping<00:04:38.910> people<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.510> do

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
it's really about equipping people to do

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.710 
it's really about equipping people to do
the<00:04:39.930> best<00:04:40.229> they<00:04:40.620> can<00:04:41.000> without<00:04:42.000> feeling<00:04:42.570> that

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
the best they can without feeling that

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.800 
the best they can without feeling that
they<00:04:42.870> have<00:04:43.139> to<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:44.340> things<00:04:44.669> that<00:04:45.000> fit<00:04:45.330> what

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
they have to do the things that fit what

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.989 
they have to do the things that fit what

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:51.109

so<00:04:48.659> the<00:04:48.839> lessons<00:04:49.259> are<00:04:49.680> not<00:04:49.949> very<00:04:50.159> different<00:04:50.490> in

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:51.119 
so the lessons are not very different in

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:53.540 
so the lessons are not very different in
the<00:04:51.270> simple<00:04:51.689> facts<00:04:51.930> school<00:04:52.289> but<00:04:53.129> the<00:04:53.279> teacher
