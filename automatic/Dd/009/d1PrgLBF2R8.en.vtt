00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello everyone my name is or go even and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.309
 you are watching t with t in 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.410
 htc company for the third year in a row 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.809
 don't experiment with your titles 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.390
 flagship smartphones the year before 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.090
 Ivan X came out last year successfully 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.119
 Sevan and this year have a new eat 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.560
 Sevan in m8 brackets the same name 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.779
 apparently called to emphasize 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 generational continuity and own 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.939
 continuity are present in full 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.850
 volume 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.770
 new cheats sevan m8 got the same 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.320
 the aluminum case is almost like 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 last year that sevan which became 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.020
 the same dynamics were decided to be called m7 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.610
 boomsound on both sides of the screen 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.350
 the side faces have changed a little they 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 become a little more rounded 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.090
 of course increased body size 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.280
 because the screen diagonal has grown 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.410
 so much family up to 5 whole shit 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.870
 smartphone lost hardware keys 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.539
 now they are simply drawn on the screen 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.339
 like on sony phones but under 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.390
 screen left wide by usb with 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.820
 htc 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.049
 why it is necessary is not clear just by 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.880
 my allow squandering 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 free space with the button 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.810
 unlocking is still in 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.180
 upper body and strong 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 fuel groups so one handed 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.020
 unlock the smartphone is very inconvenient 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.450
 have to stretch very much or 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.820
 use for this second hand but 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.650
 engineers have thought about this problem 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.290
 so along with mars the smartphone goes 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.570
 Here is such a case called dot view 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.299
 he stops with us right on 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.909
 smartphone and further just when 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.799
 opening cover 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.509
 screens automatically block idea 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.240
 cover just us at the same time very 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.100
 originally it is true to large 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.140
 the number of through holes well almost 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.180
 through through which shines through 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.250
 Still, the screen, respectively, on the screen 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.219
 formed a special picture and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.170
 keystrokes are highlighted in 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.390
 certain pixel locations is obtained 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.210
 something like a formation board 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.860
 train station or airport 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.200
 for example this with unlocked 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.370
 screen allows you to display the current time and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.159
 weather also 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.230
 volume is regulated besides a cover 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.959
 reacts to simple gestures with his fingers 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.540
 up and down so you can not open 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.209
 cover answer the call or put 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.489
 up after talking well and it is important that 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.670
 above and below the static holes are different 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.190
 so the microphone and speaker are perfectly 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.409
 easily accessible so you can call 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.049
 just talk without removing the cover here 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.510
 in such a way in general ideas with a cover 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.250
 Of course, excellent and original but the most 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.859
 unfortunately not very convenient because 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.470
 he constantly tries to shut herself 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.799
 going to get in the way when trying 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.840
 take pictures because so is he 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:57.370
 closes respectively the lens as well 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.989
 so he is constantly at hand and in general 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.329
 uncomfortable now as for the camera but 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.819
 rather the camera the main camera remained 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.829
 the same as pistons year four 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.450
 megapixel is roughly called 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.870
 still ultra pixel to 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.489
 emphasize the fact that the size of each point 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.230
 for matrix more than ordinary cameras 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.769
 corresponding advantages and disadvantages 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.290
 same on those camera shoots very well 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.810
 due to 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.629
 more when they are from keta to matrix and when 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.609
 light loses to others in cameras 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.049
 because the resolution of the snapshot and 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.019
 accordingly, I get clarity 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.139
 less but ivan is learning n8 also 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.690
 the second camera is next to the main one 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:45.199
 in order to determine the distance to 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.920
 objects due to the parallax effect it 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:50.880
 becomes possible 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.130
 determined by the depth of the scene and focus 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.790
 happens really very fast and 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.920
 clearly 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.830
 still interesting programs and 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.660
 shooting modes for example there is a mode 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.480
 photosphere shooting 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.980
 that is, it is a circular panorama that you 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.370
 you catch first 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.370
 different angles of the room or on the street 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.709
 then you can in the picture in different directions 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.560
 rotate it and watch equal angles on 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.570
 the same picture is also here 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.000
 double shooting function that is when 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.580
 water is used for shooting from two cameras 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.300
 with the main and frontal as it was at 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.580
 samsung galaxy s4 for example like that 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.200
 there is a camera mode zoe and that is 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.490
 automatic continuous shooting allows 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.180
 in the aftermath 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.430
 delete accidentally in the frame 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.060
 moving object so what else can 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.660
 say very interesting frontal 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.060
 camera 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.760
 It is from 5 megapixel and 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.830
 wide angle so take off commit 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.410
 or they are crossbows or links to 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.030
 actually very convenient it turns out 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.030
 quality can do without a mirror 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.060
 also the smartphone is very cool like me 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.590
 already said boomsound speakers 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.289
 located on both sides of 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.729
 screen with them to watch video clips 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:13.500
 musical just a pleasure 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.530
 we understand the screen probably especially 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.750
 nothing to say it's honest and ps matrix 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.360
 five inch with full hd resolution 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.610
 of course there could be a little more stock 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.910
 brightness but generally in the sun picture 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.130
 put well readable and distinguishable well 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.870
 that put the speed of work, too 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.240
 probably abortion rhetorical because 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.920
 here 801 snapdragon 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.620
 and 2 gigabytes of RAM 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.450
 the only thing is that during the building 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.180
 noticeably heated see visible because he 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.700
 Aluminum however as seen in the rating 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.490
 smartphone is not leading up there 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.160
 800 chipset device which is more 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.390
 slow opportunity because 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.610
 branded shell htc sense after all 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.020
 spending too many topics 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.020
 more than any particular advantages 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.270
 now use look for sense not 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.210
 gives if it was relevant in times 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.720
 androids there is the second version of 44 in 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.430
 principle , everything is so convenient and good therefore 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.850
 many manufacturers go their way 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.760
 embedding additional chips exactly 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.430
 at a deep system level and here 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.340
 the only thing is essentially a tape 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.870
 news htc blinkfeed 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.090
 integrates news from social networks and 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.220
 news aggregators that's it and in 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.760
 principle, it's probably all of us as to 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.220
 batteries it work and that sevan m8 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.060
 approximately 20 hours of intensive mode 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.290
 cohesive ground that in principle 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.270
 good result for modern 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.490
 smartphone although it is certainly better 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.010
 Meanwhile, if the last year that this us 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:52.100
 everyone was trying to surprise the user and 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:55.220
 it was a good attempt then present 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.230
 Simon M8 is more modernized 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.690
 slightly modified improved version 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.950
 last year's flagship which by the way 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:06.470
 so I'm not particularly you got to improve 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:09.140
 that I want to note a very high price 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:14.420
 3000 rubles more than all the rest 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:18.290
 android flagships on the market 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:20.390
 that all manufacturers today produce 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.480
 flagships that are not much different from 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.340
 last year but the paradox is that 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.380
 it is their writing that cannot do this 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.530
 allow because the position of the company 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:33.230
 the market is wobbly 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:35.330
 the company has no special advertising and PR 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.280
 because of this hardly 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.920
 the novelty will become a bestseller a pity 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.640
 because the model is actually very 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.890
 not bad 

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.120
 in any case, the choice is yours, but first 

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.120
 what to buy see the test
