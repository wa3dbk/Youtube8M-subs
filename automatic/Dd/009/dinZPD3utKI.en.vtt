especially<00:06:23.910> with<00:06:24.600> the<00:06:25.010> indicating<00:06:26.010> major

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
especially with the indicating major

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.040 
especially with the indicating major
destruction<00:06:27.510> with<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.380> words<00:06:29.750> killed<00:06:30.750> by<00:06:30.990> the

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
destruction with the words killed by the

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.350 
destruction with the words killed by the
fire<00:06:31.500> and<00:06:32.990> with<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.110> word<00:06:34.260> Tokyo<00:06:35.070> in<00:06:35.340> it<00:06:35.490> so

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
fire and with the word Tokyo in it so

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.280 
fire and with the word Tokyo in it so
but<00:06:36.810> as<00:06:36.990> far<00:06:37.260> as<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.740> year<00:06:38.310> I<00:06:38.550> would<00:06:39.300> say<00:06:39.630> as<00:06:40.020> I

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290 
but as far as the year I would say as I

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.910 
but as far as the year I would say as I
would<00:06:40.500> explain<00:06:40.950> by<00:06:41.460> using<00:06:41.940> the<00:06:42.680> prophecies<00:06:43.680> in

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
would explain by using the prophecies in

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.040 
would explain by using the prophecies in
the<00:06:43.950> Psalms<00:06:44.610> we're<00:06:45.510> looking<00:06:45.870> at<00:06:46.020> a

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
the Psalms we're looking at a

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.530 
the Psalms we're looking at a
possibility<00:06:46.890> of<00:06:47.100> giant<00:06:47.940> earthquakes<00:06:48.360> around

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
possibility of giant earthquakes around

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.070 
possibility of giant earthquakes around
the<00:06:48.870> world<00:06:49.080> in<00:06:49.520> 2014<00:06:50.520> including<00:06:51.480> possibly

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
the world in 2014 including possibly

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.370 
the world in 2014 including possibly
California<00:06:52.980> in<00:06:53.100> the<00:06:53.130> u.s.<00:06:53.840> impossibly<00:06:54.840> Japan

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
California in the u.s. impossibly Japan

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.240 
California in the u.s. impossibly Japan
but<00:06:56.310> that's<00:06:56.640> why<00:06:56.880> that<00:06:57.540> recent<00:06:57.990> 5.5<00:06:58.860> quake

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
but that's why that recent 5.5 quake

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.360 
but that's why that recent 5.5 quake
yesterday<00:06:59.610> in<00:07:00.210> Tokyo<00:07:01.170> does<00:07:01.890> that<00:07:02.130> indicate

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
yesterday in Tokyo does that indicate

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.700 
yesterday in Tokyo does that indicate
there<00:07:02.850> is<00:07:02.880> a<00:07:02.970> possibility<00:07:03.600> of<00:07:03.840> a<00:07:03.930> giant<00:07:04.230> quake

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
there is a possibility of a giant quake

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.920 
there is a possibility of a giant quake
in<00:07:05.660> Tokyo<00:07:06.660> in<00:07:07.020> tooth<00:07:07.350> coming<00:07:07.860> in<00:07:08.100> 2014<00:07:08.820> it<00:07:09.660> is<00:07:09.900> a

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
in Tokyo in tooth coming in 2014 it is a

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.660 
in Tokyo in tooth coming in 2014 it is a
possibility<00:07:10.560> but<00:07:10.800> it<00:07:11.100> is<00:07:11.250> it's<00:07:11.880> hard<00:07:12.240> to<00:07:13.670> say

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670 
possibility but it is it's hard to say

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.940 
possibility but it is it's hard to say
for<00:07:14.700> sure<00:07:15.000> on<00:07:15.750> that<00:07:18.350> thank<00:07:19.350> you<00:07:19.500> could<00:07:19.770> see
