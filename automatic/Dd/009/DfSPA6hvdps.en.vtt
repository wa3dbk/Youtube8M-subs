00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.820
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.530
 all very well then today I 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.870
 come back with a new video so I 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.730
 you had promised to eat my 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.530
 new hair routine that I 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.570
 so you filmed my routine 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.820
 capillary that I was doing since 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.590
 really years has not changed 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.910
 I always use a shampoo after 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.519
 shampoos but I changed 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.529
 completely mark is completely 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.550
 especially of account 1 components that 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.500
 the products I use is since 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.120
 quite a few years actually was drunk 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.400
 silicone and me who am a follower 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.950
 really natural products of the coup 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.740
 very soon after the video actually 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.510
 so i was in store at lush 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.180
 since it's one of my shops 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.680
 favorite and I let myself be tempted 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.270
 made by their singing points before 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.830
 introduce you to the shampoos I want 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.990
 do a few small things with you 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.140
 about products that can be found in 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.580
 supermarkets so they are great 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.950
 shampoo because it's very 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.530
 beautiful hair but the fact that it is 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.420
 stuffed with silicone actually I saw 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.220
 the difference between using 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.899
 natural products and products 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.609
 August silicic compounds I actually 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.939
 actually made a difference on my 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:13.280
 hair 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.000
 so having silicone in 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.859
 its shampoos it's not serious but in 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.719
 did I realized that by 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.249
 example i have hair case day where i 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.049
 wash my hair with my shampoo 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:26.240
 200g sail after shampoo garnier 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.579
 agreed that the next day they actually 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.659
 were actually starting to attack at 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.679
 root level and you know very 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.270
 although you do not have to wash your hair 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.569
 every day in any case it's not 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.850
 recommended is there with his shampoos 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.170
 there with 200 g garnier down sincerely I 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.450
 had to wash my hair every 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.460
 two days for example if I wash myself 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.079
 Monday morning's hair makes it on Tuesday 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.899
 evening I already felt that they were 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.689
 dirty then it's not even two 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.979
 days that I had them clean so the 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.509
 kick ben that's what I did I 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.189
 will see very often very low clean 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.869
 to have something cold it's 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.039
 it was almost two days 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.509
 that I had had really 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.140
 regularly hair so I can 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.450
 know that when they 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.929
 icon makes it so nikon will encompass 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.630
 all the hair will settle on it and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.190
 in fact so it's going to regress a lot 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.980
 faster if you have oily hair 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.360
 all components of the products 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.910
 all you can do is that this 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.970
 either on the hair and on the skin the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.820
 skin absorbs the product so absorb 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.920
 the components of this product is actually 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.290
 after his pass in the sound anymore you 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.440
 have some things that are not super top 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.090
 like the extra silicone and that's it 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.590
 accumulates in your body so I 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.120
 prefer to use natural products 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.800
 not by fashion effect 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.560
 no because already I see the results 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.290
 who behind you prefer to know that 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.480
 my body soaked lemon plants 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.540
 and all the trimmings that big 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.340
 shit ascom the silicone the paraben and 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.959
 other hours to come to my 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.300
 new hair routine so I have 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.100
 summer at lush tested in fact the high 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.390
 loved you actually see for the hair 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.110
 fat so that's why I took 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.060
 necessarily 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.130
 so I took the smallest format that 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.930
 does 100 g not risk taking a 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.120
 Huge bunny have it right now 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.829
 I did not really like this shampoo 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.850
 so I took the smallest format for 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:16.709
 test and I was not at all disappointed 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.230
 then as after shampoo I took 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.060
 always from lush the vega days who 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.250
 is for all hair types so the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.530
 difference between my shampoo boxes and 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.480
 nasty point of sange respect is frozen 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.670
 view but direct from the first 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.130
 h application under the usual shower 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.810
 I lose my hair enormously 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.940
 which is normal but then I lose 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.650
 three times less so before I had 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.209
 really huge handful of hair 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.250
 who was falling to me now is 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.760
 practically more so that's a good 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.860
 point 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.019
 when I'm going to leave at home go to dry 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.140
 twice as fast as usual 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.780
 3m good point when I comb my hair 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.700
 I have a lot easier to you 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.260
 to style so I comb my hair twice more 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.850
 quickly that before you know that I am 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.950
 loop every day hair like 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.840
 it usually does not have any worries 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.109
 and there I noticed that this year 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.360
 even better than before and 4th good point is 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.340
 so this is the top of the top 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.810
 I do not need to wash 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.880
 hair every other day but I can 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.200
 keep your head clean at least three 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.800
 days and I still have hair 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.720
 own 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.540
 even the third day so that's 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.790
 really the thing that completely 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.040
 changed my life compared to these products 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.050
 there then in the meantime I wanted to test 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.370
 another shampoo which is that of 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.560
 in body is that so who is at 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.680
 licorice and special nettle for 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.500
 oily hair so between the tailgate juicy 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.040
 and the body's exactly the same 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.630
 thing 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.600
 the body shampoo is made based 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.660
 of nettles and liquorice and hi lo jo 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.560
 it is made from mango kiwi and 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.570
 pineapple compared to the 2 the smell of 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.400
 body's is nicer than the smell of 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.680
 good laches after that is a detail 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.340
 but the result is completely the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.460
 even 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.230
 after I have a little preference for the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.330
 body and this compared to the boxes all 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.400
 it's better to have two brands 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.440
 different between the shampoo and the 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.970
 point breach like that you know we have 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.710
 always tend to get used to 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.000
 finally skin and hair have 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.770
 always tend to get used to 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.510
 products and suddenly like that I can 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.030
 to alternate so that's fine but in 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.520
 anyway both of them please me totally 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.410
 and I saw the same results with the 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.390
 two but here I have a small 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.320
 preference for corrÃ¨ze after go 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.150
 know why 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.710
 if not for the after shampoo I stay 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.600
 with the vega is what completely 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.810
 changed my hair so I was chilly 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.930
 250 grams and there I recommended in 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.130
 do the 500 grams sorry and I have 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.080
 took two videos because I'm 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.030
 so much in love with 7 after 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.680
 shampoo that I took the biggest 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.270
 formats and at least I know I 'll be 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.490
 never run away so otherwise to talk 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.140
 hair other than the fact that I lose 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.780
 my hair that it's easier to 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.940
 to dry that I have easier to them 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.160
 to style that my hair stays clean 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.110
 at least three days well I find 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.729
 that my scalp and a lot but 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.110
 much more a toy the difference 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.760
 between having to wash your hair 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.350
 practically every two days and 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.690
 to have clean heads for three 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.280
 days later I found a lot more 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.010
 voluminous much softer 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.410
 much brighter and I feel them 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.030
 really in super good health for 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.310
 now I swear by these 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.650
 products have really become my 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.200
 new routine and I think I'm going 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.610
 to be faithful for very very very 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.620
 a long time and that's for sure now 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.770
 the other products dessange et cetera 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.290
 it's over I do not use that kind of 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.150
 product and you know that these two 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.639
 brands are brand that are very 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.669
 dear since these are 100% products 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.080
 natural really both and in addition to 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.669
 that they are not tested on 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.040
 animals so that's where I found 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.830
 really the must have have super 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.300
 beautiful super healthy hair and besides that 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.100
 respect all my principles 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.350
 there are only positive points with 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.210
 these products so blow really 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.520
 really if you can test the 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.950
 shampoos boxes and shampoos 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.710
 CorrÃ¨ze who are really fabulous 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.630
 really tomorrow who saved the parent 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.280
 who really save these are the movies 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.110
 and videos is over so if you have 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.729
 the least question, do not hesitate 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.200
 I will not answer with pleasure as 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:08.700
 usually any case if you already have 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.130
 tested shampoos after shampoos 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.350
 lodges or body is mostly tell me

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.840
 have tested 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.490
