00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.680
 holes return the unboxing sawarmi 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.650
 not and as you can see I am in front of two 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 packages that come from different sites 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.940
 and I 'm not going to open both today because that's how 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.709
 I leave you with the intrigue and if I would not leave 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.470
 a very long video then which of the 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.410
 two will open which of the two this is a 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.230
 little bit heavier surprise we leave it for 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.310
 another day we go with this one that comes from 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.110
 kubik law and while I open it 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.780
 just tell you that the design of the 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.719
 channel has changed a bit I changed the 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.239
 logo and well just add a 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.440
 little more colorful please firm 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.909
 on the comments 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.909
 what do you think about this new design 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.149
 well since we have opened around the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.149
 cubicle card you already know this 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.039
 US store that has everything and in 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.720
 special, I like it a lot for the 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.750
 stickers 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.750
 and this time it's not about 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.040
 stickers or stickers only 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:10.340
 that it's a cube that I eat 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.380
 is this the 357 gans 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.859
 right now another version has just come out 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.369
 from the gans la a-356 I think it's very 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:21.619
 similar but it measures 56 millimeters 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.689
 So, well, you know how it is 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.539
 this buys you a bucket and they go out to 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.539
 market other three other different 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.549
 then it is constantly changing this 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.409
 this three by three and well 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.890
 you all end up shopping 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.780
 crazy let's open it now to talk 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.929
 let's open open this we have for 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.860
 here some spare stickers of the 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.300
 own guns with a logo 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.780
 which I suppose will be the same 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.810
 stickers that come in the bucket too 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.760
 by the way a small tool for 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.440
 adjust the tensions around here you know 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.460
 that the release is different mechanism 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.050
 and this so they are stickers of to 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.690
 big we will see you now later now what 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.490
 important is the cube we are going to open it 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.310
 well wrapped in this plastic 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.200
 I by the way had the only gans that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.200
 I had this on a blue scale 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.910
 and here we have it 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.460
 in this corner a little separated 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.580
 first turns 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.060
 it's the guns they're super super cubes 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.060
 light 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.470
 it does not come too tight as you see and 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.760
 the turn the turn is very smooth and fluid 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.760
 It looks like a pretty fast cube 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.709
 and good because I bought this cube 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.560
 called attention to the whole design 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.800
 true these centers more rounded the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.360
 corners well square and good 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.580
 what effect does the cut of 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.870
 corners let's see it quickly the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.610
 Cutting corners is very very easy in 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.620
 more quantity is a bit more difficult but 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.010
 good inverse cut very easy 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.010
 surprisingly easy 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.180
 up line with line the stickers with 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.280
 those that come then are a few tones 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.019
 pretty standard that remind me of a 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.019
 diane little halos 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.510
 and what stickers are I going to put on myself? 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.400
 my pattern of colors that I leave the link 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.140
 in the description is a pattern that I have 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.310
 created in the cube and that which 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.310
 can you give me like 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.110
 and good as you see blue and green a little 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.990
 more colors are the colors 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.540
 phosphoritos on the kubik led page 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:53.590
 red orange normal and blue yellow 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.220
 I think it was light and white 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.530
 white noja well then to see how 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.810
 the cube is left with these colors because 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.760
 it's probably my color pattern 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:10.060
 for the future we will see as I told you 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.500
 the mechanism of the guns is different not 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.820
 is the typical screw but the core 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.920
 this I will teach calmly another day 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.660
 because I have to study it and this is 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.360
 a video of unboxing and first 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.550
 impressions and it's not plan here from 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.910
 spread too much about everything without me 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.190
 have seen how the cube is not here you see 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.480
 that with this tool we can loosen 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.910
 and press 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.550
 and good nothing else to add because I 've 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.590
 bought this bucket since you already know that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.250
 right now Felix is ​​the cube that is 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.890
 using as your main cube 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.170
 so good does not mean that 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.630
 only with that I'm going to improve my 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.330
 times at all the main reason 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.530
 it was the design I liked these edges 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:01.790
 well rounded combined with corners 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:04.520
 it was very square truth the center more 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.070
 round and good something different or it 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.290
 thanks is appreciated in these designs 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.870
 so a little different this cube already 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.090
 he has his time taken out now 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.190
 many months but good 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.020
 thank you to cover him well I can try 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.070
 this cube and nothing else I hope that I have 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.840
 liked the video 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.990
 I have to get a little familiar with 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.510
 these new sensations but the truth 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.720
 is that this first contact pretty 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.350
 pretty good it's hard to move the cube 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.510
 here in front of the camera but good 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.290
 sometimes it happened a little bit the turns 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.180
 I have to see how it's going to go 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.030
 here until here today's video I hope 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.250
 that you liked and soon another 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.250
