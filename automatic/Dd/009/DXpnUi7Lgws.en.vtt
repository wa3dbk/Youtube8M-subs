this<00:00:24.420> game<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.019> must<00:00:25.230> confess<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:26.420> again<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
this game I must confess for again this

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.810 
this game I must confess for again this
you<00:00:28.740> know<00:00:29.060> considerably<00:00:30.060> old<00:00:31.610> he's<00:00:32.610> probably

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
you know considerably old he's probably

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.360 
you know considerably old he's probably
one<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> few<00:00:33.570> exceptions<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.890> racing

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
one of the few exceptions of a racing

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.360 
one of the few exceptions of a racing
game<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.640> has<00:00:36.410> stood<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> test<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:38.010> time

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
game that has stood the test of time

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.350 
game that has stood the test of time
perhaps<00:00:38.910> better<00:00:39.390> than<00:00:40.760> many<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.940> his<00:00:42.120> other

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
perhaps better than many of his other

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.650 
perhaps better than many of his other
contemporaries<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.180> graphics

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
contemporaries the the graphics

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.220 
contemporaries the the graphics
obviously<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:47.129> lot<00:00:47.940> dated<00:00:48.480> compared<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
obviously a a lot dated compared to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.000 
obviously a a lot dated compared to
today's<00:00:50.360> f1<00:00:51.360> games<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.050> racing<00:00:52.469> games<00:00:52.680> but

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
today's f1 games and racing games but

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.850 
today's f1 games and racing games but
they're<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.090> pretty<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
they're actually pretty good for the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.319 
they're actually pretty good for the
time<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.660> I<00:00:58.070> think<00:00:59.070> they<00:00:59.280> certainly<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.910> stand

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
time and I think they certainly do stand

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
time and I think they certainly do stand
up<00:01:00.510> quite<00:01:00.870> well<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.199> mean<00:01:01.500> obviously<00:01:01.620> there

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
up quite well I mean obviously there

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.299 
up quite well I mean obviously there
there's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.449> lack<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> geometry<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.650> terms<00:01:05.040> of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
there's a lack of geometry in terms of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.710 
there's a lack of geometry in terms of
the<00:01:05.400> tires<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:06.090> still<00:01:06.420> look<00:01:06.659> very<00:01:08.720> cuboid

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the tires they still look very cuboid

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080 
the tires they still look very cuboid
and<00:01:10.080> rough<00:01:10.560> around<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.979> edges<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> can

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and rough around the edges as you can

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.700 
and rough around the edges as you can
see<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> car<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:12.930> don't<00:01:13.080> happen

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
see on the car they don't happen

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.890 
see on the car they don't happen
anywhere<00:01:14.460> near<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> number<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.270> polygons

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
anywhere near the number of polygons

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.539 
anywhere near the number of polygons
that<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:17.460> modern-day<00:01:18.049> racing<00:01:19.049> games<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.619> but

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that the modern-day racing games out but

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
that the modern-day racing games out but
in<00:01:20.670> terms<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> actual<00:01:21.780> track<00:01:22.110> detail<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
in terms of the actual track detail and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.630 
in terms of the actual track detail and
and<00:01:23.970> speed<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.080> performance<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and speed and performance and so on is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.630 
and speed and performance and so on is
not<00:01:27.170> actually<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> lot<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.340> fault

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
not actually really a lot you can fault

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.420 
not actually really a lot you can fault
the<00:01:29.790> game<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> still<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.960> he<00:01:31.110> does<00:01:31.430> stand

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the game on I still think he does stand

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.140 
the game on I still think he does stand
up<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> test<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.479> time<00:01:33.750> quite<00:01:34.140> well<00:01:35.150> what

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
up to the test of time quite well what

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.050 
up to the test of time quite well what
is<00:01:36.590> notable<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> playing<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> game<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
is notable and playing the game is the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.160 
is notable and playing the game is the
control<00:01:39.509> system<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.939> is<00:01:42.740> sort<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.920> very

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
control system and is sort of very

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.630 
control system and is sort of very
unpredictable<00:01:46.170> shall<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.979> say<00:01:47.189> which<00:01:47.430> was

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
unpredictable shall we say which was

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.800 
unpredictable shall we say which was
kind<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:49.729> par<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.000> course<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.659> many

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
kind of par for the course with many

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.240 
kind of par for the course with many
racing<00:01:52.380> games<00:01:53.180> back<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.570> sort<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.960> era

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
racing games back in this sort of era

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.270 
racing games back in this sort of era
the<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> fact<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.259> could<00:01:58.530> end<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.860> sort

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the the fact that you could end up sort

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.060 
the the fact that you could end up sort
of<00:01:59.340> either<00:01:59.579> suffering<00:02:00.479> from<00:02:01.040> oversteer<00:02:02.040> or

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
of either suffering from oversteer or

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.249 
of either suffering from oversteer or
understeer

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.920 

pretty<00:02:06.040> much<00:02:06.250> happening<00:02:06.820> quite<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.119> lot<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.540> f1

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
pretty much happening quite a lot of f1

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.290 
pretty much happening quite a lot of f1
games<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.709> would<00:02:09.489> imagine<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:10.119> something

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
games I would imagine it's something

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.690 
games I would imagine it's something
that<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:11.110> adjust<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.950> options<00:02:12.430> but<00:02:12.670> I

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
that you can adjust in the options but I

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.940 
that you can adjust in the options but I
kind<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.150> just<00:02:13.360> plug<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.020> game<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.709> offer

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
kind of just plug this game in and offer

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.770 
kind of just plug this game in and offer
when<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.489> just<00:02:15.700> wanted<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.360> what<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.599> looked

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
when I just wanted to see what it looked

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.800 
when I just wanted to see what it looked
like<00:02:16.959> for<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.319> purposes<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:19.180> video<00:02:19.569> and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
like for the purposes of this video and

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.440 
like for the purposes of this video and
I<00:02:19.900> have<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.230> say<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:20.950> am<00:02:21.819> really<00:02:22.300> impressed

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
I have to say that I am really impressed

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.020 
I have to say that I am really impressed
by<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:25.830> what's<00:02:26.830> kind<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.220> interesting<00:02:27.310> as<00:02:27.880> well

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
by it what's kind of interesting as well

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.970 
by it what's kind of interesting as well
is<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.690> number<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.319> tracks<00:02:29.709> that's<00:02:31.830> there<00:02:32.830> in

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
is the number of tracks that's there in

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.770 
is the number of tracks that's there in
this<00:02:33.190> game<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.700> are<00:02:33.790> no<00:02:33.940> longer<00:02:34.120> part<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.630> the

this game that are no longer part of the

this game that are no longer part of the
f1<00:02:35.110> calendar<00:02:35.319> mean<00:02:35.800> this<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:37.030> is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
f1 calendar mean this is this is

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.390 
f1 calendar mean this is this is
Argentina<00:02:37.900> for<00:02:38.230> example<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:41.280> you're<00:02:42.280> now

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
Argentina for example and you're now

Argentina for example and you're now
going<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> end<00:02:42.880> up<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.239> on<00:02:43.510> it's<00:02:43.720> washed<00:02:43.989> RIA

going to end up going on it's washed RIA
kind<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.739> like<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.130> a1<00:02:45.489> ring<00:02:45.730> there<00:02:45.910> was<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.030> bit

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
kind of like the a1 ring there was a bit

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.059 
kind of like the a1 ring there was a bit
disappointed<00:02:46.959> when<00:02:47.110> he<00:02:47.200> he<00:02:47.530> was<00:02:47.680> dropped<00:02:47.950> from

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
disappointed when he he was dropped from

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.420 
disappointed when he he was dropped from
the<00:02:48.160> Formula<00:02:48.700> One<00:02:48.850> calendar<00:02:50.280> because<00:02:51.280> it

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
the Formula One calendar because it

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.890 
the Formula One calendar because it
meant<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.790> was<00:02:51.819> dropped<00:02:52.120> from<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.450> Formula

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
meant it was dropped from the Formula

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.840 
meant it was dropped from the Formula
One<00:02:52.930> games<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.650> actually<00:02:53.799> quite<00:02:54.250> liked<00:02:54.580> it

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
One games and I actually quite liked it

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.460 
One games and I actually quite liked it
I<00:02:56.910> still<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.510> dream<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.049> day<00:02:59.230> where

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
I still so dream of the day where

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.920 
I still so dream of the day where
there'll<00:02:59.709> be<00:02:59.739> a<00:02:59.890> an<00:03:00.370> octa<00:03:00.700> day<00:03:00.880> f1<00:03:01.360> game<00:03:01.630> that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
there'll be a an octa day f1 game that

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.370 
there'll be a an octa day f1 game that
will<00:03:02.140> not<00:03:02.410> be<00:03:02.590> necessarily<00:03:03.160> licensed<00:03:04.030> for<00:03:04.380> one

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
will not be necessarily licensed for one

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.229 
will not be necessarily licensed for one
particular<00:03:05.590> season<00:03:06.489> but<00:03:06.700> will<00:03:06.819> actually

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
particular season but will actually

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.500 
particular season but will actually
allow<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.720> race<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.350> f1<00:03:08.709> cars<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.340> all

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
allow you to race the f1 cars and all

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.030 
allow you to race the f1 cars and all
manner<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.630> different<00:03:11.170> tracks<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:11.890> that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
manner of different tracks I think that

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.789 
manner of different tracks I think that
would<00:03:12.220> be<00:03:12.480> rather<00:03:13.480> interesting<00:03:14.260> because<00:03:14.290> as<00:03:14.769> I

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
would be rather interesting because as I

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.360 
would be rather interesting because as I
said<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.070> did<00:03:15.250> quite<00:03:15.579> like<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.090> a1<00:03:16.959> ring<00:03:17.370> he's

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
said I did quite like the a1 ring he's

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.190 
said I did quite like the a1 ring he's
also<00:03:18.579> interesting<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.209> know<00:03:19.480> as<00:03:19.660> well<00:03:19.870> but

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
also interesting to know as well but

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.150 
also interesting to know as well but
this<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.799> still<00:03:21.190> from<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.670> age<00:03:21.790> where<00:03:22.950> f1<00:03:23.950> did

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
this is still from the age where f1 did

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.740 
this is still from the age where f1 did
his<00:03:24.250> rather<00:03:24.519> silly<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:26.109> pointless<00:03:26.500> and

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
his rather silly and pointless and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.319 
his rather silly and pointless and
experimentation<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:29.140> groove<00:03:29.440> tires<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:31.180> an

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
experimentation with groove tires in an

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.000 
experimentation with groove tires in an
attempt<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.750> try<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.019> slow<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.590> cars<00:03:32.829> down

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.810 

thus<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.459> impact<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.120> had<00:03:37.299> on<00:03:37.350> on<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:39.370> racing

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
thus of impact it had on on the racing

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.880 
thus of impact it had on on the racing
was<00:03:39.940> quite<00:03:40.239> profound<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.140> thankfully<00:03:41.709> these

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
was quite profound and thankfully these

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.620 
was quite profound and thankfully these
days<00:03:42.190> they've<00:03:42.430> gotten<00:03:42.730> back<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:43.060> slick<00:03:43.299> tyres

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
days they've gotten back to slick tyres

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.220 
days they've gotten back to slick tyres
which<00:03:43.959> makes<00:03:44.260> far<00:03:44.709> more<00:03:44.739> sense<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:47.109> the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
which makes far more sense and in the

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.900 
which makes far more sense and in the
horrible<00:03:47.709> grooved<00:03:48.010> tires<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.640> they<00:03:48.670> had

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
horrible grooved tires that they had

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.890 
horrible grooved tires that they had
through<00:03:49.209> for<00:03:49.750> many<00:03:50.049> years<00:03:50.470> which<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:52.510> was

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
through for many years which just was

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.900 
through for many years which just was
ridiculous<00:03:53.590> they<00:03:53.890> look<00:03:54.069> completely<00:03:54.310> wrong

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
ridiculous they look completely wrong

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.309 
ridiculous they look completely wrong
they<00:03:55.120> look<00:03:55.299> stupid<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:58.030> was<00:03:58.600> sort<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.079> glad

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
they look stupid and I was sort of glad

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.520 
they look stupid and I was sort of glad
when<00:04:00.060> my<00:04:01.060> foreign<00:04:01.389> cars<00:04:01.600> were<00:04:01.780> bouts<00:04:02.049> wearing

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
when my foreign cars were bouts wearing

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.099 
when my foreign cars were bouts wearing
slick<00:04:02.799> tyres<00:04:03.130> I<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:03.700> think<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:04.090> was<00:04:04.239> total

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
slick tyres I just think it was total

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.900 
slick tyres I just think it was total
overkill<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.739> know<00:04:05.799> why<00:04:06.100> they<00:04:06.280> did<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.579> in<00:04:06.700> the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
overkill I know why they did it in the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.509 
overkill I know why they did it in the
wake<00:04:07.090> of<00:04:07.120> what<00:04:07.510> happened<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.930> him<00:04:08.109> alone<00:04:08.350> in

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
wake of what happened to him alone in

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.430 
wake of what happened to him alone in
1994<00:04:09.519> but<00:04:10.209> they<00:04:10.420> were<00:04:10.510> better<00:04:10.750> ways<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.049> make

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
1994 but they were better ways to make

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.240 
1994 but they were better ways to make
the<00:04:11.590> cars

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
the cars

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.510 
the cars
slower<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:14.170> he<00:04:14.380> didn't<00:04:14.620> really<00:04:14.860> work<00:04:15.040> anyway

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
slower and he didn't really work anyway

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.910 
slower and he didn't really work anyway
because<00:04:15.940> whenever<00:04:16.840> they<00:04:17.170> tried<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.470> put<00:04:17.769> these

and<00:04:30.910> they<00:04:31.000> pretty<00:04:31.240> much<00:04:31.450> dead<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:33.160> just

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
and they pretty much dead and it just

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.910 
and they pretty much dead and it just
made<00:04:33.700> overtaking<00:04:34.510> more<00:04:34.660> difficult<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.440> it

made overtaking more difficult and it

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.470 
made overtaking more difficult and it
was<00:04:36.070> rather<00:04:36.250> stupid<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:37.000> in<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.180> end<00:04:37.330> they

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
was rather stupid and in the end they

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.230 
was rather stupid and in the end they
decided<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:38.050> he<00:04:38.380> was<00:04:38.530> better<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:39.010> have

decided that he was better to have
actually<00:04:40.240> have<00:04:40.420> a<00:04:40.450> spectacle<00:04:41.140> rather<00:04:41.410> than

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
Monaco and this is always a good tester

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.360 
Monaco and this is always a good tester
of<00:04:57.820> how<00:04:58.630> good<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.050> game<00:04:59.260> looks<00:04:59.590> is<00:04:59.830> how<00:05:00.070> good

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
of how good the game looks is how good

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.080 
of how good the game looks is how good
is<00:05:00.520> Monaco<00:05:01.000> because<00:05:01.180> he's<00:05:02.669> one<00:05:03.669> of<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:03.880> very

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
is Monaco because he's one of the very

is Monaco because he's one of the very
few<00:05:04.390> racetracks<00:05:05.050> where<00:05:05.169> there's<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.560> hell<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:05.860> a

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
few racetracks where there's a hell of a

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.830 
few racetracks where there's a hell of a
lot<00:05:06.190> of<00:05:06.280> trucks<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.760> had<00:05:06.880> detailed<00:05:07.330> going<00:05:07.690> on

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
lot of trucks I had detailed going on

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.980 
lot of trucks I had detailed going on
and<00:05:08.520> as<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:09.640> can<00:05:09.790> see<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:10.030> got<00:05:10.210> beat<00:05:10.510> up<00:05:10.540> by<00:05:10.930> two

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
and as you can see I got beat up by two

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.990 
and as you can see I got beat up by two
McLaren<00:05:11.800> straight<00:05:12.160> away<00:05:12.370> on<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.820> first

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
McLaren straight away on the first

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.409 
McLaren straight away on the first
corner<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:15.550> other<00:05:15.669> interesting<00:05:16.210> thing

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
corner and the other interesting thing

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.570 
corner and the other interesting thing
to<00:05:16.630> know<00:05:16.780> is<00:05:16.990> here<00:05:17.260> the<00:05:17.470> attention<00:05:17.979> to<00:05:18.130> detail

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
to know is here the attention to detail

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.520 
to know is here the attention to detail
actually<00:05:18.790> goes<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.720> point<00:05:19.990> where<00:05:20.140> it<00:05:20.350> was

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
actually goes to the point where it was

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.870 
actually goes to the point where it was
the<00:05:22.080> tire<00:05:23.080> manufacturer<00:05:23.740> war<00:05:24.190> going<00:05:24.580> on<00:05:24.700> I

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
the tire manufacturer war going on I

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.719 
the tire manufacturer war going on I
thinking<00:05:25.270> is<00:05:25.419> between<00:05:25.870> Goodyear<00:05:26.380> and

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
thinking is between Goodyear and

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.909 
thinking is between Goodyear and
Bridgestone<00:05:27.729> so<00:05:28.360> depending<00:05:28.840> on<00:05:28.930> which<00:05:29.140> car

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
Bridgestone so depending on which car

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.550 
Bridgestone so depending on which car
you<00:05:30.070> driving<00:05:30.669> will<00:05:31.600> actually<00:05:32.020> have<00:05:32.260> either

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
you driving will actually have either

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.159 
you driving will actually have either
Goodyear<00:05:33.130> or<00:05:33.550> Bridgestone<00:05:34.360> Tire<00:05:34.660> stuck<00:05:35.020> on

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
Goodyear or Bridgestone Tire stuck on

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.810 
Goodyear or Bridgestone Tire stuck on
him<00:05:35.320> I<00:05:35.500> don't<00:05:35.890> think<00:05:36.070> it<00:05:36.190> makes<00:05:36.370> too<00:05:36.640> much

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
him I don't think it makes too much

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.850 
him I don't think it makes too much
difference<00:05:37.330> to<00:05:37.450> the<00:05:37.570> actual<00:05:37.990> gameplay<00:05:38.229> itself

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
difference to the actual gameplay itself

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.090 
difference to the actual gameplay itself
but<00:05:39.130> it's<00:05:39.250> just<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.550> nice<00:05:39.700> inner<00:05:40.419> detail<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.890> as

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
but it's just a nice inner detail and as

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.560 
but it's just a nice inner detail and as
you<00:05:42.220> can<00:05:42.370> see<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:42.580> nice<00:05:42.790> bit<00:05:43.030> of<00:05:43.120> detail<00:05:43.540> on

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
you can see the nice bit of detail on

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.880 
you can see the nice bit of detail on
the<00:05:43.810> wall<00:05:44.020> there<00:05:44.290> that<00:05:44.470> I<00:05:44.500> just<00:05:44.740> keep

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
the wall there that I just keep

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.540 
the wall there that I just keep
repeatedly<00:05:45.580> hitting<00:05:45.790> and<00:05:47.220> but<00:05:48.220> I<00:05:48.280> mean<00:05:48.400> as<00:05:48.520> you

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
repeatedly hitting and but I mean as you

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.000 
repeatedly hitting and but I mean as you
can<00:05:48.700> see<00:05:49.090> is<00:05:49.390> still<00:05:50.350> a<00:05:50.380> pretty<00:05:50.740> good-looking

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
can see is still a pretty good-looking

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.230 
can see is still a pretty good-looking
game<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:52.979> it's<00:05:53.979> still<00:05:54.400> well<00:05:54.610> presented<00:05:55.180> I

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
game and it's still well presented I

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.120 
game and it's still well presented I
mean<00:05:55.390> if<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:55.570> don't<00:05:55.720> mind<00:05:55.840> all<00:05:56.200> the<00:05:56.440> drivers

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
mean if you don't mind all the drivers

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.540 
mean if you don't mind all the drivers
and<00:05:57.430> statistics<00:05:58.390> and<00:05:58.630> cars<00:05:58.930> and<00:05:59.320> so<00:06:00.100> on<00:06:00.130> and<00:06:00.400> so

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
and statistics and cars and so on and so

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.630 
and statistics and cars and so on and so
forth<00:06:00.880> be<00:06:01.090> now<00:06:01.300> today<00:06:01.979> it<00:06:02.979> is<00:06:03.100> still<00:06:03.400> well

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
forth be now today it is still well

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.370 
forth be now today it is still well
worth<00:06:03.820> tracking<00:06:04.180> down<00:06:04.510> and<00:06:04.720> having<00:06:04.840> a<00:06:05.020> go<00:06:05.169> on<00:06:05.200> I

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
worth tracking down and having a go on I

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.839 
worth tracking down and having a go on I
mean<00:06:05.590> I<00:06:05.710> only<00:06:05.830> tend<00:06:06.130> to<00:06:06.280> go<00:06:06.400> back<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.850> it

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
mean I only tend to go back to it

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.600 
mean I only tend to go back to it
tweak<00:06:08.849> the<00:06:09.030> control<00:06:09.479> system<00:06:09.960> so<00:06:10.289> don't<00:06:10.610> handle

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
tweak the control system so don't handle

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.850 
tweak the control system so don't handle
having<00:06:12.479> a<00:06:12.569> race<00:06:12.750> of<00:06:12.960> bumper<00:06:13.379> cars<00:06:13.590> going

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
having a race of bumper cars going

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.559 
having a race of bumper cars going
around<00:06:14.129> the<00:06:14.250> circuit<00:06:14.759> that<00:06:14.909> I<00:06:14.940> actually<00:06:15.210> do

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
around the circuit that I actually do

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.770 
around the circuit that I actually do
end<00:06:15.780> up<00:06:16.639> being<00:06:17.639> able<00:06:17.759> to<00:06:17.970> have<00:06:18.210> some<00:06:18.479> semblance

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
end up being able to have some semblance

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.830 
end up being able to have some semblance
of<00:06:19.259> control<00:06:19.710> over<00:06:19.949> the<00:06:20.190> cars<00:06:20.449> believe<00:06:21.449> me<00:06:21.659> it's

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
of control over the cars believe me it's

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.930 
of control over the cars believe me it's
a<00:06:21.870> lot<00:06:22.379> more<00:06:22.530> difficult<00:06:23.159> than<00:06:23.220> it<00:06:23.490> looks

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
a lot more difficult than it looks

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.760 
a lot more difficult than it looks
especially<00:06:24.629> Monica<00:06:25.199> when<00:06:25.349> you<00:06:25.470> start

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
especially Monica when you start

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.320 
especially Monica when you start
bouncing<00:06:26.280> off<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.580> walls<00:06:26.789> of<00:06:27.030> he's<00:06:27.150> like

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
bouncing off the walls of he's like

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.490 
bouncing off the walls of he's like
being<00:06:27.539> stuck<00:06:27.900> inside<00:06:28.139> a<00:06:28.349> pinball<00:06:28.889> machine<00:06:30.500> you

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
being stuck inside a pinball machine you

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.610 
being stuck inside a pinball machine you
know<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.740> same<00:06:31.949> can<00:06:32.159> be<00:06:32.190> said<00:06:32.310> with<00:06:32.610> a<00:06:32.639> with<00:06:33.620> f1

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
know the same can be said with a with f1

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.279 
know the same can be said with a with f1
2011<00:06:35.520> that's<00:06:36.030> equally<00:06:36.449> difficult<00:06:37.020> as<00:06:37.139> well

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
2011 that's equally difficult as well

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.439 
2011 that's equally difficult as well
together<00:06:37.710> to<00:06:38.129> get<00:06:38.280> round<00:06:38.430> Monica<00:06:38.909> so<00:06:39.150> it's<00:06:39.300> by

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
together to get round Monica so it's by
