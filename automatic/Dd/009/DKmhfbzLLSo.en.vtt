00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:12.879
 Yes Domo Oh by this time try the collapse of the building, which has been often used even pv 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:14.800
 It will come out anyway, but it will come out already 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:20.140
 I will do it 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:23.430
 Let's try winding with smoke ao ao 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.430
 It's like this 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:31.090
 It and the smoke waiting time will be displayed here 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.090
 HM 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.500
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.500
 Jeep curiosity 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.340
 I'm getting better 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:54.660
 So all you need to do to break down the building is to just attack this breaking pillar 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.030
 Only 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:04.850
 If it is the main gun of a tank, it can be completely destroyed in about 2 shots 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.850
 Well then I will break everything 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.200
 Ute 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:34.410
 This is the only pillar I can aim from here, but I have to aim from the other side after that 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:41.420
 Now when I do in combat but not one else 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.420
 It will not be easy to break like this because it is disturbed 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.800
 On the other side 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.670
 So that's the only pillar I'm aiming for from here 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.649
 Winnie the Pooh giggle giggle of Yan against the flop Tanaka 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.649

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:12.450
 When after Do I'm useful when the helicopter or Tekigai came flying it is to escape from the enemy when you are swimming 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.330
 It seems to be usable, too 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.400

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.599
