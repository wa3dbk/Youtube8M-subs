00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
better visibility on backing up and also

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.890 
better visibility on backing up and also
fuel<00:01:35.530> economy<00:01:35.770> because<00:01:36.130> there's<00:01:36.280> less<00:01:36.430> drag

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.860 

and<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.280> tailgate<00:01:41.520> partially<00:01:42.210> open<00:01:42.540> you

and with the tailgate partially open you

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.810 
and with the tailgate partially open you
have<00:01:42.990> less<00:01:43.200> wind<00:01:43.440> resistance<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:44.700> were

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
have less wind resistance like you were

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.550 
have less wind resistance like you were
saying<00:01:45.000> earlier<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.260> makes<00:01:46.410> a<00:01:46.470> lot

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
saying earlier and so that makes a lot

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
saying earlier and so that makes a lot
of<00:01:46.590> sense<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.040> better<00:01:47.190> fuel<00:01:47.460> economy

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
of sense you have better fuel economy

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.430 
of sense you have better fuel economy
yeah<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.690> also<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.110> you're<00:01:49.260> if

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
it's a lot easier than getting out

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.370 
it's a lot easier than getting out
putting<00:01:57.180> down<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.390> tailgate<00:01:57.780> backing<00:01:58.230> up
