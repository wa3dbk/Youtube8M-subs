after a while I started painting with

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.190 
after a while I started painting with
coffee<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.610> coffee<00:00:38.610> worked<00:00:39.120> really<00:00:39.450> well<00:00:39.600> and

and liquor and all kinds of stuff and
beer<00:00:55.949> has<00:00:56.100> been<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.640> really<00:00:57.390> successful

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

venture<00:01:04.070> it's<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.159> little<00:01:05.430> more<00:01:05.549> difficult

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
venture it's a little more difficult

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.320 
venture it's a little more difficult
than<00:01:06.270> normal<00:01:07.200> paint<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:09.090> come

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
than normal paint because it will come

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.020 
than normal paint because it will come
off<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.020> spill<00:01:10.439> water<00:01:10.920> drop<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.820> it'll

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
off if I spill water drop on it it'll

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.130 
off if I spill water drop on it it'll
come<00:01:12.270> back<00:01:12.299> off<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.479> don't<00:01:15.479> layer<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.049> on

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
come back off and if I don't layer it on

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.490 
come back off and if I don't layer it on
just<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:18.659> blend<00:01:19.049> well<00:01:19.290> so

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
just right it it will not blend well so

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.640 
just right it it will not blend well so
it's<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> little<00:01:19.890> bit<00:01:20.040> delicate<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:21.650> mostly

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it's a little bit delicate but mostly

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.030 
it's a little bit delicate but mostly
it's<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.189> watercolor
