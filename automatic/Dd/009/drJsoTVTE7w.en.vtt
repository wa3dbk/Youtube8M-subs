 in front of Jobs Palo Alto's house 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.559
 cupertino in general in silicon valley 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.539
 electric car is not something of a discharge 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.610

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.590
 Basil increased attention of people to 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.149
 electric car is clear in the first behind them 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.130
 the future I think with that no one will 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.780
 argue and secondly industry which 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.490
 for several decades it was 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.410
 stagnation finally gave birth to something 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.360
 interesting and no no i like dug 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.039
 saliva on a thousand horses of verona but all 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.319

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.390
 like electric cars well except oh 8 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.580

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.300
 Go buy one to my family is that 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.979
 most famous companies 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.959
 being drawn into this race tells us about 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.819
 seriousness intends unfortunately so far 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.679
 The most popular electric car is 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.080
 nissan leaf but on the other hand also not 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.580
 the worst representative of the kind of what I 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.259
 I tell you all this recently 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.819
 the road of the same silicon valley 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.820
 began to notice such strange 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.590
 minivans with some equipment on 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.360
 roofs which turned out to be 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.370
 owned by apple 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.500
 rides himself and even special and not encrypted 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.360
 At first they suggested that it was possible 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.580
 need for google street view analog 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.230
 only for the floor card equipment top 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.130
 just maybe something to shoot and 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.870
 take pictures 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.400
 By the way, I very much ask you never 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.470
 record video in vertical mode 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.450
 Straight never, never turned the phone 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.160
 horizontally and everything will be fine so here 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.230
 as soon as these mini donuts left for 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.030
 way authoritative editions of types on and 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.550
 showtime sol 2 street journal started 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.440
 writing about apple car after last year 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.330
 apple pay and apple watch have a feeling 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.550
 no ikara is worth the wait 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.320
 carplay bye the only bridge apple in 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.030

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.980
 plus or minus a trillion dollars and dine on 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.380
 This pie is my share I think Tim Cook 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.270
 more than wants but 3 apple development 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.680
 the shelves are code-named project 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.630
 tayton if you think you're somewhere his 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.370
 heard and often not used 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.140
 recently an example of a blizzard closed its 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.269
 next mom after world of warcraft 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.620

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.540
 nobody knows for sure 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.130
 responsible for developing steve for discs 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.780

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.400
 manages the development team from one hundred to 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.110
 thousand people or here johan jungar 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.180

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.769
 research development mercedes-benz 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:34.280
 it's just incredible team at all 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.840
 is going to test as it was from apple 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.730
 watch johnny quince man who 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.330
 responsible for the design introduces bentley 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.220
 mulsanne 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.050
 Well, how does he drive according to himself 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.330
 johnny hasn't got behind the wheel for about a year 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.490
 By the way, recently it was a big one 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.530
 interview new york hands where open 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.900
 eyes on many things for example apple 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.180
 watch is a personal project johnie quince 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.710
 from such affairs a sonju does not have any experience 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.750
 car design well so on 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.970
 heavy if you remember to support the fund 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.590
 Bono red, he took back from behind 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.410
 a feat that was eventually sold on 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.030
 auction Sotheby's for 485 thousand dollars 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.070
 here's another observation from recent 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.290
 past remember barbara fashion show 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.060
 which was filmed on iphone 5s and then 1 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.860
 times and former CEO 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.930
 Barbara Angela Arenes moves to 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.519
 position of senior vice president at apple 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.440
 well this is a short bentley mulsanne movie 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.480
 which, as you will see , was also filmed on 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.540
 iphone 5s and i'm not surprised if 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.470
 very soon we will find out that some 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.270
 top executive from 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.060
 bentley goes to work on the floor for 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.770
 to help the company with what not 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.970
 understandable can be develop 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.970
 any new product 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.340
 besides mulsanne and johnny there is still aston 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.830
 martin db4 with which he participates even 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.139
 at some rare exhibitions but there 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.030
 where lovers of this kind are not 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.010
 I can call it old stuff is a classic and 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.440
 many believe that it is better to go to the general 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.880
 better buy all times sell 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.410
 similar cars at auctions and 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.180
 it is clear that john cannot afford it 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.400

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.200

 public lifestyle however is known 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.650
 that his first car was a used one 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.510

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.850
 as a teenager when I studied at the institute 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.070
 also for some reason wanted boxter not because 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.380
 what is the most affordable and cheap 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.360
 porsche and so know for those who do not have 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.220

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.560
 It affects the overall appearance of the overall design 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.750
 feeling apple car whether it will 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.090
