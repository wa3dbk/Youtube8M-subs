 stuff<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.490> legacy<00:03:05.970> because<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.990> have

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
 stuff on legacy because you have

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.320 
 stuff on legacy because you have
vengeance<00:03:07.380> or<00:03:07.920> do<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.310> any<00:03:08.610> special<00:03:08.970> tag

about<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:54.120> today<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.840> was<00:04:55.140> like<00:04:55.320> oh<00:04:56.010> i

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
about it and today I was like oh i

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.770 
about it and today I was like oh i
had<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:56.430> video<00:04:56.820> because<00:04:56.940> all<00:04:57.180> looking<00:04:57.540> at<00:04:57.600> my

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
had this video because all looking at my

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.500 
had this video because all looking at my
my<00:04:57.960> Derek<00:04:58.490> creeps<00:05:00.530> so<00:05:01.530> anyway<00:05:01.980> I<00:05:02.670> think<00:05:03.090> that

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
my Derek creeps so anyway I think that

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.160 
my Derek creeps so anyway I think that
governs<00:05:04.200> in<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:05.190> way<00:05:05.700> more<00:05:05.910> higher<00:05:06.150> than<00:05:06.480> all

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
governs in is way more higher than all

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.920 
governs in is way more higher than all
the<00:05:07.500> other<00:05:07.890> sets<00:05:08.220> kaerios<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.450> eye<00:05:09.630> creams

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
end sooner or later to be honest is it

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.100 
end sooner or later to be honest is it
will<00:05:20.070> be<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.220> winners<00:05:20.880> will<00:05:21.120> be<00:05:21.150> just<00:05:21.540> like<00:05:21.780> elk

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
will be a winners will be just like elk
