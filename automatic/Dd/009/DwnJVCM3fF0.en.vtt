00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.300 
Nathan Drake minifigure from uncharted 3
I<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.630> looks<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.470> him<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.189> not

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.810 
I think it looks a bit like him it's not
exact<00:01:56.759> obviously<00:01:57.360> he's<00:01:58.200> missing<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.820> gun

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
exact obviously he's missing the gun

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.010 
exact obviously he's missing the gun
