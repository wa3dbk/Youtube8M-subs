00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.630 
that sets him apart instantly and his
base<00:05:56.820> mode<00:05:57.120> is<00:05:57.300> somewhat<00:05:57.810> superb<00:05:58.620> so<00:05:59.310> you<00:05:59.370> can

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
base mode is somewhat superb so you can

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.399 
base mode is somewhat superb so you can
see<00:05:59.909> as<00:06:00.090> a<00:06:00.150> dragon<00:06:00.840> or<00:06:00.990> dinosaur

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
see as a dragon or dinosaur

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.339 
see as a dragon or dinosaur
he<00:06:02.499> is<00:06:02.909> excellent<00:06:03.909> I<00:06:04.089> can't<00:06:04.599> vote<00:06:04.809> him<00:06:05.019> and<00:06:05.259> I'm

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
he is excellent I can't vote him and I'm

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.320 
he is excellent I can't vote him and I'm
not<00:06:05.469> going<00:06:05.709> to<00:06:05.860> because<00:06:06.069> he<00:06:06.279> is<00:06:06.399> that<00:06:06.610> good<00:06:06.849> now

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
not going to because he is that good now

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.019 
not going to because he is that good now
we<00:06:07.389> should<00:06:07.569> transform<00:06:08.050> him<00:06:08.289> this<00:06:09.189> is<00:06:09.489> his

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
we should transform him this is his

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:22.409 
we should transform him this is his
weakest<00:06:13.029> mode<00:06:13.509> will<00:06:14.319> call<00:06:14.830> it<00:06:20.459> I<00:06:21.459> don't<00:06:22.269> know

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
weakest mode will call it I don't know

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.149 
weakest mode will call it I don't know
what<00:06:22.629> we'll<00:06:22.809> call<00:06:22.839> it<00:06:23.139> actually<00:06:23.559> what<00:06:24.009> should

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
what we'll call it actually what should

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:29.040 
what we'll call it actually what should
we<00:06:24.219> call<00:06:24.399> it<00:06:25.559> half<00:06:26.559> ass<00:06:27.300> between<00:06:28.300> robot<00:06:28.779> mode

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
we call it half ass between robot mode

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.619 
we call it half ass between robot mode
and<00:06:29.319> base<00:06:29.709> mode<00:06:30.099> but<00:06:30.610> you<00:06:30.699> know<00:06:30.819> what<00:06:31.119> it's

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:31.629 
and base mode but you know what it's

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:33.269 
and base mode but you know what it's
triptykon<00:06:32.289> and<00:06:32.469> I<00:06:32.709> ain't<00:06:32.860> going<00:06:32.979> to<00:06:33.039> hold<00:06:33.219> it

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:33.279 
triptykon and I ain't going to hold it

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:34.679 
triptykon and I ain't going to hold it
against<00:06:33.639> him<00:06:33.819> because<00:06:33.909> he<00:06:34.119> might<00:06:34.360> come<00:06:34.539> and

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:34.689 
against him because he might come and

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.290 
against him because he might come and
kill<00:06:34.899> me<00:06:35.429> so<00:06:36.429> there<00:06:36.879> you<00:06:36.909> go<00:06:37.029> that's

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
kill me so there you go that's

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.659 
kill me so there you go that's
essentially<00:06:37.779> the<00:06:38.079> second<00:06:38.499> mode<00:06:38.649> still<00:06:39.219> better

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
essentially the second mode still better

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.369 
essentially the second mode still better
than<00:06:39.759> school<00:06:40.089> Polacks<00:06:40.360> base<00:06:40.599> mode<00:06:40.869> but<00:06:41.229> we

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:41.379 
than school Polacks base mode but we

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.290 
than school Polacks base mode but we
haven't<00:06:41.619> seen<00:06:41.860> trypticon<00:06:42.399> base<00:06:42.639> mode<00:06:42.939> yet<00:06:43.149> so

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
haven't seen trypticon base mode yet so

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.989 
haven't seen trypticon base mode yet so
you<00:06:43.360> know<00:06:43.509> what<00:06:43.719> let's<00:06:44.589> transform<00:06:45.429> it<00:06:45.639> into<00:06:45.819> a

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:45.999 
you know what let's transform it into a

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:49.589 
you know what let's transform it into a
base<00:06:46.300> mode<00:06:47.249> Trypticon<00:06:48.249> base<00:06:48.669> mode<00:06:49.029> now

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:55.169

doesn't<00:06:50.319> that<00:06:50.469> look<00:06:51.399> brilliant<00:06:53.969> possibly<00:06:54.969> one

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:55.179 
doesn't that look brilliant possibly one

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:57.329 
doesn't that look brilliant possibly one
of<00:06:55.209> the<00:06:55.360> best<00:06:55.499> transformer<00:06:56.499> base<00:06:56.709> motes<00:06:57.099> ever

00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:57.339 
of the best transformer base motes ever

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.459 
of the best transformer base motes ever
and<00:06:57.519> here's<00:06:57.729> a<00:06:57.789> light<00:06:58.029> see<00:06:58.329> look<00:06:58.539> I<00:06:58.779> don't<00:06:59.409> know

00:06:59.459 --> 00:06:59.469 
and here's a light see look I don't know

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:00.719 
and here's a light see look I don't know
if<00:06:59.529> you're<00:06:59.919> really<00:07:00.099> picking<00:07:00.309> it<00:07:00.459> up<00:07:00.550> on<00:07:00.639> the

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729 
if you're really picking it up on the

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:02.069 
if you're really picking it up on the
camera<00:07:00.999> I<00:07:01.029> know<00:07:01.179> it<00:07:01.239> looks<00:07:01.329> a<00:07:01.449> bit<00:07:01.539> of<00:07:01.659> pathetic

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:02.079 
camera I know it looks a bit of pathetic

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:03.509 
camera I know it looks a bit of pathetic
i<00:07:02.139> think<00:07:02.319> the<00:07:02.379> batteries<00:07:02.739> ago<00:07:02.919> but<00:07:03.129> he<00:07:03.279> has<00:07:03.489> a

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:03.519 
i think the batteries ago but he has a

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:06.299 
i think the batteries ago but he has a
light<00:07:03.819> he<00:07:04.329> has<00:07:04.539> battery<00:07:05.110> operated<00:07:05.469> gizmos<00:07:06.129> and

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:06.309 
light he has battery operated gizmos and

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.790 
light he has battery operated gizmos and
i<00:07:06.879> love<00:07:07.240> that<00:07:07.269> now<00:07:08.019> this<00:07:08.199> is<00:07:08.259> probably<00:07:08.589> getting

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
i love that now this is probably getting

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.259 
i love that now this is probably getting
quite<00:07:09.039> boring<00:07:09.279> we<00:07:09.550> should<00:07:09.699> skip<00:07:09.879> forwards

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:10.269 
quite boring we should skip forwards

00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:12.509 
quite boring we should skip forwards
yeah<00:07:11.259> he<00:07:11.379> does<00:07:11.559> have<00:07:11.709> electric<00:07:12.099> gizmos<00:07:12.490> to

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:12.519 
yeah he does have electric gizmos to

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:14.759 
yeah he does have electric gizmos to
power<00:07:12.939> him<00:07:13.179> you<00:07:13.329> know<00:07:13.449> these<00:07:13.869> little<00:07:14.139> radar

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:14.769 
power him you know these little radar

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:16.169 
power him you know these little radar
thing<00:07:15.069> is<00:07:15.219> but<00:07:15.369> you<00:07:15.459> know<00:07:15.550> what<00:07:15.729> the<00:07:15.819> batteries

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:16.179 
thing is but you know what the batteries

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:17.879 
thing is but you know what the batteries
are<00:07:16.300> gone<00:07:16.419> flat<00:07:16.659> as<00:07:16.809> I<00:07:16.929> said<00:07:17.199> so<00:07:17.469> you<00:07:17.529> know<00:07:17.679> what

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:17.889 
are gone flat as I said so you know what

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.009 
are gone flat as I said so you know what
who<00:07:18.579> cares<00:07:19.059> if<00:07:19.240> you<00:07:19.329> want<00:07:19.479> to<00:07:19.539> find<00:07:19.659> out<00:07:19.869> what

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:20.019 
who cares if you want to find out what

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:22.999 
who cares if you want to find out what
they<00:07:20.139> do<00:07:20.199> go<00:07:20.919> buying<00:07:21.249> yourself<00:07:21.550> all<00:07:22.119> right

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:23.009 
they do go buying yourself all right

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:27.419 
they do go buying yourself all right
Trypticon<00:07:24.009> is<00:07:25.050> possibly<00:07:26.050> one<00:07:26.379> if<00:07:26.679> not<00:07:26.979> the
