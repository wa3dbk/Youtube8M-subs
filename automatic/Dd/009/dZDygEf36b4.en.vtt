00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
couple inches taller I guess when you're

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.590 
couple inches taller I guess when you're
sitting<00:04:38.539> down<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:40.370> depending<00:04:41.060> on<00:04:41.060> how<00:04:41.210> big<00:04:41.570> the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
sitting down so depending on how big the

sitting down so depending on how big the
implant<00:04:41.750> is<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:42.289> guess<00:04:42.800> they<00:04:42.919> use<00:04:43.070> different

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
implant is I guess they use different

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.159

sizes<00:04:43.850> they<00:04:44.060> actually<00:04:44.660> it's<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:44.930> good<00:04:45.050> point

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169
