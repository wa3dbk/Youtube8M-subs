 (Music) 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.790
 Hello good day. I am Saul and I greet you from my kitchen. 

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:22.589
 Today we will prepare a dish of sea and earth, ... 

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:27.262
 ... a stew of potatoes with squid noodles. 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.013
 For the development of this dish we will use potatoes, fresh squid, ... 

00:00:40.422 --> 00:00:45.636
 ... a little parsley, chili, pepper, garlic and an onion or spring onion. 

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:50.677
 We take our potato that we have peeled and we are going to make slices ... 

00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:55.990
 ... about half a centimeter, a little more wide. 

00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:58.992
 Let it be a little wide because our intention is going to be ... 

00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:02.361
 ... that is a hard crust on the outside but that inside is cooked. 

00:01:02.936 --> 00:01:06.424
 We have our potatoes already sliced ​​and we are going to put them to fry. 

00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:09.896
 We will put them with a very strong oil to make that crust ... 

00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:16.604
 ... and then we will go down so that they can confection, so that it is almost pure inside. 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.248
 Let's start with our sauce to boil the potatoes. 

00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:23.776
 We take a garlic, we make a green sauce, since it is a sea dish ... 

00:01:25.016 --> 00:01:28.664
 ... and that green salsita can be interesting. 

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:41.480
 We do the same with our onions, the more finite, the better. 

00:01:46.224 --> 00:01:47.888
 We go to the fire. 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.332
 Once we see that the onion has changed color, ... 

00:01:54.367 --> 00:02:00.459
 ... we add a little water to make that green sauce. 

00:02:02.808 --> 00:02:06.424
 We add the parsley, a little bit of ground white pepper, ... 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.224
 ... the ají, which is a Peruvian pepper that gives a very nice touch ... 

00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:12.008
 ... and a little salt. 

00:02:12.043 --> 00:02:14.424
 Let it reduce a little while we are taking out the potatoes. 

00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:17.176
 We already have those potatoes, they have already finished frying, ... 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.681
 ... remove them from the fire and remove them to absorbent paper. 

00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:28.512
 I already have them as you can see. 

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:39.482
 It remains a crust made on the outside and on the inside very soft ... 

00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:41.809
 ... almost like a kind of puree. 

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:47.425
 We incorporate them so that they finish boiling with that sauce ... 

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.290
 ... and go grab all its flavor. 

00:02:55.097 --> 00:02:57.649
 We have our squid, which we have cleaned at the tap, ... 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.794
 ... we have removed ears, head and we have fully cleaned the skin. 

00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:03.057
 In this case, we are only interested in the body. 

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.976
 We make a square ... This we will take advantage of at another time. 

00:03:08.697 --> 00:03:12.225
 We have our squid completely clean, ... 

00:03:13.497 --> 00:03:15.263
 ... from which we will extract the noodles. 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.632
 The more finite, the better, the nicer. 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:24.885
 We have already cut our squid, they almost look like gulas or even noodles. 

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.517
 So what we put out the fire and with the own residual heat ... 

00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:30.999
 ... let's make it our squid. 

00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:34.973
 In two minutes we will have it, we will see how it has changed color. 

00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:39.032
 It goes from crystalline color to a much whiter color. 

00:03:41.017 --> 00:03:44.386
 We have finished our plate and we are going to put it on. 

00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:52.417
 I'm going to place a base of that potato and place the noodles on top, ... 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:56.218
 ... that does not stop being that squid with all its texture. 

00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:01.755
 We cleaned a little ... 

00:04:04.442 --> 00:04:07.778
 And we decorate with an aromatic plant, a little lavender. 

00:04:10.048 --> 00:04:11.868
 Our plate is finished. 

00:04:14.247 --> 00:04:17.575
