I'm going to turn the scan gauge on and
wait<00:00:14.030> a<00:00:14.060> few<00:00:14.300> minutes<00:00:15.910> turn<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:16.939> key<00:00:17.269> on<00:00:17.300> and

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:27.310 
see what we do we get then I'll try to
crank<00:00:21.019> it<00:00:21.169> there<00:00:22.099> we<00:00:22.189> go<00:00:23.710> so<00:00:24.710> key<00:00:25.369> is<00:00:25.490> off<00:00:26.320> turn

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
crank it there we go so key is off turn

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.870 
crank it there we go so key is off turn
the<00:00:27.499> scan<00:00:27.800> gauge<00:00:28.099> on<00:00:29.980> so<00:00:30.980> right<00:00:31.400> when<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.579> turn

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
the scan gauge on so right when I turn

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.049 
the scan gauge on so right when I turn
it<00:00:32.029> on<00:00:33.340> that's<00:00:34.340> what<00:00:34.489> we're<00:00:34.609> sitting<00:00:34.940> at

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
it on that's what we're sitting at

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:50.350 
it on that's what we're sitting at
hopefully<00:00:38.059> I<00:00:38.269> have<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:38.629> on<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.500> right<00:00:39.680> setting

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.069 

so<00:00:50.960> we're<00:00:51.200> gonna

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
so we're gonna

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.660 
so we're gonna
I<00:00:53.170> don't<00:00:53.620> know<00:00:53.710> how<00:00:53.829> long<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.129> takes<00:00:54.339> to<00:00:54.519> update

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
I don't know how long it takes to update

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:04.139 
I don't know how long it takes to update
but

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:02:00.260 

okay<00:01:04.750> I'm<00:01:05.109> gonna<00:01:05.229> turn<00:01:05.469> the<00:01:05.590> key<00:01:05.770> on<00:01:07.350> she<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.469> on

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.020 

so<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.619> ICP<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.790> at<00:02:03.799> 3606<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.640> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
so you can see the ICP is at 3606 and it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.199 
so you can see the ICP is at 3606 and it
should<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.659> zero<00:02:07.459> fine<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:09.090> I'm

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
should be at zero fine if I'm

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.949 
should be at zero fine if I'm
understanding<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.869> correctly<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.480> IPR

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
understanding that correctly the IPR

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.540 
understanding that correctly the IPR
doesn't<00:02:13.319> seem<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.530> change<00:02:13.800> much<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.400> usually

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
doesn't seem to change much it's usually

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.870 
doesn't seem to change much it's usually
right<00:02:15.060> at<00:02:15.209> fourteen<00:02:15.599> point<00:02:15.900> four<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:17.610> now<00:02:17.760> I'm

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
right at fourteen point four so now I'm

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:35.840 
right at fourteen point four so now I'm
gonna<00:02:18.000> crank<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:19.849> there<00:02:20.849> we<00:02:20.970> go

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.480 

doesn't<00:02:36.630> seem<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.930> me<00:02:37.080> moving<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.650> time<00:02:37.920> of

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
doesn't seem to me moving this time of

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:58.250 
doesn't seem to me moving this time of
course<00:02:38.760> not<00:02:39.150> I'm<00:02:39.360> videotaping<00:02:39.690> it

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:19.420 

here

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:37.180 

and<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.520> cycle<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.000> key<00:03:22.790> key<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.910> off

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.820 

turning<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.060> back<00:03:38.210> on

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
turning it back on

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.940 
turning it back on
keys<00:03:40.490> on<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:43.330> do<00:03:44.330> that<00:03:44.600> there<00:03:45.380> we<00:03:45.500> go<00:03:45.530> so

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
keys on and do that there we go so

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.100 
keys on and do that there we go so
that's<00:03:46.100> changed<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:47.150> little<00:03:47.300> bit<00:03:49.630> okay<00:03:50.660> trying

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
that's changed a little bit okay trying

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.630 
that's changed a little bit okay trying
to<00:03:51.170> start<00:03:51.440> again<00:03:52.630> there<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:53.870> goes<00:03:54.080> right<00:03:54.640> to

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
to start again there it goes right to

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:15.230 
to start again there it goes right to
zero

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.460 

no<00:04:15.860> pee<00:04:16.860> off

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.250 

that's<00:04:21.980> the<00:04:22.190> key<00:04:22.400> off<00:04:23.350> turn<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.440> key<00:04:24.620> on

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
that's the key off turn the key on

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:39.290 
that's the key off turn the key on
keys<00:04:27.260> on<00:04:28.420> 35<00:04:29.420> may<00:04:29.690> be<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:32.020> start

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:50.590 

because<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.140> ICP

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.200 

you<00:04:51.600> know<00:04:51.780> what<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:51.990> think
