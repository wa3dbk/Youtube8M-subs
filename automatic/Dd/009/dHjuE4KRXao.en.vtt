00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
protein is created equal and you'll look

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.960 
protein is created equal and you'll look
at<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.080> front<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.040> bottle<00:01:20.490> package

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
a protein shake here 35 grams of protein

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.910 
a protein shake here 35 grams of protein
but<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.810> want<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.350> cognizant

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
of is the back of the can ok so the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
of is the back of the can ok so the
calorie<00:01:35.670> count<00:01:35.910> on<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.660> a<00:01:37.320> lot<00:01:37.680> lower

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
calorie count on this is a lot lower

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.040 
calorie count on this is a lot lower
than<00:01:38.100> many<00:01:38.490> protein<00:01:38.970> shakes<00:01:39.330> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.900> see

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
than many protein shakes you can see

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.560 
than many protein shakes you can see
it's<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.410> low<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.460> fat<00:01:41.640> content<00:01:41.880> low

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
it's really low in the fat content low

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.900 
it's really low in the fat content low
in<00:01:42.810> carbohydrates<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.460> basic

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
in carbohydrates so this is basic

look at the serving size on the back of
the<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.730> because<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.880> serving<00:02:30.300> size

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the can because the serving size

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.870 
the can because the serving size
sometimes<00:02:31.020> they'll<00:02:31.260> say<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.800> know<00:02:31.890> two<00:02:32.610> point

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
sometimes they'll say you know two point

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.910 
sometimes they'll say you know two point
five<00:02:33.060> servings<00:02:33.540> per<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.230> then<00:02:34.680> give<00:02:34.830> you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
five servings per can and then give you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.520 
five servings per can and then give you
the<00:02:35.070> fat<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.850> below<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.170> when<00:02:37.170> they<00:02:37.290> do<00:02:37.350> that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the fat just below it when they do that

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.080 
the fat just below it when they do that
you<00:02:37.920> basically<00:02:38.100> have<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.610> use<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.060> a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
you basically have to use that as a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.910 
you basically have to use that as a
multiplier<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.019> total<00:02:40.470> fat<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.800> the

antioxidant<00:04:03.290> it's<00:04:04.290> going<00:04:04.439> to<00:04:04.469> stop<00:04:04.769> the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
antioxidant it's going to stop the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.659 
antioxidant it's going to stop the
breakdown<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:05.609> muscle<00:04:06.120> tissue<00:04:06.329> from<00:04:06.840> exercise

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
breakdown of muscle tissue from exercise

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.309 
breakdown of muscle tissue from exercise
and<00:04:08.669> it<00:04:08.819> also<00:04:09.030> helps<00:04:09.510> create<00:04:09.689> l-carnitine

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
and it also helps create l-carnitine

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.470 
and it also helps create l-carnitine
which<00:04:10.620> is<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.799> fat-burning<00:04:11.069> enzyme<00:04:11.700> which<00:04:12.299> is

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
which is a fat-burning enzyme which is

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.089 
which is a fat-burning enzyme which is
good<00:04:12.719> to<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.870> circulating<00:04:13.500> all<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.739> time<00:04:13.889> so

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
good to have circulating all the time so

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.530 
good to have circulating all the time so
you<00:04:14.189> can<00:04:14.219> constantly<00:04:14.669> be<00:04:14.790> running<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.329> fat

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
you can constantly be running that fat

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.110 
you can constantly be running that fat
so<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.780> recommend<00:04:16.099> 500<00:04:17.099> morning<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:17.880> Ed<00:04:20.060> ok<00:04:21.060> so

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
so I recommend 500 morning and Ed ok so

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.600 
so I recommend 500 morning and Ed ok so
omega-3<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.470> third<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:23.250> I'm<00:04:23.340> going<00:04:23.520> to

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
omega-3 is the third that I'm going to

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.279 
omega-3 is the third that I'm going to
recommend<00:04:23.789> it's<00:04:24.570> kind<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.810> complete<00:04:25.169> the

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
recommend it's kind of complete the

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.950 
recommend it's kind of complete the
whole<00:04:25.440> circle<00:04:25.860> it's<00:04:26.610> really<00:04:27.000> good<00:04:27.180> for<00:04:27.510> the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
whole circle it's really good for the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.500 
whole circle it's really good for the
joints<00:04:28.260> it's<00:04:28.650> an<00:04:28.770> anti-inflammatory<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:30.210> lot

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
joints it's an anti-inflammatory a lot

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.909 
joints it's an anti-inflammatory a lot
