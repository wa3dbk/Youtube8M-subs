interesting<00:00:47.940> about<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.480> vertical

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
interesting about it is it's vertical

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
interesting about it is it's vertical
takeoff<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.039> landing<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.660> um<00:00:54.649> well<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:56.300> /<00:00:57.300> if

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
takeoff and landing now um well I'm / if

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.189 
takeoff and landing now um well I'm / if
you<00:00:57.750> pulled<00:00:58.170> eight<00:00:58.579> when<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.870> first<00:01:00.870> when<00:01:01.109> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you pulled eight when you first when you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.799 
you pulled eight when you first when you
start<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> its<00:01:01.800> vertical<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> goes<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.480> if

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
start it its vertical it goes up so if

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
start it its vertical it goes up so if
you<00:01:03.930> hold<00:01:04.170> eight<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.680> goes<00:01:05.070> turns<00:01:05.610> into<00:01:05.790> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
you hold eight it goes turns into it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.030 
you hold eight it goes turns into it
like<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> regular<00:01:06.390> plain<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.710> vertical

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
like a regular plain so it's vertical

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.649 
like a regular plain so it's vertical
takeoff<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.549> landing<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.390> when<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
takeoff and landing and so when you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.510 
takeoff and landing and so when you
start<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> will<00:01:10.409> always<00:01:10.619> be<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.010> vertical

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
start it it will always be in vertical

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.050 
start it it will always be in vertical
mode<00:01:12.049> unless<00:01:13.049> you're<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.729> aircraft

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
flying above a street and there's a car

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.759 
flying above a street and there's a car
you<00:02:19.599> will<00:02:21.599> you'll<00:02:22.599> be<00:02:22.660> able<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.080> lock<00:02:23.319> onto<00:02:23.560> it

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
you will you'll be able to lock onto it

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.500 
you will you'll be able to lock onto it
and<00:02:23.890> fire<00:02:24.250> at<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.580> now<00:02:25.830> now<00:02:27.090> he's<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.120> crashed

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
and fire at it now now he's just crashed

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.809 
and fire at it now now he's just crashed
the<00:02:28.660> plane<00:02:28.750> but<00:02:29.200> that's<00:02:29.590> okay<00:02:29.920> because<00:02:29.950> we<00:02:30.670> are

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
the plane but that's okay because we are

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.770 
the plane but that's okay because we are
getting<00:02:31.090> another<00:02:31.510> one<00:02:32.250> something<00:02:33.250> that's

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
getting another one something that's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.120 
getting another one something that's
interesting<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:34.989> there's<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.530> cheek<00:02:35.800> for<00:02:36.010> this

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
interesting is there's a cheek for this

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.800 
interesting is there's a cheek for this
plane<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.880> can<00:02:37.030> get<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.569> there's<00:02:37.750> a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
plane you can get it and there's a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.059 
plane you can get it and there's a
couple<00:02:38.019> places<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.620> get<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:38.890> can<00:02:38.920> get

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
couple places you can get it you can get

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.250 
couple places you can get it you can get
it<00:02:39.130> at<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.540> yeah<00:02:40.540> actually<00:02:40.750> there's<00:02:41.140> only

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
it at the yeah actually there's only

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.960 
it at the yeah actually there's only
boat<00:02:41.530> there's<00:02:42.160> only<00:02:44.220> two<00:02:45.220> places<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.849> get

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
boat there's only two places you can get

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.850 
boat there's only two places you can get
it<00:02:46.090> sometimes<00:02:46.690> over<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.140> first<00:02:47.410> place<00:02:47.620> that

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
it sometimes over the first place that

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.520 
it sometimes over the first place that
it'll<00:02:48.280> most<00:02:48.549> likely<00:02:48.670> always<00:02:49.090> be<00:02:49.329> there<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
it'll most likely always be there is the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.000 
it'll most likely always be there is the
aircraft<00:02:51.010> carrier<00:02:51.220> by<00:02:51.730> Easter<00:02:52.269> Bay<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
aircraft carrier by Easter Bay and the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.500 
aircraft carrier by Easter Bay and the
second<00:02:54.010> place<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.459> army<00:02:55.299> base<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.810> by<00:02:56.410> los

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
second place is the army base in by los

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.630 
second place is the army base in by los
Los<00:02:58.620> venturous<00:02:59.620> and<00:03:02.130> as<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.280> can<00:03:03.400> see<00:03:03.430> this

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
Los venturous and as you can see this

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.270 
Los venturous and as you can see this
plate<00:03:03.819> is<00:03:03.849> very<00:03:04.000> uncooperative<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:06.010> you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
plate is very uncooperative it it you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.039 
plate is very uncooperative it it you
need<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.459> lot<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.670> speed<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.030> take<00:03:07.180> off<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.810> it's

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
need a lot of speed to take off and it's

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.900 
need a lot of speed to take off and it's
hard<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.950> now<00:03:09.160> we'll<00:03:09.340> move<00:03:09.430> on<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.640> our<00:03:09.819> next

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
hard so now we'll move on to our next

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.800 
hard so now we'll move on to our next
plane<00:03:10.269> this<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.560> puppet<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:13.470> 8400<00:03:14.470> now<00:03:15.810> it

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
plane this is the puppet the 8400 now it

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.780 
plane this is the puppet the 8400 now it
I<00:03:17.170> believe<00:03:17.680> we<00:03:17.799> can<00:03:17.829> only<00:03:18.040> been<00:03:18.250> found<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:18.609> one

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
I believe we can only been found in one

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.890 
I believe we can only been found in one
location<00:03:19.980> we're<00:03:20.980> switching<00:03:21.280> we<00:03:22.150> are<00:03:22.299> origin

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
location we're switching we are origin

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.250 
location we're switching we are origin
and<00:03:23.109> this<00:03:23.799> is<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.269> 8400<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.720> big<00:03:25.900> door<00:03:26.139> is

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
and this is the 8400 the big door is

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.280 
and this is the 8400 the big door is
opening<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.859> here<00:03:27.579> it<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.880> so<00:03:28.329> this<00:03:28.660> plane<00:03:28.989> is

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
opening and here it is so this plane is

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.099 
opening and here it is so this plane is
at<00:03:29.530> its<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.370> past<00:03:30.970> it's<00:03:31.269> an<00:03:31.420> eighty<00:03:31.720> four

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
at its a past it's an eighty four

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.530 
at its a past it's an eighty four
hundred<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.620> it's<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.889> large<00:03:33.400> passenger<00:03:33.880> plane

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
hundred and it's a large passenger plane

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.410 
hundred and it's a large passenger plane
a<00:03:34.569> sort<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.260> like<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> Boeing<00:03:35.769> 747<00:03:36.459> or<00:03:37.030> something

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
a sort of like a Boeing 747 or something

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.979 
a sort of like a Boeing 747 or something
like<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:39.130> just<00:03:39.340> found<00:03:39.609> that<00:03:39.989> it's

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
like that and it just found that it's

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.259 
like that and it just found that it's
found<00:03:41.200> at<00:03:41.319> Las<00:03:41.530> futurus<00:03:41.950> airport<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.700> there's

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
found at Las futurus airport and there's

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.379 
found at Las futurus airport and there's
this<00:03:43.389> really<00:03:43.690> big<00:03:43.959> garage<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:46.000> stand<00:03:46.239> in

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
this really big garage that you stand in

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.000 
this really big garage that you stand in
front<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.900> open<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.440> takes<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.769> long<00:03:47.950> time

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
front of to open it takes a long time

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.210 
front of to open it takes a long time
for<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.579> open<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.180> should<00:03:49.329> be<00:03:49.450> patient<00:03:49.690> and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
for it open so you should be patient and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.410 
for it open so you should be patient and
now<00:03:51.220> while<00:03:51.430> you're<00:03:51.609> in<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.790> garage<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
now while you're in the garage the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.690 
now while you're in the garage the
camera<00:03:53.019> is<00:03:53.079> really<00:03:53.380> confusing<00:03:53.620> but<00:03:54.400> if<00:03:54.579> you

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
camera is really confusing but if you

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.759 
camera is really confusing but if you
just<00:03:54.849> back<00:03:55.060> out<00:03:55.269> him<00:03:55.480> normal<00:03:56.079> and<00:03:56.260> when<00:03:56.650> you're

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
just back out him normal and when you're

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.319 
just back out him normal and when you're
backing<00:03:56.950> out<00:03:57.280> make<00:03:57.579> sure<00:03:57.609> you<00:03:57.910> back<00:03:58.090> out

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
backing out make sure you back out

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:04.970 
backing out make sure you back out
completely<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.290> then<00:03:59.500> use<00:03:59.920> q<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.730> e<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:03.090> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
completely and then use q and e the the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.920 
completely and then use q and e the the
rudder<00:04:05.980> thing<00:04:06.609> and<00:04:06.910> there's<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.359> couple<00:04:07.569> boxes

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
rudder thing and there's a couple boxes

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.630 
rudder thing and there's a couple boxes
by<00:04:08.349> it<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:08.709> it's<00:04:08.889> kind<00:04:09.130> of

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
by it so it's kind of

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
kind of like a like a fat pig of a plane

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.110 
kind of like a like a fat pig of a plane
it's<00:04:32.320> I<00:04:32.650> don't<00:04:33.070> think<00:04:33.280> anybody<00:04:33.520> want<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.030> use

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
it's I don't think anybody want to use

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.970 
it's I don't think anybody want to use
it<00:04:34.240> it's<00:04:34.390> just<00:04:34.510> kind<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.900> there<00:04:35.080> for<00:04:35.380> fun<00:04:35.710> I

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
it it's just kind of there for fun I

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.770 
it it's just kind of there for fun I
don't<00:04:36.250> think<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:36.760> really<00:04:36.970> want<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.300> fly<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.600> at

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
don't think you really want to fly it at

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.180 
don't think you really want to fly it at
all<00:04:39.570> now<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.810> needs<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:41.169> lot<00:04:41.350> of<00:04:41.410> space<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.770> take

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
all now it needs a lot of space to take

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.780 
all now it needs a lot of space to take
off<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:42.430> once<00:04:43.060> you<00:04:43.210> take<00:04:43.450> off<00:04:43.660> here<00:04:44.080> we<00:04:44.200> go<00:04:44.790> you

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
off and once you take off here we go you

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.970 
off and once you take off here we go you
pull<00:04:46.060> up<00:04:46.240> just<00:04:46.510> slightly<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.230> can<00:04:47.500> press

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
pull up just slightly and you can press

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.159 
pull up just slightly and you can press
two<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.820> retract<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.419> landing<00:04:49.450> here<00:04:49.930> that's

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
two to retract the landing here that's

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.470 
two to retract the landing here that's
on<00:04:50.800> most<00:04:51.190> planes<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.700> can<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:51.970> retract<00:04:52.300> the

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
on most planes you can you retract the

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.670 
on most planes you can you retract the
landing<00:04:52.510> gear<00:04:52.930> on<00:04:53.110> others<00:04:53.890> you<00:04:54.130> can't<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:56.200> you

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
landing gear on others you can't and you

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.520 
landing gear on others you can't and you
should<00:04:57.130> be<00:04:57.160> able<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.550> tell<00:04:57.730> so<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:58.690> plan<00:04:58.960> as<00:04:59.260> I

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
should be able to tell so this plan as I

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.250 
should be able to tell so this plan as I
as<00:04:59.770> I<00:04:59.950> said<00:05:00.190> before<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.850> sort<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.540> pig<00:05:01.960> is<00:05:02.169> a

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
as I said before is sort of a pig is a

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.470 
as I said before is sort of a pig is a
big<00:05:02.470> fat<00:05:02.740> halt<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.940> need<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.300> everything

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
big fat halt and you need to everything

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.360 
big fat halt and you need to everything
you<00:05:04.870> do<00:05:05.140> is<00:05:05.320> slower<00:05:05.680> so<00:05:05.980> if<00:05:06.040> you're<00:05:06.190> going<00:05:06.280> to

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
you do is slower so if you're going to

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.180 
you do is slower so if you're going to
turn<00:05:06.730> it's<00:05:07.690> good<00:05:07.930> mix<00:05:08.290> over<00:05:08.919> you<00:05:09.130> should

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
turn it's good mix over you should

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.040 
turn it's good mix over you should
expect<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.760> to<00:05:09.880> be<00:05:10.000> very<00:05:10.030> long<00:05:10.630> wide<00:05:11.320> veranda

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
expect it to be very long wide veranda

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.150 
expect it to be very long wide veranda
it's<00:05:14.050> pretty<00:05:14.430> it's<00:05:15.430> pretty<00:05:15.610> cool<00:05:15.970> it's<00:05:16.360> the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
it's pretty it's pretty cool it's the

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.580 
it's pretty it's pretty cool it's the
useless<00:05:18.160> so<00:05:19.060> when<00:05:19.930> you're<00:05:20.080> flying<00:05:20.260> this<00:05:20.530> plane

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
useless so when you're flying this plane

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.400 
useless so when you're flying this plane
you<00:05:21.220> should<00:05:21.520> not<00:05:22.419> go<00:05:22.600> straight<00:05:22.660> up<00:05:23.050> or<00:05:23.260> you'll

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
you should not go straight up or you'll

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.170 
you should not go straight up or you'll
you'll<00:05:24.100> uh<00:05:24.370> you'll<00:05:25.110> stall<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.410> it's<00:05:27.180> doesn't

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
you'll uh you'll stall and it's doesn't

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.740 
you'll uh you'll stall and it's doesn't
go<00:05:28.390> terribly<00:05:28.810> fast<00:05:29.140> but<00:05:29.680> it's<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.669> jet<00:05:31.270> plane<00:05:31.419> so

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
go terribly fast but it's a jet plane so

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.170 
go terribly fast but it's a jet plane so
you<00:05:32.350> can<00:05:32.470> get<00:05:32.560> some<00:05:32.740> good<00:05:32.890> speed<00:05:33.130> phenom<00:05:33.550> not

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
you can get some good speed phenom not

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.740 
you can get some good speed phenom not
that<00:05:34.419> one<00:05:34.830> this<00:05:35.830> plan<00:05:36.070> has<00:05:36.100> no<00:05:37.060> defense

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
that one this plan has no defense

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.380 
that one this plan has no defense
systems<00:05:38.260> nothing<00:05:38.890> particular<00:05:39.850> it<00:05:39.880> all<00:05:40.210> it

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
systems nothing particular it all it

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.409 
systems nothing particular it all it
does<00:05:40.600> is<00:05:40.979> um<00:05:42.540> just<00:05:43.540> fly<00:05:43.960> around<00:05:44.400> so<00:05:45.400> landing<00:05:46.270> it

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
does is um just fly around so landing it

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.180 
does is um just fly around so landing it
is<00:05:46.600> extremely<00:05:48.030> hard<00:05:49.140> I<00:05:50.140> say<00:05:50.979> this<00:05:51.130> because

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
is extremely hard I say this because

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.930 
is extremely hard I say this because
compared<00:05:52.060> to<00:05:52.180> the<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:54.070> Jump<00:05:54.370> Jet<00:05:54.580> which<00:05:54.760> is

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
compared to the the Jump Jet which is

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.820 
compared to the the Jump Jet which is

have to press like this is I'll probably

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.110 
have to press like this is I'll probably
crash<00:06:04.030> it<00:06:04.300> right<00:06:04.450> now<00:06:05.130> I'll<00:06:06.130> just<00:06:06.490> going<00:06:06.880> for<00:06:07.060> a

crash it right now I'll just going for a

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.990 
crash it right now I'll just going for a
second<00:06:07.450> pass<00:06:07.600> but<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.950> thing<00:06:09.160> that's<00:06:09.280> hard

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
second pass but the thing that's hard

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.670 
second pass but the thing that's hard
about<00:06:10.090> it<00:06:10.240> is<00:06:10.390> it's<00:06:10.570> a<00:06:10.630> pig<00:06:10.870> so<00:06:11.050> everything<00:06:11.410> so

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
about it is it's a pig so everything so

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
and it you need to start breaking an

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.090 
and it you need to start breaking an
extra<00:06:16.850> 10<00:06:17.120> seconds<00:06:17.630> early<00:06:18.520> and<00:06:20.680> what<00:06:21.680> I<00:06:21.710> do<00:06:21.889> is

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
extra 10 seconds early and what I do is

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.120 
extra 10 seconds early and what I do is
I<00:06:22.400> do<00:06:22.460> my<00:06:22.820> past<00:06:23.090> I'm<00:06:23.389> taking<00:06:23.750> a<00:06:23.840> pass<00:06:24.020> I<00:06:24.350> let<00:06:25.100> go

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
I do my past I'm taking a pass I let go

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:31.150 
I do my past I'm taking a pass I let go
I<00:06:25.490> turn<00:06:25.940> I<00:06:26.210> like<00:06:26.449> let<00:06:27.110> go<00:06:27.320> of<00:06:27.470> the<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:30.650> engines

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
I turn I like let go of the the engines

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.770 
I turn I like let go of the the engines
about<00:06:31.430> halfway<00:06:31.729> through<00:06:32.060> the<00:06:32.150> turn<00:06:32.360> and<00:06:32.630> then

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
about halfway through the turn and then

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.930
