00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
about longer it's just like a few

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.630 
about longer it's just like a few
millimeters<00:02:19.040> all<00:02:20.040> right<00:02:20.930> but<00:02:22.610> stronger<00:02:23.610> than

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
millimeters all right but stronger than

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.260 
millimeters all right but stronger than
both<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.120> these<00:02:24.180> values<00:02:24.740> combined<00:02:26.120> which<00:02:27.120> is

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
both of these values combined which is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.800 
both of these values combined which is
180<00:02:27.870> twos<00:02:28.140> all<00:02:28.410> right<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.770> let's<00:02:29.430> move<00:02:29.610> on

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.650 

he<00:02:33.320> doesn't<00:02:33.590> light<00:02:33.710> up<00:02:33.740> though<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.370> no<00:02:34.820> that's

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
he doesn't light up though so no that's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.840 
he doesn't light up though so no that's
scary<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.110> downside

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.530 

and<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.720> let's<00:02:41.050> read<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.260> ability<00:02:41.680> card<00:02:41.860> now

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.949 

observed<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.290> Titan<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.709> course<00:02:47.010> he<00:02:47.670> says<00:02:47.959> play

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
observed on Titan of course he says play

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.410 
observed on Titan of course he says play
during<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.319> battle<00:02:49.530> when<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.069> have<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.420> resent

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
during a battle when you have a resent

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.729 
during a battle when you have a resent
on<00:02:51.569> Titan<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.230> back<00:02:52.379> when<00:02:52.560> an<00:02:52.709> oh

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
on Titan with it back when an oh

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.819 
on Titan with it back when an oh
attached<00:02:54.140> change<00:02:55.140> your<00:02:55.260> Bakugan<00:02:55.500> an

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
attached change your Bakugan an

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.039 
attached change your Bakugan an
attribute<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:57.090> attribute<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.720> your<00:02:57.840> choice

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
attribute to attribute of your choice

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.990 
attribute to attribute of your choice
after<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.799> battle<00:02:59.129> and<00:02:59.220> remove<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.610> backward

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
after the battle and remove all backward

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.789 
after the battle and remove all backward
and<00:03:00.150> I'll<00:03:00.269> attach<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.810> zag<00:03:01.170> don't<00:03:01.379> I<00:03:01.530> didn't

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
and I'll attach to zag don't I didn't

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.569 
and I'll attach to zag don't I didn't
from<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.069> game<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:04.170> basically<00:03:04.500> I'm<00:03:05.099> guessing

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
from the game so basically I'm guessing

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.460 
from the game so basically I'm guessing
you<00:03:05.700> could<00:03:05.790> change<00:03:06.030> attributes<00:03:06.659> to<00:03:07.290> any

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
you could change attributes to any

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.949 
you could change attributes to any
attribute<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.450> wish<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:11.510> they<00:03:12.510> stays

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
attribute that you wish and they stays

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.370 
attribute that you wish and they stays
with<00:03:13.170> that

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.430 

and<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:17.060> can<00:03:17.210> use<00:03:17.540> them<00:03:17.720> actually<00:03:18.290> with

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
and so you can use them actually with

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.460 
and so you can use them actually with
the<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:20.360> can<00:03:20.510> change<00:03:20.690> em<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.900> darkest<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.380> you

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
the you can change em to darkest and you

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.560 
the you can change em to darkest and you
can<00:03:21.590> bring<00:03:21.770> out<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.220> direct<00:03:23.120> Colossus<00:03:23.480> and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
can bring out to direct Colossus and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.250 
can bring out to direct Colossus and
then<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.930> bond<00:03:24.140> there<00:03:24.320> G<00:03:24.470> powers<00:03:25.960> or<00:03:26.960> you

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
then you can bond there G powers or you

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.020 
then you can bond there G powers or you
can<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.590> keep<00:03:27.740> them<00:03:27.950> at<00:03:28.040> Pyrus<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.670> combine

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
can just keep them at Pyrus and combine

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.390 
can just keep them at Pyrus and combine
it<00:03:29.060> with<00:03:29.210> Dragonoid<00:03:30.080> Colossus<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.650> that's<00:03:34.250> a

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
it with Dragonoid Colossus so that's a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.310 
it with Dragonoid Colossus so that's a
you<00:03:34.610> see<00:03:34.790> that's<00:03:35.030> why<00:03:35.240> I<00:03:35.270> said<00:03:35.630> this<00:03:35.990> is<00:03:36.290> a

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
you see that's why I said this is a

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.840 
you see that's why I said this is a
really<00:03:36.770> good<00:03:37.090> guy<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.150> get<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:39.110> anyway<00:03:39.950> you

really good guy to get so anyway you
close<00:03:41.090> them<00:03:41.270> up<00:03:41.330> by<00:03:42.070> closing<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.310> hands<00:03:43.520> first

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
close them up by closing the hands first

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.190 
close them up by closing the hands first
we<00:03:44.390> go<00:03:44.570> one<00:03:45.230> hand<00:03:45.500> one<00:03:45.950> o'clock<00:03:46.960> and<00:03:47.960> then<00:03:48.110> the
