euphoria is the way it was put together

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.360 
euphoria is the way it was put together
it's<00:01:39.660> not<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.229> bunch<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.560> random<00:01:40.979> effects

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
it's not just a bunch of random effects

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.760 
it's not just a bunch of random effects
and<00:01:41.610> fills<00:01:41.880> thrown<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.479> folder<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.650> know

the<00:01:43.890> fact<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.220> these<00:01:44.400> buildups<00:01:44.910> come

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the fact that these buildups come

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600 
the fact that these buildups come
crafted<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.750> construction<00:01:46.440> kits<00:01:46.710> means<00:01:47.400> it's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
crafted in construction kits means it's

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550
