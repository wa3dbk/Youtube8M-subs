thinking<00:00:47.039> somebody<00:00:47.370> would<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.519> had<00:00:47.699> already

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
thinking somebody would have had already

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:55.729 
thinking somebody would have had already
but<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:51.890> seen<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.629> guy<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.140> sure<00:00:55.320> where<00:00:55.530> he

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
but I seen one guy I'm not sure where he

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.939 
but I seen one guy I'm not sure where he
was<00:00:55.859> at<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.309> he<00:00:56.550> did<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> review<00:00:57.149> riding<00:00:57.600> it<00:01:00.949> he

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
was at but he did a review riding it he

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.739 
was at but he did a review riding it he
said<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> sucked<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.819> highway<00:01:03.179> which<00:01:03.480> he's

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
said it sucked on the highway which he's

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.969 
said it sucked on the highway which he's
right<00:01:04.880> but<00:01:06.380> it's<00:01:07.380> not<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.680> meant<00:01:07.920> for

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
right but it's not really meant for

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.679 
right but it's not really meant for
going<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> highway<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.240> meant<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.479> be

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.760 

ripping<00:01:12.689> through<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> streets<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.500> town<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
ripping through the streets in town I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.609 
ripping through the streets in town I
guess<00:01:14.210> which<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.390> does<00:01:17.360> still<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> same<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.350> 94

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
guess which it does still the same in 94

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.230 
guess which it does still the same in 94
that<00:01:22.619> they<00:01:22.829> had<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.340> they<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.670> toned<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
that they had but they just toned it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.020 
that they had but they just toned it
down<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.829> they're<00:01:25.979> saying<00:01:26.340> with

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
down is what they're saying with

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.069 
down is what they're saying with
everything<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:29.329> read<00:01:30.329> about<00:01:32.659> I've<00:01:33.659> owned<00:01:33.899> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
everything I read about I've owned a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.810 
everything I read about I've owned a
GSXR<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.909> was<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> nine<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.539> was<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> 96<00:01:37.399> s<00:01:38.399> read

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
GSXR it was a nine it was a 96 s read

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.420 
GSXR it was a nine it was a 96 s read
edition<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.680> definitely<00:01:44.219> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
edition and that was definitely a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.480 
edition and that was definitely a
different<00:01:45.000> kind<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.420> power<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.200> mean<00:01:47.009> then

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
different kind of power but I mean then

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:56.719 
different kind of power but I mean then
I<00:01:47.609> had<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> CBR<00:01:48.420> 929<00:01:50.210> which<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:53.000> loved<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:55.670> but<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
I had a CBR 929 which I loved it but I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.819

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.150 
there and just so they can do it but
that's<00:02:53.330> probably<00:02:53.480> gonna<00:02:53.720> be<00:02:53.780> Friday<00:02:57.160> all

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
that's probably gonna be Friday all

that's probably gonna be Friday all
right

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.770 

engine<00:03:01.520> same<00:03:01.870> inline-four<00:03:02.870> as<00:03:03.020> I<00:03:03.170> said<00:03:03.440> uh<00:03:04.780> gas

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
engine same inline-four as I said uh gas

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.470 
engine same inline-four as I said uh gas
wise<00:03:07.300> gas<00:03:08.300> tanks<00:03:08.990> probably<00:03:09.290> um<00:03:09.650> between<00:03:10.480> 4.6

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
wise gas tanks probably um between 4.6

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.009 
wise gas tanks probably um between 4.6
and<00:03:12.940> probably<00:03:13.940> four<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.269> half<00:03:14.300> gallons<00:03:14.900> the

five gallon tank I think it's somewhere
like<00:03:18.080> 4.6<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:21.080> gas<00:03:21.260> mileage<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.769> this

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920
