00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
talking about the top 5 someone said I

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
talking about the top 5 someone said I
should<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.710> know<00:02:44.770> put<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.190> little<00:02:45.340> thing

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
should you know put in a little thing

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.520 
should you know put in a little thing
where<00:02:45.610> people<00:02:45.760> can<00:02:46.150> vote<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.690> I'm<00:02:47.260> gonna<00:02:47.380> look

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
where people can vote and I'm gonna look

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.200 
where people can vote and I'm gonna look
into<00:02:47.710> that<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.040> we<00:02:48.250> might<00:02:48.520> be<00:02:48.700> able<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.000> do

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
into that and we might be able to do

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.370 
into that and we might be able to do
that<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:49.570> then<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.840> know<00:02:49.960> you<00:02:50.020> can<00:02:50.230> actually
