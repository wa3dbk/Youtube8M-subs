00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
pregnant so I've arrived at this anchor

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.679 
pregnant so I've arrived at this anchor
and<00:00:18.619> before<00:00:19.160> I<00:00:19.189> utilize<00:00:19.730> it<00:00:19.939> I<00:00:20.060> want<00:00:20.300> to<00:00:20.419> check

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
and before I utilize it I want to check

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.040 
and before I utilize it I want to check
it<00:00:20.839> out<00:00:20.960> we've<00:00:21.349> got<00:00:21.529> one<00:00:21.829> two<00:00:22.460> three<00:00:23.050> possibly

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
it out we've got one two three possibly

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.560 
it out we've got one two three possibly
four<00:00:24.169> pieces<00:00:24.829> of<00:00:25.039> old<00:00:25.460> materials<00:00:26.089> been<00:00:26.300> hit<00:00:26.449> by

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
four pieces of old materials been hit by

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.470 
four pieces of old materials been hit by
the<00:00:26.630> Sun<00:00:26.960> they're<00:00:27.320> crusty<00:00:27.829> we<00:00:28.249> also<00:00:28.400> have<00:00:29.029> a

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
the Sun they're crusty we also have a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.800 
the Sun they're crusty we also have a
good<00:00:29.630> example<00:00:29.989> of<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.499> old<00:00:30.529> triangle<00:00:31.519> problem

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
good example of the old triangle problem

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.420 
good example of the old triangle problem
often<00:00:32.810> you'll<00:00:32.960> find<00:00:33.320> this<00:00:33.500> because<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.370> is

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
often you'll find this because this is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.490 
often you'll find this because this is
an<00:00:34.670> easy<00:00:34.910> thing<00:00:35.149> to<00:00:35.210> set<00:00:35.510> up<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:35.870> it<00:00:35.930> uses<00:00:36.140> the

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
an easy thing to set up and it uses the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.020 
an easy thing to set up and it uses the
least<00:00:36.649> amount<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:37.010> material<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:37.730> has<00:00:37.879> the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
least amount of material but it has the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.639 
least amount of material but it has the
least<00:00:38.210> redundancy<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.170> least<00:00:39.320> strength

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
least redundancy and the least strength

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.290 
least redundancy and the least strength
of<00:00:39.890> any<00:00:40.070> ways<00:00:40.340> that<00:00:40.370> you<00:00:40.609> could<00:00:40.760> set<00:00:40.940> up<00:00:40.969> an

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
of any ways that you could set up an

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.670 
of any ways that you could set up an
anchor<00:00:41.539> from<00:00:41.750> here<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.140> I<00:00:42.170> want<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.500> take<00:00:42.620> a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
anchor from here so I want to take a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.680 
anchor from here so I want to take a
look<00:00:42.859> and<00:00:43.100> see<00:00:43.370> if<00:00:43.519> I<00:00:43.699> could<00:00:43.940> perhaps<00:00:44.180> improve

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
look and see if I could perhaps improve

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.810 
look and see if I could perhaps improve
it<00:00:44.840> before<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.170> use<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.590> anchor<00:00:45.829> as<00:00:45.980> I<00:00:46.219> cut<00:00:46.550> the

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
it before I use the anchor as I cut the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.910 
it before I use the anchor as I cut the
old<00:00:46.910> material<00:00:47.570> I'm<00:00:47.750> gonna<00:00:47.989> also<00:00:48.199> remove<00:00:48.739> it<00:00:48.890> I

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
old material I'm gonna also remove it I

ready to close that loop with my knots
I'm<00:01:17.780> gonna<00:01:17.960> tie<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.170> double<00:01:18.409> fisherman's

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.660 

I<00:01:24.350> want<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.410> pull<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:25.920> knot<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.430> near

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I want to pull it so the knot is up near

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.280 
I want to pull it so the knot is up near
the<00:01:26.790> anchors<00:01:27.150> arrange<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> direction

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the anchors arrange it in the direction

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.770 
the anchors arrange it in the direction
that<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.590> wanted<00:01:28.950> equalized<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.790> figure<00:01:30.660> eight

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that I wanted equalized I figure eight

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.460 
that I wanted equalized I figure eight
to<00:01:30.900> finish<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.260> off<00:01:32.840> if<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.960> didn't<00:01:34.230> have<00:01:34.320> this

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to finish it off if I didn't have this

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.050 
to finish it off if I didn't have this
much<00:01:34.650> material<00:01:34.860> there's<00:01:35.430> other<00:01:35.580> ways<00:01:35.760> that<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
much material there's other ways that I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
much material there's other ways that I
can<00:01:36.240> tie<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.450> knot<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.500> had<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> shorter

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
can tie this knot if I had a shorter

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.810 
can tie this knot if I had a shorter
cord<00:01:38.480> and<00:01:39.480> I<00:01:39.540> could<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.020> an<00:01:40.140> overhand<00:01:40.820> if

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
cord and I could just do an overhand if

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.430 
cord and I could just do an overhand if
I<00:01:41.880> wanted<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:42.390> my<00:01:42.540> master<00:01:42.960> point<00:01:43.200> higher

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
I wanted to make my master point higher

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.300 
I wanted to make my master point higher
then<00:01:44.190> I<00:01:44.280> could<00:01:44.460> use<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> figure<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.210> nine<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
then I could use a figure of nine so you
