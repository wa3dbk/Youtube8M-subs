surfer Joe surfer and kite surfer and so
when<00:01:01.540> when<00:01:01.930> it<00:01:02.020> comes<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.380> shaping<00:01:02.560> surfboards

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
when when it comes to shaping surfboards

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.150 
when when it comes to shaping surfboards
he<00:01:03.940> knows<00:01:04.120> what<00:01:04.240> he's<00:01:04.330> doing<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:09.040> new

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
he knows what he's doing so the new

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.950 
he knows what he's doing so the new
rocket<00:01:09.490> fish<00:01:09.670> line<00:01:09.910> consists<00:01:10.660> of<00:01:10.720> three

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
rocket fish line consists of three

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.230 
rocket fish line consists of three
boards<00:01:11.320> it's<00:01:11.800> a<00:01:11.920> 56<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.850> 59<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.930> 60<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:16.090> is

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
boards it's a 56 a 59 and a 60 this is

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.820 
boards it's a 56 a 59 and a 60 this is
kind<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.510> new<00:01:16.630> concept<00:01:17.080> basically<00:01:17.440> what

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
kind of a new concept basically what

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.920 
kind of a new concept basically what
what<00:01:18.220> it<00:01:18.310> is<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.729> it's<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:19.119> small<00:01:19.420> medium<00:01:19.810> and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
what it is is it's a small medium and

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.469 
what it is is it's a small medium and
large<00:01:19.990> board<00:01:20.470> each<00:01:21.340> board<00:01:21.729> has<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.210> really

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
large board each board has a really

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.969 
large board each board has a really
similar<00:01:22.750> shape<00:01:23.050> it's<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.470> same<00:01:23.680> sort<00:01:23.920> of

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
similar shape it's the same sort of

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.210 
similar shape it's the same sort of
concept<00:01:24.540> they<00:01:25.540> all<00:01:25.690> work<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.619> pretty<00:01:26.830> wide

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
concept they all work in a pretty wide

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.670 
concept they all work in a pretty wide
range<00:01:27.550> of<00:01:27.700> conditions<00:01:27.880> they<00:01:28.360> work<00:01:28.540> from<00:01:29.380> small

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
range of conditions they work from small

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.210 
range of conditions they work from small
surf<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.280> took<00:01:30.640> pretty<00:01:30.850> big<00:01:31.030> syrup<00:01:32.220> but

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
surf to took pretty big syrup but

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.850 
surf to took pretty big syrup but
basically<00:01:33.630> having<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.780> three<00:01:34.960> sizes<00:01:35.229> small

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
basically having the three sizes small

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.190 
basically having the three sizes small
medium<00:01:35.890> large<00:01:36.509> makes<00:01:37.509> it<00:01:37.660> really<00:01:37.810> easy<00:01:37.900> for

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
medium large makes it really easy for

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.560 
medium large makes it really easy for
someone<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.800> purchase<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.640> board<00:01:39.850> make<00:01:40.450> them

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
someone to purchase a board make them

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.530 
someone to purchase a board make them
walking<00:01:40.720> into<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:41.080> into<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.380> shop<00:01:41.650> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
walking into it into a shop and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.350 
walking into it into a shop and
depending<00:01:43.540> on<00:01:43.660> their<00:01:43.780> weight<00:01:44.790> they<00:01:45.790> can<00:01:46.210> pick

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
depending on their weight they can pick

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.430 
depending on their weight they can pick
a<00:01:46.390> board<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.690> know<00:01:46.780> if<00:01:46.900> they're<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.050> medium

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
a board you know if they're a medium

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.109 
a board you know if they're a medium
sized<00:01:47.619> rider<00:01:47.890> they<00:01:48.160> can<00:01:48.310> take<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.580> 59<00:01:48.940> if

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
sized rider they can take the 59 if

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.910 
sized rider they can take the 59 if
they're<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.300> bigger<00:01:49.690> rider<00:01:49.960> like<00:01:50.259> myself<00:01:50.470> I

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
they're a bigger rider like myself I

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.730 
they're a bigger rider like myself I
read<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.030> 60<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:52.869> it's<00:01:52.899> pretty<00:01:53.350> easy<00:01:53.470> to

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
read the 60 so it's pretty easy to

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.760 
read the 60 so it's pretty easy to
choose<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.220> right<00:01:54.280> board

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310 

these<00:02:02.579> boards<00:02:03.030> are<00:02:03.119> great<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.840> top<00:02:04.109> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
these boards are great for going top to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.020 
these boards are great for going top to
bottom<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> way<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.909> go

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
bottom on the way if you can you can go

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.449 
bottom on the way if you can you can go
straight<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.929> snap<00:02:07.619> off<00:02:07.859> the<00:02:08.009> top<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.369> go

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
straight up and snap off the top and go

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.910 
straight up and snap off the top and go
vertically<00:02:08.970> straight<00:02:09.239> back<00:02:09.479> down<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.649> can

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
vertically straight back down so you can

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.369 
vertically straight back down so you can
basically<00:02:11.099> draw<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:12.030> turns<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> way<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
basically draw you turns on the way and

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.180 
basically draw you turns on the way and
that's<00:02:14.099> exactly<00:02:14.550> what<00:02:15.030> they're<00:02:15.180> made<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.360> do

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
that's exactly what they're made to do

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.250 
that's exactly what they're made to do
so<00:02:17.190> after<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.550> lot<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.730> fin<00:02:18.000> testing<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:18.840> decided

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
so after a lot of fin testing we decided

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.320 
so after a lot of fin testing we decided
to<00:02:19.379> go<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.709> softer<00:02:20.040> flex<00:02:20.640> your<00:02:20.819> fin<00:02:21.060> for

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
to go with a softer flex your fin for

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.660 
to go with a softer flex your fin for
2008<00:02:21.900> gives<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.980> border<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:23.400> nice<00:02:23.549> to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
2008 gives the border really nice to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.070 
2008 gives the border really nice to
feel<00:02:23.790> through<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.120> water<00:02:24.299> makes<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.900> feel

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
feel through the water makes it feel

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.170 
feel through the water makes it feel
really<00:02:25.440> responsive<00:02:25.950> through<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.220> turns<00:02:26.459> and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
really responsive through the turns and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.420 
really responsive through the turns and
it<00:02:27.390> also<00:02:27.540> makes<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.959> possible<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.620> break<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
it also makes it possible to break the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.009 
it also makes it possible to break the
tail<00:02:29.610> free<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.150> break<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.510> fins<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.959> the

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
tail free and break the fins out of the

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:41.780 
tail free and break the fins out of the
water<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.470> your<00:02:31.680> top<00:02:31.890> turn

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.360 

so<00:02:42.510> there's<00:02:42.750> also<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.019> double<00:02:43.409> density<00:02:43.650> pad<00:02:44.069> on

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
so there's also a double density pad on

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.369 
so there's also a double density pad on
the<00:02:44.430> new<00:02:44.579> rocket<00:02:44.909> fish<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.599> softer<00:02:46.170> layer

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
the new rocket fish it's a softer layer

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.349 
the new rocket fish it's a softer layer
underneath<00:02:47.099> with<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.579> harder<00:02:47.909> layer<00:02:48.090> over<00:02:48.329> the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
underneath with a harder layer over the

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.050 
underneath with a harder layer over the
top<00:02:48.629> it's<00:02:49.260> really<00:02:49.500> grippy<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.129> its<00:02:50.909> really

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
top it's really grippy and its really

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.000 
top it's really grippy and its really
soft<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:51.689> when<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.290> coming<00:02:52.680> off<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.859> top
