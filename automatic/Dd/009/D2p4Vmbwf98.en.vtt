 you can do it all using the 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.589
 media creation tool that the 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.929

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.080
 Official of them I'll leave the link to 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.519
 you can access the video description there 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.600
 being here on the site we already have some 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.269
 information about what is needed 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.239
 to get windows 10 through 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.670
 media creation tool and we have 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.610
 also the system requirements 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.250
 in this case is a 1 GHz processor 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.839
 I'm faster a gigabyte of memory 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:59.019
 ram to 32-bit or 2 gigabytes to 64 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:02.350
 bit 16 GB of hard disk space 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.269
 for a 32-bit system or 20 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.100
 gigabytes to an operating system of 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.900
 64-bit 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.470
 a graphics card is also required 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.790
 with directx 9 or later with drive 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.300
 wddm 1.0 and a screen with minimal resolution 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.590
 from 800 to 600 good these are the 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.290
 requirements for you to use windows 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.330
 10 in your system and certainly there 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.159
 Most of you or else I will all go 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.070
 able to install and use windows 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.690
 10 in a very fluid way back here 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.430
 to the windows 10 page 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.800
 now we are going to download the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.300
 media creation tool and you 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.770
 you must choose the corresponding version 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.409
 to your system 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.390
 if your current system was 32-bit 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.970
 you download the 32-bit version 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.760
 and if it is 64-bit 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.220
 you download 64-bit my 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.950
 current system is 64-bit then click 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.940
 to 64-bit download 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.710
 here it will start automatically 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.840
 I'm going to cancel because I already have 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.830
 My computer then go there in the directory 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.450
 and after downloading 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.450
 you run the file 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.200
 and will open this installation window of the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.030
 windows 10 for you 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.410
 so here's the question what you 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.770
 want to do 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.239
 we have two options the first 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.550
 update this computer now and then 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.959
 second to create installation media for 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.540
 another computer 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.760
 choosing this first option the system 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.319
 operating system will be updated 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.540
 for Windows 10 almost 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.730
 this tool will start automatically. 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.470
 download the updates for you and will 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.250
 transform the operating system of the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.720
 windows 10 and already this second option 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.060
 you are going to download on the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.730
 10 and you choose whether to create a 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.090
 changeable or will save the iso in 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.489
 a bonus dvd to case I do not want to update 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.590
 This computer now, so I'll show you 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.970
 step by step for you to create a 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.890
 installation media 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.769
 I chose here an installation media 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.900
 little who advance in this window we 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.660
 we can choose the language to edit and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.640
 architecture of windows 10 in the language 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.660
 Obviously I'm going to choose Portuguese. 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.530
 of Brazil 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.470
 the issue we have three windows options 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.989

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.390
 today and windows 10 pro i will choose 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.269
 one of the 10 in architecture you can 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.799
 choose between 32 and 64 bits 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.450
 you will choose according to the 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.910
 settings of your computer 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.000
 and also you can choose embassy 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.510
 both you will lower the iso of 32 and 64 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.560
 bits in this case I choose 64 bits or 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.810
 click next 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.049
 and here in the final window we can 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.299
 to choose between installing windows 10 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.310
 using a pen drive that will create 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.000
 automatically a USB stick would 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.859
 you 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.900
 if you went to choose this option you 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.430
 click forward and place your 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.180
 pendrive at the USB port of your 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.209
 computer 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.310
 in my case the pen drive is the effective unit 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.769
 you will select and click on 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.930
 auto- forward or pen drive goes 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.850
 be formatted and this tool will 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.150
 download windows 10 on your pendrive 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.910
 good beauty who want to return already in the option 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.680
 iso file will be downloaded only to the 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.720
 Windows 10 iso 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.510
 then you can record this iso in a 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.430
 dvd clicking on next 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.800
 will ask you to select 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.170
 directory where you want it to be 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.200
 save iso and you can also choose 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:39.520
 the file name in my case I will 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:40.240
 to put windows 10 64 bit or click 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.000

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.620
