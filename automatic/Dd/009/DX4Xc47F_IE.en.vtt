00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
well this piece of metal right here is

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.620 
well this piece of metal right here is
supposed<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> vibrate<00:00:29.099> back<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.400> forth<00:00:29.640> when

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
supposed to vibrate back and forth when

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.780 
supposed to vibrate back and forth when
there's<00:00:30.840> power<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.279> plug<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.640> in

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
there's power so I'm going to plug it in

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.760 
there's power so I'm going to plug it in

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and then see if that does vibrate back

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.240 
and then see if that does vibrate back
and<00:00:34.829> forth

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.709 

now<00:00:40.250> plugged<00:00:40.699> it<00:00:40.879> in<00:00:41.030> I'm<00:00:41.269> just<00:00:41.329> going<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.600> make

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
now plugged it in I'm just going to make

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.090 
now plugged it in I'm just going to make
sure<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:41.960> I'm<00:00:42.140> only<00:00:42.230> touching<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.890> power

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
sure that I'm only touching the power

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.520 
sure that I'm only touching the power
switch<00:00:43.460> here<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.149> then<00:00:44.780> I'll<00:00:44.929> see<00:00:45.140> if<00:00:45.260> this

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
switch here and then I'll see if this

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.149 
switch here and then I'll see if this
will<00:00:45.769> activate<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.280> motor<00:00:47.859> and<00:00:48.859> that<00:00:49.010> is

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
will activate the motor and that is

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.779 
will activate the motor and that is
vibrating<00:00:49.820> back<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.239> forth<00:00:51.280> so<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.339> motor<00:00:52.579> is

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
vibrating back and forth so the motor is

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.209 
vibrating back and forth so the motor is
working<00:00:53.300> okay<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.050> now<00:00:54.260> it's<00:00:54.409> just<00:00:54.530> semi<00:00:54.979> clean

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
working okay so now it's just semi clean

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.590 
working okay so now it's just semi clean
these<00:00:55.339> up<00:00:55.399> I<00:00:55.729> don't<00:00:55.789> want<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.089> take<00:00:56.299> a<00:00:56.329> whole

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
these up I don't want to take a whole

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.090 
these up I don't want to take a whole
bunch<00:00:56.719> of<00:00:56.930> time<00:00:57.079> cleaning<00:00:57.320> this<00:00:57.589> up<00:00:57.769> if<00:00:57.949> it's

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
bunch of time cleaning this up if it's

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.740 
bunch of time cleaning this up if it's
not<00:00:58.250> going<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:58.519> work<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.239> again<00:00:59.420> I've

they're<00:01:19.250> still<00:01:19.369> not<00:01:21.610> still<00:01:22.610> not<00:01:22.640> vibrating<00:01:23.390> so

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
they're still not still not vibrating so

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.899 
they're still not still not vibrating so
now<00:01:24.380> I've<00:01:24.500> loosen<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.009> screws<00:01:25.310> up<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:25.700> my

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
now I've loosen the screws up on my

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.240

and<00:01:31.119> now<00:01:32.119> they<00:01:32.330> are<00:01:32.450> vibrating<00:01:33.140> so<00:01:33.409> I'm<00:01:34.039> going

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
and now they are vibrating so I'm going

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.850 
and now they are vibrating so I'm going
to<00:01:34.780> try<00:01:35.780> not<00:01:35.929> to<00:01:36.020> tighten<00:01:36.289> them<00:01:36.380> down<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:36.740> much

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
to try not to tighten them down so much

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.950 
to try not to tighten them down so much
and<00:01:37.039> see<00:01:37.100> if<00:01:37.190> that<00:01:37.310> helps<00:01:37.459> so<00:01:38.179> it<00:01:38.299> snug<00:01:38.539> them<00:01:38.750> up

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:53.270 

they<00:01:44.470> are<00:01:44.680> vibrating<00:01:45.490> now

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.610 

so<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:54.030> Conair<00:01:54.390> Hair<00:01:54.570> Clipper<00:01:54.750> wasn't<00:01:55.230> working

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
so my Conair Hair Clipper wasn't working

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.140 
so my Conair Hair Clipper wasn't working
what<00:01:55.830> I've<00:01:55.950> done<00:01:56.160> is<00:01:56.430> I've<00:01:56.580> just<00:01:56.610> taken<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
what I've done is I've just taken it

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.050 
what I've done is I've just taken it
apart<00:01:57.450> I've<00:01:58.350> cleaned<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.130> i<00:01:59.610> check<00:01:59.820> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
apart I've cleaned it out i check the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.080 
apart I've cleaned it out i check the
blades<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.840> blades<00:02:01.170> were<00:02:01.620> actually<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.580> don't

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
blades the blades were actually I don't

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.580 
blades the blades were actually I don't
know<00:02:03.150> if<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.570> gunk<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.960> there<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.500> then

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
know if just with gunk in there and then

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.860 
know if just with gunk in there and then
I<00:02:04.680> tighten<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.130> back<00:02:05.280> down<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.820> tight<00:02:06.120> so

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
I tighten the back down to tight so

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.990 
I tighten the back down to tight so
maybe<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.410> hair<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.980> had<00:02:08.520> tightened<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
maybe with the hair it had tightened the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.060 
maybe with the hair it had tightened the
blades<00:02:09.270> down<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.690> got<00:02:09.810> jammed<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.380> so<00:02:11.009> I

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
blades down they got jammed up so I

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.940 
blades down they got jammed up so I
cleaned<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.820> stuff<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.780> then<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.710> just

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
cleaned that stuff out and then I just

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.380 
cleaned that stuff out and then I just
make<00:02:14.130> sure<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.340> don't<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:14.610> my<00:02:14.700> blades<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.150> too
