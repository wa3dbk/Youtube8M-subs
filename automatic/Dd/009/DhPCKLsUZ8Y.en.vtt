00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.100 

so<00:02:33.060> now<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.239> we<00:02:33.330> have<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.570> headlight<00:02:33.720> fully

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
so now that we have the headlight fully

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.960 
so now that we have the headlight fully
disassembled<00:02:34.769> on<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.950> reflector<00:02:35.459> taken<00:02:35.820> out

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
disassembled on the reflector taken out

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.670 
disassembled on the reflector taken out
of<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.239> we're<00:02:36.900> going<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.080> need<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.260> compare<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
of it we're going to need to compare it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.770 
of it we're going to need to compare it
to<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.860> mini<00:02:38.010> h1<00:02:38.400> projector<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.060> often<00:02:39.510> times

thousand six age 13 H 11 for example the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.840 
thousand six age 13 H 11 for example the
depth<00:02:49.019> of<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.320> reflector<00:02:49.920> or<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.459> butt<00:02:50.670> of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
the reflector where the bulb mounts is

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.590 
the reflector where the bulb mounts is
too<00:02:52.560> much<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.580> threaded<00:02:53.940> shaft<00:02:54.150> on<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
too much for the threaded shaft on the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780 
too much for the threaded shaft on the
projector<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.500> fit<00:02:55.709> through<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.190> then<00:02:56.670> get

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
projector to fit through and then get

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.979 
projector to fit through and then get
the<00:02:56.880> lock<00:02:57.060> ring<00:02:57.299> back<00:02:57.540> on

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
the lock ring back on

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.289 
the lock ring back on
so<00:02:58.590> when<00:02:59.130> you're<00:02:59.250> doing<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.519> retrofit<00:02:59.940> on<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.180> on

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
so when you're doing a retrofit on it on

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.690 
so when you're doing a retrofit on it on
a<00:03:00.390> headlight<00:03:00.750> again<00:03:00.989> anything<00:03:01.380> but<00:03:01.590> an<00:03:01.709> h4<00:03:02.070> h7

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
a headlight again anything but an h4 h7

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.120 
a headlight again anything but an h4 h7
you<00:03:03.090> need<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.330> grind<00:03:03.690> down<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.590> depth<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.100> that

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
you need to grind down the depth of that

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.490 
you need to grind down the depth of that
reflector<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.380> know

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
reflector but so that you can you know

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.590 
reflector but so that you can you know
basically<00:03:07.920> thin<00:03:08.280> up<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.580> very<00:03:08.790> back<00:03:09.090> half<00:03:09.420> of

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
basically thin up the very back half of

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.020 
basically thin up the very back half of
it<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.959> leave<00:03:10.530> as<00:03:10.680> much<00:03:10.920> space<00:03:11.640> as<00:03:11.700> possible

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
it and leave as much space as possible

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.420 
it and leave as much space as possible
for<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.690> lock<00:03:12.870> ring<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.799> bulb<00:03:14.010> holder<00:03:14.220> to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
for the lock ring and the bulb holder to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.449 
for the lock ring and the bulb holder to
go<00:03:14.580> back<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.150> projector<00:03:16.459> sometimes

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
go back on the projector sometimes

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.550 
go back on the projector sometimes
that's<00:03:17.640> even<00:03:17.760> required<00:03:18.480> an<00:03:18.720> h4<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.200> h7

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
that's even required an h4 and h7

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.259 
that's even required an h4 and h7
retrofits<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.370> still<00:03:20.610> have<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> benefit

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
retrofits but you still have the benefit

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.300 
retrofits but you still have the benefit
of<00:03:21.390> using<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.750> adapter<00:03:22.200> plate<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.160> other

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
of using the adapter plate so the other

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.220 
of using the adapter plate so the other
challenge<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.150> retrofit<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.989> is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
challenge in a retrofit like this is

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.870 
challenge in a retrofit like this is
doing<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.890> alignment<00:03:26.459> which<00:03:26.610> is<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
doing the alignment which is the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.640 
doing the alignment which is the
rotation<00:03:27.450> because<00:03:27.720> there's<00:03:27.930> no<00:03:28.110> adapter

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
rotation because there's no adapter

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.650 
rotation because there's no adapter
plate<00:03:28.920> for<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> nine<00:03:29.430> thousand<00:03:29.970> six<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:30.540> age

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
plate for a nine thousand six in age

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.890 
plate for a nine thousand six in age
thirteen<00:03:31.140> etc<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.549> when<00:03:33.030> doing<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.780> know

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
thirteen etc so when doing that you know

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.539 
thirteen etc so when doing that you know
you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.139> either<00:03:34.290> use<00:03:34.560> reference<00:03:35.070> lines<00:03:35.310> on

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
you can either use reference lines on

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.309 
you can either use reference lines on
the<00:03:35.700> reflector<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.630> make<00:03:36.810> sure<00:03:36.989> that

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
the reflector to make sure that

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.259 
the reflector to make sure that
you<00:03:37.409> tighten<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.829> projector<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.519> its

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
you tighten the projector in its

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.179 
you tighten the projector in its
horizontal<00:03:39.629> reference<00:03:40.019> matches<00:03:40.650> those<00:03:40.859> and

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
horizontal reference matches those and

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.830 
horizontal reference matches those and
then<00:03:41.670> when<00:03:41.760> put<00:03:41.909> back<00:03:41.939> on<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.299> car<00:03:42.480> everything

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
then when put back on the car everything

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.899 
then when put back on the car everything
is<00:03:42.959> level<00:03:43.290> again<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:44.370> other<00:03:44.489> thing<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.730> you

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
is level again the other thing that you

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.190 
is level again the other thing that you
can<00:03:45.030> do<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.299> when<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.510> put<00:03:45.689> it<00:03:45.780> back<00:03:45.810> on<00:03:45.959> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
can do is when you put it back on the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.080 
can do is when you put it back on the
car<00:03:46.409> is<00:03:46.650> leave<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.310> lock<00:03:47.489> ring<00:03:47.700> on<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.939> back

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
car is leave the lock ring on the back

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.050 
car is leave the lock ring on the back
only<00:03:48.590> semi-tight<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:50.310> way<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.939> can

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
only semi-tight and that way you can

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.729 
only semi-tight and that way you can
actually<00:03:51.239> grab<00:03:51.599> the<00:03:51.810> projector<00:03:52.290> from<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
actually grab the projector from the

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.589 
actually grab the projector from the
front<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.549> course<00:03:53.790> before<00:03:53.939> you<00:03:54.090> put<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.420> front

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
front of course before you put the front

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.449 
front of course before you put the front
lens<00:03:54.930> cover<00:03:55.200> back<00:03:55.409> on<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.709> headlight<00:03:56.010> it

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
lens cover back on the headlight it

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.160 
lens cover back on the headlight it
manually<00:03:56.849> rotated<00:03:57.540> just<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.750> couple<00:03:57.959> degrees

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
manually rotated just a couple degrees

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.830 
manually rotated just a couple degrees
clockwise<00:03:59.129> or<00:03:59.579> counterclockwise<00:03:59.849> to<00:04:00.480> adjust

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
clockwise or counterclockwise to adjust

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.929 
clockwise or counterclockwise to adjust
the<00:04:00.930> rotation<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.680> need<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.340> lights<00:04:02.519> on<00:04:02.700> for

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
the rotation you need the lights on for

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.000 
the rotation you need the lights on for
that<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:04.169> know<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.290> can<00:04:04.560> check<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.739> out

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
that but you know you can check that out

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.099 
that but you know you can check that out
later<00:04:05.159> so<00:04:05.909> what<00:04:06.569> we're<00:04:06.659> going<00:04:06.749> to<00:04:06.810> do<00:04:06.959> is

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
later so what we're going to do is

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.869 
later so what we're going to do is
modify<00:04:07.319> this<00:04:07.709> reflector<00:04:08.159> show<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.430> how<00:04:08.579> we<00:04:08.639> do

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
modify this reflector show you how we do

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.610 
modify this reflector show you how we do
that<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.359> that<00:04:09.389> you<00:04:09.540> can<00:04:09.750> get<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.079> projector

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
that so that you can get this projector

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.860 
that so that you can get this projector
mounted<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.129> it<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.489> for<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.510> we're<00:04:12.780> going

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
mounted to it and for that we're going

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.679 
mounted to it and for that we're going
to<00:04:12.959> need<00:04:13.079> either<00:04:13.349> a<00:04:13.500> belt<00:04:13.950> sander<00:04:14.269> or<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.329> dremel

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
to need either a belt sander or a dremel

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.270 
to need either a belt sander or a dremel
tool<00:04:15.870> in<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.650> case<00:04:16.829> we're<00:04:16.949> going<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.099> use<00:04:17.250> a

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
tool in this case we're going to use a

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.800 
tool in this case we're going to use a
belt<00:04:17.489> sander<00:04:17.639> just<00:04:18.000> because<00:04:18.269> it's<00:04:18.479> the

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
belt sander just because it's the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.270 
belt sander just because it's the
easiest<00:04:19.109> way<00:04:19.259> to<00:04:19.289> do<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.620> if<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.829> have<00:04:19.979> one<00:04:20.160> of

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
easiest way to do it if you have one of

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.249 
easiest way to do it if you have one of
those<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.639> from<00:04:21.630> there<00:04:21.810> we'll<00:04:21.930> mount<00:04:22.049> the

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
those and from there we'll mount the

00:04:22.259 --> 00:05:15.670 
those and from there we'll mount the
projector<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:22.919> reassemble<00:04:23.580> everything

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.960 

okay<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:16.740> now<00:05:16.979> that<00:05:17.039> we<00:05:17.190> have<00:05:17.220> our<00:05:17.490> reflector

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
okay so now that we have our reflector

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.939 
okay so now that we have our reflector
all<00:05:18.090> modified<00:05:18.569> with<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:18.990> base<00:05:19.229> ground<00:05:19.650> down

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
all modified with the base ground down

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.409 
all modified with the base ground down
you<00:05:20.430> can<00:05:20.550> actually<00:05:20.699> compare<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.330> the

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
you can actually compare it to the

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:22.820 
you can actually compare it to the
original<00:05:21.870> one<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.139> see<00:05:22.319> that<00:05:22.470> this<00:05:22.590> one<00:05:22.800> is

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
original one and see that this one is

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.339 
original one and see that this one is
still<00:05:23.009> much<00:05:23.400> deeper<00:05:23.849> so<00:05:24.479> now<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.080> we're<00:05:25.289> at

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
still much deeper so now that we're at

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.770 
still much deeper so now that we're at
this<00:05:25.470> point<00:05:25.770> we<00:05:25.979> have<00:05:26.190> enough<00:05:26.520> depth<00:05:27.300> here<00:05:27.630> so

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
this point we have enough depth here so

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.210 
this point we have enough depth here so
that<00:05:27.900> we<00:05:27.990> can<00:05:28.110> fit<00:05:28.289> the<00:05:28.380> threaded<00:05:28.740> shaft<00:05:28.919> from

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
that we can fit the threaded shaft from

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.159 
that we can fit the threaded shaft from
the<00:05:29.340> mini<00:05:29.520> projector<00:05:29.729> through<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.840> put<00:05:31.080> the

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
the mini projector through and put the

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.740 
the mini projector through and put the
hardware<00:05:31.440> on<00:05:31.560> lock<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.370> down<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.819> we'll<00:05:33.630> be

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
hardware on lock it down and we'll be

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.570 
hardware on lock it down and we'll be
all<00:05:33.840> set<00:05:33.870> from<00:05:34.229> there<00:05:34.410> so<00:05:35.009> what<00:05:35.190> we<00:05:35.250> need<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.400> do

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
all set from there so what we need to do

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.100 
all set from there so what we need to do
is<00:05:35.729> we<00:05:35.849> need<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.060> take<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.419> three<00:05:36.599> prong<00:05:36.840> bulb

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
is we need to take the three prong bulb

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.020 
is we need to take the three prong bulb
holder<00:05:37.319> off<00:05:37.590> of<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.949> mini<00:05:38.130> projector<00:05:38.370> first

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
holder off of the mini projector first

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.730 
holder off of the mini projector first
so<00:05:39.449> that<00:05:39.479> we<00:05:39.690> can<00:05:39.840> get<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.080> threaded<00:05:40.349> chef

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
so that we can get that threaded chef

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.770 
so that we can get that threaded chef
through<00:05:41.069> usually<00:05:41.819> it's<00:05:41.909> just<00:05:41.940> as<00:05:42.120> easy<00:05:42.630> as

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
through usually it's just as easy as

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.499 
through usually it's just as easy as
taking<00:05:42.960> off<00:05:43.199> just<00:05:43.409> one<00:05:43.560> screw<00:05:43.919> so<00:05:44.729> loosen<00:05:45.330> that

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
taking off just one screw so loosen that

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.529 
taking off just one screw so loosen that
get<00:05:46.409> rid<00:05:46.560> of<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.650> screw<00:05:46.979> and<00:05:47.300> then<00:05:48.300> you<00:05:48.389> can

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
get rid of the screw and then you can

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.089 
get rid of the screw and then you can
put<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:48.780> projector<00:05:49.259> through<00:05:49.530> from<00:05:49.740> the<00:05:49.830> front

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
put the projector through from the front

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.680 
put the projector through from the front
side<00:05:50.280> before<00:05:50.759> you<00:05:50.849> do<00:05:50.970> that<00:05:51.120> you<00:05:51.300> want<00:05:51.419> to<00:05:51.539> put

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
side before you do that you want to put

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.749 
side before you do that you want to put
one<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.990> rubber<00:05:52.169> grommets<00:05:52.650> in<00:05:52.830> here<00:05:53.639> I'm

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
one of the rubber grommets in here I'm

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.430 
one of the rubber grommets in here I'm
using<00:05:53.909> the<00:05:54.150> bigger<00:05:54.330> one<00:05:54.599> but<00:05:55.110> you<00:05:55.199> just<00:05:55.319> kind

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
using the bigger one but you just kind

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.749 
using the bigger one but you just kind
of<00:05:55.470> have<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.620> feel<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.949> out<00:05:56.039> which<00:05:56.280> one<00:05:56.490> you<00:05:56.610> end

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
of have to feel it out which one you end

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.659 
of have to feel it out which one you end
up<00:05:56.880> using<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.419> bigger<00:05:57.599> or<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:57.990> smaller<00:05:58.289> one

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
up using the bigger or the smaller one

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.180 
up using the bigger or the smaller one
put<00:05:59.669> that<00:05:59.819> through<00:05:59.970> from<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.300> front<00:06:00.569> side

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
put that through from the front side

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.029 
put that through from the front side
that'll<00:06:02.190> fit<00:06:02.400> through<00:06:02.610> there<00:06:02.789> and<00:06:03.830> from<00:06:04.830> there

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
that'll fit through there and from there

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.659 
that'll fit through there and from there
put<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:06.259> adapter<00:06:07.259> plate<00:06:07.380> on<00:06:07.620> this<00:06:07.949> is<00:06:08.099> an<00:06:08.220> h7

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
put the adapter plate on this is an h7

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.399 
put the adapter plate on this is an h7
adapter<00:06:09.060> plate<00:06:09.300> you<00:06:09.599> know<00:06:09.719> for<00:06:09.990> purpose<00:06:10.289> of

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
adapter plate you know for purpose of

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.320 
adapter plate you know for purpose of
this<00:06:10.560> retrofit<00:06:11.159> it's<00:06:11.400> really<00:06:11.729> just<00:06:11.940> serving

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
this retrofit it's really just serving

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.570 
this retrofit it's really just serving
you<00:06:13.139> know<00:06:13.259> for<00:06:13.469> extra<00:06:13.830> support<00:06:14.009> on<00:06:14.400> the

you know for extra support on the
reflector<00:06:15.090> 2a<00:06:15.449> you<00:06:15.930> know<00:06:16.020> just<00:06:16.169> give<00:06:16.259> it<00:06:16.349> a

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
reflector 2a you know just give it a

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.830 
reflector 2a you know just give it a
little<00:06:16.469> more<00:06:16.979> surface<00:06:17.430> area<00:06:17.729> so<00:06:18.570> we've<00:06:18.690> got

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
little more surface area so we've got

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.270 
little more surface area so we've got
that<00:06:19.050> on<00:06:19.169> there<00:06:19.199> on<00:06:19.409> the<00:06:19.500> back<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:19.949> then<00:06:20.159> we'll

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
that on there on the back and then we'll

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.279 
that on there on the back and then we'll
go<00:06:20.370> ahead<00:06:20.490> and<00:06:20.729> thread<00:06:20.969> on<00:06:21.120> our<00:06:21.150> our<00:06:21.539> hex<00:06:22.020> lock

go ahead and thread on our our hex lock
ring<00:06:22.909> and<00:06:23.909> we<00:06:24.030> want<00:06:24.150> to<00:06:24.210> be<00:06:24.270> careful<00:06:24.509> when

we're doing this because the threads are
a<00:06:26.250> little<00:06:26.400> bit<00:06:26.580> soft<00:06:26.909> and<00:06:27.240> when<00:06:28.080> you<00:06:28.169> tighten

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
a little bit soft and when you tighten

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:29.719 
a little bit soft and when you tighten
them<00:06:28.530> down<00:06:28.680> all<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:28.949> way<00:06:29.070> they're<00:06:29.250> made<00:06:29.460> to<00:06:29.610> do

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
them down all the way they're made to do

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.029 
them down all the way they're made to do
form<00:06:30.060> so<00:06:30.389> that<00:06:30.419> it<00:06:30.539> locks<00:06:30.840> itself<00:06:31.080> in<00:06:31.500> place

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
form so that it locks itself in place

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.700 
form so that it locks itself in place
permanently<00:06:32.960> so<00:06:33.960> we<00:06:34.080> need<00:06:34.199> to<00:06:34.289> get<00:06:34.409> this<00:06:34.530> on

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
permanently so we need to get this on

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.800 
permanently so we need to get this on
all<00:06:35.009> the<00:06:35.159> way<00:06:35.310> you<00:06:35.370> can<00:06:35.669> just<00:06:35.699> hand<00:06:36.150> tighten<00:06:36.539> it

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
all the way you can just hand tighten it

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.360 
all the way you can just hand tighten it
again<00:06:37.139> just<00:06:37.500> hand<00:06:37.740> tighten<00:06:37.979> it<00:06:38.130> when<00:06:38.280> you

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
again just hand tighten it when you

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.529 
again just hand tighten it when you
first<00:06:38.580> start<00:06:38.849> because<00:06:39.150> you're<00:06:39.270> probably

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 
first start because you're probably

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:41.600 
first start because you're probably
going<00:06:39.870> to<00:06:39.930> need<00:06:40.110> to<00:06:40.169> adjust<00:06:40.349> the<00:06:40.800> rotation<00:06:40.979> of

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
going to need to adjust the rotation of

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.149 
going to need to adjust the rotation of
the<00:06:41.909> projector<00:06:42.449> after<00:06:42.960> the<00:06:43.080> fact<00:06:43.319> just<00:06:43.979> due<00:06:44.130> to

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
the projector after the fact just due to

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.370 
the projector after the fact just due to
the<00:06:44.340> fact<00:06:44.370> that<00:06:44.669> we're<00:06:44.880> not<00:06:45.000> using<00:06:45.060> any<00:06:45.509> you

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
the fact that we're not using any you

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.839 
the fact that we're not using any you
know<00:06:46.500> adapter<00:06:47.130> plates<00:06:47.370> that<00:06:47.550> set<00:06:47.819> that

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
know adapter plates that set that

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.330 
know adapter plates that set that
rotation<00:06:48.539> automatically<00:06:49.319> again<00:06:49.590> like<00:06:49.860> an<00:06:49.979> h4

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
rotation automatically again like an h4

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.510 
rotation automatically again like an h4
and<00:06:50.669> h7<00:06:50.969> based<00:06:51.270> application<00:06:51.960> so<00:06:52.830> it's<00:06:53.370> got

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
and h7 based application so it's got

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.279 
and h7 based application so it's got
this<00:06:53.669> lock<00:06:53.880> down<00:06:54.090> here<00:06:54.330> see<00:06:54.810> how<00:06:54.900> that's<00:06:55.080> put

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
this lock down here see how that's put

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.170 
this lock down here see how that's put
together<00:06:55.440> and<00:06:55.860> we<00:06:56.639> just<00:06:56.669> need<00:06:56.940> to<00:06:57.000> make<00:06:57.120> sure

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
together and we just need to make sure

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.790 
together and we just need to make sure
that<00:06:57.300> we<00:06:57.479> get<00:06:57.599> our<00:06:57.719> lock<00:06:57.900> ring<00:06:58.169> down<00:06:58.349> all<00:06:58.620> the

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
that we get our lock ring down all the

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.010 
that we get our lock ring down all the
way<00:06:58.979> so<00:06:59.520> that<00:06:59.699> the<00:06:59.819> three<00:07:00.090> feet<00:07:00.389> on<00:07:00.630> the<00:07:00.840> bulb

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
way so that the three feet on the bulb

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.870 
way so that the three feet on the bulb
holder<00:07:01.259> can<00:07:01.500> go<00:07:01.620> all<00:07:01.889> the<00:07:02.099> way<00:07:02.130> back<00:07:02.460> into<00:07:02.729> the

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
holder can go all the way back into the

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.120 
holder can go all the way back into the
channels<00:07:03.389> on<00:07:03.599> the<00:07:03.659> back<00:07:04.319> of<00:07:04.500> the<00:07:04.590> projector

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
channels on the back of the projector

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.890 
channels on the back of the projector
because<00:07:05.729> if<00:07:05.969> they<00:07:06.060> don't<00:07:06.210> sink<00:07:06.569> all<00:07:06.690> the<00:07:06.719> way

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
because if they don't sink all the way

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.200 
because if they don't sink all the way
in<00:07:07.050> there<00:07:07.370> the<00:07:08.370> bolt<00:07:08.580> is<00:07:08.699> not<00:07:08.819> going<00:07:09.000> to<00:07:09.060> line

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
in there the bolt is not going to line

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.879 
in there the bolt is not going to line
up<00:07:09.360> perfectly<00:07:09.509> inside<00:07:10.080> and<00:07:10.289> the<00:07:10.349> beam<00:07:10.500> pattern

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
up perfectly inside and the beam pattern

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.140 
up perfectly inside and the beam pattern
and<00:07:11.280> the<00:07:11.340> light<00:07:11.520> output<00:07:11.699> is<00:07:11.940> going<00:07:12.000> to<00:07:12.090> be

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
and the light output is going to be

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.050 
and the light output is going to be
thrown<00:07:12.360> off<00:07:12.569> so<00:07:13.289> once<00:07:13.800> we've<00:07:13.919> got<00:07:14.070> that<00:07:14.099> in<00:07:14.490> we

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
thrown off so once we've got that in we

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.209 
thrown off so once we've got that in we
can<00:07:15.180> go<00:07:15.240> ahead<00:07:15.360> and<00:07:15.650> reinstall<00:07:16.650> our<00:07:17.010> bulb

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:17.219 
can go ahead and reinstall our bulb

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:19.250 
can go ahead and reinstall our bulb
holder<00:07:17.690> reassemble<00:07:18.690> the<00:07:18.779> headlight

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
holder reassemble the headlight

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.040 
holder reassemble the headlight
with<00:07:20.220> the<00:07:20.310> xenon<00:07:20.580> bulb<00:07:20.760> in<00:07:20.910> it<00:07:21.030> turn<00:07:21.600> it<00:07:21.720> on<00:07:21.840> and

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
with the xenon bulb in it turn it on and

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.230 
with the xenon bulb in it turn it on and
check<00:07:22.230> the<00:07:22.380> check<00:07:22.950> the<00:07:23.040> rotation<00:07:23.190> and<00:07:23.700> then

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
check the check the rotation and then

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.970 
check the check the rotation and then
from<00:07:24.420> there<00:07:24.630> you<00:07:25.350> know<00:07:25.440> again<00:07:25.680> we<00:07:25.800> can<00:07:25.950> just

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:25.980 
from there you know again we can just

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.910 
from there you know again we can just
rotate<00:07:26.700> the<00:07:27.090> the<00:07:27.360> projector<00:07:27.840> manually<00:07:28.350> from

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:28.920 
rotate the the projector manually from

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.710 
rotate the the projector manually from
the<00:07:29.010> front<00:07:29.280> of<00:07:29.370> the<00:07:29.430> housing<00:07:29.850> just<00:07:30.210> so<00:07:30.630> the
