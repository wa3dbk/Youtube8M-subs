some<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.270> game<00:00:36.510> development<00:00:36.720> tools<00:00:37.230> to

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
some of the in game development tools to

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.660 
some of the in game development tools to
show<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.010> new<00:00:38.190> feature<00:00:38.430> is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
show you what this new feature is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.430 
show you what this new feature is
actually<00:00:39.030> doing<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.750> displacement<00:00:43.110> maps

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
actually doing so with displacement maps

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080 
actually doing so with displacement maps
off<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> rocks<00:00:44.880> on<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
off you can see that the rocks on the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.480 
off you can see that the rocks on the
riverbed<00:00:45.450> are<00:00:45.600> basically<00:00:45.960> flat<00:00:46.230> however<00:00:47.220> as

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
riverbed are basically flat however as

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.610 
riverbed are basically flat however as
we<00:00:47.880> slowly<00:00:48.060> turn<00:00:48.330> on<00:00:48.480> displacement<00:00:48.810> maps<00:00:49.260> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we slowly turn on displacement maps you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.800 
we slowly turn on displacement maps you
can<00:00:49.650> see<00:00:49.950> real<00:00:50.160> geometry<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.090> rocks<00:00:51.330> the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
can see real geometry the rocks the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.650 
can see real geometry the rocks the
nooks<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.380> crags<00:00:52.650> actually<00:00:53.130> grow

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
nooks the crags actually grow

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.450 
nooks the crags actually grow
this<00:00:55.290> is<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.470> significant<00:00:56.100> increase<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
this is a significant increase in

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.220 
this is a significant increase in
geometric<00:00:56.910> fidelity<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.630> is<00:00:57.720> happening<00:00:57.900> in

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
geometric fidelity that is happening in

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.450 
geometric fidelity that is happening in
real<00:00:58.440> time<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:59.010> our<00:00:59.100> new<00:00:59.250> engine<00:01:01.460> another

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
real time in our new engine another

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.680 
real time in our new engine another
great<00:01:02.640> new<00:01:02.820> feature<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.360> engine<00:01:03.600> is

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
great new feature of the engine is

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.920 
great new feature of the engine is
called<00:01:03.930> sub<00:01:04.260> D<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> technique<00:01:06.750> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
called sub D this is a technique that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.719 
called sub D this is a technique that
takes<00:01:07.229> once<00:01:07.440> blocky<00:01:07.740> geometry<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.460> builds

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
takes once blocky geometry and builds

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.610 
takes once blocky geometry and builds
them<00:01:08.820> into<00:01:09.030> perfectly<00:01:09.420> smooth<00:01:09.660> curves<00:01:09.960> it's

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
them into perfectly smooth curves it's

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.410 
them into perfectly smooth curves it's
been<00:01:10.830> used<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> while<00:01:11.550> by<00:01:11.820> Hollywood<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
been used for a while by Hollywood and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.910 
been used for a while by Hollywood and
film<00:01:12.660> but<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> breakthrough<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.650> us<00:01:13.740> has

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
film but the breakthrough for us has

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
film but the breakthrough for us has
been<00:01:13.950> utilizing<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.700> real<00:01:14.970> time<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.510> engine<00:01:19.940> so

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
been utilizing it real time in engine so

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.280 
been utilizing it real time in engine so
as<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.150> look<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.630> site<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.960> sub<00:01:22.140> D

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
as we look down the site with sub D

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.499 
as we look down the site with sub D
turned<00:01:22.560> off<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.670> actually<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
turned off you can actually see how the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.240 
turned off you can actually see how the
edges<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.900> jagged<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> normal

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
edges are jagged because of the normal

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.350 
edges are jagged because of the normal
polygons<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.130> sub<00:01:32.310> D<00:01:32.460> turned<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.880> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
polygons so now with sub D turned on you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.820 
polygons so now with sub D turned on you
can<00:01:33.539> see<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.990> normal<00:01:34.229> poly<00:01:34.410> count<00:01:34.619> has

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
can see that the normal poly count has

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.580 
can see that the normal poly count has
been<00:01:34.979> increased<00:01:35.369> exponentially<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.590> what's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
been increased exponentially and what's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
been increased exponentially and what's
amazing<00:01:37.830> about<00:01:38.070> sub<00:01:38.430> D<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.940> will

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
amazing about sub D is that it will

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.969 
amazing about sub D is that it will
continue<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> subdivide<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.320> real<00:01:40.500> time<00:01:40.770> as

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
continue to subdivide in real time as

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.770 
continue to subdivide in real time as
you<00:01:41.070> get<00:01:41.190> closer<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.640> objects<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.570> no<00:01:42.690> matter

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
you get closer to objects so no matter

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420 
you get closer to objects so no matter
how<00:01:43.050> close<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.440> get<00:01:43.649> nothing<00:01:44.009> will<00:01:44.310> break

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
how close you get nothing will break

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.359 
how close you get nothing will break
down<00:01:45.440> now<00:01:46.440> as<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> look<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.100> player's

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
down now as you look at your player's

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.889 
down now as you look at your player's
hand<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.940> weapon<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> tech

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
hand and weapon with all the tech

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.870 
hand and weapon with all the tech
running<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.710> see<00:01:49.890> how<00:01:50.039> high<00:01:50.250> resolution

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
running you can see how high resolution
