00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.560
 there are vampires they mostly stay 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.000
 unrecognized and live in the middle of us 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.400
 but at least when it comes down to it 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.440
 berrys twilight and yet there 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.769
 maybe even more we will find it 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.660
 out after the intro number five 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.070
 Fountain that secret for one 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.330
 longer life in the blood of ours 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 could lie to fellow humans 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.189
 This was recently revealed by three studies 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.160
 mice have been carried 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.780
 blood transfusions in older animals 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.790
 memorial strength and also the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.380
 the sense of smell improves 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.720
 Investigations revealed that one 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.160
 certain protein that in the blood young 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.530
 containing mice is an important 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.240
 The researchers have hoped to play a role 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.480
 now alzheimer's and more 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.410
 treat diseases effectively 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.960
 hopefully not an army of 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.740
 to create darkness number four 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.850
 vampire graves italy 2006 czech republic 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.650
 2008 and bulgaria 2012 almost every year 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.500
 become more vampire graves 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.210
 discovered and uncovered tuberculosis for 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.530
 the current state of knowledge often 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.310
 a pale appear and too 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.620
 weight loss 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.720
 also was subordinated to these vampires 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.970
 to somehow spread the disease 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.260
 yet many of the skeletons became like that 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.120
 found draped 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.770
 as if someone wanted to prevent them 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.900
 ever eat something again 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.170
 They became great for you, for example 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.840
 Chunks stuck in the jaw 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.880
 number three the real dracula dracula 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.440
 His name is not just a fiction 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.600
 he is going to a real event 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.650
 back and also his real role model 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.320
 officials shy seen 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.950
 remains the third or even the leaf 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.170
 error 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.270
 born in transylvania he was 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.250
 member in the order of the dragon one 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.530
 Christian military organization 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.110
 at this time he killed more than 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.120
 100,000 people some he burned 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.920
 then just the most 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.500
 were skewered on pointed wooden piles 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.810
 to deter his opponents and the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.210
 Respect to strengthen your own rows 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.010
 even if the film industry thinks 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.750
 cruiser capable of draculas skin 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.210
 The story is still burning 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.910
 that this first vampire is a warrior for 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.950
 the Christian faith was number two 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.880
 professional 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.920
 this is a disease that affects the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.080
 metabolism impaired and thus 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.600
 for the deposition of red pigments in the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.290
 Skin cares body and face are of it 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.570
 affected 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.880
 The disease was also assumed 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.800
 mental impairments 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.280
 causing the affected to part 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.290
 strangely behaved king george the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.930
 third of england is one of her 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.370
 most famous victims caused him 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.709
 austerity and the disease 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.140
 hallucinations and soon was one 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.790
 still known as the mad king 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.700
 today many are social scientists 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.910
 the opinion where Vori has a large part 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.890
 contributed to the myth of the paper 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.250
 believe to strengthen 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.720
 number one friends elisabeth bathory 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.300
 she is more or less the female one 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.240
 counterpart to the mistake Countess 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.340
 Elizabeth Bathory of Hungary 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.830
 she adopted a variety of young 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.350
 Many of them became a job 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.690
 as servant offer over years suggested 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.210
 she burnt the girls to death and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.010
 abused her body and left some 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.730
 from them slowly in the winternights 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.310
 freeze bathory believed young blood 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.500
 could stop the aging process and 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.990
 as soon as you see her in the blood of her victims 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.660
 Residents often heard screams from their 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.730
 then came in 1609 and then 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.790
 sent soldiers to find out what 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.710
 what happened there happened to be there 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.090
 awful around here in the report 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.220
 to be held 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.120
 however, in that bathory was gone 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.720
 process 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.550
 in which more than 300 witness statements they 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.030
 came into captivity in the later 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.430
 died 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.870
 the reactions to your story because 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.319
 but many of those people 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.650
 unceremoniously concluded 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.450
 Papers are real and if they are 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.200
 are actually real with all theirs 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.239
 Skills 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.099
 would you let yourself become one 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.989
 and which finds its capability 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.340
 coolest writes me that down times 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.260
 in the comments I'm really curious 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.510
 to discuss with you a little bit 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.310
 that was s for this time when you 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.290
 I just liked that 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.909
 with an abo or like and we see 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.569
 Next time we bit again 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.569
 show
