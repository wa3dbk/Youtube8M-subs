programs in advance
finally<00:01:17.640> lighting<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.750> three

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
finally lighting here we have three

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
finally lighting here we have three
lights<00:01:19.350> set<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> receiver<00:01:20.580> can't

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
lights set up but the receiver can't

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
lights set up but the receiver can't
support<00:01:21.330> more<00:01:21.630> control<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.140> outlet<00:01:22.710> switches

support more control for outlet switches

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.670 
support more control for outlet switches
and<00:01:23.340> dimmers<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> sony<00:01:25.290> es

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and dimmers so that's it for the sony es

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.410 
and dimmers so that's it for the sony es
remote<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:27.180> home

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
remote but we can actually take home

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
remote but we can actually take home
automation<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.049> step<00:01:28.290> further<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.979> those<00:01:29.159> who

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
lives and that's where control 4 comes

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
lives and that's where control 4 comes
in<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.659> first<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> want<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> an
