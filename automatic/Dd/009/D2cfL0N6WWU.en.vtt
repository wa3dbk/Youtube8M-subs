00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.370
 hello friends rest millions of 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.120
 paraguarí good let's make a videoblog if 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.269
 we will not present the nike and 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.029
 but renault phantom skin 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.240
 here they have good this one this technician and 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:24.019
 designed to play from big 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:27.770
 category and the attackers for that in 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.669
 like was inspired and was great is that of the 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.850
 called my skin which is a 3d camera and 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.030
 that when using the foot with this 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.909
 This fabric is squeezing you to 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.120
 have better foot conditions and have 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.120
 the best 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.080
 also the one that is inspired by the sole 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.560
 the players had a great demand 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.530
 in the area that did not work well 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.060
 stumbles for this nobody yes and for kingdom 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.770
 who created this school that 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:08.250
 which is divided in two after 43 heels 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.180
 is to avoid falls for example 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.180
 to play 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.110
 for and this so that the foot does not bend 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 good also rain this like in editor 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.509
 verón created the most lighter sole 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.790
 even very light tennis and very 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.790
 practical this can be folded 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.990
 there is also skin 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.299
 but I do not believe this part since many 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.700
 players at the time of stumbling 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.610
 unfolded the foot or so they would stay like this 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.370
 that this being is movable and returned to 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.440
 better protection uses plate 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.659
 well I also bring you the design makes 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.979
 the control 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.170
 it is against water since many of the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.399
 Paradores have had contact with the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.379
 wet ball could not rebel in 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.019
 other words could not have good 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.640
 control so that's what it was designed for 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.640
 this strip my skin 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:30.640
 in the sole the template does not come very 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.680
 Well equipped also brings to bring some 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.640
 small perforations to avoid the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.640
 contact with the side and with moisture 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.269
 there is also skin as usual 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.330
 and pulls out more than half and low ranges 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.900
 for example the mean that is very 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.950
 different from the scj and it already maintains the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.950
 finished 3d 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:04.590
 no longer has a link 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.190
 has a very different one from the one 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.540
 skin as you could see 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.390
 has a synthetic fiber that is also 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.420
 equal in the hit he has with equal 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.980
 he came back from the ball 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.980
 the area is very different 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.750
 Well now we present the range 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.830
 low that is called 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.790
 good as well as like it has ranges 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:39.740
 middle or low this was inspired to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.440
 do the fatal is equal to the mainz quin 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.590
 but the difference is that you already have the 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.010
 same just a 3d does not have the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.010
 control 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.100
 Blanquilla is totally the same 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.450
 without finishing but what does change is the 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:04.610
 template 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:10.490
 low that is since this one has got the 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:15.080
 the structure to avoid falls and is 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:19.420
 also but no longer has it with the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.420
 the kind of video that comes on deck 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.310
 good friends thank you very much 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.420
 these happy 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.280
 and several colors have come out but 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.610
 but for my taste they are the best and 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.560
 these and then if you have the opportunity to 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:42.360
 buy the ligeritos and they will see it 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.360
 with the sea thank you 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.979
 to 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.740
 Y
