first<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.350> will<00:00:40.530> lift<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> power

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
first we will lift out of the power

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.900 
first we will lift out of the power
supply<00:00:44.989> then<00:00:45.989> carefully<00:00:46.680> lift<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.969> unit

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910

this is an extremely compact design I

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.209 
this is an extremely compact design I
would<00:01:00.719> say<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:01.829> smaller

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
would say that it is actually smaller

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.750 
would say that it is actually smaller
and<00:01:03.000> lighter<00:01:03.300> than<00:01:04.170> my<00:01:04.500> electribe<00:01:05.390> emx<00:01:07.760> open

construction<00:01:16.340> this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
construction this is not just a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.210 
construction this is not just a
synthesizer<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.619> masterpiece<00:01:22.040> here<00:01:23.040> you
