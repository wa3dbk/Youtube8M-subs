00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.710
 my name is joe hernandez let's see 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.109
 a little while we are going to share 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.939
 what is this about the experiences outside 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.500
 of the body what we mean when 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.900
 We speak 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.350
 in this term if there is something that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.450
 Interested in making it clear when you know 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.390
 this talk is the experiences outside 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.360
 of the body are a consequence 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.860
 we said that in the same way as the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.540
 physical body has some organs 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.530
 internal of Bogota of operability in 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.210
 this plane that other subtle body that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.760
 body that is able to access the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.430
 experiences outside the body of the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.239
 same way it has some structures 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.780
 internal than when they are active and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.780
 operational 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.170
 naturally as a result of 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.880
 this operability of these nuclei 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.880
 experiences happen 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.180
 well we see the portability of the same 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.060
 we would see the lower core 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.610
 It is an area located two fingers 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.800
 below the navel at the physical level 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.800
 medium nucleus that would be in the area of 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.030
 upper core chest that would be 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.010
 internally not if we said within 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.970
 the head to understand them 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:39.110
 outer core that apparently is a 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.060
 core is out 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.240
 of the structure structure itself 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.580
 this body 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.560
 posterior nucleus 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.689
 the internal channel 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.930
 when there is enough energy the core 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.520
 lower than for me to run a 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.100
 order from higher core 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.560
 and from here have the power so that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.240
 what happens that means that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.150
 from the upper core is giving 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.930
 the order 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.930
 I say 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.080
 d 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.080
 now to understand us 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.490
 when from the upper core will be that 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.110
 order 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.110
 what the posterior core does 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.250
 later modifies the novelty 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.080
 and from there I can capture that 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.350
 information from those other planes when 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.470
 the movement is so deep that 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.240
 you need the full interpretation of 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.980
 all that information forces a 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.780
 vehicle that is capable of interpreting 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.640
 this information emerge 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.520
 I explain 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.120
 I repeat followed from the upper core 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.860
 of credit access to the cloud within 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.280
 of the plane see there 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.390
 a huge range of possibilities for 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.390
 action within that plane 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:14.660
 according to 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.810
 The quality of the vibration for 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.910
 understand me from my middle core I 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:26.340
 will allow access to one or the other 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.269
 space of that plane 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.269
 if we say 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.230
 And now let's go where we 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.230
 interest 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:43.080
 if we say, we said at the beginning that 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.080
 everyone owns this vehicle 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.120
 this link that is able to access 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.630
 out-of-body experiences if 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.430
 everybody owns it 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.600
 what do some people do 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.470
 access this type of experience and 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.610
 others do not 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.200
 and if we say that it is a consequence 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.900
 if the out-of- body experiences are 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.160
 a consequence 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.070
 what was happening 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.650
 if we all have that vehicle and in a way 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.480
 natural it should be normal to access 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.030
 those other planes of information that is 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.600
 what happened so that we are not there 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.600
 OK
