00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
from the first snap and we didn't try to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.540 
from the first snap and we didn't try to
let<00:00:46.770> our<00:00:46.890> foot<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> pedal<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:52.739> team<00:00:53.190> your

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
let our foot off the pedal a team your

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.180

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.720 
so just little things here and there I
mean<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:19.410> were<00:02:19.680> moving<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.160> ball<00:02:20.280> today<00:02:20.430> which

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
mean we were moving the ball today which

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.640 
mean we were moving the ball today which
I<00:02:20.850> was<00:02:20.970> happy<00:02:21.210> with<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.810> think<00:02:22.410> we're<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> lot

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
I was happy with I think we're a lot

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.220 
I was happy with I think we're a lot
better<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:22.890> third<00:02:23.160> downs<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.870> mean<00:02:25.050> if

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
better on third downs and I mean if

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.590 
better on third downs and I mean if
defenses<00:02:25.980> are<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.460> stay<00:02:26.760> back<00:02:26.970> play

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
defenses are going to stay back play

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.650 
defenses are going to stay back play
cover<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.050> show<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.590> forces<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.160> run<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:30.540> know

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
cover to show and forces to run you know

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.150 
cover to show and forces to run you know
then<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.200> got<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.410> do<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.740> that's<00:02:31.860> that's

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
then we got to do it and that's that's

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.670 
then we got to do it and that's that's
what<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:32.459> did<00:02:32.550> today<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.990> week<00:02:36.680> didn't

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
what we did today and this week didn't

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.040 
what we did today and this week didn't
seem<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.010> whole<00:02:38.250> lot<00:02:38.600> not<00:02:39.600> nearly<00:02:39.810> as<00:02:39.900> much

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
seem like a whole lot not nearly as much

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.920 
seem like a whole lot not nearly as much
as<00:02:40.230> last<00:02:40.440> week<00:02:41.209> they<00:02:42.209> had<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> couple<00:02:42.630> times

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
as last week they had a couple times

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.170 
as last week they had a couple times
when<00:02:43.260> they<00:02:43.410> were<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:44.400> caught<00:02:44.580> her<00:02:44.700> radar<00:02:44.910> where

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
when they were we caught her radar where

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.790 
when they were we caught her radar where
they're<00:02:45.300> all<00:02:45.450> moving<00:02:45.989> around<00:02:46.350> trying<00:02:46.620> to

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
they're all moving around trying to

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.990 
they're all moving around trying to
confuse<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:47.400> then<00:02:47.550> they<00:02:47.610> just<00:02:47.760> played<00:02:47.970> a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
confuse you but then they just played a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.290 
confuse you but then they just played a
cover<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.420> shell<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.920> doesn't<00:02:50.880> seem<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.180> too

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
cover to shell so doesn't seem like too

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.130 
cover to shell so doesn't seem like too
much

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.470 

I<00:02:55.880> think<00:02:56.880> they<00:02:56.970> were<00:02:57.030> trying<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.360> protect

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
I think they were trying to protect

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.410 
I think they were trying to protect
against<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.080> past<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:59.550> those<00:03:00.150> kind<00:03:00.390> of

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
against the past and those kind of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.990 
against the past and those kind of
evidence

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:08.309 
not much to say about it was a

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.279 
not much to say about it was a
interception<00:05:09.719> that<00:05:10.719> he<00:05:10.779> went<00:05:11.110> through<00:05:11.169> the

interception that he went through the

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.929

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:14.649 
office that call it back out there I

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.889 
office that call it back out there I

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:16.899 
think you just tell with his energy and

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:19.139 
think you just tell with his energy and
his<00:05:17.589> tempo<00:05:18.039> how<00:05:18.429> much<00:05:18.610> he<00:05:18.759> has<00:05:18.879> to<00:05:18.909> the

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:19.149 
his tempo how much he has to the

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:21.209 
his tempo how much he has to the
offensive<00:05:19.449> line<00:05:19.599> and<00:05:19.989> you<00:05:20.889> know<00:05:20.979> not<00:05:21.099> to

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
offensive line and you know not to

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.309 
offensive line and you know not to
mention<00:05:21.459> his<00:05:21.610> leadership<00:05:22.299> and<00:05:22.539> seniority<00:05:23.110> out

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.850 
mention his leadership and seniority out
there<00:05:23.529> making<00:05:23.889> calls<00:05:24.189> but<00:05:25.179> I<00:05:25.209> think<00:05:25.449> just<00:05:25.689> as

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
there making calls but I think just as

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.049 
there making calls but I think just as
you<00:05:26.860> know<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.069> momentum<00:05:27.519> that<00:05:27.549> he<00:05:27.759> gives<00:05:27.939> her

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:28.059 
you know the momentum that he gives her

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:29.459 
you know the momentum that he gives her
offensive<00:05:28.479> line<00:05:28.659> whether<00:05:28.869> it's<00:05:29.079> running<00:05:29.379> up

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
offensive line whether it's running up
