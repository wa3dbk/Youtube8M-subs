00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.899
 the team can eurocopter to marignane succeeded and we present 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:10.559
 today with some pride Russia just this improbable marriage 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.739
 between the rotary wing the helicopter and 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:14.580
 the plane 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.740
 here with the presentations with him 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.770
 compliments hervé jammayrac killed daniel semioli who are in command of 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.390
 the whole team the wedding flight tests 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 here is a small flute 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 for philippe richert is named chief of staff of the blues 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.590
 two of his children mini reportage 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.350
 still must sport and Japan emerged I do not know it's going to me 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.510
 serve 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.089
 try the 25 who will face can be exported factor I had face me 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.320
 in short a year 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.790
 dick taxquet 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.420
 this phase was broken into the reportage karzai chameyrat 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.730
 Clariant of his lair to improve 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.520
 so he smoked no helicopter in that sense that saw her on the roof 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.500
 of the rotor barilla cell it's a big rotor with five blades 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.850
 the quite classic finally 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.390
 and then the time the actual cell that derives from that of a 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.630
 well-known dolphin helicopter there are a lot of engines 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 very powerful are the turbines of the nh90 so it's a twin engine 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.950
 p on either side of the cell you can just with testimonials from 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.270
 detainees who rebel and all other novelties such as there you 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.250
 have 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.300
 two ac propellers ac 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.550
 does that mean what does it mean that for 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.680
 2 believe these three countries the rotor on the roof and the two propellers end 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.210
 wing 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.650
 are powered by obviously the power delivered per liter the engine 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.380
 through a gearbox I made a real masterpiece at 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.570
 technical plan 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.260
 which refers to the power 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.850
 for croisic that aims to make 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.860
 and it does the following way there for example by putting 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.850
 helicopters were stopped the rotor provides lift 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.340
 the bulls we are in the district dan helicopter roughly normal 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.330
 to rotate on the spot have varied 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.309
 the attraction of churches its competition 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.059
 customs officers on stage 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.539
 it's different from a helicopter in my line that's normally done by 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.149
 the postponement of all 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.289
 so that's already a difference it had to be developed but 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.339
 now look here 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.439
 we will accelerate 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.729
 we accelerate first a little like a helicopter and then everything 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:40.459
 gently hervé jammayrac give weight to delights sending power 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.739
 in the propellers that stands for all 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.379
 testifying to a m and one accelerates it to gain altitude 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.159
 the propellers come 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.579
 almost majority and when going towards high speeds and beyond 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.959
 130 140 kilometers per hour 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.670
 practically two rotor serve more than much rotor top rotor 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.769
 and biya places the trolling rotor 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.790
 forgiveness saying the least possible and it is the adults who ensures the most 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.799
 important of lift so we became an airplane 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.130
 it's not easy to do 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.390
 this mix of genres and they've obviously succeeded in seeing the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.390
 way the x6 flight 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.619
 and then they can play 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.700
 both a province the reporter 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.549
 in three years 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.459
 the expert in adopting and tullow 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.459
 30th time cultural jean chaumien maritime studies

 camer-sport rafael correa of ​​the two Maghreb countries of the android system designed 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.959
 for cause these are not my chances inditex 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.010
 it will be a little bit of collective success 20h35 france 5 36 et octobre 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.519
 ford 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.980
 parameters like Frankfurt kids and this time though on the ribs 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.860
 the presentation corvo has some good chances to export with nantes 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.519
 it's a little this country of 10 points Islamic conference 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.199
 the captain wishes 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:04.099
 it specifies that offers texas instruments is important so far the 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.709
 future 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.319
 according to fanny smets online on the grounds that the competition was fair 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.649
 a crowd this country you are automotive sector feed and make known 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.999
 at the time of its exit facing the cold we see very little next to this same 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.059
 month 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:20.939
 françois amichia make a small simulation opponents of abdel 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.330
 to explain what we could actually 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.580
 for example the some of them for them the maritime took off in 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.969
 a few moments with the Bordeaux region 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.449
 national excludes for example have taken off and the center of bordeaux to 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.979
 the strong euro church of the reveres at the edge of the garonne to monitor the 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:38.819
 surfaces 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.009
 to take off near the stone bridge in the city center 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.090
 and then we would be bored to Toulouse and recorded with a luxury that the 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.840
 police in half an hour 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.740
 and of course there is also no place of the capitol place de liga 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.810
 often crowded on the square but we could land in the city on 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.770
 a surface 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.569
 so this is the marriage of the speed of a plane misses turboprop with kevin 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.470
 helicopter and again it's not nothing the problem is that bad 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.089
 very recently defeated 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.479
 of his own speed record 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.560
 three years 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.150
 nine of the ten years on the basis of a common list on the basis of 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.770
 the story by reaching the speed of 430 kilometers an hour 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.039
 for a helicopter it's part of the realm of the impossible but that's 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.650
 the more the helicopter is so how should we call it to remy 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:31.689
 bricka a composite 2 for now the palena excuses 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.639
 but there is a case law lengthening things in large hand 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.020
 format and steel lasted a single wheel before his deputy to lead a real 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.569
 stupid 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.099
 same sex but a week earlier sign up on the lack of 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.099
 vigilance in serving Mass 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.069
 younger boys who is lost and who was found
