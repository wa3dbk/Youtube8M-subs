00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.000
If you are away from home for one of those days where the temperature is very favorable to us

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.400
for the absence of heat, and also just do not find the clothes for that weather

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.840
then your body starts shaking. Have you ever wondered: Why shiver when we are cold?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.580
The core body temperature of the human body depends on several factors such as:

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.460
sex, diet, physical activity, etc.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.460
However, this should be in a range between 36 and 37 degrees centigrade

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.160
for the various internal processes are performed properly

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.620
so our body has a mechanism for regulating temperature or thermoregulation.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.320
When it's hot or cold temperature our skin detects this and sends a signal you dare nerve fibers

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
to a particular brain area called

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.420
hypothalamus

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.300
who besides being responsible for regulating mood

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.740
sex, sleep, hunger and thirst

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.740
It is the custom of thermoregulation.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.660
When the hypothalamus receives this signal with skin temperature information

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.720
Compare this with the average benchmark of 37 degrees Celsius

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560
if it is above the reference temperature

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.620
which means heat sends a signal to the smooth muscles, particularly

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.340
the walls of arteries

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.160
if instead the hypothalamus senses that it is below the reference temperature

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.180
thus we feel cold

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.980
sends a signal not only to the walls of arteries

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.720
but skeletal muscles

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.840
those with which we are familiar, biceps, triceps etc.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.640
When we feel hot, the hypothalamus tells the walls of the arteries expand

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.160
because when this occurs  the differents elements that circulate in the blood

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.040
white blood cells, red blood cells and proteins

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.680
has greater contact with the surface, allowing the heat produced by the free movement of these elements are at a greater rate.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.540
However when we feel cold, the walls of the arteries constrict

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.880
so that there is less surface where it can dissipate heat

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.020
and thus keep it in the body

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.780
but besides this particular type of smooth muscle+

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.200
when we are cold skeletal muscles also contract in order to take the ATP

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.580
or adenosine triphosphate and break to produce ADP

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.860
and a phosphate group

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.740
whereby energy is produced in the form of heat

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.100
it helps to increase body temperature

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.340
and the contraction of skeletal muscles which makes us tremble when we feel cold.
