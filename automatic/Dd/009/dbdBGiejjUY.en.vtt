00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
like so their pistons should do that you

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.190 
like so their pistons should do that you
don't<00:03:32.880> need<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.180> put<00:03:33.329> some<00:03:33.540> done<00:03:33.750> them<00:03:33.959> yet

need to do so we're still in there
there's<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.319> piston<00:03:44.040> not<00:03:44.670> like<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:46.220> that's

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
there's the piston not like that that's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.860 
there's the piston not like that that's
our<00:03:47.430> union<00:03:47.819> that

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870

that's a night block some redstone going
here<00:04:06.260> digging<00:04:07.260> in<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.739> pressure<00:04:07.980> place<00:04:10.849> let's

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
here digging in the pressure place let's

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.039 
here digging in the pressure place let's
just<00:04:12.090> put<00:04:12.300> a<00:04:12.330> repeater<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.480> another<00:04:15.780> white

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
just put a repeater so another white

on oops so we have to put the Sun down
like<00:04:49.800> this

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.630 

and<00:04:57.370> I<00:04:57.400> think<00:04:58.030> I'm<00:04:58.330> saying<00:04:58.630> that's<00:04:59.020> wrong<00:04:59.640> and

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
and I think I'm saying that's wrong and

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.570 
and I think I'm saying that's wrong and
he<00:05:01.540> is<00:05:01.950> after<00:05:02.950> face<00:05:03.460> this<00:05:04.240> way<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.950> not<00:05:05.980> like

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
he is after face this way to not like

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.450 
he is after face this way to not like
not<00:05:07.000> just<00:05:07.720> need<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:08.260> one<00:05:08.320> how<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.890> is<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:12.430> I

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
not just need that one how it is so I

think so yeah then you will go walking
me<00:05:18.420> in<00:05:19.420> stuck<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:20.020> quicksand<00:05:22.140> now<00:05:23.140> the

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
me in stuck in quicksand now the

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.250 
me in stuck in quicksand now the
research<00:05:23.800> all<00:05:24.610> they<00:05:24.820> have<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.210> do<00:05:25.420> is<00:05:25.840> place

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
research all they have to do is place

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.840 
research all they have to do is place
the<00:05:26.440> redstone<00:05:26.920> so<00:05:27.160> much<00:05:27.630> like<00:05:28.630> nosh<00:05:29.220> so<00:05:30.220> what

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
the redstone so much like nosh so what

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.900 
the redstone so much like nosh so what
it<00:05:31.000> does<00:05:31.210> is<00:05:31.620> this<00:05:32.620> white<00:05:32.920> hanger<00:05:33.370> when<00:05:33.730> it's

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
it does is this white hanger when it's

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.520 
it does is this white hanger when it's
not<00:05:34.060> on<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.300> press<00:05:34.480> play<00:05:34.780> come<00:05:35.140> see<00:05:35.410> yeah

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
not on the press play come see yeah

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.840 
not on the press play come see yeah
turns<00:05:36.220> that<00:05:36.490> redstone<00:05:37.210> torch<00:05:38.110> off<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:39.190> when

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
turns that redstone torch off and when

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.820 
turns that redstone torch off and when
that<00:05:40.150> redstone<00:05:40.450> torch<00:05:40.840> is<00:05:41.080> on<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.530> how<00:05:41.650> was

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
that redstone torch is on it how was

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.450 
that redstone torch is on it how was
these<00:05:42.010> piston<00:05:42.580> sort<00:05:42.940> of<00:05:43.090> things<00:05:43.840> like<00:05:44.140> that

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
these piston sort of things like that

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.950 
these piston sort of things like that
but<00:05:45.460> when<00:05:45.610> it's<00:05:45.820> turned<00:05:46.030> off<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.510> Pistons

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
but when it's turned off the Pistons

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.380 
but when it's turned off the Pistons
pull<00:05:47.230> back<00:05:47.470> and<00:05:47.710> drop<00:05:47.980> the<00:05:48.130> sound<00:05:48.370> now<00:05:49.330> you

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
pull back and drop the sound now you

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.480 
pull back and drop the sound now you
don't<00:05:49.840> have<00:05:49.990> this<00:05:50.230> person<00:05:50.680> here<00:05:50.890> knocking<00:05:51.340> off

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
don't have this person here knocking off

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.770 
don't have this person here knocking off
the<00:05:51.520> redstone<00:05:52.270> torch<00:05:52.950> the<00:05:53.950> Pistons<00:05:54.520> will<00:05:55.300> go

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
the redstone torch the Pistons will go

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.710 
the redstone torch the Pistons will go
back<00:05:56.050> like<00:05:56.350> that<00:05:56.650> so<00:05:57.040> you<00:05:57.880> can't<00:05:58.150> fall<00:05:58.420> in<00:05:58.600> the

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
back like that so you can't fall in the

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.340 
back like that so you can't fall in the
quicksand<00:05:58.990> so<00:05:59.800> then<00:05:59.980> what<00:06:00.190> I<00:06:00.220> came<00:06:00.490> up<00:06:00.700> with

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
quicksand so then what I came up with

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:08.400 
quicksand so then what I came up with
its<00:06:02.350> more<00:06:02.620> redstone<00:06:03.390> leading<00:06:05.250> tuned<00:06:07.410> pissed

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
its more redstone leading tuned pissed

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.440 
its more redstone leading tuned pissed
until<00:06:09.130> I<00:06:09.160> piss<00:06:09.430> and<00:06:09.640> not<00:06:09.760> or<00:06:09.880> not<00:06:10.060> off<00:06:10.240> the

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
until I piss and not or not off the

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.000 
until I piss and not or not off the
redstone<00:06:10.930> torch<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:13.960> has<00:06:14.320> to<00:06:14.530> knock<00:06:14.770> it

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
redstone torch and it has to knock it

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.310 
redstone torch and it has to knock it
off<00:06:15.190> a<00:06:15.490> little<00:06:15.760> bit<00:06:15.910> after<00:06:16.030> God<00:06:16.930> knock<00:06:17.110> it<00:06:17.230> off
