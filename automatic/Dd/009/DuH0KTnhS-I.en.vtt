of<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> Coulter's<00:00:40.770> that's<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.670> connected

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
of to Coulter's that's when we connected

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.389 
of to Coulter's that's when we connected
to<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> pro<00:00:42.600> te<00:00:42.870> pui<00:00:43.050> outsole<00:00:43.680> let's<00:00:44.100> go<00:00:44.280> have

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
to the pro te pui outsole let's go have

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.430 
to the pro te pui outsole let's go have
a<00:00:44.430> nice<00:00:44.670> stiff<00:00:45.000> build<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.110> allows

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a nice stiff build to it so this allows

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.750 
a nice stiff build to it so this allows
you<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.620> get<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> very<00:00:47.070> efficient<00:00:47.610> energy

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
you to get a very efficient energy

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.330 
you to get a very efficient energy
transfer<00:00:48.329> process<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:50.070> top

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
into the liner this is where we see a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.429 
into the liner this is where we see a
great<00:01:48.210> upgrade<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.290> their

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
great upgrade this is going to be their

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.889 
great upgrade this is going to be their
hydra<00:01:49.860> max<00:01:49.890> mesh<00:01:50.460> liner<00:01:50.759> now<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.450> used<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> be

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
hydra max mesh liner now this used to be

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.600 
hydra max mesh liner now this used to be
their<00:01:52.020> premier<00:01:52.439> liner<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> last<00:01:53.399> couple

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
their premier liner for the last couple

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
their premier liner for the last couple
years<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.659> has<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:55.140> great

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
years but it has a really great

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.620 
years but it has a really great
hydrophobic<00:01:56.100> compound<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> which<00:01:57.450> means

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
hydrophobic compound to it which means

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.389 
hydrophobic compound to it which means
that<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.930> helps<00:01:58.170> push<00:01:58.409> away<00:01:58.649> moisture<00:01:58.829> keeping

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
that it helps push away moisture keeping

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.020 
that it helps push away moisture keeping
your<00:01:59.490> feet<00:01:59.700> dry

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
your feet dry

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.090 
your feet dry
it<00:02:00.479> also<00:02:00.600> helps<00:02:01.049> reduce<00:02:01.200> drying<00:02:01.710> time<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it also helps reduce drying time and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100 
it also helps reduce drying time and
then<00:02:02.610> internally<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.479> an<00:02:03.570> upgrade<00:02:03.930> with

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
then internally we get an upgrade with

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.230 
then internally we get an upgrade with
