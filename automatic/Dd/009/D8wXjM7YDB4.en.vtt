00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
right for all the parts together I'm

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.970 
right for all the parts together I'm
very<00:02:17.510> difficult<00:02:18.170> part<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.590> jumping

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
very difficult part of that is jumping

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.410 
very difficult part of that is jumping
from<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.160> first<00:02:19.430> finger<00:02:19.610> here<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.180> first

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
from the first finger here to the first

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.850 
from the first finger here to the first
finger<00:02:20.660> here<00:02:20.959> because<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.319> quite<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> bit<00:02:21.800> of

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
finger here because it is quite a bit of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.380 
finger here because it is quite a bit of
a<00:02:21.890> jump<00:02:24.519> play<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:25.640> nice<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.090> slow<00:02:26.209> and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
a jump play it nice and slow and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.240 
a jump play it nice and slow and
gradually<00:02:27.080> speed<00:02:27.319> up<00:02:27.380> don't<00:02:27.830> play<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.100> too

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
gradually speed up don't play it too

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.059 
gradually speed up don't play it too
fast<00:02:28.580> all<00:02:28.790> right<00:02:28.970> then<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.989> basically<00:02:30.290> repeat

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
fast all right then you basically repeat

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.800 
fast all right then you basically repeat
the<00:02:31.190> same<00:02:31.430> riff<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.000> starting<00:02:32.600> note

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the same riff but the starting note

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.930 
the same riff but the starting note
changes<00:02:33.620> rather<00:02:33.860> than<00:02:34.010> starting<00:02:34.430> on<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.670> 10th

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
changes rather than starting on the 10th

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.150 
changes rather than starting on the 10th
you're<00:02:35.420> going<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.600> start<00:02:35.870> on<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.319> 12th<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:40.010> of

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
you're going to start on the 12th one of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:49.660 
you're going to start on the 12th one of
the<00:02:40.220> rest<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.610> same<00:02:43.870> repeat<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.170> us

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.009 

then<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.790> repeat<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.209> exact<00:02:51.569> same<00:02:51.780> riff

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
then you repeat the exact same riff

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.899 
then you repeat the exact same riff
again<00:02:52.319> but<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.739> throws<00:02:53.250> people<00:02:53.519> off<00:02:53.760> because

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
again but this throws people off because

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.250 
again but this throws people off because
you're<00:02:54.120> starting<00:02:54.239> on<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.569> new<00:02:54.629> string<00:02:55.110> you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
you're starting on a new string you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.160 
you're starting on a new string you
start<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> g<00:02:55.799> string<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> tenth<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:58.049> you

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
start the g string on the tenth and you

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.089 
start the g string on the tenth and you
jump<00:02:58.409> to<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> same<00:02:58.860> place<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.489> on<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.819> 13th

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
jump to the same place to be on the 13th

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:13.250 
jump to the same place to be on the 13th
then<00:03:02.099> you<00:03:02.250> repeat<00:03:02.549> through<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.879> river<00:03:12.260> and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
then you repeat through the river and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.199 
then you repeat through the river and
then<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.859> go<00:03:13.980> back<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.519> original<00:03:14.640> father

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
then you go back to the original father

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.230 
then you go back to the original father
it

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
it

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.610 
it
the<00:03:18.240> most<00:03:18.510> important<00:03:18.960> part<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.380> is

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
the most important part of this is

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.380 
the most important part of this is
consistent<00:03:20.130> picking<00:03:20.880> pattern<00:03:21.180> with<00:03:21.300> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
consistent picking pattern with the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.270 
consistent picking pattern with the
right<00:03:21.570> hand<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.930> will<00:03:22.110> make<00:03:22.320> your<00:03:22.500> life<00:03:22.740> easier

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
not just on this but any rift that you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.230 
not just on this but any rift that you
learn<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.860> second<00:03:26.220> part<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.670> making<00:03:26.910> sure

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
learn the second part is making sure

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.880 
learn the second part is making sure
that<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.510> play<00:03:27.690> nice<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.200> slowly<00:03:28.500> and

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890

gradually<00:03:29.340> speed<00:03:29.820> up<00:03:29.880> play<00:03:30.240> it<00:03:30.360> accurately

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
gradually speed up play it accurately

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.110

before<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.980> speed<00:03:32.220> up<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.490> say<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:32.970> many

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
before you speed up I say it so many

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.060 
before you speed up I say it so many
times<00:03:33.210> because<00:03:33.990> so<00:03:34.170> many<00:03:34.350> people<00:03:34.740> will<00:03:34.860> rush

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
times because so many people will rush

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.860 
times because so many people will rush
it<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.310> make<00:03:35.520> too<00:03:35.700> many<00:03:35.790> mistakes<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.750> then

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
it and make too many mistakes and then

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.300 
it and make too many mistakes and then
those<00:03:37.050> mistakes<00:03:37.410> enter<00:03:37.800> your<00:03:37.890> muscle<00:03:38.190> memory

and they're very difficult to get rid of
slow<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:40.830> accurate<00:03:41.610> rather<00:03:41.820> than<00:03:42.030> fast<00:03:42.360> and

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
slow and accurate rather than fast and
