okay<00:00:06.050> now<00:00:06.800> we'll<00:00:07.250> go<00:00:07.430> over<00:00:07.460> the<00:00:07.850> same<00:00:08.120> five

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:08.600 
okay now we'll go over the same five

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.620 
okay now we'll go over the same five
pentatonic<00:00:09.470> scales<00:00:09.820> but<00:00:10.820> we'll<00:00:11.059> add<00:00:11.270> in<00:00:11.510> the

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
pentatonic scales but we'll add in the

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.050 
pentatonic scales but we'll add in the
fourth<00:00:11.960> and<00:00:12.230> seventh<00:00:12.650> notes<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.520> notes<00:00:13.550> that

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.060

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
is the complete scale across the neck

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.550 
is the complete scale across the neck
now<00:00:22.369> we're<00:00:22.880> adding<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.329> fourth<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:24.020> step<00:00:24.349> with

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
now we're adding a fourth and step with

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:45.369 
now we're adding a fourth and step with
notes<00:00:24.829> and<00:00:25.160> here<00:00:25.759> we<00:00:25.910> go<00:00:35.590> here<00:00:36.590> that<00:00:44.379> pattern

on<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.110> 12th<00:05:50.110> fret<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:51.460> see<00:05:51.700> pattern<00:05:52.120> 5<00:05:52.360> again

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
on the 12th fret you see pattern 5 again

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.180 
on the 12th fret you see pattern 5 again
this<00:05:54.370> is<00:05:54.550> because<00:05:54.970> every<00:05:55.630> 12<00:05:55.960> frets<00:05:56.440> you'll

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
this is because every 12 frets you'll

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:04.170 
this is because every 12 frets you'll
run<00:05:57.520> into<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:58.000> same<00:05:58.240> pattern

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
pattern 5 it looks the same but it's

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.850 
pattern 5 it looks the same but it's
