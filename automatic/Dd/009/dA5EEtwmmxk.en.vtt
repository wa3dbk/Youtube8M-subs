00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
vacuum and depending on how critical it

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.520 
vacuum and depending on how critical it
is<00:02:44.910> not<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.480> any<00:02:45.690> stuff<00:02:46.020> in<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.290> what

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
is not to have any stuff in here what

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.310 
is not to have any stuff in here what
you<00:02:46.650> kind<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.920> try<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.580> reduce<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
you kind of try and do is reduce the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.750 
you kind of try and do is reduce the
amount<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.410> stuff<00:02:49.680> floating<00:02:50.040> around<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
amount of stuff floating around in the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.640 
amount of stuff floating around in the
air<00:02:51.980> somehow<00:02:54.170> what<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.200> would<00:02:55.470> recommend

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
air somehow what I would recommend

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.880 
air somehow what I would recommend
almost<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.520> damp<00:02:57.060> mopping<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.750> floor<00:02:58.050> you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
almost just damp mopping the floor you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.040 
almost just damp mopping the floor you
know<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.280> could<00:03:00.090> get<00:03:00.269> them<00:03:00.480> off<00:03:00.570> this<00:03:00.750> floor

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
know you could get them off this floor

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.290 
know you could get them off this floor
so<00:03:01.230> nothing's<00:03:01.650> gonna<00:03:01.890> come<00:03:02.580> up<00:03:02.730> off<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.120> floor

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
so nothing's gonna come up off the floor

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.970 
so nothing's gonna come up off the floor
because<00:03:04.080> there's<00:03:04.290> probably<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.620> lot<00:03:04.739> down

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
because there's probably a lot down

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.890 
because there's probably a lot down
there<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.150> don't<00:03:06.510> realize<00:03:06.720> how

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
there and you you just don't realize how

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.390 
there and you you just don't realize how
much<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.980> takes<00:03:09.769> somewhere<00:03:10.769> between<00:03:10.950> four

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
much and it takes somewhere between four

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.330 
much and it takes somewhere between four
and<00:03:11.430> six<00:03:11.730> hours<00:03:12.000> for<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.510> stuff<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.930> to

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
and six hours for this stuff you to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.680 
and six hours for this stuff you to
become<00:03:15.950> dust<00:03:16.950> free<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.790> speak<00:03:19.820> okay<00:03:20.820> well<00:03:21.450> I
