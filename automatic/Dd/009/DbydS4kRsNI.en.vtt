00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.010
 the electronic module when we see here this module that can be added especially 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.279
 appliances and light 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.219
 the module is there 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.929
 three functions 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.980
 first official is 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.630
 functions 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.869
 nivet ie if the device there is very very long 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.110
 and we do not see the adult level 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.730
 we can always dream 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.179
 the device with ti level 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.650
 electronic 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.650
 without the need for voice levels 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.450
 the second warmest south iron with electronic modules 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.450
 youth action in the world of luxury 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.320
 we can measure the distance 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.820
 so and with ranking 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.660
 allowing 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.699
 cover it 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.809
 a distance from the EU fifty centimeters up to 11 meters ap 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.470
 read the article make a music 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.490
 clearly the six volumes measure a distance of 10 meters and 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.490
 four years old 12 13 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.700
 it's an injury 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.820
 to be reappointed 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.820
 that means it also allows me to more measured 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.610
 for five years his accounts 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.610
 the best 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.189
 a scene for example if I have a weapon 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.310
 close to me 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.620
 that I serve advanced only 5 meters 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.620
 the rest is an infinite 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.210
 I can do it 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.440
 as a scan with the module is the more than 300 and museums the different 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.290
 richelieu distances 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 all the time on the processes in rhythm 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.190
 in addition to the electronic module 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.970
 and has a memory card 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.190
 all the information about optics or own 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.440
 except that with 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.019
 switch 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.019
 you need all the optical defects 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.039
 downstream 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:18.299
 and in addition the electronic module it is connected with the ramp 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.739
 helical 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.859
 we paid college electronics 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.129
 he showed me all the time for women 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.619
 licenses that is measured 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:32.589
 the sum has designated I see that the licenses I settled 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.379
 master 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.379
 and more roundwood 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.970
 the ideas for the destroyer of singing 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.340
 for the categories finally had to bow so fast france 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.729
 and it's 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.479
 besides there are three possibilities of reggae the device 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.339
 settle it 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:55.959
 with the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.709
 ultra sounds saby% of measures the distance 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.659
 and after 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.129
 I want to settle the colonial mentality 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.829
 to the point 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.269
 that light 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.269
 it's a 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.469
 and after I'm sure 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.719
 the room 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.699
 and settle 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:17.779
 to the point 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.429
 then we measured 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.880
 the other possibility is sealed 2 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.169
 measured 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.759
 a laser clues commit 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.359
 with a speech significantly more measured points Saturday for this purpose 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.229
 not that we have described a way to reach a Newcastle English with the 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.809
 expectations 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:39.449
 art museum a point 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:40.509
 and after 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.620
 I'm able seems that singer 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.199
 this 14 meters 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.269
 i can only for the event the school of arles 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.149
 at 14 meters 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:51.049
 a German scene 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.919
 exactly 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.819
 without the need for a card 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.459
 or even see sting encrypted the needs to adjust on the ramp 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.300
 helical 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.689
 we must lightly 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.139
 on this island it's him 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.239
 the third possibility is to work 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.679
 with the depths of field 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:11.829
 it means 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.659
 in work earlier for example in a sea without water 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:21.229
 in an exhibition hall it's pretty much like the mena 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.389
 for 100 m distance of up to 50 meters 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.099
 alas by claiming only the helical ramp 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.249
 I want to choose now to say hitting weather-france 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.639
 and I want with the griffins 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.129
 70 euros at the same station 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.689
 15 meters 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.039
 now I can say it right now 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.009
 7 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.839
 45 millimeters a diaphragm novelistic depth of field of 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.839
 transmit and 48 cents to 75 meters 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.490
 if this depth is not enough 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.650
 not anymore 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.310
 make a second image 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.180
 it means 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.069
 the nearest point 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.229
 who dares to put 40 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.229
 now move on the other side 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.539
 three-point rivers further on we now have one go with him until 14 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.330
 meters 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.530
 and now I can not say now I have a depth of field 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.530
 from 6 meters 90 to 14 meters 10 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.449
 so far two images 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.449
 a second image 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.729
 I have a depth of field that allows me to cover the choices 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.840
 from routes 70 to 75 meters 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:38.800
 have measured 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.409
 a distance 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.409
 and after the village 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:45.479
 at school for all 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.479
 or at cs5 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.169
 a place in eighths 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.930
 and as in the picture how very very important 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:00.649
 without perhaps having to work with an optics that is much more 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:01.379
 short 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:02.740
 for having passed 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.550
 depth of field
