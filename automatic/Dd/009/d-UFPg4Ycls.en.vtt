system<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:54.250> acts<00:01:54.550> as<00:01:54.760> enough<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.390> spring<00:01:55.720> so

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
system it acts as enough of a spring so

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.100 
system it acts as enough of a spring so
you<00:01:56.050> can<00:01:56.350> finitely<00:01:57.000> adjust<00:01:58.000> if<00:01:58.510> you<00:01:58.720> want<00:01:58.930> the

this<00:02:01.090> gap<00:02:01.330> by<00:02:01.810> just<00:02:02.110> simply<00:02:02.470> tightening<00:02:02.979> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
this gap by just simply tightening the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.520 
this gap by just simply tightening the
screws<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.880> can<00:02:04.330> kind<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:04.720> balance<00:02:04.900> it<00:02:05.260> and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
screws you can kind of balance it and

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.980 
screws you can kind of balance it and
then<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:07.090> his<00:02:07.330> pickup<00:02:07.950> our<00:02:08.950> screws<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.750> can

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
then in his pickup our screws that can

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.930 
then in his pickup our screws that can
be<00:02:11.140> changed<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.800> guess<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.190> would<00:02:12.340> do<00:02:12.490> that<00:02:12.670> to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
be changed I guess you would do that to

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.480 
be changed I guess you would do that to
like<00:02:13.120> balance<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.780> strings<00:02:14.110> or<00:02:14.320> something

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
like balance the strings or something

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.860 
like balance the strings or something
but<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.520> George<00:02:15.880> board<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.330> already<00:02:16.720> so

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
but a George board is already so

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.180 
but a George board is already so
balanced<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.440> don't<00:02:17.620> think<00:02:17.860> you're<00:02:17.980> going<00:02:18.130> to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190
