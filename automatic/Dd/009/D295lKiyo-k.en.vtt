00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.879
 welcome to another touchdown on football 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.220
 Purchase box and rescued 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.540
 Today I want to show how to reset these settings and 12 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.909
 This is done by missing the Reset Preference List 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.900
 and from Wittlich 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.310
 "If you place example an error message let 'em light the lights 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.449
 Thick the game board will then you can do this 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.599
 so try by simply adjusting the settings to the default 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.810
 replace is 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.640
 and you just fly a line 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.460
 the options best friend Cy Waits embarrassed when the first for the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.680
 serve as a good man many go 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.230
 Werdohl St 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.610
 co-financed for these numbers are line dash BZ underlined 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.250
 Transparency is 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.350
 but just copying 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.780
 and that will now introduce St 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.220
 The team start No and there in the stock game is Suntech Power Manager 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.530
 2011 was 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.220
 also works with other version 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.730
 hope for it and now against the right 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.050
 properties 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.170
 then the field startsups and set and also with me on 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.440
 Bonndorf - easy 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.860
 Top ten 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.200
 and close 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.520
 and if it is in the last space flight 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.160
 should Andreas Schranz BFM in the Sherwood option 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.530
 what does it mean 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.400
 Full Screen 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.420
 and would be in the power grid and live Mitchell 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.670
 There's information 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.420
 the picture is the variant 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.460
 while the affair is more robust 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.560
 percent 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.250
 this line back out there - end station course, otherwise needed 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.250
 It will be started every time the Captain is restarted 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.270
 so they called possess and lead for the normal version the British used 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.360
 and optics 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.970
 there is to be expected 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.980
 a best-of connection 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.130
 buy as link 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.890
 "No Contest" but on the way to more speed and the keyboards and right 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.910
 Prof 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.510
 properties 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.420
 well a day has been shortened 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510
 and Altenfeld goal 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.380
 right at the bottom 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.780
 hedge a current occupy so that does not look like that either 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.929
 Place removes a space 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.009
 that's what it's a fly for 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.489
 take over and okay 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.119
 and then penalize for what the celebrity fixes 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.629
 if yes then take this option of the breast 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.049
 think you can help normal again floor
