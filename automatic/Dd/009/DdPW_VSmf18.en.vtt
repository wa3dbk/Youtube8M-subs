hey<00:00:01.079> guys<00:00:01.319> it's<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.619> MC<00:00:02.100> i'm<00:00:03.060> here<00:00:03.180> to<00:00:03.330> show

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.450 
hey guys it's the MC i'm here to show

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.139 
hey guys it's the MC i'm here to show
you<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.960> to<00:00:04.020> make<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.259> piston<00:00:04.680> powered<00:00:05.149> suicide

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:06.149 
you how to make a piston powered suicide

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.680 
you how to make a piston powered suicide
booth<00:00:06.330> or<00:00:06.629> trap<00:00:07.019> door<00:00:08.450> really<00:00:09.450> there's<00:00:09.630> a

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
booth or trap door really there's a

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.830 
booth or trap door really there's a
bunch<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.020> uses<00:00:10.410> for<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:11.390> mechanism<00:00:14.840> but

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
bunch of uses for this mechanism but

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.220 
bunch of uses for this mechanism but
basically<00:00:17.330> button<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.780> the<00:00:19.560> floor<00:00:19.830> will

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
basically button and the floor will

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.620 
basically button and the floor will
contract<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.560> expand<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.880> people<00:00:24.270> who<00:00:24.360> fall

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
contract and expand so people who fall

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.880 
contract and expand so people who fall
in<00:00:24.840> make<00:00:25.770> it<00:00:25.920> back<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.250> or<00:00:27.410> whatever<00:00:28.410> purpose

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
in make it back out or whatever purpose

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.780 
in make it back out or whatever purpose
you<00:00:29.100> want<00:00:29.840> to<00:00:30.840> use<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.610> build

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
you want to use it for so it's build

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.700 
you want to use it for so it's build
this<00:00:33.560> I<00:00:34.560> can<00:00:34.890> start<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:35.220> our<00:00:35.250> floor<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
this I can start with our floor and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.150 
this I can start with our floor and
you're<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.980> want<00:00:38.130> to<00:00:38.220> leave<00:00:38.720> two<00:00:39.720> spaces

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.380 

this<00:00:44.160> way<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.700> fit<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.210> our<00:00:45.329> Pistons<00:00:47.390> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
this way we can fit in our Pistons so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.100 
this way we can fit in our Pistons so
face<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.899> blocks<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> Pistons<00:00:49.829> point<00:00:50.130> in

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
face the blocks of the Pistons point in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.080 
face the blocks of the Pistons point in
its<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.559> far<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.190> good<00:00:54.469> now<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:56.460> Pistons<00:00:56.820> will

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
its so far so good now the Pistons will

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.110 
its so far so good now the Pistons will
start<00:00:58.489> contracted<00:00:59.489> but<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.789> need<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
start contracted but we need them to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.319 
start contracted but we need them to
start<00:01:00.510> expended<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.610> order<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> accomplish

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
start expended so in order to accomplish

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.109 
start expended so in order to accomplish
this<00:01:04.070> all<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.220> need<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.760> create<00:01:05.970> an

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
this all we need to do is create an

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.410 
this all we need to do is create an
inverter<00:01:06.390> which<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.500> simple<00:01:08.420> start

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
inverter which is pretty simple start

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.500 
inverter which is pretty simple start
with<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> block<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.250> block<00:01:11.250> here

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.810 

place<00:01:15.410> redstone<00:01:15.710> torch<00:01:16.220> you<00:01:16.460> have<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.670> place

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
place redstone torch you have to place

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.570 
place redstone torch you have to place
it<00:01:17.000> on<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.210> block<00:01:17.890> not<00:01:18.890> on<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.100> ground<00:01:19.310> here

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
it on the block not on the ground here

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.700 
it on the block not on the ground here
and<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:19.760> will<00:01:20.660> create<00:01:20.780> an<00:01:20.960> inverter<00:01:21.260> so<00:01:21.590> now

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
and that will create an inverter so now

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:32.800 
and that will create an inverter so now
they'll<00:01:22.070> start<00:01:24.310> expanded<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:26.890> now<00:01:31.660> you<00:01:32.660> can

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
they'll start expanded and now you can

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.830 
they'll start expanded and now you can
place<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.020> button<00:01:34.450> push<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.420> can<00:01:38.660> be<00:01:38.810> a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
place a button push it so you can be a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.510 
place a button push it so you can be a
bit<00:01:39.020> more<00:01:39.200> clever<00:01:39.440> with<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.740> wiring<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.370> make

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
bit more clever with the wiring to make

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.550 
bit more clever with the wiring to make
it<00:01:40.610> look<00:01:40.730> prettier<00:01:41.110> more<00:01:42.110> aesthetically

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
it look prettier more aesthetically

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.360 
it look prettier more aesthetically
pleasing<00:01:43.180> but<00:01:44.180> that's<00:01:44.420> just<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:45.130> basic<00:01:46.130> name

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
pleasing but that's just the basic name

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.150 
pleasing but that's just the basic name
isn't<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.760> go<00:01:46.880> through<00:01:47.090> um<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:48.740> guys<00:01:48.860> have<00:01:49.040> any

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
isn't to go through um you guys have any

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.950 
isn't to go through um you guys have any
more<00:01:49.310> questions<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:50.180> know<00:01:50.300> feel<00:01:50.600> free<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.840> let

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
more questions you know feel free to let

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.690 
more questions you know feel free to let
me<00:01:51.020> know<00:01:51.400> i'd<00:01:52.400> be<00:01:52.430> happy<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:52.790> address<00:01:53.090> them<00:01:54.700> and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
me know i'd be happy to address them and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.000 
me know i'd be happy to address them and
i<00:01:56.000> guess<00:01:56.150> that's<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.479> for<00:01:56.540> now<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.620> until<00:01:57.950> next

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
i guess that's it for now so until next

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.160 
i guess that's it for now so until next
time<00:01:58.370> this<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.060> MC<00:01:59.560> see<00:02:00.560> ya

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
time this is the MC see ya
