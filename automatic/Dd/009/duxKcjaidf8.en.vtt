00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
lid in any way whatsoever and what I do

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.800 
lid in any way whatsoever and what I do
is<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.200> try<00:03:48.859> to<00:03:48.889> make<00:03:49.250> sure<00:03:49.459> when<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.180> take<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.510> lid

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
is I try to make sure when I take a lid

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.580 
is I try to make sure when I take a lid
off<00:03:50.989> that<00:03:51.230> none<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.959> material<00:03:53.959> goes<00:03:54.230> down

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
off that none of the material goes down

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.990 
off that none of the material goes down
onto<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:56.060> rim<00:03:56.660> of<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.290> lid<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:57.769> don't<00:03:58.730> want

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
onto the the rim of the lid I don't want

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.449 
onto the the rim of the lid I don't want
to<00:03:59.120> really<00:03:59.510> get<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> top<00:04:00.139> all<00:04:00.889> messed<00:04:01.250> up

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
to really get the top all messed up

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.720 
to really get the top all messed up
because<00:04:02.000> then<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.959> starts<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.319> become<00:04:03.440> dry<00:04:04.340> and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
because then it starts to become dry and

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.580 
because then it starts to become dry and
then<00:04:05.329> when<00:04:05.540> you're<00:04:05.660> dipping<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.109> brush<00:04:06.319> and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
then when you're dipping the brush and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.629 
then when you're dipping the brush and
you<00:04:06.650> might<00:04:06.829> get<00:04:07.129> little<00:04:07.940> bits<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.389> the<00:04:08.540> dried

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
you might get little bits of the dried

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.030 
you might get little bits of the dried
product<00:04:10.639> onto<00:04:11.299> your<00:04:11.599> brush<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.079> so<00:04:12.709> on<00:04:12.829> it

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
product onto your brush and so on it

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.020 
product onto your brush and so on it
gets<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.790> then<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.389> gets<00:04:14.599> a<00:04:14.720> little<00:04:14.750> bit<00:04:15.079> messy

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
gets and then it gets a little bit messy

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.449 
gets and then it gets a little bit messy
again<00:04:17.030> same<00:04:17.810> principle<00:04:18.289> as<00:04:18.380> before<00:04:18.769> I'm<00:04:19.250> going

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
again same principle as before I'm going

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.260 
again same principle as before I'm going
to<00:04:19.549> use<00:04:19.940> my<00:04:20.150> brush<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.989> make<00:04:21.199> sure<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:22.669> goes

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
to use my brush to make sure it goes

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.370 
to use my brush to make sure it goes
