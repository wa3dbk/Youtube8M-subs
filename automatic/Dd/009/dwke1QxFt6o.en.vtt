00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.779 
very obviously depending on the widths
so<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.500> don't<00:02:08.770> know<00:02:08.860> exactly<00:02:09.190> what<00:02:09.369> wits<00:02:09.610> these

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
so I don't know exactly what wits these

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.610 
so I don't know exactly what wits these
are<00:02:09.970> but<00:02:10.149> they're<00:02:10.300> in<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> mid<00:02:10.660> 20s<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:11.350> low

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
are but they're in the mid 20s so low

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.100 
are but they're in the mid 20s so low
20s<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.190> mid<00:02:12.370> 20s<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:13.270> if<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.660> would<00:02:13.810> compare

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
20s to mid 20s so if you would compare

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.420 
20s to mid 20s so if you would compare
if<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.260> would<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.590> same<00:02:14.620> size<00:02:15.070> from<00:02:15.280> all

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
if you would have the same size from all

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.090 
if you would have the same size from all
these<00:02:15.580> three<00:02:15.880> wheels<00:02:16.560> how<00:02:17.560> were<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.770> weight

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
these three wheels how were the weight

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.120 
these three wheels how were the weight
differs<00:02:19.030> between<00:02:19.269> them<00:02:19.630> not<00:02:20.620> by<00:02:20.739> very<00:02:20.769> much

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
differs between them not by very much

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.250 
differs between them not by very much
they<00:02:21.940> would<00:02:22.060> all<00:02:22.150> be<00:02:22.239> about<00:02:22.420> one<00:02:22.750> about<00:02:23.200> a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
they would all be about one about a

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.930 
they would all be about one about a
quarter<00:02:23.590> pound

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
quarter pound

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.550 
quarter pound
correct<00:02:26.660> they're<00:02:27.110> all<00:02:27.200> they're<00:02:27.530> all

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
correct they're all they're all

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.000 
correct they're all they're all
low-grade<00:02:27.950> into<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.280> same<00:02:29.590> 690<00:02:30.590> kg<00:02:30.770> so

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
low-grade into the same 690 kg so

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.270 
low-grade into the same 690 kg so
they're<00:02:31.130> very<00:02:31.340> very<00:02:31.610> strong<00:02:32.240> yeah<00:02:33.250> one<00:02:34.250> thing

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
they're very very strong yeah one thing

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.670 
they're very very strong yeah one thing
we<00:02:34.610> do<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.000> first<00:02:35.210> strength<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.350> then

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
we do is first strength and then

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.900 
we do is first strength and then
obviously<00:02:37.010> they<00:02:37.310> were<00:02:37.430> waitin<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.880> the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
obviously they were waitin in the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.330 
obviously they were waitin in the
organization<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.320> p43<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:40.070> going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> be

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
organization so the p43 is going to be

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.920 
organization so the p43 is going to be
your<00:02:40.430> lightest<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.940> everybody<00:02:41.450> thinks<00:02:41.660> amesh

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
your lightest to everybody thinks amesh

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.570 
your lightest to everybody thinks amesh
is<00:02:42.080> always<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.380> lightest<00:02:42.710> but<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.370> straight

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
is always the lightest but the straight

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.850 
is always the lightest but the straight
spoke<00:02:43.910> design<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.840> most<00:02:44.990> efficient<00:02:45.440> okay

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
spoke design is the most efficient okay

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.410 
spoke design is the most efficient okay
the<00:02:46.010> straight<00:02:46.250> spoke<00:02:47.260> will<00:02:48.260> be<00:02:48.410> lightest<00:02:49.420> okay

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
the straight spoke will be lightest okay

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.010 
the straight spoke will be lightest okay

owners love this particular style these

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.460 
owners love this particular style these
wheels<00:04:00.830> me<00:04:01.160> 890<00:04:01.550> range<00:04:01.790> yep<00:04:02.330> as<00:04:03.170> we<00:04:03.290> move<00:04:03.440> down

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
wheels me 890 range yep as we move down

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.240 
wheels me 890 range yep as we move down
we<00:04:03.739> got<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:03.950> competition<00:04:04.610> series

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
we got the competition series

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.100 
we got the competition series
and<00:04:06.460> wielded<00:04:07.000> Alan<00:04:07.330> of<00:04:07.360> course<00:04:07.480> design

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
and wielded Alan of course design

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.750 
and wielded Alan of course design
allocute<00:04:08.770> also<00:04:09.040> about<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.280> competition's

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
allocute also about the competition's

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.660 
allocute also about the competition's
here<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:10.570> didn't<00:04:10.780> design<00:04:11.020> this<00:04:11.140> one<00:04:11.550> but<00:04:12.550> the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
here I didn't design this one but the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.130 
here I didn't design this one but the
competition<00:04:13.150> series<00:04:13.480> while<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:13.750> designed<00:04:14.080> the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
competition series while I designed the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.780 
competition series while I designed the
original<00:04:14.230> function<00:04:14.740> but<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.190> competition<00:04:15.460> is

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
original function but the competition is

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.670 
original function but the competition is
you<00:04:15.910> obviously<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.930> focus<00:04:17.079> there<00:04:17.380> was<00:04:17.500> all

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
you obviously the focus there was all

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.560 
you obviously the focus there was all
about<00:04:17.950> minimal<00:04:18.519> weight<00:04:18.640> yeah<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.209> minimal

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
about minimal weight yeah and minimal

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.110 
about minimal weight yeah and minimal
rotation<00:04:19.959> so<00:04:20.500> but<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.160> see<00:04:21.430> which<00:04:21.730> looks<00:04:22.030> like

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
rotation so but you see which looks like

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.990 
rotation so but you see which looks like
something<00:04:22.840> decorative<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:23.560> obviously<00:04:24.000> there

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
something decorative is obviously there

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.490 
something decorative is obviously there
to<00:04:25.180> take<00:04:25.360> out<00:04:25.540> weight<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.080> if<00:04:26.170> you<00:04:26.260> look<00:04:26.380> at

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
to take out weight and if you look at

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.110 
to take out weight and if you look at
the<00:04:26.590> back<00:04:26.740> side<00:04:26.980> you<00:04:27.220> see<00:04:27.430> something<00:04:27.670> similar

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
the back side you see something similar

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.370 
the back side you see something similar
on<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.300> back<00:04:28.450> side<00:04:28.690> but<00:04:28.870> we're<00:04:28.990> also<00:04:29.140> taking

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
on the back side but we're also taking

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.110 
on the back side but we're also taking
that<00:04:29.650> way<00:04:29.830> out<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.130> we're<00:04:30.580> trying<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.820> do<00:04:30.940> it

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
that way out and we're trying to do it

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.480 
that way out and we're trying to do it
as<00:04:31.630> much<00:04:31.840> as<00:04:31.900> possible<00:04:32.280> farther<00:04:33.280> away<00:04:33.400> from

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
as much as possible farther away from

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.190 
as much as possible farther away from
the<00:04:33.670> center<00:04:33.970> of<00:04:34.030> rotation<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.600> reduce<00:04:34.870> atman

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
the center of rotation to reduce atman

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.140 
the center of rotation to reduce atman
that<00:04:35.590> rotational<00:04:36.100> inertia<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.850> obviously

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
that rotational inertia the obviously

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.450 
that rotational inertia the obviously
here<00:04:37.420> we've<00:04:37.540> also<00:04:37.720> been<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.950> cuts<00:04:39.220> and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
here we've also been the the cuts and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.800 
here we've also been the the cuts and
the<00:04:39.520> sides<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:40.030> make<00:04:40.150> sure<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:40.630> we're

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
the sides to make sure that we're

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.409 
the sides to make sure that we're
basically<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:42.280> gives<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.610> an<00:04:42.730> i-beam<00:04:43.180> type

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
basically it gives it an i-beam type

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.210 
basically it gives it an i-beam type
geometry<00:04:43.930> which<00:04:44.110> is<00:04:44.260> very<00:04:44.410> very<00:04:44.620> efficient<00:04:45.100> in

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
geometry which is very very efficient in

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.580 
geometry which is very very efficient in
bending<00:04:45.640> yeah<00:04:46.090> so<00:04:46.480> everything<00:04:47.230> about<00:04:47.530> this

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
bending yeah so everything about this

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.030 
bending yeah so everything about this
wheel<00:04:48.010> is<00:04:48.040> designed<00:04:48.940> for<00:04:49.560> basically<00:04:50.560> minimal

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
wheel is designed for basically minimal

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.070 
wheel is designed for basically minimal
weights<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:51.700> what<00:04:52.210> your<00:04:52.360> fool<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:52.810> find

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
weights and so what your fool you find

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.200 
weights and so what your fool you find
is<00:04:53.290> 19<00:04:53.710> inch<00:04:53.980> wheels<00:04:54.040> that<00:04:54.490> way<00:04:54.669> under<00:04:54.970> 12

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
is 19 inch wheels that way under 12

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.380 
is 19 inch wheels that way under 12
pounds<00:04:55.630> index<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.490> would<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.610> sea<00:04:57.820> 90<00:04:58.030> be<00:04:58.270> the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
pounds index so would the sea 90 be the

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.840 
pounds index so would the sea 90 be the
lightest<00:04:58.810> wheels<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.530> offer<00:04:59.770> except<00:05:00.490> your

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
lightest wheels you offer except your

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.230 
lightest wheels you offer except your
carbon<00:05:01.419> wheels<00:05:01.600> yes<00:05:02.020> okay<00:05:02.980> so<00:05:03.040> all<00:05:03.550> of<00:05:03.940> these

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
carbon wheels yes okay so all of these

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.890 
carbon wheels yes okay so all of these
means<00:05:04.540> this<00:05:04.870> will<00:05:04.930> be<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:06.280> lightest<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:07.330> then

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
means this will be the lightest and then

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.560 
means this will be the lightest and then
the<00:05:08.050> second<00:05:08.410> lightest<00:05:08.800> would<00:05:09.010> be<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:10.390> black

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
the second lightest would be the black

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.730 
the second lightest would be the black
one<00:05:10.780> right<00:05:10.990> at<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.590> m<00:05:11.740> 43

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
one right at the m 43

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.379 
one right at the m 43
actually<00:05:14.009> some<00:05:14.190> of<00:05:14.280> our<00:05:14.400> 519<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.030> pretty<00:05:15.240> right

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
actually some of our 519 so pretty right

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.110 
actually some of our 519 so pretty right
too<00:05:15.630> but<00:05:15.870> yet<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.080> would<00:05:16.620> think<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.830> t43<00:05:17.310> that

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
too but yet I would think the t43 that

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.610 
too but yet I would think the t43 that
would<00:05:18.300> be<00:05:18.419> probably<00:05:18.720> something<00:05:19.470> in<00:05:19.560> the

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
would be probably something in the

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.290 
would be probably something in the
second<00:05:19.979> line<00:05:20.099> instead<00:05:20.460> yeah<00:05:20.849> way<00:05:20.970> not<00:05:21.150> any

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
second line instead yeah way not any

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.510 
second line instead yeah way not any
start<00:05:21.479> to<00:05:21.569> get<00:05:21.690> into<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.050> five<00:05:22.380> 90s<00:05:22.860> in<00:05:23.370> the

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
start to get into the five 90s in the

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.309 
start to get into the five 90s in the
eighth<00:05:23.669> 90s<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.449> then<00:05:24.630> obviously<00:05:24.780> for<00:05:25.080> our

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
eighth 90s and then obviously for our

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.550 
eighth 90s and then obviously for our
bigger<00:05:26.000> vehicles<00:05:27.050> there<00:05:28.050> much<00:05:28.199> littler

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
bigger vehicles there much littler

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.559 
bigger vehicles there much littler
writer<00:05:28.830> much<00:05:29.009> higher<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:29.610> there<00:05:29.789> and<00:05:30.180> in<00:05:30.539> the

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
writer much higher so there and in the

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.439 
writer much higher so there and in the
load<00:05:30.810> ratings<00:05:31.110> sort<00:05:31.319> of<00:05:31.380> go<00:05:31.530> up<00:05:31.560> as<00:05:31.860> well<00:05:32.449> as

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
load ratings sort of go up as well as

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.150 
load ratings sort of go up as well as
you<00:05:33.660> go<00:05:33.780> along<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.110> serious<00:05:34.440> this<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.710> this<00:05:35.039> is

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
you go along the serious this is this is

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.339 
you go along the serious this is this is
low<00:05:35.280> rated<00:05:35.580> higher<00:05:35.729> than<00:05:35.759> s2<00:05:36.150> so<00:05:36.690> that<00:05:37.110> helps

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
low rated higher than s2 so that helps

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.580 
low rated higher than s2 so that helps
some<00:05:38.160> of<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.370> wave<00:05:38.550> sevens<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:39.289> for<00:05:40.289> track

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590
