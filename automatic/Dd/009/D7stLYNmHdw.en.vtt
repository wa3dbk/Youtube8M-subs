00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.080
 jockey very well guys he talks to them his 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.970
 dear host the doctor wrestling 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.300
 system in this tuto 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.800
 and I will help you as you can 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.980
 set the joystick for the game of 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.770
 computer and a version of xurÃ©s 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 that apparently if we use success 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 to emulate an xbox 360 control 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.160
 it seems that it does not catch it good in many 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.150
 cases there are some cases that perhaps 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.150
 fuck but I do not know 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.530
 and also what 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.829
 who were in the program when 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.199
 we install success 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.560
 in the game then we create the files and 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:09.610
 we execute the game after it sneaks 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:13.830
 well good not even like that if he does not 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.170
 we do not copy the files of success 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.960
 and we run the game the game not the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.689
 game tells us that like that control 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.820
 the usb is connected but it does not work 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.630
 no command then I made a 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.570
 configuration with the expand the only thing that 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.490
 you have to do it is the following will go to 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.120
 link that is in the description that I 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.550
 leave 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.760
 download this file that says expand 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.820
 configured for inversion by cams 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.330
 you know delivering the system we give to 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.330
 to download 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.299
 I downloaded 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.260
 we wait for it to finish downloading 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.560
 when I finish downloading we go to 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:13.550
 close to the file 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.550
 to the decompress 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:23.319
 true when we decompress it we go 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.319
 towards the former father 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.910
 can also read the file 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.260
 information that is from home 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.810
 we execute it 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.210
 and it tells us that it does not support it is because 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.090
 you have to execute it with 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.540
 with compatibility 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.290
 windows xp and run as program 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.290
 administrator 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.349
 and then when 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.480
 when they execute 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.440
 then when you run in the program you 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.440
 the ex- father will come out completely 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.440
 configured 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.390
 well configured to play it in the 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.599
 best possible condition because I 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.940
 configure the buttons to have a 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.439
 standard as if it were playing it in a 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.010
 console 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:39.329
 if you want to change the buttons only 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:43.159
 They have to click one of them and them 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:46.109
 will appear the tea the board with all and 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.769
 all the keyboard keys and the 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.769
 command buttons 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:58.500
 If you want, you can leave it like this 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.480
 you can play very very well that's all 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.000
 in which case that 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:09.830
 so I want to work the agreement and 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.830
 it looks good we see you then bytes
