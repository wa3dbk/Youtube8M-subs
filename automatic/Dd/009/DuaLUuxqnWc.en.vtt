00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.110

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.910
 it is the s12 with the front clipper on the 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.860
 atlas 540 as secondary jobs we 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.480
 understood perth to stand but I have 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.380
 changed a bit because I have 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.079
 only the well 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.060
 presso forehead turned here is my 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.800
 class by the way we have the pi and pi 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.720
 complete times 2 and we really have that 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.670
 stand still for of course extra 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.450
 so half as of course one 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.340
 shot-gun 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.170
 I've never used a shot-gun 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.490
 so go be fun 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.220
 that is why i like glass 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.890
 presser and sending instead of 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.240
 something else because that is what I like 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.550
 bulk i don't have it technically or anything 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.700
 who put it on and I knew where this was again 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.700
 word 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.290
 fashion things like none but have none 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.100
 racing with one thing is if she's okay okay 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.640

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.070
 ills tackle mohammed never succeed 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.810
 Finally, they can also potty 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.430
 the smappee sentiment of think google 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.080
 best can be around I really have 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.910
 besides him an antler could not faint him 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.680

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.119
 probably completely different side 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.110
 of the basket can be massive for months 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.430
 run towards it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.259
 doing it slowly just fucking quickly 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.600
 this way we took the kills we get one 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.979
