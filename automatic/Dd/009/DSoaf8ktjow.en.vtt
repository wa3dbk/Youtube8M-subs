00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.470
 policy leads to even more debt is 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.420
 but ultimately suffers the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.830
 Savings policy especially through the media 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.179
 are totally excited about greece 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.679
 back to the capital markets 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.500
 then the citizens will be back 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.279
 it is worse for citizens than worse 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.539
 ever before 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.490
 we have an economic slump of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.990
 samer minus 30 percent 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.430
 that happened in times of peace 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.510
 greece actually does not have it 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.369
 gives a nice story of age 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.080
 greek once said that came earlier 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.029
 German with tanks and ships and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.470
 we have bravely come now 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.980
 They are in ties and collars and we are 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.200
 helpless 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.059
 but you hear that is crazy in the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.320
 south since bled the country and instead 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.950
 we connect them to make them one 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.660
 bloodletting 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.320
 you could almost say it is one 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.320
 tragedy 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.159
 the greek patient the sick man 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.159
 from Europe 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.810
 our giro 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.750
 sister please the instruments 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.110
 you do not need fear but trust 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.409
 These measures are only for you 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.090
 go through western cuts again 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.079
 hospitals make tens of thousands of jobs 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.689
 painted 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.110
 Maybe that could be a bit 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.110
 hurts 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.530
 how are the patients saving policy 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.479
 for depression malaria 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.000
 and several other diseases 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.830
 that must hurt now because otherwise 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.830
 would not really be scared 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.459
 what about the suicide rate? 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.130
 they were once the lowest in whole 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.590
 Europe has now increased by 40 percent 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:10.810
 I have the feeling they never want 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:13.190
 Healings become shortcuts 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.109
 what are we doing against unemployment ? 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.090
 people dismissed we have one 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.910
 youth unemployment close to 60 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.799
 percent rising 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.359
 and what should I grab them now? 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.139
 to get you back on your own 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.139
 put 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.120
 and we are the future prospects 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.100
 well, 500,000 children in greece 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.750
 live under the poverty line greek 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.550
 Families give their children to sos 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.360
 children's villages because they no longer 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.360
 can feed 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.750
 Let us now hear a comment from the 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.650
 Deputy Chief Editor of 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.590
 world on sunday 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.170
 ulf poschardt what we the greeks to 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.769
 Remember is beyond what you are 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.180
 can expect 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.290
 but it is still economically correct 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.150
 understand this is neoliberalism 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.549
 you do not justify something 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.549
 works with something that is not right
