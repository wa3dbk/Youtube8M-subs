00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and it doesn't have to be perfect I

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
and it doesn't have to be perfect I
haven't<00:00:46.410> filled<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.010> perfect<00:00:47.519> because

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
haven't filled this one perfect because

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.880 
haven't filled this one perfect because

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
I'm going to use the tip of the diamond

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.719 
I'm going to use the tip of the diamond

in<00:01:48.390> half<00:01:48.570> lengthwise<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.469> then<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:50.159> just

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
in half lengthwise and then I just

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.580 
in half lengthwise and then I just
applied<00:01:50.640> water<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> back<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.719> it<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.049> hold

it in place and once that's dry I'll use

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.969 
it in place and once that's dry I'll use
paste<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.149> fill<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.539> seams<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.200> then<00:01:58.859> I'll

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
paste to fill the seams and then I'll

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.660

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.000 
let it dry and sand it smooth and then
it's<00:02:02.820> ready<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.149> fire

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
it's ready to fire

got a box that's made from no flake
firing<00:02:14.850> foil<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.530> bury<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.890> by<00:02:17.100> about

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
firing foil and I just bury it by about

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.790 
firing foil and I just bury it by about
a<00:02:17.400> half<00:02:17.610> an<00:02:17.820> inch<00:02:17.960> put<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.080> lid<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.500> and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
a half an inch put the lid on it and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.790 
a half an inch put the lid on it and
then<00:02:20.790> I'm<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.330> fire<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.260> kiln<00:02:22.560> at

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
then I'm going to fire it in the kiln at

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.400 
then I'm going to fire it in the kiln at
fourteen<00:02:23.640> hundred<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:23.970> fifty<00:02:24.330> degrees<00:02:24.720> for

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
fourteen hundred and fifty degrees for

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.810 
fourteen hundred and fifty degrees for
one<00:02:25.560> hour<00:02:26.360> after<00:02:27.360> firing<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:29.040> patina

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
one hour after firing I want to patina

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.600 
one hour after firing I want to patina
it<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.270> then<00:02:30.420> I'm<00:02:30.690> using<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.410> mini<00:02:31.860> fiber<00:02:32.310> wheel

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
it and then I'm using a mini fiber wheel

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.230 
it and then I'm using a mini fiber wheel
in<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.970> coarse<00:02:33.210> grit<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:34.350> remove<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.610> oxidation

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
in a coarse grit to remove the oxidation

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.930 
in a coarse grit to remove the oxidation
from<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.810> places<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.470> don't<00:02:37.800> want<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.220> so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
from the places that I don't want it so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.400 
from the places that I don't want it so
I'm<00:02:39.000> going<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.210> remove<00:02:39.570> all<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.110> from<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I'm going to remove all of it from the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.880 
I'm going to remove all of it from the
backside

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.850 

on<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.790> front<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.720> fiber<00:02:45.110> wheel<00:02:45.350> can't<00:02:45.650> get

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
on the front the fiber wheel can't get

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.020 
on the front the fiber wheel can't get
into<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.220> nooks<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.520> crannies

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
into the nooks and crannies

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.510 
into the nooks and crannies
so<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:48.020> really<00:02:48.290> brings<00:02:48.620> out<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.160> beautiful

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
so it really brings out this beautiful

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.890 
so it really brings out this beautiful
texture

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.869 

now<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.739> want<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.040> give<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.549> little<00:02:54.700> bit

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
now I want to give this a little bit

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.759 
now I want to give this a little bit
more<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.209> buttery<00:02:55.480> finish<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.200> I'm<00:02:56.379> going<00:02:56.650> to

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
more of a buttery finish so I'm going to

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.180 
more of a buttery finish so I'm going to
use<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.340> 3m<00:02:58.299> polishing<00:02:58.930> paper<00:02:59.200> in<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.620> 400<00:03:00.159> grit

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
use a 3m polishing paper in a 400 grit

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.229 
use a 3m polishing paper in a 400 grit
and<00:03:00.870> polish<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.900> completely<00:03:02.709> using<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:03.879> grit

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
and polish it completely using this grit

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.100 
and polish it completely using this grit
and<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:06.310> will<00:03:06.489> soften<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:07.180> finish<00:03:07.690> for<00:03:07.989> me

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
and this will soften that finish for me

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.509 
and this will soften that finish for me
and<00:03:08.230> I'll<00:03:08.319> get<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.530> really<00:03:08.980> really<00:03:09.250> beautiful

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
and I'll get a really really beautiful

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.500 
and I'll get a really really beautiful
satin<00:03:10.480> finish<00:03:11.760> always<00:03:12.760> make<00:03:12.940> sure<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.180> your

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
satin finish always make sure that your

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.619 
satin finish always make sure that your
hand<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:14.290> contacting<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.400> solid<00:03:16.030> surface<00:03:16.209> when

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
hand is contacting a solid surface when

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.750 
hand is contacting a solid surface when
you're<00:03:16.750> polishing<00:03:17.200> something<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:17.799> this<00:03:18.099> you

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
you're polishing something like this you

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.819 
you're polishing something like this you
get<00:03:19.060> no<00:03:19.329> control<00:03:19.840> when<00:03:20.260> you're<00:03:20.379> holding<00:03:20.590> this

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
get no control when you're holding this

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.259 
get no control when you're holding this
in<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.129> air<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.549> makes<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.879> job<00:03:21.909> much

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
in the air and it makes the job much

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.479 
in the air and it makes the job much
harder<00:03:22.329> if<00:03:22.959> your<00:03:23.560> hand<00:03:23.769> is<00:03:23.890> against<00:03:24.310> something

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
harder if your hand is against something

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.569 
harder if your hand is against something
solid<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.660> get<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> lot<00:03:26.560> better<00:03:26.799> control<00:03:27.160> this

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
solid I get a lot better control this

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.199 
solid I get a lot better control this
way

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.089
