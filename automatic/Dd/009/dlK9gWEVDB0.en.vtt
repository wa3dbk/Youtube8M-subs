00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
every game like this where it's an

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
have the invisible wall we're pretty

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
have the invisible wall we're pretty
much<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> game<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> stop<00:00:47.820> turn<00:00:48.180> around

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
much the game so as you stop turn around

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.510 
much the game so as you stop turn around
can't<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.050> any<00:00:49.230> farther<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.829> that's<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> it's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
can't go any farther and that's it it's

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.900 
can't go any farther and that's it it's
just<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.850> wall<00:00:51.090> nothing<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.899> um<00:00:52.789> games<00:00:53.789> like

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
just a wall nothing there um games like

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.139 
just a wall nothing there um games like
Halo<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.260> map<00:00:55.590> extends<00:00:56.129> pretty<00:00:56.610> far<00:00:56.850> outside

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
Halo the map extends pretty far outside

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.510 
Halo the map extends pretty far outside
its<00:00:57.420> boundaries<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.590> can't<00:00:58.859> go<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.070> far

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
its boundaries but you can't go very far

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.279 
its boundaries but you can't go very far
past<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.030> boundaries<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:01.170> have

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
past the boundaries because they have

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.189 
past the boundaries because they have
with<00:01:01.469> our<00:01:01.500> call<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> Guardians<00:01:02.460> in

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
with our call the Guardians in

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.880 
with our call the Guardians in
quotations<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.260> pretty<00:01:07.260> much<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.710> leave

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
quotations and so pretty much you leave

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.530 
quotations and so pretty much you leave
the<00:01:08.040> map<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.520> after<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.850> five<00:01:09.060> seconds<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the map and after like five seconds I

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.950 
the map and after like five seconds I
think<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.799> blown<00:01:11.189> up<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.180> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
think it is you get blown up so it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.240 
think it is you get blown up so it
doesn't<00:01:13.320> work<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.770> no<00:01:13.920> matter<00:01:14.040> what

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
doesn't work out for you no matter what

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.490 
doesn't work out for you no matter what
but<00:01:14.850> anyways<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.720> saw<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> put<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.259> map

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
but anyways I just saw I put up my map

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.260 
but anyways I just saw I put up my map
there<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> went<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.610> way<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.850> far<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.180> i

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
there I went all the way as far as i

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.690 
there I went all the way as far as i
could<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.600> my<00:01:18.630> marker<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.350> put<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
could with my marker and put a little a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.170 
could with my marker and put a little a
marker<00:01:21.659> down<00:01:21.810> or<00:01:22.140> whatever<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.530> call<00:01:22.710> them<00:01:23.180> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
marker down or whatever you call them so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
marker down or whatever you call them so
pretty<00:01:24.390> much<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.659> would<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:25.740> sure<00:01:25.979> i'm<00:01:26.100> going

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
pretty much I would make sure i'm going

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609 
pretty much I would make sure i'm going
at<00:01:26.430> straight<00:01:26.790> line<00:01:27.110> because<00:01:28.110> i<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.500> if

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
at straight line because i don't know if

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.749 
at straight line because i don't know if
it<00:01:28.680> would<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.860> hard<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> go<00:01:29.280> straight<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.640> not

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it would be hard to go straight or not

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.249 
it would be hard to go straight or not
but<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> head<00:01:30.479> straight<00:01:30.659> towards<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
but so I head straight towards that

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.920 
but so I head straight towards that
marker<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.340> past<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.850> keep<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.720> it's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
marker I go past I keep on going it's

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.380 
marker I go past I keep on going it's
really<00:01:34.259> cool<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:35.329> even<00:01:36.329> though

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
really cool actually like even though

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.789 
really cool actually like even though
you<00:01:36.509> marker<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.049> only<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> certain

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
you marker can only go to a certain

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.120 
you marker can only go to a certain
point<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.780> actually<00:01:40.079> go<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
point you can actually go all the way to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.789 
point you can actually go all the way to
the<00:01:41.460> outer<00:01:41.670> edge<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:43.049> screen<00:01:43.439> shows

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the outer edge of what your screen shows

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.380 
the outer edge of what your screen shows
on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.189> map<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.700> you'll<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
on the map and you'll see that in a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510 
on the map and you'll see that in a
second<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.259> anyway<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> got<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> super

second but anyway so here I got a super

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.210 
second but anyway so here I got a super
fast<00:01:47.700> mode<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.450> obviously<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.890> takes<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
fast mode because obviously this takes a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.490 
fast mode because obviously this takes a
long<00:01:50.430> time<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.820> took<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.000> good<00:01:51.320> minute<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
long time it took a good minute and a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.780 
long time it took a good minute and a
half<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.740> two<00:01:52.920> minutes<00:01:53.189> something<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.579> that

out about the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.050 
out about the
but<00:02:11.050> my<00:02:11.890> engine<00:02:12.160> started<00:02:12.430> turning<00:02:12.700> off<00:02:12.819> so<00:02:13.000> I

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
but my engine started turning off so I

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.180 
but my engine started turning off so I
was<00:02:13.180> like<00:02:13.270> okay<00:02:13.480> now<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.319> want<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.680> test<00:02:14.890> this

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
was like okay now I want to test this

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.150 
was like okay now I want to test this
maybe<00:02:15.970> if<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.450> turn<00:02:16.720> back<00:02:16.989> around<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.650> go

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
maybe if I turn back around and go

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.900 
maybe if I turn back around and go
inland<00:02:18.790> will<00:02:19.540> my<00:02:19.750> engine<00:02:20.410> turn<00:02:20.739> back<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.160> when

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
inland will my engine turn back on when

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.720 
inland will my engine turn back on when
i<00:02:21.940> get<00:02:22.150> back<00:02:22.300> inside<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.780> map<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.190> that's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
i get back inside the map so that's

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.920 
i get back inside the map so that's
pretty<00:02:24.910> much<00:02:25.000> what<00:02:25.239> i<00:02:25.270> do<00:02:25.360> i<00:02:25.450> turn<00:02:25.599> it<00:02:25.780> around

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
pretty much what i do i turn it around

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.020 
pretty much what i do i turn it around
go<00:02:26.590> straight<00:02:26.920> towards<00:02:27.130> my<00:02:27.370> little<00:02:27.640> marker

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
go straight towards my little marker

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.670 
go straight towards my little marker
purple<00:02:28.450> marker<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.900> put<00:02:29.050> in<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.170> map<00:02:29.410> and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
purple marker that I put in the map and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.420 
purple marker that I put in the map and
I<00:02:30.550> go<00:02:31.150> straight<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.900> try<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.560> keep<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:33.010> level

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
I go straight and try to keep it level

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
I go straight and try to keep it level
as<00:02:33.790> long<00:02:34.030> as<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.269> can<00:02:34.330> while<00:02:35.170> gliding<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.450> hope

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
as long as I can while gliding and hope

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.030 
as long as I can while gliding and hope
for<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.690> best<00:02:37.780> pretty<00:02:38.410> much<00:02:38.590> because

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
engine never turned on I don't know if I

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.820 
engine never turned on I don't know if I
got<00:03:07.840> back<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.200> map<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.470> never<00:03:08.650> even<00:03:08.739> thought

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
got back to the map I never even thought

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.280 
got back to the map I never even thought
of<00:03:09.040> checking<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.760> map<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.810> I'm<00:03:11.110> going<00:03:11.230> to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
of checking the map but I'm going to

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.410 
of checking the map but I'm going to
test<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.590> again<00:03:11.830> fly<00:03:12.160> up<00:03:12.280> way<00:03:12.519> higher<00:03:12.819> so<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.180> can

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
test it again fly up way higher so I can

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.630 
test it again fly up way higher so I can
glide<00:03:13.630> for<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> longer<00:03:14.110> time<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.799> sink<00:03:15.160> as<00:03:15.280> far

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
glide for a longer time so I sink as far

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.880 
glide for a longer time so I sink as far
as<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:15.880> possibly<00:03:16.060> can<00:03:16.450> because<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:17.410> course<00:03:17.680> I'm

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
as I possibly can because of course I'm

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.229 
as I possibly can because of course I'm
too<00:03:18.040> scared<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.370> get<00:03:18.489> out<00:03:18.609> of<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.790> plane<00:03:19.000> I

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
too scared to get out of the plane I
