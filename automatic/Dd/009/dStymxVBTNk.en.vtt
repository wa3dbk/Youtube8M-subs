00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hey and welcome to the new 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.770
 beach figure studio I am kolja balcony 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.179
 and now that we have a brand new camera 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.510
 I had thought of equipment 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.070
 OK 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.259
 why not just one 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.379
 real professional studio with 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.970
 new sound with crystal clear resolution 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.189
 turn the new videos 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.769
 In today's video I want something about 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.900
 Muscle building for men speak and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.880
 Although what exercises are actually 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.490
 suitable for you at the beginning if you 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.019
 beginners are able to build muscle 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.630
 what are really the most important 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.309
 Exercises are complete 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.020
 different philosophies 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.000
 some say you should first 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.950
 Some say machines are focused on machines 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.879
 you should rather be on free trade 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.710
 focus 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.809
 my approach and the opinion of me 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.750
 after works much better is on 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.239
 every case from the beginning with free 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.879
 weights to work from the beginning 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.129
 to work a basic exercises one 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.480
 fundament and that is above all the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.969
 Exercises squat and cross 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.070
 Bench presses are three of the reasons 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.290
 I recommend the exercises at the beginning 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.689
 really with very little weight and then 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.159
 slowly working up the technique of 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.020
 these two of these three exercises 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.820
 I link the videos here to you 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 I've done something to everyone like you 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.299
 that means that the technology is exactly perfect 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.939
 learn and now why are they exactly 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.729
 these three exercises now because these three 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.570
 Exercises many muscles at once 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.280
 activate 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.920
 and the more muscles you have all at once 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.070
 activates the bigger it gets 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.780
 to say the muscle building son now 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.490
 some recall determines yes you are yes 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 not so muscular and so broad at all 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.590
 brewed ready used especially wide 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.030
 for example, others are being built 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.280
 internet and so and why should i from 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.720
 Muscle tips now accept because 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.240
 I always keep my tips because of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.290
 Many years of experience of many own 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.090
 take studies 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.100
 and if I'm getting it right now 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.409
 I want to pump then on mass then I have 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.509
 just like I would do that and 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.549
 this book for example here of one 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.610
 and only arnold schwarzenegger on page 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.509
 97 writes he is very close to freeway 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.729
 between samantha of gravity 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.650
 So act freely, so to speak 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.150
 machines is one and it is about the 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.230
 gravity and he writes here on 297 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.849
 So in principle everything in English 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.890
 that's why you just have to briefly 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.310
 German for a beginning 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.360
 bodybuilders the majority of 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.849
 Training always with free weights 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.459
 should take place and who this this 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.890
 has book can be happy that here on page 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.659
 97 times read everything in this 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.480
 video is said I am referring 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.480
 completely on hanni and not on mine 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.239
 so to speak, only on my own experience 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.889
 and therefore definitely for 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.560
 muscle building the three basic exercises 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:54.470
 Cross lifting bench press and squats 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.510
 and has to do with that as dating 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.760
 the evolution out of our body 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.980
 adapted directly against the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.180
 to work gravity so 10 20 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.659
 a thousand years or more 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.549
 then back somebody has that 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.040
 was just on the search for food and 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.540
 anyone out there either one 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.060
 other people or just in the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.000
 Boar has said it with an arrow 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.239
 and bow or with the spear like that 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.120
 thrown off and then he had this 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.949
 livestock what partly 50 60 kilo none 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.599
 I know how hard it was, of course, first 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.190
 hauling until the cave or week 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.019
 after all that means he just had to 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.900
 to load a huge weight on it 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.760
 and then drag and therefore always 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.370
 working directly against gravity 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.620
 with real iron is always the best 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.109
 what you can do because our body 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.329
 just adapted to it and with 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.359
 You will do that with these three basic exercises 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.220
 lay foundation of everything else 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.889
 Okay again as a conclusion to the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.290
 conclude for you as a new beginner 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.659
 the area strength training and beach figure 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.019
 It is important to reach it from the beginning 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.699
 join the basic exercises if you 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.959
 more tips like this one here 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.609
 want to have an example and if you want 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.680
 you liked this video then you can 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.169
 just below the beach figure channel 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.079
 I subscribe to almost daily videos 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:14.239
 on the topic of muscle development for men fed 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.120
 removal for women and for men and 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.400
 nutrition with great great recipes 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.859
 and that's why we see each other on the beach 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.949
 your kollenberg 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.949
 Bonn
