about the ultimate makeover Elliott
isn't<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.139> crazy<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> mean<00:00:17.430> that's

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
isn't that crazy right I mean that's

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.099 
isn't that crazy right I mean that's
it's<00:00:18.240> extraordinary<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.869> they've

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it's extraordinary that they've

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.689 
it's extraordinary that they've
discovered<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.279> said<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
discovered that and as you said it's a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.330 
discovered that and as you said it's a
real<00:00:20.880> breakthrough<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.510> obviously<00:00:22.340> stem

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
real breakthrough because obviously stem

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.580 
real breakthrough because obviously stem

stem<00:00:25.800> cell<00:00:26.010> research<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.460> very<00:00:26.730> hot<00:00:27.330> box<00:00:27.570> but

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
stem cell research is a very hot box but

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 
stem cell research is a very hot box but
the<00:00:28.080> subject<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:29.189> country<00:00:29.580> i<00:00:29.609> think<00:00:29.939> i

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the subject in this country i think i

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120 
the subject in this country i think i
think<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.720> new<00:00:30.869> canaan<00:00:31.109> europe<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.740> give<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
think in new canaan europe and give the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.670 
think in new canaan europe and give the
reason<00:00:32.430> why<00:00:32.610> right<00:00:33.210> well<00:00:33.480> yeah<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
reason why right well yeah one of the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.229 
reason why right well yeah one of the
pilots<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.340> let's<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.700> talk<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> little<00:00:36.090> bit

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
pilots so let's just talk a little bit

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.479 
pilots so let's just talk a little bit
briefly<00:00:36.870> about<00:00:37.140> stem<00:00:37.440> cell<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:38.250> stem<00:00:38.460> cell

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
briefly about stem cell in stem cell

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.580 
briefly about stem cell in stem cell
research<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.420> there<00:00:39.750> what's<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
research so what is there what's the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.080 
research so what is there what's the
overriding<00:00:40.920> benefit<00:00:41.399> there<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
overriding benefit there so the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
overriding benefit there so the
overriding<00:00:42.420> benefit<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.899> stem<00:00:43.410> cells

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
overriding benefit is that stem cells

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.779 
overriding benefit is that stem cells
are<00:00:44.219> essentially<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.469> goop<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.129> makes

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
are essentially like the goop that makes

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.540 
are essentially like the goop that makes
us<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.930> stem<00:00:49.559> cells<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.370> like

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
us up right so stem cells can be like

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
us up right so stem cells can be like
the<00:00:50.730> tofu<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.719> food<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.110> add<00:00:52.260> whatever

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the tofu in your food you add whatever

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
the tofu in your food you add whatever
flavor<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> want<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.460> could<00:00:53.610> taste<00:00:53.730> like

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
flavor you want and it could taste like

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
flavor you want and it could taste like
chicken<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.239> beef<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.510> whatever<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.260> when<00:00:55.379> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
chicken or beef or whatever so when you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.920 
chicken or beef or whatever so when you
take<00:00:55.680> stem<00:00:55.980> cells<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.090> turn<00:00:57.300> into<00:00:57.539> any

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
take stem cells they can turn into any

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.680 
take stem cells they can turn into any
other<00:00:58.829> cells<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.640> turned<00:01:00.300> into<00:01:00.480> like

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
other cells they can be turned into like

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.959 
other cells they can be turned into like
liver<00:01:00.989> cells<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.980> heart<00:01:02.280> cells<00:01:02.489> anything

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
liver cells into heart cells anything

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
liver cells into heart cells anything
you<00:01:03.059> want<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.420> their<00:01:03.799> incredibly

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
you want them to their incredibly

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.950 
you want them to their incredibly
malleable<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.180> terms<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.540> medical

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
malleable so in terms of medical

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.830 
malleable so in terms of medical
research<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.979> valuable<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.760> they<00:01:09.689> are

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
research it's it's valuable if they are

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.600 
research it's it's valuable if they are
already<00:01:10.229> used<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.650> bone<00:01:10.830> marrow<00:01:10.860> transplants

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
already used in bone marrow transplants

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
already used in bone marrow transplants
and<00:01:11.700> heart<00:01:11.880> transplants<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.510> other

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and heart transplants and other

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.120 
and heart transplants and other
transplants<00:01:13.110> where<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.680> need<00:01:13.890> additional

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
transplants where you need additional

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.330 
transplants where you need additional
stem<00:01:14.520> cells<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.000> regenerate<00:01:15.509> cells<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
stem cells to regenerate cells so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.100 
stem cells to regenerate cells so
they're<00:01:17.580> incredibly<00:01:18.030> helpful<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.630> medicine

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
they're incredibly helpful in medicine

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.109 
they're incredibly helpful in medicine
and<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.619> particular<00:01:19.860> study<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and in this particular study the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.190 
and in this particular study the
scientists<00:01:21.799> published<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> quote

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200

material you're taking that cell and
transforming<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> into<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.640> stem<00:01:50.909> cell<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.720> it's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
transforming it into a stem cell so it's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.410 
transforming it into a stem cell so it's
like<00:01:52.020> um<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:52.979> trying<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.549> take<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> rock

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
like um you know trying to take a rock

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.959 
like um you know trying to take a rock
and<00:01:54.500> create<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> making<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.189> diamond<00:01:56.640> out<00:01:56.790> of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and create and making a diamond out of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.039 
and create and making a diamond out of
it<00:01:57.060> you're<00:01:57.180> not<00:01:57.329> changing<00:01:57.570> anything<00:01:57.840> you're

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it you're not changing anything you're

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.999 
it you're not changing anything you're
simply<00:01:59.240> adding<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.630> heat<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.710> speak

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
simply adding some more heat so to speak

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.010 
simply adding some more heat so to speak
and<00:02:02.219> making<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.729> into<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> nap<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.299> diamond<00:02:03.869> as

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
and making it into a nap a diamond as

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.300 
and making it into a nap a diamond as
opposed<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.619> adding<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.979> bunch<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.159> other

opposed to like adding a bunch of other

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.340 
opposed to like adding a bunch of other
chemicals<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.450> particularly

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
chemicals so that's particularly

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.719 
chemicals so that's particularly
important<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.860> research<00:02:08.160> because<00:02:08.399> oftentimes

you<00:02:17.490> could<00:02:17.640> potentially<00:02:17.760> take<00:02:18.300> say<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.690> don't

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
you could potentially take say I don't

those environmental cues change them
into<00:02:30.030> stem<00:02:30.390> cells<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.930> can<00:02:31.110> use<00:02:31.260> them

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
this way but then they can then now
