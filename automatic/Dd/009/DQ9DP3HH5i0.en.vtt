we're<00:00:00.149> gonna<00:00:00.240> now<00:00:00.450> take<00:00:00.480> a<00:00:00.719> look<00:00:00.930> at<00:00:01.050> the

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.140 
we're gonna now take a look at the

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.910 
we're gonna now take a look at the
aftershock<00:00:01.680> x17<00:00:02.449> running<00:00:03.449> both<00:00:04.259> crysis<00:00:04.680> two

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
aftershock x17 running both crysis two

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.030 
aftershock x17 running both crysis two
and<00:00:05.190> borderlands<00:00:06.180> 2<00:00:06.450> so<00:00:07.230> first<00:00:07.440> up<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.710> crysis

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
and borderlands 2 so first up is crysis

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.610 
and borderlands 2 so first up is crysis
2<00:00:08.189> we<00:00:08.730> have<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.059> set<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.690> very<00:00:09.990> maximum

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
2 we have this set to the very maximum

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.499 
2 we have this set to the very maximum
with<00:00:10.830> additional<00:00:11.670> attractions<00:00:12.059> enabled<00:00:12.420> as

well as there are excellent features and
basically<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.199> running<00:00:16.320> at<00:00:16.500> full

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
basically we have this running at full

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.740 
basically we have this running at full
HD<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.310> we're<00:00:18.060> getting<00:00:18.119> smooth<00:00:18.480> gameplay

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750

the<00:00:29.849> gameplay<00:00:30.150> gameplay<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:30.810> good

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the gameplay gameplay is really good

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.049 
the gameplay gameplay is really good
this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.439> pretty<00:00:31.679> decent<00:00:32.009> FPS<00:00:32.130> game<00:00:32.520> for

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
this is a pretty decent FPS game for

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.910 
this is a pretty decent FPS game for
those<00:00:33.210> who<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.480> FPS<00:00:33.719> games<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.320> focus<00:00:34.800> on

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
those who like FPS games with focus on

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.400 
those who like FPS games with focus on
the<00:00:34.980> start<00:00:35.219> line<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.930> sit<00:00:40.050> back<00:00:40.079> enjoy

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the start line so just sit back enjoy

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.400 
the start line so just sit back enjoy
and<00:00:41.399> watch<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.090> game<00:00:42.120> play<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:43.020> an<00:00:43.110> idea<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
and watch the game play I get an idea of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.450 
and watch the game play I get an idea of
the<00:00:43.620> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.829> performance<00:00:44.070> you'll<00:00:44.370> be

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the kind of performance you'll be

00:00:44.460 --> 00:01:49.440 
the kind of performance you'll be
expecting<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.660> 6<00:00:45.840> ATM<00:00:46.050> gtx<00:00:46.590> traffic<00:00:46.950> scar

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.260 

right<00:01:50.289> so<00:01:50.530> this<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:51.039> modern<00:01:51.310> lens<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.700> now<00:01:51.909> and

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
right so this is modern lens to now and

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.639 
right so this is modern lens to now and
what<00:01:52.780> we're<00:01:52.930> going<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.110> do<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:53.380> we're<00:01:53.500> going<00:01:53.590> to

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:54.600 
what we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.799> look<00:01:53.979> at<00:01:54.070> some<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.219> the<00:01:54.340> differences

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
take a look at some of the differences

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.819 
take a look at some of the differences
between<00:01:54.759> having<00:01:55.270> physics<00:01:55.659> on<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.439> physics

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
between having physics on and physics

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.459 
between having physics on and physics
off<00:01:57.039> basically<00:01:57.369> without<00:01:57.850> physics<00:01:58.469> Nvidia's

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
off basically without physics Nvidia's

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.709 
off basically without physics Nvidia's
physics<00:01:59.829> demonology<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.820> x70<00:02:01.329> is<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.539> six

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
physics demonology the x70 is the six

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.359 
physics demonology the x70 is the six
EDM<00:02:02.049> is<00:02:02.079> easily<00:02:02.619> able<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.920> run<00:02:03.039> this<00:02:03.100> game<00:02:03.250> with

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
EDM is easily able to run this game with

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.789 
EDM is easily able to run this game with
ultra<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:05.200> we're<00:02:05.380> going<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.560> take<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.679> look

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
ultra and we're going to take a look

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:06.899 
ultra and we're going to take a look
sound<00:02:05.979> different<00:02:06.340> it's<00:02:06.490> like<00:02:06.549> for<00:02:06.850> example

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
sound different it's like for example

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.550 
sound different it's like for example
we're<00:02:07.869> shooting<00:02:08.110> at<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.259> ground<00:02:08.440> here

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
we're shooting at the ground here

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.080 
we're shooting at the ground here
there's<00:02:08.739> no<00:02:08.890> rocks<00:02:09.160> there's<00:02:09.369> no<00:02:09.519> debris<00:02:09.759> and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
there's no rocks there's no debris and

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.300 
there's no rocks there's no debris and
there's<00:02:10.239> no<00:02:10.360> physics<00:02:10.720> involved<00:02:11.099> also<00:02:12.099> as<00:02:12.280> you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
there's no physics involved also as you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.949 
there's no physics involved also as you
see<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:12.610> top<00:02:12.970> many<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.360> these<00:02:13.450> flags<00:02:13.780> are

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
see on top many of these flags are

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.140 
see on top many of these flags are
stationary<00:02:14.349> they<00:02:15.250> don't<00:02:15.430> move<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.910> they

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
stationary they don't move and they

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.270 
stationary they don't move and they
don't<00:02:16.330> react<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.720> being<00:02:16.870> shot<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.380> it's<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
don't react to being shot and it's the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.559 
don't react to being shot and it's the
same<00:02:18.459> for<00:02:18.640> many<00:02:18.849> other<00:02:19.030> things<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.450> game

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
same for many other things in the game

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.990 
same for many other things in the game
such<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:19.959> rocks<00:02:20.230> or<00:02:20.470> liquids<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.310> such<00:02:21.760> most

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
such as rocks or liquids and such most

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.190 
such as rocks or liquids and such most
of<00:02:22.090> them<00:02:22.180> are<00:02:22.299> static<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.810> they<00:02:22.870> don't<00:02:22.989> move

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
of them are static and they don't move

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.860 
of them are static and they don't move
so<00:02:23.860> if<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.130> choose<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.400> nvidia<00:02:24.819> 680m<00:02:25.299> GTX

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
so if you choose the nvidia 680m GTX

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.780 
so if you choose the nvidia 680m GTX
card<00:02:26.140> what<00:02:26.650> you're<00:02:26.799> actually<00:02:26.890> able<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:27.549> is

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
card what you're actually able to do is

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.330 
card what you're actually able to do is
run<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.360> game<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.660> physics<00:02:29.019> on<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.920> many<00:02:30.130> of

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
run the game of physics on so many of

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.949 
run the game of physics on so many of
the<00:02:30.430> objects<00:02:30.819> actually<00:02:31.269> have<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> physical

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the objects actually have a physical

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.660 
the objects actually have a physical
presence<00:02:32.049> in<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.590> game<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:33.250> they<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:33.549> be

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
presence in the game so they can be

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.509 
presence in the game so they can be
affected<00:02:34.060> by<00:02:34.180> explosions<00:02:34.569> win<00:02:35.349> gunshots<00:02:36.280> and

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
affected by explosions win gunshots and

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.210 
affected by explosions win gunshots and
etc<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.260> even<00:02:38.500> includes<00:02:38.650> things<00:02:39.069> such

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
etc and this even includes things such

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.270 
etc and this even includes things such
as<00:02:39.340> blood<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.090> liquids<00:02:40.480> in<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.720> game<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:42.010> yeah

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
as blood and liquids in the game so yeah

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.559 
as blood and liquids in the game so yeah
so<00:02:42.640> we're<00:02:42.760> going<00:02:42.849> to<00:02:42.940> tend<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.150> physics<00:02:43.420> on

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
so we're going to tend to physics on

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.660 
so we're going to tend to physics on
while<00:02:44.230> having<00:02:44.440> ultra<00:02:44.739> settings<00:02:44.920> at<00:02:45.160> full<00:02:45.340> HD

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
while having ultra settings at full HD

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.259 
while having ultra settings at full HD
for<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.540> 680m<00:02:46.989> gtx<00:02:47.709> carbon<00:02:48.069> aftershock<00:02:48.700> x<00:02:48.849> 17

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
for the 680m gtx carbon aftershock x 17

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.610 
for the 680m gtx carbon aftershock x 17
and<00:02:49.750> we're<00:02:49.900> going<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.079> take<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.200> looks<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
and we're going to take a looks on the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.610 
and we're going to take a looks on the
differences<00:02:52.019> okay<00:02:53.019> so<00:02:53.079> we're<00:02:53.349> back<00:02:53.470> with

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
differences okay so we're back with

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.800 
differences okay so we're back with
borderlands<00:02:54.010> 2<00:02:54.310> now<00:02:54.489> with<00:02:54.730> physics<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.359> set<00:02:55.690> to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
borderlands 2 now with physics on set to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.660 
borderlands 2 now with physics on set to
high<00:02:55.989> settings<00:02:56.380> as<00:02:57.040> well<00:02:57.100> as<00:02:57.370> all<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.489> other

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
high settings as well as all the other

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.430 
high settings as well as all the other
settings<00:02:57.970> maxed<00:02:58.150> out<00:02:58.389> of<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.660> six<00:02:58.870> ATM<00:02:59.230> and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
settings maxed out of the six ATM and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.830 
settings maxed out of the six ATM and
not<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.100> show<00:03:00.220> x<00:03:00.400> 17<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.209> what<00:03:01.660> we're<00:03:01.750> gonna

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
not the show x 17 and what we're gonna

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.910 
not the show x 17 and what we're gonna
do<00:03:02.019> is<00:03:02.109> show<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.260> some<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> differences

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
do is show you some of the differences

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.830 
do is show you some of the differences
for<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.430> have<00:03:03.670> nvidia<00:03:04.000> 680<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.750> you're

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
for if you have nvidia 680 and you're

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.900 
for if you have nvidia 680 and you're
able<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.079> turn<00:03:05.260> physics<00:03:05.650> on<00:03:05.799> so<00:03:06.670> we're<00:03:06.790> gonna

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
able to turn physics on so we're gonna

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.190 
able to turn physics on so we're gonna
start<00:03:07.090> by<00:03:07.180> shooting<00:03:07.329> at<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.600> ground<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:08.049> show

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
start by shooting at the ground to show

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.199 
start by shooting at the ground to show
you<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> difference<00:03:08.680> basically<00:03:09.609> you<00:03:09.730> can<00:03:10.000> see

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
you the difference basically you can see

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.370 
you the difference basically you can see
that<00:03:10.239> when<00:03:10.569> you<00:03:10.630> shoot<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.930> ground<00:03:11.170> that's

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
that when you shoot the ground that's

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.599 
that when you shoot the ground that's
actually<00:03:11.440> bullet<00:03:11.859> impact<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.400> debris

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
actually bullet impact in this debris

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.550 
actually bullet impact in this debris
flying<00:03:12.970> everywhere<00:03:13.299> you<00:03:14.019> like<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.440> can

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
flying everywhere you like you can

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.440 
flying everywhere you like you can
actually<00:03:14.829> step<00:03:15.010> over<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.370> debris<00:03:15.639> then<00:03:16.329> doc

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
actually step over this debris then doc

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.479 
actually step over this debris then doc
them<00:03:16.600> around<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.049> they<00:03:17.200> react<00:03:17.560> because<00:03:18.130> every

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
them around and they react because every

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.890 
them around and they react because every
single<00:03:18.790> physical<00:03:19.000> debri<00:03:19.480> actually<00:03:19.720> has<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
single physical debri actually has a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.890 
single physical debri actually has a
presence<00:03:20.859> in<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.160> game<00:03:21.459> world<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.690> top<00:03:22.870> of

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
presence in the game world and on top of

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.390 
presence in the game world and on top of
you<00:03:23.109> usually<00:03:23.260> see<00:03:23.530> all<00:03:23.620> those<00:03:23.709> flags<00:03:24.010> all

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
you usually see all those flags all

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.190 
you usually see all those flags all
these<00:03:25.090> are<00:03:25.329> no<00:03:25.450> longer<00:03:25.600> static<00:03:26.019> but<00:03:26.170> I

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
these are no longer static but I

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.530 
these are no longer static but I
actually<00:03:26.489> dynamic<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.730> they<00:03:27.910> can<00:03:28.060> be<00:03:28.180> shot<00:03:28.389> at

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
actually dynamic and they can be shot at

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.780 
actually dynamic and they can be shot at
they<00:03:28.959> can<00:03:29.109> be<00:03:29.230> ripped<00:03:29.500> they<00:03:29.709> can<00:03:29.859> be<00:03:29.950> torn<00:03:30.250> and

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
they can be ripped they can be torn and

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.860 
they can be ripped they can be torn and
if<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:30.970> don't<00:03:31.090> if<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.180> throw<00:03:31.389> a<00:03:31.420> grenade<00:03:31.600> at

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
if you don't if you throw a grenade at

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.210 
if you don't if you throw a grenade at
it<00:03:31.989> can<00:03:32.230> break<00:03:32.380> into<00:03:32.560> pieces<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:32.980> they

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
it can break into pieces and they

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.860 
it can break into pieces and they
actually<00:03:33.670> go<00:03:33.910> flying<00:03:34.209> according<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.690> where

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
actually go flying according to where

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.660 
actually go flying according to where
you<00:03:34.930> put<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.170> credit<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.889> how<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.099> explosion

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
you put the credit and how the explosion

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.690 
you put the credit and how the explosion
sends<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.209> boss

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.770 

you<00:03:45.700> can<00:03:45.880> see<00:03:46.030> we're<00:03:46.180> actually<00:03:46.270> tearing<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
you can see we're actually tearing the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
you can see we're actually tearing the
angle<00:03:47.080> bits<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.440> shotgun<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.680> the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
angle bits of the shotgun and the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.370 
angle bits of the shotgun and the
officer<00:03:51.040> actually<00:03:51.370> reacts<00:03:51.610> in<00:03:51.730> real<00:03:51.880> time

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
officer actually reacts in real time

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.280 
officer actually reacts in real time
getting<00:03:53.380> hit<00:03:53.530> try<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:53.770> guns<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:56.050> emitter

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
getting hit try the guns so emitter

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.660 
getting hit try the guns so emitter
physics<00:03:56.620> that<00:03:56.710> I<00:03:56.800> technology<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.430> actually

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
physics that I technology is actually

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.550 
physics that I technology is actually
pretty<00:03:57.850> interesting<00:03:58.120> as<00:03:58.630> you<00:03:59.050> if<00:03:59.260> we<00:03:59.380> move

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
pretty interesting as you if we move

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.840 
pretty interesting as you if we move
ahead<00:03:59.710> you<00:03:59.950> actually<00:04:00.220> see<00:04:00.370> there<00:04:00.550> will<00:04:00.730> be

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
ahead you actually see there will be

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.510 
ahead you actually see there will be
some<00:04:01.030> enemies<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:02.530> when<00:04:02.920> we<00:04:03.010> find<00:04:03.220> them<00:04:03.340> you'll

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
some enemies so when we find them you'll

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.370 
some enemies so when we find them you'll
see<00:04:03.640> what<00:04:04.240> the<00:04:04.300> differences<00:04:04.660> are<00:04:04.810> for<00:04:04.990> combat

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
see what the differences are for combat

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:16.310 
see what the differences are for combat
with<00:04:05.680> nvidia<00:04:06.190> physx<00:04:06.459> on

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.540 

so<00:04:17.320> first<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.620> all<00:04:17.739> you<00:04:17.830> can<00:04:17.980> see<00:04:18.130> with<00:04:18.280> liquid

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:18.550 
so first of all you can see with liquid

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.550 
so first of all you can see with liquid
weapons<00:04:18.880> such<00:04:19.030> as<00:04:19.060> this<00:04:19.360> when<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.440> actually

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
weapons such as this when you actually

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.990 
weapons such as this when you actually
hit<00:04:20.769> them<00:04:20.890> a<00:04:20.950> bit<00:04:21.100> as<00:04:21.190> blood<00:04:21.459> splatters<00:04:21.970> and

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
hit them a bit as blood splatters and

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.460 
hit them a bit as blood splatters and
all<00:04:22.180> this<00:04:22.330> blood<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:22.780> liquid<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.230> stuff<00:04:23.350> on

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
all this blood and liquid and stuff on

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.050 
all this blood and liquid and stuff on
the<00:04:23.560> floor<00:04:23.740> they<00:04:24.250> actually<00:04:24.400> have<00:04:24.640> a<00:04:24.670> physical

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
the floor they actually have a physical

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.030 
the floor they actually have a physical
presence<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:26.140> when<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.350> step<00:04:26.560> over<00:04:26.590> them<00:04:26.920> you

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
presence so when you step over them you

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.560 
presence so when you step over them you
walk<00:04:27.220> through<00:04:27.340> them<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.640> lock<00:04:27.760> them<00:04:27.820> the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
walk through them and lock them the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.270 
walk through them and lock them the
liquid<00:04:28.870> can<00:04:29.020> actually<00:04:29.260> roll<00:04:29.470> down<00:04:29.710> hills<00:04:29.950> or

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
liquid can actually roll down hills or

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.830 
liquid can actually roll down hills or
you<00:04:30.940> know<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.120> can<00:04:31.240> actually<00:04:31.450> wait<00:04:31.600> for<00:04:31.780> the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
you know you can actually wait for the

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.469 
you know you can actually wait for the
pearls

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.000 

it's<00:04:40.479> just<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:40.840> much<00:04:41.050> more<00:04:41.110> going<00:04:41.350> on<00:04:41.620> in<00:04:41.800> when

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
it's just so much more going on in when

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.409 
it's just so much more going on in when
you<00:04:42.100> shoot<00:04:42.250> at<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:42.460> barrel<00:04:42.760> it's<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.210> shot

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
you shoot at that barrel it's a shot

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.270 
you shoot at that barrel it's a shot
barrel<00:04:43.630> over<00:04:43.810> there<00:04:44.050> if<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.680> ever<00:04:44.710> blows<00:04:45.130> up

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
barrel over there if you ever blows up

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.840 
barrel over there if you ever blows up
this<00:04:45.400> is<00:04:45.720> so<00:04:46.720> much<00:04:47.130> particle<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:48.310> much<00:04:48.430> effects

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
this is so much particle so much effects

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.969 
this is so much particle so much effects
and<00:04:49.449> so<00:04:49.630> much<00:04:49.780> debris<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.229> actually<00:04:50.530> reacts

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
and so much debris that actually reacts

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.520 
and so much debris that actually reacts
to<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.190> bullets
