the<00:03:07.090> animators<00:03:07.390> get<00:03:07.840> off<00:03:07.930> your<00:03:08.109> seat<00:03:08.319> act<00:03:09.069> it

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
the animators get off your seat act it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.649 
the animators get off your seat act it
out<00:03:09.340> because<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.910> got<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.120> really<00:03:10.239> feel<00:03:10.629> it

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
out because you got to really feel it

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.420 
out because you got to really feel it
inside<00:03:10.989> before<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.709> can<00:03:11.859> kind<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.069> like<00:03:12.190> put

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
inside before you can kind of like put

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.009 
inside before you can kind of like put
it<00:03:12.459> on<00:03:12.579> the<00:03:12.700> screen<00:03:12.849> yeah<00:03:13.299> I<00:03:13.739> just<00:03:14.739> go<00:03:14.950> crazy

believable<00:03:40.959> at<00:03:41.590> same<00:03:41.799> time<00:03:42.010> we<00:03:42.730> want<00:03:42.849> to<00:03:43.000> make

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
believable at same time we want to make

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.690 
believable at same time we want to make
it<00:03:43.299> awesome<00:03:43.870> we're<00:03:44.590> like<00:03:44.739> you're<00:03:44.919> like<00:03:45.040> wow<00:03:45.400> I

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
it awesome we're like you're like wow I

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.490 
it awesome we're like you're like wow I
know<00:03:46.329> that's<00:03:46.540> impossible<00:03:46.780> but<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.139> want<00:03:47.349> to<00:03:47.410> do

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
know that's impossible but I want to do

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.760 
know that's impossible but I want to do
that

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.470 

so<00:03:54.430> I'm<00:03:54.490> reckoning<00:03:54.730> what<00:03:54.910> we've<00:03:55.060> done<00:03:55.180> is<00:03:55.360> we

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
so I'm reckoning what we've done is we

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.210 
so I'm reckoning what we've done is we
built<00:03:55.690> a<00:03:55.780> combo<00:03:56.110> system<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.860> lets<00:03:57.070> the

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
built a combo system that lets the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.920 
built a combo system that lets the
players<00:03:57.460> sort<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.850> build<00:03:58.090> out<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.360> combos<00:03:58.750> in

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
players sort of build out the combos in

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.840 
players sort of build out the combos in
a<00:03:58.990> way<00:03:59.110> they<00:03:59.290> see<00:03:59.350> fit<00:03:59.470> but<00:03:59.920> it's<00:04:00.160> built<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.730> be

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
a way they see fit but it's built to be

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.150 
a way they see fit but it's built to be
balanced<00:04:01.270> also<00:04:01.510> as<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:02.020> sense<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.440> risk<00:04:02.980> and

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
balanced also as a sense of risk and

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.220 
balanced also as a sense of risk and
reward<00:04:03.490> so<00:04:04.000> it's<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.150> very<00:04:04.180> bottom<00:04:04.570> level<00:04:04.960> you

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
reward so it's a very bottom level you

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.660 
reward so it's a very bottom level you
have<00:04:05.380> your<00:04:05.650> basic<00:04:05.800> attacks<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.430> these<00:04:06.550> are

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
have your basic attacks and these are

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.400 
have your basic attacks and these are
the<00:04:06.820> first<00:04:07.030> hits<00:04:07.330> of<00:04:07.480> your<00:04:07.600> combo<00:04:07.930> chain<00:04:08.140> so<00:04:08.320> if

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
the first hits of your combo chain so if

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.570 
the first hits of your combo chain so if
you<00:04:08.500> think<00:04:08.530> about<00:04:08.740> it<00:04:08.890> with<00:04:09.040> your<00:04:09.190> daggers

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
you think about it with your daggers

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.880 
you think about it with your daggers
daggers<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.690> six-hit<00:04:11.110> change<00:04:11.320> so<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.680> first

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
daggers is a six-hit change so the first

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.500 
daggers is a six-hit change so the first
five<00:04:12.100> hits<00:04:12.370> are<00:04:12.490> your<00:04:12.610> basic<00:04:12.760> attacks<00:04:13.210> you<00:04:13.360> can

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
five hits are your basic attacks you can

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.450 
five hits are your basic attacks you can
always<00:04:13.840> cancel<00:04:14.020> those<00:04:14.320> basic<00:04:14.650> attacks<00:04:14.890> in<00:04:15.070> to

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
always cancel those basic attacks in to

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.000 
always cancel those basic attacks in to
dodge<00:04:15.670> or<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.000> block<00:04:16.299> any<00:04:16.930> time<00:04:17.140> you<00:04:17.290> want<00:04:17.530> you

cancel or even attack again out of it so
what<00:04:58.330> we've<00:04:58.450> done<00:04:58.480> is<00:04:58.630> built<00:04:58.990> that<00:04:59.080> system

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
what we've done is built that system

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.660 
what we've done is built that system
where<00:04:59.530> you<00:04:59.590> start<00:04:59.860> with<00:04:59.980> the<00:05:00.130> low<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:00.520> can

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
where you start with the low and you can

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.060 
where you start with the low and you can
go<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:00.850> always<00:05:01.210> move<00:05:01.390> up<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.660> chain<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:02.170> now

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
go to always move up the chain and now

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.290 
go to always move up the chain and now
you<00:05:03.130> start<00:05:03.490> working<00:05:03.850> in<00:05:03.970> things<00:05:04.210> like

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
you start working in things like

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.060 
you start working in things like
launching<00:05:04.840> attacks<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.530> then<00:05:05.710> you<00:05:05.800> can<00:05:05.920> start

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
launching attacks and then you can start

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.890 
launching attacks and then you can start
building<00:05:06.220> combos<00:05:06.730> out<00:05:06.850> of<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:07.600> might<00:05:07.750> get

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
building combos out of it you might get

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.420 
building combos out of it you might get
to<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.110> end<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.530> your<00:05:08.650> very<00:05:08.920> last<00:05:09.130> hit<00:05:09.400> you've

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
to the end of your very last hit you've
