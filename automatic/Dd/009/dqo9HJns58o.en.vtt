most brightness you have to use a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.950 
most brightness you have to use a
lithium-ion<00:00:58.670> 14500<00:00:59.670> battery<00:01:01.280> right<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.960> this

will give you impressive brightness
without<00:01:07.530> having<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:08.640> lithium<00:01:09.210> ion<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:09.960> all

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
without having to use lithium ion at all

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.250 
without having to use lithium ion at all
this<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.860> uses<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> plain<00:01:11.670> old<00:01:12.060> double-a<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
this just uses a plain old double-a and

this just uses a plain old double-a and
in<00:01:14.159> order<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> they've<00:01:15.360> had<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> make

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
in order to do that they've had to make

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.080 
in order to do that they've had to make
it<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.680> larger<00:01:16.920> these<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it a little bit larger these are the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.920 
it a little bit larger these are the
same<00:01:18.330> length

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
same length

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.039 
same length
pretty<00:01:19.439> much<00:01:19.759> right<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> diameter

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
pretty much right but the diameter

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.890 
pretty much right but the diameter
alright<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> newer<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:24.659> bit

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
alright the newer one a little bit

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
alright the newer one a little bit
larger<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.500> diameter<00:01:25.850> now<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.090> not

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
larger in diameter now if you're not

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.359

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
go on let's actually demonstrate the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.480 
go on let's actually demonstrate the
light<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.659> first<00:01:57.869> 10<00:01:58.140> seconds<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.920> went<00:01:59.340> out

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
light the first 10 seconds I went out

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
light the first 10 seconds I went out
there<00:01:59.700> there<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.030> actually<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> rabbit<00:02:00.990> there

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
there there is actually a rabbit there

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080 
there there is actually a rabbit there
so<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.740> kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.009> chasing<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.549> rabbit<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
so I was kind of chasing the rabbit that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:20.690 
so I was kind of chasing the rabbit that
Scooby<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> first<00:02:03.810> 10<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> 15<00:02:04.740> seconds

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.180 

okay<00:02:21.480> YouTube<00:02:21.630> I'm<00:02:22.020> out<00:02:22.140> here<00:02:22.349> at<00:02:22.500> 3:30<00:02:22.860> a.m.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
okay YouTube I'm out here at 3:30 a.m.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.300 
okay YouTube I'm out here at 3:30 a.m.
with<00:02:23.819> this<00:02:24.000> zebra<00:02:24.360> light<00:02:24.830> this<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.069> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
with this zebra light this is the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.030 
with this zebra light this is the
highest<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.270> highest<00:02:27.660> setting<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.890> how

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
highest the highest setting this is how

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.330 
highest the highest setting this is how
dark<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.120> without<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> light<00:02:31.250> pretty<00:02:32.250> dark

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.400 

okay<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.489> just<00:02:38.700> moved<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.120> distance<00:02:39.630> back

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
okay and I just moved the distance back

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.160 
okay and I just moved the distance back
so<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> little<00:02:41.459> longer<00:02:41.970> range<00:02:42.209> still

as<00:06:09.170> far<00:06:09.890> as<00:06:09.920> what<00:06:10.280> battery<00:06:10.730> you<00:06:10.910> should<00:06:11.120> use

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
as far as what battery you should use

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.430 
as far as what battery you should use
they<00:06:12.710> actually<00:06:13.160> recommend<00:06:13.790> a<00:06:14.450> loop<00:06:14.660> batteries

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
they actually recommend a loop batteries

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.190 
they actually recommend a loop batteries
so<00:06:15.650> I'm<00:06:15.770> using<00:06:16.010> an<00:06:16.250> eneloop<00:06:16.700> Pro<00:06:17.200> double-a

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
so I'm using an eneloop Pro double-a

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.470 
so I'm using an eneloop Pro double-a
I'll<00:06:18.860> include<00:06:19.370> a<00:06:19.490> link<00:06:19.730> to<00:06:20.000> where<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:20.330> get

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
I'll include a link to where to get

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.450 
I'll include a link to where to get
these<00:06:20.750> in<00:06:21.020> case<00:06:21.200> some<00:06:21.920> people<00:06:21.950> don't<00:06:22.340> have

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
these in case some people don't have

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.460 
these in case some people don't have
them<00:06:22.670> in<00:06:22.730> their<00:06:22.850> local<00:06:23.060> stores<00:06:23.600> so<00:06:24.320> I'll

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
them in their local stores so I'll

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.470 
them in their local stores so I'll
include<00:06:24.680> a<00:06:24.980> link<00:06:25.010> for<00:06:25.430> the<00:06:25.550> inner<00:06:25.700> loops<00:06:26.000> it

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
include a link for the inner loops it

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.100 
include a link for the inner loops it
also<00:06:26.690> has<00:06:27.050> a<00:06:27.410> battery<00:06:28.070> charge<00:06:28.460> indicator<00:06:29.110> if

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
also has a battery charge indicator if

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.710 
also has a battery charge indicator if
you<00:06:30.320> click<00:06:30.590> this<00:06:30.770> four<00:06:31.070> times<00:06:31.450> it's<00:06:32.450> going<00:06:32.660> to

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
you click this four times it's going to

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.860 
you click this four times it's going to
blink<00:06:33.080> from<00:06:34.040> one<00:06:34.250> to<00:06:34.400> four<00:06:34.610> times<00:06:34.970> indicating

blink from one to four times indicating

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.950 
blink from one to four times indicating
how<00:06:36.470> much<00:06:36.680> charge<00:06:37.130> is<00:06:37.220> left<00:06:37.370> in<00:06:38.090> your<00:06:38.420> battery

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
how much charge is left in your battery

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.620 
how much charge is left in your battery
all<00:06:39.200> right<00:06:39.320> let's<00:06:39.470> do<00:06:39.590> that<00:06:39.620> now<00:06:41.320> one<00:06:42.320> Oh<00:06:43.630> see

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
all right let's do that now one Oh see

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.810 
all right let's do that now one Oh see
it<00:06:44.720> only<00:06:44.840> blinked<00:06:45.290> once<00:06:45.520> since<00:06:46.520> I've<00:06:46.670> been

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
it only blinked once since I've been

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.240 
it only blinked once since I've been
using<00:06:47.090> this<00:06:47.330> a<00:06:47.390> lot<00:06:47.540> right<00:06:48.530> it's<00:06:48.740> down<00:06:49.010> to

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
using this a lot right it's down to

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.090 
using this a lot right it's down to
about<00:06:49.460> twenty<00:06:49.970> five<00:06:50.210> percent<00:06:50.650> now<00:06:51.650> the<00:06:51.770> fact

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
about twenty five percent now the fact

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.660 
about twenty five percent now the fact
that<00:06:52.220> this<00:06:52.460> can<00:06:52.670> generate<00:06:52.940> over<00:06:53.510> 500<00:06:54.410> lumens

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670 
that this can generate over 500 lumens

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.120 
that this can generate over 500 lumens
with<00:06:55.670> just<00:06:55.970> a<00:06:56.120> regular<00:06:56.450> AAA<00:06:57.110> battery<00:06:57.890> that<00:06:58.100> you

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
with just a regular AAA battery that you

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.790 
with just a regular AAA battery that you
can<00:06:58.430> get<00:06:58.610> in<00:06:58.790> any<00:06:59.030> just<00:06:59.810> convenience<00:07:00.500> store

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
can get in any just convenience store

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.080 
can get in any just convenience store
that's<00:07:01.370> amazing<00:07:02.300> I<00:07:02.420> mean<00:07:03.400> most<00:07:04.400> lights<00:07:04.790> that

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090 
that's amazing I mean most lights that

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.540 
that's amazing I mean most lights that
can<00:07:05.240> generate<00:07:05.660> that<00:07:05.930> have<00:07:06.410> to<00:07:06.650> use<00:07:06.890> lithium

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
can generate that have to use lithium

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.730 
can generate that have to use lithium
ion<00:07:08.000> batteries<00:07:08.570> that<00:07:08.810> you<00:07:08.870> know<00:07:09.410> they<00:07:09.560> don't

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
ion batteries that you know they don't

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.200 
ion batteries that you know they don't
even<00:07:09.860> pretty<00:07:10.340> much<00:07:10.490> have<00:07:10.640> to<00:07:10.700> order<00:07:11.000> them

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
even pretty much have to order them

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.660 
even pretty much have to order them
online<00:07:11.450> so<00:07:11.990> this<00:07:12.170> is<00:07:12.350> kind<00:07:12.620> of<00:07:12.740> a<00:07:12.830> new<00:07:13.100> level<00:07:13.400> of

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:13.670 
online so this is kind of a new level of

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.060 
online so this is kind of a new level of
development<00:07:14.030> so<00:07:14.990> yeah<00:07:15.290> I<00:07:15.320> mean<00:07:15.530> I<00:07:15.590> am<00:07:15.770> familiar

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
development so yeah I mean I am familiar

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.590 
development so yeah I mean I am familiar
with<00:07:16.340> the<00:07:16.610> budget<00:07:17.000> lights<00:07:17.210> and<00:07:17.480> they<00:07:17.570> are

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600 
with the budget lights and they are

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.720 
with the budget lights and they are
workhorses<00:07:18.320> but<00:07:18.680> if<00:07:18.770> you<00:07:18.890> want<00:07:19.070> to<00:07:19.190> step<00:07:19.460> up<00:07:19.670> to

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
workhorses but if you want to step up to

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.170 
workhorses but if you want to step up to
a<00:07:20.150> more<00:07:21.110> high<00:07:21.320> quality<00:07:21.380> light<00:07:22.070> yeah<00:07:22.910> I<00:07:22.940> would

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
a more high quality light yeah I would

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.180 
a more high quality light yeah I would
definitely<00:07:23.300> recommend<00:07:23.690> this<00:07:24.200> all<00:07:24.890> right<00:07:25.010> this
