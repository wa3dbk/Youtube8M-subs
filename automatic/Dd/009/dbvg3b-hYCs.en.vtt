00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 Welcome gentlemen greets you 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.730
 Parisians have been transmitting from this 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.290
 same spot scattered dot net and this 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.590
 opportunity with one of the territorial 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.269
 about the advanced panel in tractor and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.320
 in that video we open the club but leave 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.320
 make more videos 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.169
 inside the club we have eight to point 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.330
 insertion are actually 32 but 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.039
 Visibly we only have 8 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.810
 another 24 would have to do a mapping 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.210
 satec side or some driver for 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.919
 to be able to access them now the only thing 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.399
 we have to do to place a 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.199
 marker 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.199
 is simply to place it inside the 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.809
 play position and give some of 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.699
 those values ​​in this case do not give 7 in a 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.540
 value number 7 and then say that I want 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:47.360
 a group or that want a feeling or that 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.030
 I want a feiral depending on our 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.219
 social network the colors are already 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.430
 known among white actor for the 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.559
 turquoise gray for the middle club 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.570
 light orange for the feeling and 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.210
 fary I think I should both place 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.070
 different color for the fire out appears 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.380
 in either of two and the only way 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.060
 what we have to recognize them is with 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.570
 this small inclination of the liquid 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.720
 upwards for the feeling and for the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:19.240
 end down 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:22.090
 he is known in the green color and in the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.770
 yellow color now another detail that 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.810
 I believe it will be for many and that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.240
 many wish is that whenever I lift 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.520
 a track to always be loaded from 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.440
 that point for that we have to tell 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.650
 tractor leaving and we want it to load 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.930
 and that we do with the other 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.780
 then we save barn for the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.790
 example we put the penalty point 5 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.180
 but we want a kilo we want a 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.510
 side then every time we load a 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.409
 track to this we would arrive that it is 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.469
 will always be charged from that point 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.259
 we come back or rather we load another 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.450
 song we return to the previous song 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.990
 and let's see how it was going to load from 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.380
 that oad marker that has been 15 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.210
 we will charge 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.880
 and we see that it has automatically 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.020
 loaded on that marker for another 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.760
 function I'm sure they have escaped 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.130
 many is that the path allows us 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.140
 make a continuous reproduction of 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.209
 songs that are in the you see by 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.130
 example I have a song in decades 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.500
 and another happy song but the song 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.560
 of the teak I have a feira a marker fail 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.340
 out at point number 6 and on the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.980
 number b I have a feeling at the point 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.090
 reproduction or at point number one 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.360
 then what will do tractor is 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.480
 that when the play comes to that faire 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.130
 out to 6 will automatically play 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.750
 the song of dec bay with that marker 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.400
 from facebook number 1 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.070
 now the new big machine function 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.750
 this we have to do with the sinn 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.250
 activated and neither a function of 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.940
 cropper so they have to make sure 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.530
 well at what point do they leave that feirauto in 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.950
 this case I have two songs with the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.050
 I live from pm so it's going to sound decent 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.680
 we are going to give him play we get a little closer 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.630
 to 6 and as I said they will find out 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.150
 moment that the play to that marker 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.760
 number 6 will automatically sound the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.340
 dv from that marker of feil 1 in 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.459
 fighting in the number then a little 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.459
 plus 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.569
 we dance lic 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.319
 or they do not realize he saw it as I said neither 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.970
 well male and micro fire is kept in 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.950
 almost the same because sanz almost the same bpm 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.330
 There will be a need for those who have to 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.300
 leave the emergency booth and want 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.090
 have a track backup and that in 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.580
 some specific moment now that's 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.250
 ideal but you can also have a point 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.720
 against since the next song 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.160
 that can be on that list can be 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.010
 play automatically and when 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.140
 come you have to continue to fire out then 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.940
 what we have to do we are going to 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.430
 references 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.030
 and in the login tab we remove or 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.880
 we activate the feirauto racing in the case 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.090
 from day to day we can leave it 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.370
 deactivated and when we want to leave what 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.660
 we leave activated and when we want it 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.640
 in the next song play 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.920
 we go back to preferences and what 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.260
 we leave activated is going to be the example 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.100
 we remove elche 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.760
 we close 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.830
 we go to the end point almost the end point 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.000
 we must play and we will see that that 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.510
 automatic play function 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.510
 is 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.050
 then as I said ideal for when 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.430
 They want to have a song from Acáp and they 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.150
 want to leave the cabin for a 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.530
 emergency 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.680
 they simply maintain their conditions of 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.610
 preferences one more time to leave it 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.960
 modding market and activate and dodge 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.789
 happy efe the bad guys 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.190
 let's see the small description of 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.190
 this top first with the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.250
 Christmas arrows among the markers in 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.620
 this case let's start with the 1 follow 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.750
 with the 2 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.130
 the third and we see how he knows with 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.530
 safety mind with the values 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.740
 assigned to those markers for example 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.229
 again we take out 2 to 32 and do not make 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.900
 also here the value of the marker in the 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:31.229
 that we are and in the box is at 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.570
 costadito we have 42 points 59 that we 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.720
 indicates in what time is that 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.600
 next marker to the right we can 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.080
 rename after we're just going to put you 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.980
 for example 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.200
 12 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.820
 and we can renew it to the title that 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.550
 we create convenient 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.820
 obviously we already saw it 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:57.360
 and with the garbage icon what 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.190
 we do is erase it now something weird has 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.260
 fact tractor k conoscan button 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.300
 director the truth I do not see utility 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.290
 but there's the function and what's going to 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.790
 do is create an additional point to 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.010
 where we are placed for example 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.770
 because maybe store we saw that in 7 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.140
 another one has been created we can change it 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.700
 that we want happened with the team to that 7 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.260
 the need does not go because it also 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.750
 can do manually but that I have 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.990
 made deals 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.180
 now button more than we can 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.330
 to do is change position or change 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:33.960
 of number there if then it seems that there was 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.490
 something that we have assigned we give more and 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:42.129
 we want you to feel what happens to 8 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:43.959
 and that 's the function of you map 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:45.969
 good gentlemen that has been all with 

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:47.830
 respect to which within advance to 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:49.179
 the extractor do not forget to follow us 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.580
 in sharing and we know about networks 

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:53.169
 social facebook twitter and youtube and 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.339
 we also expect your comments inside 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.300
 of the note 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:57.300
 now yes until the next
