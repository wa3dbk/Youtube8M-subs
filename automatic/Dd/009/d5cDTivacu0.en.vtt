00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.990
 so there we see better the gir of 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.990
 Installation 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.350
 in order to judge the station is seen 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.350
 well the limit that is here here 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.060
 so follow him there that means that 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.360
 here we are below zero degrees and 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.620
 here is above zero degrees and 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.620
 the humidity in the air 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.370
 on the part 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.960
 in three hours of debate it freezes and on 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.760
 the part above 0.2 and well that's it 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.420
 what would it look like dhimmis at 6pm a bit 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.060
 the ambient air for that only fault 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.240
 that's why it's this part 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.479
 there there must be bp 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.729
 insulation and not that it puts 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.009
 water everywhere because when all of that 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.270
 it'll digest down if at my gun there 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.869
 is not it will sink 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.869
 it will sink 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.610
 1 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.610
 we see an interesting phenomenon 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.760
 it is there 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.020
 bah frost slope badly done 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.380
 and there we see that it's like a trap 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.210
 to town between them here here 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.420
 we see that it is frozen there 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.840
 I froze the laces not to suffer alas 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.840
 ARJEL 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.189
 so here I have here would have two oils 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.229
 their employees the developer 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.820
 by the way that's what I showed in 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.860
 the video point of the sky 1 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.680
 remember the bottom is not jugulated 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.920
 precisely there is oil keith haring 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.880
 on the sees well 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.910
 I saw choice and it is and hot air 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.080
 who can sometimes we have not thought 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.080
 I thought it's true that seeing the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.020
 Oh 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.800
 but here we see that there is a 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.800
 small oil trap 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.800
 for that it is not true there is 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.760
 the oil here 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.760
 you interest to do 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.590
 a regular ford larry necklace is going 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.590
 directly compressor 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040
 ah ah 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.319
 because there we see where it goes down 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.469
 there it goes back it goes back and here it 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.469
 descends 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.550
 here 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.760
 so there we have facilities so 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.110
 the same 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.450
 we see that 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.240
 So here it goes down it goes down 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.110
 down goes down but here it goes it 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.110
 ride a world 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.200
 so here we see the same 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.110
 here is not to play the seize 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.030
 like this would surely be a little stupid 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.890
 than 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.890
 7 days it's a little trap for life 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.450
 hahaha 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.670
 that's the rosaceae that part of it 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.110
 and the rest is a little bit stuck a 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.849
 little oil trap now we see 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.140
 that even here his wise it is about 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:50.270
 everywhere it was he who was doing that 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.530
 here I do not know 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.530
 we're not here I'm not going
