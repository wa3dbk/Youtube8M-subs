00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.129
 that's it it's all it's to a pile 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.330
 for microbes and is today a 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.650
 new video in the game 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.619
 configuration shut up and today we 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.849
 is against the cooler so we chose 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.220
 a cooler master hyper 212 evo a cold 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.560
 on sale will dissipate very good quality 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.120
 and has already proven itself in version 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.800
 evo it's even better and with an awning 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.080
 kg they have a little reworked the look 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.820
 so it's really a very good product 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.710
 to tell you the Swiss the very 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.580
 big confides that it corresponds to a 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.620
 core i7 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.340
 so we can tell you that it's very 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.120
 good so I will not have read 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.480
 the ifri down internet extension no 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.630
 far from the golds just unpacking so here 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.150
 Heavy fighting is so with the socket 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.540
 2011 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:09.220
 good then we'll do a little unpacking 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.780
 for confi mystery when you could 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.390
 notice in front of the industrial tribunal video 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.970
 I organized myself to have a 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.220
 better lighting like that you see 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.940
 better my videos you've been pretty good 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.940
 criticized on on the light so I the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.090
 confirms I do not deny you have 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.110
 reason in level at the site image and not 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.630
 yet the end of May but now find 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:40.490
 the spots it's going very well 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.490
 then you explain 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.789
 ap 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.360
 I think if you subscribe a 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.400
 chain to another to other channels 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.350
 IT 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.050
 I think you've already seen 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.880
 unpacking that in 212 evo it's done 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.520
 lines or those of this ventirad 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.910
 so we find in 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:19.430
 the backplate worries with in then 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:27.500
 we do not have a race license 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:29.780
 estate for the 2011 socket for for 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.690
 add a new tower fan this 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.150
 what is dam of intel companies 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.500
 finally you know the parade we have 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:46.520
 all the bedding here so we want 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.770
 to see the operators is useful 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.150
 well if cooler master have provided me 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:56.150
 these little piece of paper 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.459
 it's really great I feel like it's ok 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.590
 use my life to not speak ill 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:06.500
 each silly hand then ventirad with 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.220
 so our beautiful fan with 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.250
 our cable in 4 pin our know departure 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.769
 which goes back tact so it's live 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.510
 download 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:25.730
 the steps are directly in contact with 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:30.200
 the hard base of the processor we have 1 2 3 4 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:36.099
 5 6 7 8 8 heat pipes that goes back so 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.540
 four on each side with our students 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.069
 so the state format that not very 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.420
 bulky for but in a housing on 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.269
 can vote of high memory as I have 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.950
 have seen before I took the wines 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.359
 who are who are fast enough but because 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.430
 we feel foal since it is not 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.370
 a cooler like the cooler master hyper 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.930
 6 2 6 1 612 is who he is very 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.030
 bulky so I'm not sure that 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.790
 sometimes it goes the limit with his with 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.930
 the six did not do it because I loved him 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.400
 but it will really limit any case 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:13.909
 strong no problem level of the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:18.289
 nouba so have our behavior pretty 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:23.109
 boring to climb a good note following 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.109
 repeat if not bah to implant corner 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.630
 it was a life of unpacking so two 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:35.509

 my channel for the other videos of the 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.380
 mysterious configuration for the 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.460
 mounting 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.840
