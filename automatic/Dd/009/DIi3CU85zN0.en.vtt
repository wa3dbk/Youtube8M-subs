like other nail art we've done that it's
only<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:40.170> two-thirds<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.950> now<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.219> is

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
only like two-thirds of the now this is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.369 
only like two-thirds of the now this is
pretty<00:00:41.670> much<00:00:41.850> about<00:00:42.300> half<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> nail<00:00:43.170> so

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
let's get started with that I'm going to

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.720 
let's get started with that I'm going to
do<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.809> side<00:00:46.079> swipe<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> white<00:00:47.219> colors

and<00:01:09.740> it's<00:01:09.890> pretty<00:01:10.160> much<00:01:10.430> about<00:01:10.700> half<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.300> the

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
nail we're going to be doing it might

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.140 
nail we're going to be doing it might
take<00:01:14.330> two<00:01:14.740> coats<00:01:15.740> maybe<00:01:16.250> not<00:01:16.520> maybe<00:01:16.820> yes

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
take two coats maybe not maybe yes

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.660 
take two coats maybe not maybe yes
