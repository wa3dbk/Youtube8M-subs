00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:08.269
 we all know that quality of life is possible 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.269
 change when regularly 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.360
 doing your health in what sense 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.610
 physical exercise various simulators 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.550
 yes, just work in the garden 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.380
 gives us more strength and energy today 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.939
 we will learn how breathing simulators 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.939
 improve the quality of meet elena 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.610
 highly 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.100
 divided thanks that you came to us well 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.460
 tell me why so sure about that but i 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.300
 heard so about it from a friend from 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.090
 girlfriends up 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.940
 at first she showed me breathing 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.500
 gymnastics here and I built 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.960
 Strelnikova gymnastics 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.750
 by strelnik yes we said they in our 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.230
 program if this is a very useful thing i 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.089
 also tried to deal with and I 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.690
 it seemed that I had improved 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.710
 health condition and what you have 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.199
 health problems 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.110
 yes , firstly, this is a problem of excess 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.520
 weight second dipper the hypertonic 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.740
 illness ii really many people 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.119
 by the way 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.740
 see we inhales the simulator some 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.289
 respiratory gymnastics alternative 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.060
 because to the respiratory gymnastics itself 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.440
 you need to force yourself 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.320
 remind you to do something 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.420
 strain while it seems that 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.580
 resting on and simulator from all these 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.429
 disadvantages spared ie do 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.619
 don't need anything just breathe with them they 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.619
 through such breathing simulators in 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.680
 the body enters the air with high 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.560
 carbon dioxide and low 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.840
 oxygen content the whole point is that 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.420
 all these simulators are built on the principle 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.119
 back breathing or how else 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.399
 called the snorkel effect the snorkel on 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.360
 in fact this is this tube for 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.049
 scuba diving 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.049
 while i am eating 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.000
 just when you breathe through this tube 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.020
 breathe not only the air that 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.060
 surrounds you 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.380
 but also part of the air that you 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.810
 exhaled into the phone 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.880
 this is the snorkel effect just as well 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.590
 Most respiratory simulators 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.750
 based on the same effect 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.600
 return breathing what happens when 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.110
 this enriches this air 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.930
 carbon dioxide and see reacts to this 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.280
 modified gas composition so that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.810
 adapts where to go from 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.370
 for large amounts of carbon dioxide 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.360
 blood expansion occurs 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.190
 vessels 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.930
 and it really leads to a decrease 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.780
 blood pressure what is elena 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.010
 see how it turns out your girlfriend was 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.430
 the rights 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.360
 you really have to purchase 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.519
 this is not a difficult breathing simulator and 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.420
 get engaged but i think we 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.970
 we can not wait for this moment in Richie 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.709
 not that we are one of you right now 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.230
 these simulators will give I believe that 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.230
 here is this beautiful
