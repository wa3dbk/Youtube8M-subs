 Good evening I am Professor of India and 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.580
 in today's lesson I will invite you to stay 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:10.650
 careful about your behavior on 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.540
 facebook the social network that counts 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.790
 now a billion subscribers in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.949
 particular you have to be very careful 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.420
 I like that you put on the pages or 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.640
 fans page if you prefer 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.800
 when these are commercial pages vi 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.990
 I'll give you an example my friend mario 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.490
 from the coffins and deign and one day he has 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.529
 clicked I like it on the page 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
 the lamb fans who among others 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.699
 Things explain how to pack meatballs 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 with the innards to keep innocent 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.109
 lambs because admitted I like for 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.390
 to be able to comment awakened the photo of a 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.609
 huge Easter grill page i 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.050
 Lamb fans are run by a company 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.089
 which distributes lamb meat into 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.249
 around the world and has been advertised on 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.170
 facebook paying a figure of six zeros 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.719
 now you need to know that facebook doesn't 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.699
 promotes this company by inserting it here and there 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.859
 there at random on its pages the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.269
 promotes raising for days and days the 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.829
 location of your notifications 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.670
 friends who put me like that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.559
 page 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.420
 the reason is soon told then you see that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.190
 has a friend like that page vi 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.050
 trust your friend's tastes and 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.000
 go and see what it is in 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.800
 case of mario but the result was 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.390
 that for weeks his vegan friends 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.020
 they saw on their main page 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.270
 of facebook the so-called com ei a mario 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.490
 like to devour innocent lambs the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.350
 poor mario quickly lost the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.430
 girl to friends and even her own 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.020
 social identity 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.090
 he recently tried to commit suicide 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.040
 hanging himself with the guts of a beef 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.750
 Argentine be careful I like that 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.890
 put on commercial pages you can 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.050
 stay calm only on pages 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.340
 humorous groups of friends do not have 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.510
 you can also make a profit 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.070
 quiet with the wine page from 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.800
 sandra for example but be careful 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.870
 because facebook does not sell advertising but 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.360
 is selling you as a testimonial 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.070
 advertising unaware facebook not 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.720
 sells products sells the souls of the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.370
 people to raise his misery 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.409
 facebook quotes is looking for 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.540
 desperately to squeeze money with 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.460
 a giant juicer where yours 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.440
 heads make the part of the oranges but 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.610
 we must consider that so many heads are 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.909
 empty 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.909
 good evening
