it<00:04:08.490> there<00:04:09.490> we<00:04:09.550> go<00:04:09.700> up<00:04:10.300> I<00:04:10.600> tried<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.590> use<00:04:11.770> the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
it there we go up I tried to use the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.750 
it there we go up I tried to use the
lock<00:04:13.560> all<00:04:14.560> right<00:04:14.710> and<00:04:14.920> there<00:04:15.100> we<00:04:15.190> go<00:04:15.340> five<00:04:15.610> out

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
lock all right and there we go five out

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
of five and for some reason I thought it

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.460 
of five and for some reason I thought it
had<00:04:18.940> something<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.450> do<00:04:19.570> with<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.780> picture<00:04:20.140> I'm
