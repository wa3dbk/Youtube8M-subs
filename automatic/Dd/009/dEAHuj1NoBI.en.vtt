00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.280
 old year of EHEC de 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.510
 and that's what I tested Ministers Bayern van b 250 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:12.629
 the domestic was pretty good 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.359
 and what had been faulted again, for example, have the little that late 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.839
 Therefore, now consider the Acer Aspire were 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.189
 531 concerned 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.630
 that is supposed to solve this problem because since a larger day falls 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.329
 we'll see otherwise 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.470
 as well as that's organic to the 52 ounces of beautiful packaging 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.239
 the public session 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.370
 unfortunately no bag cleared 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 German court 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 then very nice surface as you can see 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.860
 Glenz also not too strong 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630
 and that's how it is 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.630
 really very slim 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.050
 nobody will be very good to me either 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.050
 I read so embraced from all sides 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.550
 you can clearly see that around 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.350
 again limited space for musicians 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 but I do not know about the module on board he is not likely 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.950
 Place 5 13 Battery is here 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.870
 but if you can put the included 3 No 6-cell battery 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.870
 Unfortunately, we think we'll look a little bit out 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.940
 and then you can too 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.290
 we'll do more for a semblance 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.390
 and it's still open 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.390
 and, of course, like a mirror of evil 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.040
 that is not that much 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 all the robbers have decided so far 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.030
 the keyboard is very good at writing 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.820
 it is not the same as when is it at Hyundai 52 namely 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.240
 the Sisi is a bit smaller or too 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.590
 the good ones 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.060
 I test it now 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.780
 and of course Cape Town 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.079
 what had annoyed me so g2 final so small is 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.650
 Here we have finally stepped one already went 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.769
 optimistic people work well 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.769
 the one fitting plan 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.909
 with such an open state 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.909
 of course I like that very slim and very noble 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.369
 but Lena very rarely but sides already say what fits in the box 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.869
 Table tennis KR 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.869
 the court stands 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.359
 Schibsted Media Brent Crude October damn 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.139
 a 6-cell battery with 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.259
 Genscher hobbies can read 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.179
 5200 media Kerr hours 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.599
 So that will be determined by one already hold 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.599
 I'll just test it 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.189
 the Spree has addressed 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.189
 after all, a goal is used 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.649
 I looked out the back 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:23.239
 But that also has the advantage, for example, of keeping the motto 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.579
 can 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.579
 and so ugly too 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.409
 Finance Prof 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.009
 Franconia 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.009
 around four hours 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.789
 and 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.259
 what can she do with me again? 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.859
 Drivers and so on you have to download from the internet 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.289
 that was the whole content
