00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.270
 Hello friends, we are very 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.790
 interesting question about democracy but how would 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.699
 by example therefore by example we are completely 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.839
 just going to look means a question 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.939
 create such a green card lottery 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.130
 there is a man playing here he is a doctor of science 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.240
 that is, such as it seems from the point 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.289
 viewer 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.300
 such a valuable person and and so there is still 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.160
 there he so somehow neglect him well 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.900
 there is still some fool let's say there 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.480
 quite a simple person but absolutely 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.980
 but no value 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.500
 Wave also give the doctor that is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.870
 what is the fool's value to society for 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 American countries there and then here 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.420
 PhD and year and here they are together 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.940
 playing the lottery and the odds of winning 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.820
 they are the same and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.850
 and this is what democracy is such a question 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.450
 this is democracy is the most real 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.720
 democracy because the green card lottery 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.720
 not 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.550
 tied to how and more to education 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.410
 what is his profession as far as he is 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.310
 need a country there economically and so 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.530
 further m this you ray meaning which up 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.500
 versions fix the population that is 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.320
 the only thing that matters is where 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.840
 man was born the country in which he 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.450
 born of course there is a lower limit 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.790
 that he should have at least an average 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.170
 education yes, here's all well 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.270
 if he is a doctorate 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.550
 so what is there for example immigration 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.680
 on a work visa and can get there 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.600
 work visa is immigration 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.850
 Specially green card immediately give if you 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.619
 so -called extraordinary 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.360
 commitments yes i mean you are some there 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.670
 talented as it is to very many scientists 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.440
 I I know people I remember the poet Yevtushenko 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.229
 got a green card it was for a couple 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.479
 weeks he gave you told me this 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.179
 the story I myself did not communicate with him but 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.610
 someone told me that in the early 90s 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.650
 Yevtushenko for two weeks got green 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.540
 card I do not know took advantage of her or or 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.380
 that will help and may never appeal 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.269
 but that was such a story so this 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.390
 scientists are athletes then there are people 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:29.200
 who merit to them perfectly 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.689
 other roads so if a person with 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.250
 doctoral degree participates in a lottery 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:38.319
 which is the only thing that matters 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.930
 this is what he was born there i don't know 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:46.459
 vazir badge not either there in Russia or I do not 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.819
 I know where you are in Germany, then protection 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.620
 there is democracy is how we on concepts 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.590
 there they somehow agreed but this one more 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.549
 important but would divide people into useful 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.980
 and useless 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.049
 here it would not be democracy it was 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.629
 It would be very bad, that is, as if all people 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.939
 equal here we were born we are all equal from 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.720
 birth and nothing to either of us 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:10.639
 not allowed except we're in 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.769
 able to earn and how would 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:16.549
 get it by your own work 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.159
 and there is democracy why not the answer I am 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.049
 so I understand that is, if it were 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:26.359
 otherwise I would be surprised I will give you 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:28.969
 example for when was in paris there we 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.609
 went on several excursions with local 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:33.960
 Russian guides daughter he was born in 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.190
 paris he is apparently somehow 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.440
 from such a generation of Russians 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.200
 revolutionary time emigrants are not there 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.180
 after the war 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.609
 ionic 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.849
 tells us here I can smell you there 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.909
 some story there tomorrow and we all 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.870
 students are tired there they say no strength and he 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:57.859
 because you think because there is 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:01.189
 How many hours does it mean to show 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.260
 there is a special license and you can not 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.810
 whether to get this shadow without 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.680
 born in france can be born 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.659
 in france a french citizen and if 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.609
 it is not then you can not get 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.220
 licensed to drive tourists here in 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:22.430
 this very castle 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:25.099
 i i think god here's a symbol 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.650
 democracy this country is a symbol of democracy 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:30.740
 this country is open 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.599
 discriminates people and it's not like that 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.220
 In the USA from the USA there is such a position then 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.530
 here is us president you should have been born 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.410
 in the united states but no more miss and president 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.020
 you can already be already people will give these 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.789
 Clit guests were born there 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.610
 somewhere else but to drive tourists to take 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.039
 he was to be born in France 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.510
 so and if you talk to them and 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.310
 there they think they are there 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.600
 democracy what is American 3 not 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:03.930
 dreamed but well, so I understand how 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.479
 Oh well, I think that we are so subject 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.770
 more or less illuminated just need 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:14.430
 think about the green card in the game 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.380
 has a definite purpose and how much 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.669
 we learn there from everyone 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.650
 correspondence forms of history there and so on 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.919
 there is a story on the forum when a guy 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.190
 talked to a man who seemed to be 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:33.419
 founded this lottery as if the creators and 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.650
 he explained well and according to this story 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.169
 private conversation 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.039
 that the idea was to transport in 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:43.259
 americans more africans something not 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.250
 enough Africans around the island 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.800
 politically correct 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.570
 and you can not discriminate like that right 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.000
 discriminates then they said well 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.940
 well how much is it from africa how much is it 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.900
 from asia how much is there today 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.819
 then it will be like that as well as once 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.340
 but this is usually a normal element. 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:05.159
 American politics here is how sometime 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.440
 for example there in Soviet times there 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.590
 they should have said it from the Soviet Union 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.810
 there to bring the Jews there who want 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.280
 go away a year but we should say but 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.710
 even just let's time when 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.139
 Pentecostal Baptists there yet 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.599
 some categories there for different there 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:27.539
 reasons for a sign and then it turned out 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:30.900
 here is such a law there on this subject is like 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:33.389
 would just be such a way such a way 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.070
 do things on purpose to not offend 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.560
 specifically not to discriminate 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.949
 specifically not to give privileges to that 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.409
 group or this group 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.599
 so it is the lottery was created in the place 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:48.270
 birth was not meant from Africa 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:50.610
 pick up doctors of science or medical 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.259
 doctors or engineers there and so on 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.070
 it's enough just to be born there 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.070
 is happy
