00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.280
 I took gmt is an Israeli footballer who 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.080
 has been playing in Spain since 2011 and that already adds up 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.840
 more than 100 games played in the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.090
 best league in the world like so many children 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.740
 jémez emerged from neighborhood football and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.420
 13 years old, a large team from his country 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.420
 the maccabi haifa signed him 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.350
 in the Hebrew country soccer is still 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.239
 an emerging sport living with the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.079
 basketball a very popular discipline 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.079
 for many years 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:53.680
 people like soccer a lot and I 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.329
 I think it's the first sport for all 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.719
 the people the truth that 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.479
 as a sixth is worth we have no more 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:08.649
 titles like maccabi tel aviv that 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.310
 everyone knows but people nest the max 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.009
 football 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.840
 and how many good teams and have they done 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.340
 as well 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.340
 they played in champions 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.100
 but 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.640
 we just need to do something with our 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.640
 selection 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.140
 submerge goal landed in the bbva league in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.670
 June 2011 to sign for the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.930
 mallorca and after playing 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.930
 four years in the maccabi haifa 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.690
 a few seasons in the soccer elite 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.400
 Israeli who was used to acquire 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.170
 enough experience to be able 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.780
 face this adventure in the demanding 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.430
 Spanish league that goals and had met 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.020
 your child's dream 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.020
 moving inside the auction 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:09.100
 and so all the level players 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.300
 The dream is to play in the league as in Spain 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.850
 or england 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.730
 each player and kailey 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.850
 have the opportunity to play in the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.190
 line of spain for me first in the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.650
 last three years in power this dream 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.069
 in the front of my face 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.200
 my eyes have been three years with much 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:38.439
 personal work to be prepared and 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.439
 in the end 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.650
 as I say to Spain in the last year 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.930
 we have done good seasons with brands 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.930
 of ipad with champions 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.680
 striker scored penalty its 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.719
 first goals in the league bbva in the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.210
 and the fourth round tie two of 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.010
 Majorca in Pamplona 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.340
 that first season of the Israeli 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.200
 would score eight goals and in the second eleven 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.879
 that recognizes me that it cost me to adapt 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.879
 the demanding style of Spanish football 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.640
 when I get more 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.880
 I thought there are many differences the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.230
 rhythm is something different from the first 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.319
 months in training 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.280
 for me 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.909
 very difficult the quality of the players 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:47.450
 with the ball I have seen that I have to follow 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.450
 to work much much more than in Israel 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.340
 after three years in mallorca and a decline 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.950
 of category would reach the call of the 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.390
 almería that I was looking at last summer 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.520
 by the Andalusian club with the idea of 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.020
 return to its best level and 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.510
 thus become a benchmark 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.950
 Atletico attack the Real and knows what 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.930
 complicated that is for any team 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.700
 stay in first division and 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.970
 recognizes that work is the key to 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.970
 success 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:29.539
 first we plan to continue first 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:33.139
 division we do not think other things clear 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:36.819
 that we make good matches at the beginning 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:40.430
 of the season but we also do not think 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:43.580
 too far we just think every 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.180
 party that we have to do 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.110
 we work very hard every day 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.100
 we are a team with players that do not 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.180
 we know that the first one we have to 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.930
 work and fight and in the end when I 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.340
 we make the results also come 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.340
 good for us 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.389
 tomer gmt is a strong powerful attacker 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:13.849
 worker and with a lot of character 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.279
 the forward dominates the passing game and is 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.549
 a good auctioneer though his 9 of 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:20.869
 reference is also very mobile 

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:22.639
 other of its characteristics are the 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:24.349
 quality intelligence for the 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.599
 uncheck and sacrifice in the labors 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.429
 defensive goals that goal has always had 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.149
 as a great reference to the Brazilian 

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:31.149
 ronaldo nazario 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.910
 for me 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.570
 ronaldo the Brazilian 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.570
 well 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.870
 his years in Barcelona I do not know how many 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.870
 years 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.740
 but for me he is the best striker in 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.740
 all the 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.479
 of my life and I have seen 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.479
 for me this 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.670
 great in the absence of joy the 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.740
 poor crowns the auction of chilean time m 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.480
 with 27 years and in full maturity 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.100
 soccer tomer gmt is 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.470
 starring a great season in the 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.420
 almeria 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.400
 the Israeli striker hopes to continue 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.200
 scoring hopes to continue enjoying the 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.000
 best league in the world and of course 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 hopes to help the Andalusians 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.200
 stay in the bbva league
