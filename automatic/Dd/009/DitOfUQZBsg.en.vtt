I suppose you could go one E and a two E
and<00:00:45.059> E<00:00:46.190> I've<00:00:47.190> always<00:00:47.640> found<00:00:47.969> those<00:00:48.270> ways<00:00:48.539> four

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and E I've always found those ways four

and E I've always found those ways four
fives<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.350> bit<00:00:49.530> too<00:00:52.219> boring<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.640> came<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:54.030> with

around<00:01:46.829> hippopotamus<00:01:47.640> hippopotamus<00:01:48.950> head

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
around hippopotamus hippopotamus head

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.380 
around hippopotamus hippopotamus head
around<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.850> we're<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.299> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
around that what we're going to do to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.749 
around that what we're going to do to
make<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.570> easier<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.399> we're<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> combine

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
make it easier is we're going to combine

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.940 
make it easier is we're going to combine
a<00:01:53.939> group<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> five<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> group<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.649> three

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
a group of five with a group of three

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340 
a group of five with a group of three
now<00:01:56.520> five<00:01:56.820> plus<00:01:57.060> three<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.689> right<00:01:57.930> equals

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
now five plus three that's right equals

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.929 
now five plus three that's right equals
8<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.939> i<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.240> grouping<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> five<00:02:01.939> followed

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
8 so if i do a grouping of five followed

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.410 
8 so if i do a grouping of five followed
by<00:02:03.060> grouping<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:04.490> 35<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> hands

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
by grouping of 35 is for in the hands

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.270 
by grouping of 35 is for in the hands
then<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.780> bass<00:02:06.960> drum<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.560> three<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.920> two<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.129> the

one the ender to e r3 and r4 and okay
the<00:02:28.019> challenge<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.950> last<00:02:29.159> note<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> bass

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the challenge is the last note is a bass

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.610 
the challenge is the last note is a bass
drum<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.390> generally<00:02:30.989> when<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.200> go<00:02:31.319> back<00:02:31.500> into

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
drum and generally when we go back into

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.410 
drum and generally when we go back into
a<00:02:31.709> beat<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.250> usually<00:02:32.459> have<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.730> usually<00:02:33.299> have<00:02:33.390> a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
a beat we usually have a usually have a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.789 
a beat we usually have a usually have a
bass<00:02:33.629> drum<00:02:33.659> on<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.019> first<00:02:34.230> count<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.590> bar

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
bass drum on the first count of the bar

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.580 
bass drum on the first count of the bar
not<00:02:35.250> always<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:35.849> usually<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.379> have<00:02:37.470> to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
not always but usually so we have to

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.910 
not always but usually so we have to
learn<00:02:37.709> how<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:38.329> double<00:02:39.329> up<00:02:39.390> with<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.599> foot<00:02:39.920> so

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
learn how to double up with the foot so

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:51.530 
learn how to double up with the foot so
we<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> with<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.849> beat<00:02:51.359> would

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
we have so that with a with a beat would

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:20.449 
we have so that with a with a beat would
sound<00:02:51.810> something<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:52.379> this<00:03:17.870> now<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.930> me<00:03:19.459> 53

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
sound something like this now to me 53

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.099 
sound something like this now to me 53
53<00:03:21.090> because<00:03:21.329> that's<00:03:21.480> what<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.690> grouping<00:03:22.019> is

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
53 because that's what the grouping is

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.210 
53 because that's what the grouping is
now<00:03:22.260> now<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.470> want<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.769> think<00:03:22.889> that<00:03:23.069> way

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
now now I want you to think that way

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.589 
now now I want you to think that way
5353<00:03:27.919> because<00:03:28.919> it's<00:03:29.069> very<00:03:29.220> much<00:03:29.459> skating<00:03:29.910> each

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
5353 because it's very much skating each

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.050 
5353 because it's very much skating each
pulse<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.260> bar<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:35.489> really<00:03:35.760> feel<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
pulse of the bar you really feel the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.069 
pulse of the bar you really feel the
pulse<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:37.019> change<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.970> combination<00:03:39.079> but

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
pulse if we change that combination but

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.890 
pulse if we change that combination but
still<00:03:40.290> do<00:03:40.349> 16<00:03:40.769> 16<00:03:41.430> notes<00:03:41.699> using<00:03:42.030> fives<00:03:42.690> and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
still do 16 16 notes using fives and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.199 
still do 16 16 notes using fives and
threes<00:03:43.169> it<00:03:43.440> sounds<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.280> lot<00:03:44.400> more<00:03:44.459> syncopated

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
threes it sounds a lot more syncopated

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.119 
threes it sounds a lot more syncopated
not<00:03:45.720> necessarily<00:03:46.260> better<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.709> just<00:03:46.769> sounds

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
not necessarily better it just sounds

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.550 
not necessarily better it just sounds
more<00:03:47.280> syncopated<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.840> got<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.230> save<00:03:49.410> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
more syncopated so I got to save the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.939 
more syncopated so I got to save the
grouping<00:03:49.889> is<00:03:50.010> 55<00:03:51.349> 334<00:03:52.349> on<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.530> hands<00:03:52.739> bass

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
grouping is 55 334 on the hands bass

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.650 
grouping is 55 334 on the hands bass
drum<00:03:53.250> for<00:03:53.459> on<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.669> hands<00:03:53.910> bass<00:03:54.090> drum<00:03:54.359> tool<00:03:54.599> in

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
drum for on the hands bass drum tool in

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.970 
drum for on the hands bass drum tool in
the<00:03:54.750> hands<00:03:54.900> bass<00:03:55.139> drum<00:03:55.440> tool<00:03:55.650> in<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.799> hands

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
the hands bass drum tool in the hands

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.680 
the hands bass drum tool in the hands
bass<00:03:56.220> drum<00:03:56.489> into<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.849> beat<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.449> would<00:03:57.540> have

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
bass drum into the beat you would have

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
bass drum into the beat you would have
this<00:04:08.060> what<00:04:09.060> if<00:04:09.180> we<00:04:09.299> go<00:04:09.530> 3553

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.100 

goes<00:04:20.710> up<00:04:20.860> 3553<00:04:21.550> or<00:04:21.850> 3355<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.780> think<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:22.990> was

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
goes up 3553 or 3355 I think that was

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.690 
goes up 3553 or 3355 I think that was
3355<00:04:23.920> there<00:04:24.610> you<00:04:24.670> go<00:04:24.820> there's<00:04:25.660> 3355<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:26.800> say<00:04:27.550> we

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
3355 there you go there's 3355 I say we

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:41.100 
3355 there you go there's 3355 I say we
go<00:04:28.230> 5335<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:39.570> obviously<00:04:40.570> we<00:04:40.750> can<00:04:40.900> orchestrate

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
go 5335 and obviously we can orchestrate

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.290 
go 5335 and obviously we can orchestrate
this<00:04:41.620> pattern<00:04:42.070> differently<00:04:42.610> on<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.820> drum<00:04:43.030> kit

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
this pattern differently on the drum kit

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.450 
this pattern differently on the drum kit
for<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:43.930> five<00:04:44.200> it's<00:04:44.470> fun<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.800> go<00:04:44.920> to<00:04:44.980> on<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
for the five it's fun to go to on the

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.430 
for the five it's fun to go to on the
snares<00:04:45.760> floor<00:04:46.300> tom<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:46.840> one<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.140> your<00:04:47.230> toms

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
snares floor tom and one of your toms

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.230 
snares floor tom and one of your toms
here<00:04:47.710> whether<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:48.280> be<00:04:48.370> second<00:04:48.700> or<00:04:48.760> first<00:04:48.940> time

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
here whether it be second or first time

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.800 
here whether it be second or first time
whatever<00:04:49.630> is<00:04:49.690> comfortable<00:04:53.880> if<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:55.030> do<00:04:55.090> my<00:04:55.450> three

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
whatever is comfortable if I do my three

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.300 
whatever is comfortable if I do my three
with<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.310> snare<00:04:57.310> drum<00:04:57.490> on<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.610> high<00:04:57.790> hat<00:04:59.310> that

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
with the snare drum on the high hat that

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:16.830 
with the snare drum on the high hat that
would<00:05:00.490> then<00:05:00.610> become<00:05:00.760> this<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:15.600> think<00:05:16.600> you<00:05:16.690> get

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
would then become this I think you get

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.080 
would then become this I think you get
the<00:05:16.870> idea<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:17.740> practice<00:05:18.220> with<00:05:18.550> your<00:05:18.670> fives<00:05:18.850> and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
the idea so practice with your fives and

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.670 
the idea so practice with your fives and
threes<00:05:19.300> check<00:05:19.690> out<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:20.050> five<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:20.500> three

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
threes check out the five and three

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.620 
threes check out the five and three
combinations<00:05:21.040> in<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.880> linear<00:05:22.030> fills<00:05:22.360> in<00:05:22.510> this

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
combinations in the linear fills in this

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.780 
combinations in the linear fills in this
video<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.140> you'll<00:05:23.650> get<00:05:23.800> even<00:05:24.010> more<00:05:24.130> ideas<00:05:24.550> and

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
video and you'll get even more ideas and

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.890 
video and you'll get even more ideas and
enjoy<00:05:25.300> your<00:05:25.420> practices<00:05:25.930> as<00:05:26.080> always<00:05:26.410> thank<00:05:26.860> you
