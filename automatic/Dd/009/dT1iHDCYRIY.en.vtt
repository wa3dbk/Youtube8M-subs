 up to 70 meters high 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.880
 in nature if someone knows about 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.860
 colors is the chameleon the chameleons 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.510
 they change the color of their skin adapting 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.850
 to the environment where they are 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.850
 this does not mean that they can copy 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.560
 any color or texture each of 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.930
 they according to their species has the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.180
 ability to blend in with the environment 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.460
 where they live or change color 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.010
 as reaction or internal factors as 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.410
 fear or irritation or factors 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.440
 as external moisture and changes 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.630
 of temperature on your skin there are four 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.120
 layers each of them is sensitive to 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.040
 different colors and the mixture of them 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.900
 is what allows to deploy the great 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.900
 quantity of tones and textures 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.420
 the great prismatic fountain is 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.299
 in the yellowstone national park is the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.819
 largest source of hot springs in the USA and 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.620
 the third largest in the world the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.239
 bright colors in the prismatic fountain 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.120
 they are the result of bacteria 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.519
 pigmented in the biofilms that 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.439
 grow around the edges the 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.560
 bacteria produce colors that range from 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.930
 the green to red in the summer the edges 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.359
 they tend to be orange and red 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.540
 while in the winter the rugs 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:00.700
 They are usually dark green 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.680
 the blue color that completes the range comes 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.879
 of the high purity and depth of the water 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.879
 in the middle of the fountain 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.960
 without a doubt it is quite a show 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.060
 the rainbow owl differs from others 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.459
 owls for their peculiar feathers 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.040
 multicolored unfortunately 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.829
 is in danger of extinction 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.859
 well nothing is not true this image as 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.180
 the story of the rainbow owl is false and 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.329
 it has spread through social networks 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.819
 as something true but all this is 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.310
 a lie and here we have the photograph 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.799
 original where we see that it is a kind 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.220
 owl that was retouched with 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.170
 photoshop to give multicolored pens 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.040
 Now that you know the truth, you can 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.040
 die quiet 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.280

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.310
 past video that have very little 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.800
 visits and that the truth is incredible and 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.570
 is a very important issue more than 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.249
 interesting is important is about the 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:38.599
 human zoos and about the tragedy 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:41.159
 Well, life that the aborigines had 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.619
 South Americans and that terrible experience 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.419

 the link so that they go visit it 

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:57.479
 what they share is something of the history that 

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:59.399
 we should all know and that therefore 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.549
