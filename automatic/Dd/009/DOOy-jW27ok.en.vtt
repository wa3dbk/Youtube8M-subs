00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
 It's a bar! 

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.440
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.060

 Park is an international student from Korea who is in charge of editing the buyer channel. 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.900
 By the way, there is something prepared ... ?? 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.440
 I brought gifts 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.800
 If you roast chicken! 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.480
 It's not funny from the shell. 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.400
 I do not know what you're saying, but it shows up. 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.480
 Oh oh ! The contents are usually ramen. 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.740
 It's just a ramen? 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.940
 The sauce is something thick and dangerous. 

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:45.963
 The noodles look delicious on the thick side! 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.700
 Let's make it! 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.214
 So you do not have soup? 

00:00:56.214 --> 00:00:57.174

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.360
 This soup is all gone! 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.420
 Can I put two kinds of soup now? 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.160
 Yeah 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.600
 It smells good. I do not smell stinging ~ 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.100
 Is not it just delicious? 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.593

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.500

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.000
 I am working a lot. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.360

 There is a woman who does not even eat spicy, 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.120
 There is someone who lays a pancake with mustard sauce in a pancake and does not eat at all! 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.440
