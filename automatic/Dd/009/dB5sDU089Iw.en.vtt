that much dispersion what I see about
this<00:04:07.430> is<00:04:07.700> in<00:04:07.910> fact<00:04:07.970> in<00:04:08.480> time<00:04:08.690> my<00:04:09.260> capacitor

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
this is in fact in time my capacitor

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.159 
this is in fact in time my capacitor
tone<00:04:09.799> when<00:04:10.010> is<00:04:10.329> dispersion<00:04:11.329> ends<00:04:11.660> I<00:04:11.780> can<00:04:11.959> time

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
tone when is dispersion ends I can time

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.290 
tone when is dispersion ends I can time
it<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.590> get<00:04:12.980> killed<00:04:13.220> but<00:04:13.459> i<00:04:13.639> think<00:04:13.940> i<00:04:14.120> missed

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
it and get killed but i think i missed

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.440 
it and get killed but i think i missed
but<00:04:15.930> as<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.070> can<00:04:17.220> see<00:04:17.430> ah<00:04:19.549> i'm<00:04:20.549> about<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.090> flee

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.850 
to do damage and wait for a dispersion
i'm<00:06:04.060> like<00:06:04.180> okay<00:06:04.509> i<00:06:04.690> can<00:06:05.139> still<00:06:05.410> deal<00:06:05.560> with<00:06:05.620> it

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
i'm like okay i can still deal with it

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.010 
i'm like okay i can still deal with it
way<00:06:06.610> someone<00:06:06.970> might<00:06:07.120> cool<00:06:07.270> down<00:06:07.479> but<00:06:07.690> i<00:06:07.750> should

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
way someone might cool down but i should

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.680 
way someone might cool down but i should
be<00:06:08.110> fine<00:06:09.000> so<00:06:10.000> I<00:06:10.060> freeze<00:06:10.300> them<00:06:10.449> out<00:06:10.569> of

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
be fine so I freeze them out of

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.640 
be fine so I freeze them out of
dispersion<00:06:11.050> and<00:06:11.620> then<00:06:12.550> storm<00:06:13.479> travel<00:06:14.169> ash<00:06:14.319> I'm

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
dispersion and then storm travel ash I'm

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.570 
dispersion and then storm travel ash I'm
an<00:06:14.919> elemental<00:06:15.490> blast<00:06:15.729> a<00:06:16.150> second<00:06:17.050> and<00:06:17.370> it<00:06:18.370> done

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
an elemental blast a second and it done

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.430 
an elemental blast a second and it done
I<00:06:18.820> guess<00:06:19.270> what<00:06:19.389> I'm<00:06:19.479> trying<00:06:19.509> to<00:06:19.690> say<00:06:19.780> guys<00:06:20.080> is

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
I guess what I'm trying to say guys is

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.779 
I guess what I'm trying to say guys is
enhanced<00:06:21.039> with<00:06:21.099> right<00:06:21.310> now<00:06:21.340> is<00:06:21.580> in<00:06:21.699> a<00:06:21.759> very

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
enhanced with right now is in a very

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.760 
enhanced with right now is in a very
good<00:06:22.090> place<00:06:22.270> and<00:06:22.570> I<00:06:22.720> foresee<00:06:23.139> it<00:06:23.320> staying<00:06:23.620> in

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
good place and I foresee it staying in

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.520 
good place and I foresee it staying in
the<00:06:23.889> same<00:06:24.009> place<00:06:24.070> because<00:06:24.780> a<00:06:25.780> lot<00:06:26.380> of<00:06:26.410> people

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
the same place because a lot of people

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.650 
the same place because a lot of people
don't<00:06:26.830> play<00:06:27.160> enhance<00:06:27.490> and<00:06:27.789> don't<00:06:28.360> know<00:06:28.509> the

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
don't play enhance and don't know the

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.659 
don't play enhance and don't know the
potential<00:06:28.930> of<00:06:29.199> it<00:06:29.380> because<00:06:30.039> of<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.280> bad<00:06:30.460> rep

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
potential of it because of the bad rep

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.589 
potential of it because of the bad rep
it<00:06:30.820> has<00:06:30.970> so<00:06:32.340> it's<00:06:33.340> again<00:06:33.699> I<00:06:33.759> don't<00:06:33.970> think<00:06:34.419> it's

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
it has so it's again I don't think it's

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.540 
it has so it's again I don't think it's
going<00:06:34.720> to<00:06:34.810> get<00:06:34.960> nerfed<00:06:35.229> or<00:06:35.710> the<00:06:35.800> damage<00:06:36.220> just

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
going to get nerfed or the damage just

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.370 
going to get nerfed or the damage just
because<00:06:36.789> there's<00:06:37.000> so<00:06:37.240> few<00:06:37.599> little<00:06:38.080> people

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
because there's so few little people

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.020 
because there's so few little people
playing<00:06:38.650> and<00:06:38.830> in<00:06:38.979> the<00:06:39.130> beta<00:06:39.370> and<00:06:39.639> there's<00:06:39.849> less
