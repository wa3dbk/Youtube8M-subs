 molina and the truth is that you can not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.070
 wait for the new xbox one to come out 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.230
 this new generation of entertainment 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.180
 she told me super excited and very shocked 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 especially for the new improvements that goes 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.660
 to bring kinect that between things is going to 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.210
 be able to read your movements in a way 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 much more accurate and fast so that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.560
 walls and we review some of the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.380
 innovations that we presented this 21 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.570
 May 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.579
 with the movement of your hands you can 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.250
 have immediate access to any 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.260
 section of the interface of your console if 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.269
 you are watching a movie you can 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.129
 change to see something on TV by 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.469
 example if you want to see the marker of 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.329
 your favorite team's game or if 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.519
 you want to make a Skype call 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.060
 you can do it very easily and 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.340
 quick just to say it 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.440
 Xbox one revolutionize the way 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.780
 we enjoyed our entertainment in 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.600
 the one we play and we communicate the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.300
 console is completely interactive and 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.730
 will adapt more to you by showing you everything 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.290
 that you like the accuracy of the sensor going 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.540
 beyond just detecting your 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.820
 movements can also detect the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.320
 beats of your heart and the attention of 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.660
 your muscles in case you find yourself 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.610
 exercising a new 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.320
 feature of kinect is that you 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.200
 will detect through the infrared sensor 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.600
 which will allow me to recognize you still in 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.640
 rooms with low light 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.190
 another very nice improvement is that kinect for 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.650
 able to recognize up to 5 people in the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.540
 same room so you can have fun 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.490
 hours with your whole family 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.350
 The truth is that the new technology of 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.780
 Kinect sensor is really impressive 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.120
 and large included with all consoles 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.310
 of xbox are but what excites me the most 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.290
 is that this is just the beginning because 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.750
