00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.420
 Today we make an origami Christmas tree. 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.170
 This is a quick way to decorate a classroom or room. 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.590
 For the Christmas tree will need a square of paper. 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.450
 We fold it in half. 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.160
 We expand the sheet and once again fold in half. 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.680
 We unfold, turn the sheet and fold it diagonally. 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.960
 Deployed and once again fold diagonally. 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.100
 We open the paper and the paper is going to form a double square. 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.860
 Bend each side to the center line. 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.340
 Let's work out the crease, tear off the pocket and push it. 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.719
 Put the pocket aside. 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.839
 This side we approach to the center line. 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.930
 Open the paper, pushing to the middle 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.140
 and turned away. 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.880
 We turn the workpiece over and do the same actions again. 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.340
 The result is such a blank. 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.980
 Cut the paper here along this line. 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.300
 Now the tree will stand.
