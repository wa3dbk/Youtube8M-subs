00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.600
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.809
 welcome to 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.340
 this new tutorial which I'm going to 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.550
 teach them how to create a website 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:21.960
 connected to a php database miami 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 The first thing to do is open 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.600
 and we go to option 15 site we give 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.600
 click on new site 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.920
 you can not leave the name you want 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.550
 designate the site in this case I will 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.550
 put the option 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.140
 it is simple 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.630
 now the address 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.630
 which I want for my website 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.620
 site 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.220
 crazy 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.220
 gas 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.180
 this we give next 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.080
 here you go 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.330
 to put option 2 because you want 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.730
 use a server technology but 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.870
 you will not be able to make your connection and it will be 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.750
 the php mysql we give you next 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.980
 let's put the first option to edit and 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.330
 buy locally 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.330
 and we are going to examine 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.800
 this is very important when you 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.590
 have installed on localhost 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.619
 the app server folder should 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.189
 should look for the jolla this law 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:01.210
 here to profess they open me up and they go to the 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:06.179
 www folder here will create a new 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.179
 folder here in the www folder 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.569
 and they will put a place 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.439
 open it 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.900
 and select him 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.900
 and they use 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.180
 now to use the out of it 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.780
 folder the name of the folder they put it 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.780
 here too 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:48.680
 I buy and get the proof of the prestige of 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.680
 out of the correct acid the next 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.340
 here we are going to use 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.550
 here they will put no 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.370
 when you finish editing a file 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.390
 the next and here is summarized as 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.390
 you have a place 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.870
 complete 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.300
 so 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.080
 first now to start using it 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.920
 go new file 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.170
 dynamic page 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.459
 php 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.370
 we go to the part where it says application 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.610
 this database and the three 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.610
 Applications 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.269
 the first three points must come out 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.269
 with a seen no 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.060
 then to know that you already 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.210
 they have their connection they put in the clip 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.970
 where I made a bad connection to mysql 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.569
 and here the name of the case connection 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.530
 is going to put 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.530
 the connection 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.530
 do 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:13.000
 the name of the server will always be 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.000
 localhost localhost local 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.359
 because a local user server 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.840
 they can put anybody can put him 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.760
 rice 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.900
 and the password also the one that you 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.990
 want 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.720
 the database that we have already created 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.370
 this is very important because before 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.050
 make the connection you must have a 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:38.680
 database tables already created in the 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.250
 local hot like right now I have a the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.699
 believe 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.850
 it's called test and I created a table 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:50.740
 client call just so you press 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:54.000
 the connection then we go back 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.000
 and you put the name 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.889
 to accept 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.900
 and ready 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.770
 here as you can see we have our 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.770
 connection with 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.389
 with the ph mining database 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.840
 so 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.850
 and here are the tables that you 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.340
 they have power in the tables the 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.680
 presidents mentioned and the solution 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.500
 good view that 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.310
 that has been all we see ourselves in a 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.310
 next occasion 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.659
 given then to the gods
