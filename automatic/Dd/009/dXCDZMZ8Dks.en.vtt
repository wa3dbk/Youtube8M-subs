this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> way<00:00:28.680> they<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
this is it so the way they have a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.370 
this is it so the way they have a
picture<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.179> screwed<00:00:30.960> into<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
picture is they have it screwed into the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.760 
picture is they have it screwed into the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
bottom screw holes on the plate well

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069 
bottom screw holes on the plate well
they<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.070> don't<00:00:35.399> quite<00:00:35.550> line<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.079> accurately

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
they just don't quite line up accurately

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.020 
they just don't quite line up accurately
to<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.860> doing<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> plate<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:40.170> used<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
to be doing that on a plate so I used a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.720 
to be doing that on a plate so I used a
spacer<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.989> got<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> little<00:00:43.890> piece<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.219> plastic<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
spacer I got a little piece of plastic I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.369 
spacer I got a little piece of plastic I
tried<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> use<00:00:45.180> some<00:00:45.360> metal<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.079> wasn't

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
tried to use some metal but just wasn't

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.040 
tried to use some metal but just wasn't
having<00:00:46.500> too<00:00:46.680> much<00:00:46.800> fun<00:00:46.860> drilling<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:49.020> I

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
having too much fun drilling it so I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.000 
having too much fun drilling it so I
found<00:00:49.440> some<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.739> couple<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.480> plastic<00:00:51.480> pieces<00:00:52.010> so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
found some a couple of plastic pieces so

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.590 
found some a couple of plastic pieces so
I<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.489> lower<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.510> was

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
I can kind of lower it I think it was

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.970 
I can kind of lower it I think it was
about<00:00:55.579> almost<00:00:56.579> 3/4<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.180> an<00:00:57.390> inch<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.710> will

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
about almost 3/4 of an inch so that will

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.000 
about almost 3/4 of an inch so that will
be<00:00:59.070> lined<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.300> will<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.890> hold<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
be lined up and it will be hold on a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.510 
be lined up and it will be hold on a
second

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
second

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.539 
second
okay<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> I'll<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.769> sitting<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.339> about

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
okay so I'll be sitting there at about

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.660 
okay so I'll be sitting there at about
at<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.880> angle<00:01:06.650> this<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.710> my<00:01:07.920> old<00:01:08.100> plate<00:01:08.369> don't

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
at that angle this is my old plate don't

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
at that angle this is my old plate don't
use<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> anymore<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:12.479> went<00:01:12.990> ahead<00:01:13.110> and

light<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.000> brake<00:01:39.570> light<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.140> actually

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
light and brake light is actually

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.749 
light and brake light is actually
clamping<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.829> got<00:01:44.640> my

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
clamping in right there so got my

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.249 
clamping in right there so got my
voltmeter<00:01:45.000> figure<00:01:45.689> out<00:01:45.780> which<00:01:45.899> wire<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.140> which

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
voltmeter figure out which wire is which

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.249 
voltmeter figure out which wire is which
and<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.490> reading<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:49.049> black

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and if I'm reading it right the black

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.830 
and if I'm reading it right the black
wires<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.009> negative<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.939> blue<00:01:51.149> wires<00:01:51.420> for

kits<00:02:13.489> have<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.790> signals<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.330> here<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:14.870> if

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
kits have the signals in here so if

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.290 
kits have the signals in here so if
you've<00:02:15.170> got<00:02:16.160> an<00:02:16.280> aftermarket<00:02:16.670> kit<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.209> you've

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
you've got an aftermarket kit and you've

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.320 
you've got an aftermarket kit and you've
got<00:02:17.450> more<00:02:17.660> wires<00:02:18.170> running<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:19.239> there's<00:02:20.239> these

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
got more wires running in there's these

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.089 
got more wires running in there's these
two<00:02:20.569> wires<00:02:20.780> coming<00:02:21.349> in<00:02:21.440> right<00:02:21.560> here<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.980> one

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
two wires coming in right here the one

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.290 
two wires coming in right here the one
that's<00:02:22.250> got<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.459> connection<00:02:22.910> point<00:02:23.120> right

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
that's got the connection point right

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.720 
that's got the connection point right
here<00:02:23.660> that's<00:02:23.989> your<00:02:24.260> taillight<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:25.489> other

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
here that's your taillight this other

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.589 
here that's your taillight this other
set<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.090> wires

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
set of wires

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.589 
set of wires
those<00:02:27.110> are<00:02:27.260> your<00:02:27.380> signal<00:02:27.739> lights<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:29.330> if<00:02:29.480> you

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
those are your signal lights so if you

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.540 
those are your signal lights so if you
have<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.750> eliminator<00:02:30.560> kit<00:02:30.920> with<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.340> turn

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
have a eliminator kit with the turn

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.509 
have a eliminator kit with the turn
signal<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.180> here<00:02:32.799> now<00:02:33.799> that's<00:02:34.130> how<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.340> know

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
signal in here now that's how you know

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.600 
signal in here now that's how you know
the<00:02:34.640> difference<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:36.040> now<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.190> got<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.400> all

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
the difference so now that I got it all

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.400 
the difference so now that I got it all
apart<00:02:39.100> I'm<00:02:40.100> actually<00:02:40.370> going<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:41.290> kind<00:02:42.290> of

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
apart I'm actually going to kind of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.250 
apart I'm actually going to kind of
connect<00:02:42.709> into<00:02:42.980> this<00:02:43.130> area<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:44.959> way<00:02:45.080> if<00:02:45.140> I

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
connect into this area so that way if I

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.690 
connect into this area so that way if I
screw<00:02:45.590> up<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.830> could<00:02:45.950> always<00:02:46.069> replace<00:02:46.489> this

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
screw up I could always replace this

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.820 
screw up I could always replace this
part<00:02:46.970> where<00:02:47.269> this<00:02:47.660> one<00:02:47.900> goes<00:02:47.930> way<00:02:48.290> down<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.709> the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
part where this one goes way down in the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.370 
part where this one goes way down in the
body<00:02:49.010> don't<00:02:49.459> want<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.640> mess<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:50.030> so

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
body don't want to mess with that so

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.690 
body don't want to mess with that so
that's<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.590> setup<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.099> let's<00:02:52.430> see<00:02:52.519> how<00:02:52.610> it

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
that's the setup and let's see how it

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.309 
that's the setup and let's see how it
goes<00:02:54.819> okay<00:02:55.819> so<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.209> next<00:02:56.360> step<00:02:56.540> what<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:56.930> did

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
goes okay so the next step what I did

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.789 
goes okay so the next step what I did
was<00:02:57.950> just<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.400> little<00:02:58.790> utility<00:02:59.120> knife<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.870> went

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
was just a little utility knife I went

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.349 
was just a little utility knife I went
ahead<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.069> cut<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:03.080> little<00:03:03.319> bit<00:03:03.470> out<00:03:03.620> I

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
ahead and cut just a little bit out I

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.000 
ahead and cut just a little bit out I
didn't<00:03:05.359> want<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.570> cut<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.959> wires<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.709> splice

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
didn't want to cut the wires and splice

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.099 
didn't want to cut the wires and splice
into<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:07.609> was<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:07.760> trying<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.359> cut<00:03:08.959> and

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
into it so I was just trying to cut and

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.770 
into it so I was just trying to cut and
remove<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.530> insulation<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.269> this<00:03:11.450> wire

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
remove the insulation so that this wire

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.759 
remove the insulation so that this wire
I<00:03:12.140> could<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.560> wrap<00:03:12.709> around<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:14.079> so<00:03:15.079> I'll<00:03:15.620> go

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
I could just wrap around it so I'll go

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.710 
I could just wrap around it so I'll go
ahead<00:03:16.010> try<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.640> continue<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.540> see<00:03:17.630> how

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
ahead try that and continue and see how

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.319 
ahead try that and continue and see how
it<00:03:17.810> works

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
it works

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.030 
it works
