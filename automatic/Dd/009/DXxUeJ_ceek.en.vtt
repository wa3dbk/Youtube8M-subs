00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
so this here is a tunnel Eddie

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.249 
so this here is a tunnel Eddie
and<00:00:03.510> as<00:00:03.899> an<00:00:04.170> Eddie<00:00:04.319> edge<00:00:05.359> machine<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.660> it's

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
and as an Eddie edge machine and it's

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.669 
and as an Eddie edge machine and it's
used<00:00:07.649> basically<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.870> paint<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.990> edges<00:00:10.380> of

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
used basically to paint the edges of

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.419 
used basically to paint the edges of
your<00:00:11.460> belt<00:00:11.700> strap<00:00:12.559> it<00:00:13.559> looks<00:00:14.250> very

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
your belt strap it looks very

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.039 
your belt strap it looks very
complicated<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:15.540> actually<00:00:15.839> quite

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
complicated but it's actually quite

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.700 
complicated but it's actually quite
simple

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
simple

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.529 
simple
you<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.190> your<00:00:17.430> edge<00:00:17.580> paint<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.060> goes<00:00:18.240> in

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
you have your edge paint that goes in

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.870 
you have your edge paint that goes in
the<00:00:19.320> trace<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.760> when<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.000> turn<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.240> on

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
the trace here and when you turn it on

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.790 
the trace here and when you turn it on
you'll<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.210> rollers<00:00:24.660> going<00:00:25.320> round<00:00:25.529> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you'll see the rollers going round and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.370 
you'll see the rollers going round and
round

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
round

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.070 
round
there's<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> speed<00:00:28.890> knob<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:30.090> above<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.539> lets

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
there's a speed knob up above that lets

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.830 
there's a speed knob up above that lets
you<00:00:31.349> regulate<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.340> speed<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.630> slow

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
you regulate the speed I'm going slow

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.560 
you regulate the speed I'm going slow
today<00:00:34.140> because<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.790> first<00:00:36.030> attempt

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
today because this is the first attempt

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.080 
today because this is the first attempt
that<00:00:36.600> I've<00:00:36.840> done<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.290> machine

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
that I've done in this machine

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.700 
that I've done in this machine
basically<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.719> feed<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> leather<00:00:40.440> through

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
basically you feed the leather through

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.380 
basically you feed the leather through
like<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.170> then<00:00:43.170> let<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.590> rest

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
like so and then let it do the rest

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.869 
like so and then let it do the rest
now<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.719> strap<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.500> through<00:00:46.879> it's

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
now as the strap is going through it's

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.260 
now as the strap is going through it's
painting<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> edges<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.840> leather<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:50.270> don't

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
painting the edges of leather I don't

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.709 
painting the edges of leather I don't
know<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.539> did<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> did<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> was

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
know if you did what I did when I was

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.240 
know if you did what I did when I was
earlier<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.780> my<00:00:54.989> days<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.559> field<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.160> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
earlier in my days in this field as I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.000 
earlier in my days in this field as I
use<00:00:56.460> q-tips<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.500> basically<00:01:00.739> went<00:01:01.739> along

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
use q-tips and I basically went along

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.880 
use q-tips and I basically went along
very<00:01:02.309> very<00:01:02.370> slowly<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> strap<00:01:03.710> it<00:01:04.710> took

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
very very slowly on the strap it took

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.550 
very very slowly on the strap it took
forever<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> nice

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
forever so there you go it's a nice

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.649 
forever so there you go it's a nice
clean<00:01:07.920> edge<00:01:08.600> let's<00:01:09.600> put<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> belt<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
clean edge let's put on the belt and

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.969 
clean edge let's put on the belt and
you'll<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> little<00:01:13.049> excess<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you'll see a little excess here at the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.670 
you'll see a little excess here at the
moment<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.369> it'll<00:01:14.760> dry<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.560> it's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
moment but it'll dry up and and it's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.880 
moment but it'll dry up and and it's
good<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> go<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.420> let's<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.710> one

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
good to go so let's see if I can do one

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.450 
good to go so let's see if I can do one
more<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> thinner<00:01:26.790> strap<00:01:27.180> and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
more here so this is a thinner strap and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.679 
more here so this is a thinner strap and
there's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> knob<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.060> other<00:01:30.210> side<00:01:30.509> here

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
there's a knob on the other side here

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
there's a knob on the other side here
you<00:01:30.840> probably<00:01:31.170> can't<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.159> an

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you probably can't see but it's an

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.999 
you probably can't see but it's an
adjuster<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.909> both<00:01:33.090> wheels<00:01:33.799> once<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
adjuster for both wheels once this

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:52.719 
adjuster for both wheels once this
contact<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:36.630> goes<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.430> effortlessly<00:01:40.340> just

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.270 

okay<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:53.659> that's<00:01:53.990> not<00:01:54.140> too<00:01:54.560> bad<00:01:54.799> I<00:01:55.070> actually

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
okay so that's not too bad I actually

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.069 
okay so that's not too bad I actually
missed<00:01:55.729> some<00:01:55.880> spots<00:01:56.090> because<00:01:56.719> I<00:01:56.750> didn't

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
missed some spots because I didn't

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.469 
missed some spots because I didn't
tighten<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:57.530> enough<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.159> I'm<00:01:58.789> gonna<00:01:59.000> feed<00:01:59.360> it

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
tighten it enough so I'm gonna feed it

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.600 
tighten it enough so I'm gonna feed it
through<00:01:59.509> again<00:01:59.890> just<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.009> make<00:02:01.189> sure<00:02:01.219> that<00:02:01.549> I

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
through again just to make sure that I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.240 
through again just to make sure that I
have<00:02:01.820> all<00:02:01.969> areas<00:02:02.420> covered<00:02:08.769> I'm<00:02:09.769> gonna<00:02:09.920> speed

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
have all areas covered I'm gonna speed

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.800 
have all areas covered I'm gonna speed
it<00:02:10.280> up<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.550> bit<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:14.319> voila<00:02:15.910> there<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:16.940> go<00:02:17.150> nice

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
piece of machinery you can't get better
