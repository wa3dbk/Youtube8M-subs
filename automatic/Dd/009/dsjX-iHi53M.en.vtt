00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.080
 hello additional giuseppe agozzino we are 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.270
 here with an unboxing of a 780 card 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.279
 zotac license plate we are assembling zeus 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.119
 1.2 as you can see we also have gloves 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.580
 from killer 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.489
 in the meantime let's open the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.000
 box so as to then insert the card 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.339
 780 present inside it 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.390
 of 0 on 1 point where the box like 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:47.960
 see it's hard we proceed now 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:01:02.180
 at the same time opening the box 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:01:07.610
 as regards boxing in this 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:11.479
 case it is rather rapid then we succeed 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.929
 to show our beautiful ticket 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.710
 inside we also find the drivers 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:21.050
 then disk with the drivers inside 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.490
 of the box there is nothing else than 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.170
 some gods should also arrive 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.450
 cadetti this however is the box 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.340
 reserved for tests and therefore can be 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.110
 quietly missing some 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.450
 part that the retail version instead 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.220
 owns with regards to the 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.289
 we have just a little product 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.810
 unpacked very quickly now 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.819
 we insert it into zeus 1.2 e 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.979
 obviously we will give you a report on 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.590
 very short gallery performance 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.110
 photographic and then just as mentioned 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.720
 let's finish zeus 1.2 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.399
 now therefore all this unboxing 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.720
 extraordinarily rapid now yes 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.640
 however there are doubts such questions 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.470
 I think we are sometimes cops 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.810
