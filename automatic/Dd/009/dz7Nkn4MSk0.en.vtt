00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
don't now the tool ear fits right on

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.229 
don't now the tool ear fits right on
here<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.600> Noah<00:00:58.190> nothing<00:00:59.190> else<00:00:59.340> needed<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.969> I

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.529 
thread it on to the axle hub thread so
that<00:04:24.900> way<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.940> know<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.120> we're<00:04:28.449> actually

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
that way you know that we're actually

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.420 
that way you know that we're actually
going<00:04:28.960> on<00:04:29.229> there<00:04:29.470> nice<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.919> smoothly

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
going on there nice and smoothly

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.260 
going on there nice and smoothly
and<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:31.630> fits<00:04:32.310> seemingly<00:04:33.310> fine<00:04:33.699> I<00:04:33.729> don't<00:04:34.120> think

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
and it fits seemingly fine I don't think

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.749 
and it fits seemingly fine I don't think
I'm<00:04:34.419> fostering<00:04:34.660> anything<00:04:35.470> if<00:04:36.160> I<00:04:36.370> could<00:04:36.550> turn

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
I'm fostering anything if I could turn

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.050 
I'm fostering anything if I could turn
this<00:04:36.910> thing<00:04:36.970> on<00:04:37.300> manually<00:04:37.930> like<00:04:38.110> this<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:39.310> I

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
this thing on manually like this and I

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.460 
this thing on manually like this and I
could<00:04:41.050> see<00:04:41.199> it<00:04:41.289> go<00:04:41.470> in<00:04:45.090> now<00:04:46.090> when<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.780> pedal<00:04:47.260> it

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
could see it go in now when you pedal it

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.740 
could see it go in now when you pedal it
should<00:04:47.860> self<00:04:48.160> tightens<00:04:48.639> so<00:04:48.880> there's<00:04:49.150> no<00:04:49.389> real

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
should self tightens so there's no real

should self tightens so there's no real
need<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.880> add<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.910> lot<00:04:52.180> more<00:04:52.419> torque<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:53.080> you

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
need to add a lot more torque to it you

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.129 
need to add a lot more torque to it you
can<00:04:54.280> just<00:04:54.910> put<00:04:55.120> on<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.300> little<00:04:55.660> bit<00:04:55.780> if<00:04:55.930> you<00:04:55.960> want

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
what you don't really need any sense it

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
just will soft tighten through the pedal

motion<00:05:09.099> right<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:11.680> now<00:05:11.830> we're<00:05:12.010> back<00:05:12.039> to<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
motion right so now we're back to the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.779 
motion right so now we're back to the
little<00:05:12.699> wrench<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.270> we<00:05:13.389> just<00:05:13.889> tighten<00:05:14.889> it<00:05:15.130> my

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
let's see we have a freewheel now it's

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.370 
let's see we have a freewheel now it's
just<00:05:33.880> a<00:05:34.030> matter<00:05:34.150> of<00:05:34.330> putting<00:05:34.600> it<00:05:34.810> back<00:05:35.020> on<00:05:35.080> the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
just a matter of putting it back on the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.220 
just a matter of putting it back on the
bike<00:05:35.590> putting<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.550> spindle<00:05:37.180> very<00:05:38.020> the

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
bike putting the spindle very the
