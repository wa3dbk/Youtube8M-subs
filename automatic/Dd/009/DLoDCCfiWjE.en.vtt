00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:10.565
 Well, we have the first game 

00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:21.175
 To the middle 

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.055
 Remind you, rules, in the neck 

00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:27.805
 The spine and head prevents beatings 

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:30.435
 With the ankle we only hit the body 

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:32.565
 Listen to my guidance well 

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:35.865
 There is no time , 

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:36.865
 They shook hands 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.300
 To the corners 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.080
 Ready? Ready? Show 

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:46.715
 Stop 

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:51.555
 are you good ? Do you want to wash your eyes? 

00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:54.265
 Wash your eyes 

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:55.815
 wait 

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:59.585
 They call the doctor 

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:00.605
 the doctor 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.005
 The conductive match depends on the doctor's decision 

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.320
 Will continue or not 

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:28.785
 The second opponent now 

00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:31.495
 They wash his eyes from the dirt 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.000
 Only metal 

00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:38.715
 As we see men are stronger 

00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:40.945
 The blows were strong 

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.995
 He suggested ending the game with a draw 

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:50.185
 Or continue to win? 

00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:51.655
 We do not know yet 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.780
 Do we continue? 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.100
 Do we continue? 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.760
 Attention 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.520
 Ready? Show 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.260
 Now we see the game continue 

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.205
 Stop 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.920
 A clean win 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.320
 To the middle 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.740
 The winner, they shook hands 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.060
 Yes, I also felt this 

00:05:37.765 --> 00:05:40.725
 Well, I've finished the first game, it was fantastic to think 

00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:43.885
 I thought it was interesting, did you admire it? 

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:50.495
 My friends, before we start the phase, we will announce the schedule
