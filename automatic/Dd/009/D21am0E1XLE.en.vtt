 hello to all the merits to the channel I am 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.740
 patrick and today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.359
 on how to install the content 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.189
 customized in the sims 4 because even 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.960
 you have not asked very much always 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.539
 you have doubts so well I'm going to 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.519
 explain how to install the different 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.690
 types of personalized content both 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.059
 on motorcycles like gates is good then 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.390
 first of all is the program for 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.940
 extract the cip files many me 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.430
 you say it 's problems I use a 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.899
 program that is the program 'the zip already 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.820
 I use it from sims 2 because 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.559
 many times in the files of the sims 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.170
 or solar when extracting them gave problem and 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.120
 I discovered this program that is this one 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.219
 here that has this egg icon with 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.559
 patitas the truth that brings them all without 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.969
 give any kind of problem in the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.490
 description of the videos I will leave the 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.860
 link and it takes you to this page and what 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.869
 jce download is completely free 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.640
 after a while I will ask you to 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.740
 you buy it but you give it 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.510
 late and it will always be free and the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.940
 true that it extracts all kinds of files 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.800
 very well it works exactly like 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.840
 the honor or that the win zip is equal 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.270
 It is worth saying this and I will start with the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.210
 normal package let's say if 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.590
 we download furniture furniture hairstyles 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.720
 footwear not you would be left 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.090
 possibly an icon that would be a sheet 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.560
 blank that I have left is this 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.080
 because I have a program that is the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.660
 simple by the packages of the sims 2 and 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.450
 it automatically stays with me in all 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.450
 packages not but what we would have to 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.210
 do would be cut or copied and we're going to 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.000
 paste in the folder of my documents 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.330
 electronic sims 4 and the folder 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.479
 of mods here we are going to paste here the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.759
 mods folder of the 64 is very well 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.440
 because it allows us to make subfolders and 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.950
 so we can have everything organized already 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.180
 when uninstalling something is easier 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.700
 find it me for example I have made 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.420
 two folders I have very little content 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.310
 personalized but good I have 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.239
 one for clothes and one for hair 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.530
 then it would be easier to find what 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.760
 that we want to uninstall for 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.790
 uninstall custom content 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.010
 we just give it here to remove and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.050
 is already uninstalled from the game there is no 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.270
 nothing else to do then it's fine 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.220
 this subfolders for example in 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.260
 the sims 3 could not be done in the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.790
 unfair if it could be done and here 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.430
 we can do it again which is 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.400
 very well and as far as the package is 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.530
 normal and I think it's all the next 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.330
 kind of personalized content that I'm going 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.300
 to explain are the mods let's say there 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.700
 two types of mods there are some with script and 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.140
 others without it means that this means the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.290
 only difference they have is the way 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.380
 to install some you have to extract from 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.360
 cip and others not as we know if what 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.010
 we have to extract or not because it is very 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.739
 easy we just have to open the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.080
 zip and see if it's a package if it's a 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.990
 package we bring 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.570
 and we will install it just like you 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.360
 I explained previously we cut it and what 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.970
 We take to the folder of my documents 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.100
 electronic sims 4 mods and what 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.140
 we paste and it is already installed good is that 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.820
 I already have it that's the mode of 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.210
 lighting that I already have is not since 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:36.020
 here and the other type would already be installed 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:39.200
 it would be this and we give it to open and we see 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.920
 that is not a package but has this 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.920
 extension of p &amp; p and / or then this type 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.230
 of mods is a mod with scripts and then 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.380
 we have to install it inside the flip 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.990
 that is to say we cut in order such as it is and 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.650
 we go to the folder always and Ã¡lex and 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.300
 we paste it as it is without extracting 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.060
 important when we install this type 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.130
 of bikes that have script we have to 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.340
 entering the game was the configuration 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.290
 we have to activate that tab so that 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.140
 then the game can recognize the 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.670
 many with scripts worth and the last type 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.040
 of personalized content that also 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.070
 many of you have had doubts with him is because 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.440
 example if we download a 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.270
 of personalized content but not from 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.890
 the gallery but from a page of 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.410
 personalized content such as can be 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.370
 of no summary we are here I have 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.490
 downloaded this house I have it here is 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.860
 be here then if we open it we see 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.050
 that is not a package then this guy 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.440
 file is not installed the folder of 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.630
 mods we do not have to extract it from the cip and 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.080
 we have to install it in my 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.450
 electronic documents sims 4 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.410
 3 folder not in the folder of mods 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.230
 here I did not enter and here are all the 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.560
 houses and sims that we have in our 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.000
 game library but like this house 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.920
 We have not downloaded it through the 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.420
 gallery but we have downloaded it from 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.760
 a page we have to install here 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.570
 this folder I see it as a problem and it's 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.880
 that it is almost impossible to know this file 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.960
 here at home or without correspondence of the 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.830
 that I have in my library, maybe not 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.400
 guiding us a little bit by date 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.350
 we could guess it, but it's good 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.009
 here in this folder where you have to 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.199
 paste 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.999
 that personalized content that you have 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.219
 downloaded and well I think it does not fit 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:32.169
 nothing else if something has happened to me leave it 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.639
 in the comments as always and if 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.309
 have any questions or comments what 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.169
 that you want also in the comments and 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:39.909
 I only hope that I have served you 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.069
 you liked kizashi to like 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.409
 you can subscribe to the channel according to what 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.619
 are you and see you at the next until 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.619
 soon 

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:53.709
 do not 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.220
 and me
