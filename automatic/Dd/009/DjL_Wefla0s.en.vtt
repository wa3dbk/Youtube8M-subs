all<00:00:08.360> right<00:00:08.600> I've<00:00:09.230> got<00:00:09.470> a<00:00:09.500> check<00:00:09.920> engine<00:00:10.070> light

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
all right I've got a check engine light

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.330 
all right I've got a check engine light
on<00:00:10.600> when<00:00:11.600> it<00:00:11.690> headed<00:00:11.930> up<00:00:12.200> that<00:00:12.410> line<00:00:12.620> code

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
on when it headed up that line code

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.750 
on when it headed up that line code
reader<00:00:13.610> we<00:00:14.600> pull<00:00:14.780> it<00:00:14.870> up<00:00:14.930> a<00:00:15.020> Pio<00:00:15.230> 302<00:00:15.709> the<00:00:16.550> truck

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
reader we pull it up a Pio 302 the truck

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.150 
reader we pull it up a Pio 302 the truck
runs<00:00:16.970> like<00:00:17.119> complete<00:00:17.510> crap<00:00:19.060> now<00:00:20.890> as<00:00:21.890> far<00:00:22.100> as

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
runs like complete crap now as far as

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.710 
runs like complete crap now as far as
like<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.490> do-it-yourself<00:00:23.150> person<00:00:23.330> they're

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
like the do-it-yourself person they're

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.940 
like the do-it-yourself person they're
just<00:00:23.870> going<00:00:23.990> to<00:00:24.080> plug<00:00:24.230> in<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.500> code<00:00:24.710> reader

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
just going to plug in the code reader

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.070 
just going to plug in the code reader
and<00:00:25.040> they're<00:00:25.130> going<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:25.340> pull<00:00:25.460> up<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:25.640> 302<00:00:26.080> my

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
and they're going to pull up the 302 my

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.779 
and they're going to pull up the 302 my
scan<00:00:27.320> tool<00:00:27.500> is<00:00:27.590> a<00:00:27.620> little<00:00:27.800> bit<00:00:27.890> better<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:28.460> my

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
scan tool is a little bit better so my

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:29.980 
scan tool is a little bit better so my
you<00:00:29.030> might<00:00:29.150> not<00:00:29.300> be<00:00:29.360> able<00:00:29.420> to<00:00:29.510> see<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:29.750> but<00:00:29.900> my

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
you might not be able to see this but my

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.409 
you might not be able to see this but my
scan<00:00:30.260> tool<00:00:30.470> is<00:00:30.619> reading<00:00:31.190> live<00:00:31.640> misfire<00:00:32.180> and

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
scan tool is reading live misfire and

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.410 
scan tool is reading live misfire and
number<00:00:33.140> two<00:00:33.289> is<00:00:33.410> just<00:00:35.320> falling<00:00:36.320> on<00:00:36.440> its<00:00:36.559> face

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
number two is just falling on its face

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.389 
number two is just falling on its face
so<00:00:38.420> here<00:00:38.719> we<00:00:38.809> are<00:00:38.840> Peter<00:00:39.260> 302<00:00:39.739> cylinder<00:00:40.249> number

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
so here we are Peter 302 cylinder number

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.309 
so here we are Peter 302 cylinder number
two<00:00:40.550> misfire<00:00:41.179> and<00:00:41.449> we<00:00:41.899> have<00:00:42.019> the<00:00:42.109> check<00:00:42.289> engine

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:42.319 
two misfire and we have the check engine

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.439 
two misfire and we have the check engine
light<00:00:42.710> on<00:00:42.739> I've<00:00:43.670> already<00:00:43.969> gone<00:00:44.179> ahead<00:00:44.329> and

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
light on I've already gone ahead and

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.809 
light on I've already gone ahead and
removed<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.260> resonator<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:46.309> seen<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:46.640> like

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819 
removed the resonator you seen that like

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:48.309 
removed the resonator you seen that like
three<00:00:47.030> times<00:00:47.269> now<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:47.809> we're<00:00:48.019> not<00:00:48.079> going<00:00:48.260> to

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
three times now so we're not going to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.729 
three times now so we're not going to
show<00:00:48.499> that<00:00:48.710> part<00:00:48.859> again<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:51.350> what<00:00:51.499> we're<00:00:51.620> going

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
show that part again so what we're going

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.129 
show that part again so what we're going
to<00:00:51.800> do<00:00:51.949> here<00:00:52.309> number<00:00:53.059> two<00:00:53.210> coil<00:00:53.539> is<00:00:53.839> going<00:00:54.079> to

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
to do here number two coil is going to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:57.040 
to do here number two coil is going to
go<00:00:54.229> in<00:00:54.379> five<00:00:55.089> number<00:00:56.089> 2<00:00:56.239> plug<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.690> going<00:00:56.719> to<00:00:56.899> go

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
go in five number 2 plug is going to go

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:07.030 
go in five number 2 plug is going to go
on<00:00:57.199> three<00:00:57.819> pretty<00:00:58.819> easy<00:00:59.059> right<00:00:59.329> now<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:06.710> bitch

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
on three pretty easy right now a bitch

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.530 
on three pretty easy right now a bitch
to<00:01:07.220> go<00:01:07.370> and<00:01:07.490> plug<00:01:07.670> that's<00:01:07.880> why<00:01:08.060> I'm<00:01:08.299> plugging

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
to go and plug that's why I'm plugging

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:19.480 
to go and plug that's why I'm plugging
when<00:01:08.690> I'm<00:01:08.750> doing<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.340> plug<00:01:10.340> change<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:18.490> guess

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
when I'm doing the plug change I guess

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.249 
when I'm doing the plug change I guess
it<00:01:19.670> really<00:01:19.789> doesn't<00:01:20.240> matter<00:01:20.329> which<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:21.110> know

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
it really doesn't matter which you know

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.149 
it really doesn't matter which you know
which<00:01:21.439> two<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:21.710> swap<00:01:22.189> as<00:01:23.770> long<00:01:24.770> as<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.039> don't

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
which two you swap as long as you don't

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.819 
which two you swap as long as you don't
put<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.609> plug<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.659> coil<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.320> swap<00:01:27.710> them

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
put the plug and the coil and swap them

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.469 
put the plug and the coil and swap them
both<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.490> same<00:01:28.520> cylinder<00:01:29.119> I<00:01:29.270> mean

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
both with the same cylinder I mean

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.389 
both with the same cylinder I mean
you're<00:01:29.600> not<00:01:29.689> really<00:01:29.750> going<00:01:30.079> to<00:01:30.399> isolate

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
you're not really going to isolate

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:40.190 
you're not really going to isolate
anything

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.800 

so<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.830> got<00:01:41.180> these<00:01:42.180> two<00:01:42.240> plugs<00:01:42.690> are<00:01:42.810> switched

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
so we got these two plugs are switched

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.219 
so we got these two plugs are switched
take<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.050> one<00:01:46.290> coil<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.190> number<00:01:47.430> two

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
take the one coil that was on number two

00:01:48.229 --> 00:02:01.649 
take the one coil that was on number two
I'm<00:01:49.229> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.440> put<00:01:49.590> him<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.890> number<00:01:50.130> five

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.749 

I'm<00:02:02.049> going<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.260> take<00:02:02.350> number<00:02:02.500> five<00:02:02.799> coil<00:02:03.189> put

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
I'm going to take number five coil put

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:23.789 
I'm going to take number five coil put
it<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:03.939> number<00:02:04.180> two

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.819 

now<00:02:24.799> in<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.069> code<00:02:25.249> reader<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:27.260> probably<00:02:27.620> want

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
now in a code reader you probably want

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.440 
now in a code reader you probably want
to<00:02:27.859> clear<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.250> codes<00:02:28.430> now<00:02:28.819> before<00:02:31.450> starting

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
to clear the codes now before starting

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.589 
to clear the codes now before starting
the<00:02:32.540> engine<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.049> reason<00:02:33.349> is<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:34.420> PCM<00:02:35.420> will

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
the engine and the reason is is PCM will

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.489 
the engine and the reason is is PCM will
be<00:02:36.349> more<00:02:36.620> likely<00:02:36.889> to<00:02:37.159> set<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.669> Pio<00:02:38.150> 300<00:02:38.989> because

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:39.499 
be more likely to set a Pio 300 because

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.110 
be more likely to set a Pio 300 because
it<00:02:39.889> has<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.040> history<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.549> number<00:02:40.909> tube

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
it has a history of number tube

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.199 
it has a history of number tube
misfiring<00:02:41.629> and<00:02:41.900> now<00:02:42.620> another<00:02:43.579> cylinder<00:02:43.969> might

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
misfiring and now another cylinder might

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.860 
misfiring and now another cylinder might
be<00:02:44.299> misfiring

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
be misfiring

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:54.970 
be misfiring
so<00:02:45.349> that<00:02:45.500> could<00:02:45.769> mislead<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.620> can<00:02:54.769> see<00:02:54.859> on

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
so that could mislead so you can see on

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.849 
so that could mislead so you can see on
my<00:02:55.069> fancy<00:02:55.280> scan<00:02:55.699> tool<00:02:55.939> but<00:02:56.780> now<00:02:56.930> number<00:02:57.620> five

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
my fancy scan tool but now number five

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.300 
my fancy scan tool but now number five
has<00:02:58.159> the<00:02:58.340> miss<00:02:59.859> now<00:03:00.859> when<00:03:01.189> your

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
has the miss now when your

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.069 
has the miss now when your
do-it-yourself<00:03:01.430> approach<00:03:01.969> you<00:03:02.810> might<00:03:02.959> have

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
do-it-yourself approach you might have

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.599 
do-it-yourself approach you might have
to<00:03:03.169> wait<00:03:03.319> a<00:03:03.379> little<00:03:03.469> while<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:03.949> then<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.159> PCM

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
to wait a little while and then the PCM

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.629 
to wait a little while and then the PCM
will<00:03:04.819> set<00:03:05.120> apo<00:03:05.569> 305<00:03:06.349> well<00:03:07.219> since<00:03:07.430> we've

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
will set apo 305 well since we've

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.209 
will set apo 305 well since we've
swapped<00:03:07.969> the<00:03:08.419> coil<00:03:08.719> from<00:03:08.930> 2<00:03:09.169> to<00:03:09.290> 5<00:03:09.469> and<00:03:09.889> the

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
swapped the coil from 2 to 5 and the

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.789 
swapped the coil from 2 to 5 and the
misfire<00:03:10.609> is<00:03:10.969> now<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.329> number<00:03:11.599> 5<00:03:11.810> then<00:03:12.439> chances

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
misfire is now on number 5 then chances

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.559 
misfire is now on number 5 then chances
are<00:03:12.919> we've<00:03:13.099> got<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> bad<00:03:13.549> coil<00:03:14.620> if<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:16.569> misfire

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
are we've got a bad coil if the misfire

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.449 
are we've got a bad coil if the misfire
went<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.959> number<00:03:18.079> 3<00:03:18.500> then<00:03:19.040> we<00:03:19.159> know<00:03:19.280> we've<00:03:19.430> got

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
went to number 3 then we know we've got

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.270 
went to number 3 then we know we've got
a<00:03:19.639> plug<00:03:20.000> if<00:03:20.629> the<00:03:20.840> misfire<00:03:21.229> stayed<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.799> number<00:03:22.069> 2

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
a plug if the misfire stayed on number 2

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.129 
a plug if the misfire stayed on number 2
then<00:03:23.030> we<00:03:23.150> know<00:03:23.299> we<00:03:23.449> don't<00:03:23.569> have<00:03:23.689> an<00:03:23.930> ignition

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
then we know we don't have an ignition

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:49.140 
then we know we don't have an ignition
problem<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:25.009> have<00:03:25.129> to<00:03:25.250> look<00:03:25.370> elsewhere

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:04:10.520 

now<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:50.569> a<00:03:50.630> noon<00:03:50.870> good<00:03:51.050> coil<00:03:51.410> here

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:20.990 

see<00:04:11.490> what<00:04:11.580> happens<00:04:11.880> now<00:04:18.980> see<00:04:19.980> now<00:04:20.160> our<00:04:20.430> live

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
see what happens now see now our live

see what happens now see now our live
misfire<00:04:21.540> data<00:04:21.840> indicates<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.830> misfire<00:04:23.310> the

way<00:04:24.240> you'd<00:04:24.420> be<00:04:24.450> able<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.810> tell<00:04:24.960> obviously

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
way you'd be able to tell obviously

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.560 
way you'd be able to tell obviously
would<00:04:25.590> be<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:26.130> clear<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.490> code<00:04:26.640> again<00:04:26.940> drive

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
would be to clear the code again drive

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.510 
would be to clear the code again drive
the<00:04:27.720> truck<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.020> see<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.410> light<00:04:28.560> comes<00:04:28.770> back<00:04:28.830> I

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.100 

kind<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.610> wish<00:04:32.730> I<00:04:32.820> had<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:32.970> QP<00:04:33.360> scan<00:04:33.630> tool<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.050> I

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
kind of wish I had a QP scan tool so I

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.730 
kind of wish I had a QP scan tool so I
could<00:04:34.320> kind<00:04:34.500> of<00:04:34.530> do<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.980> average<00:04:35.760> Joe<00:04:36.390> way

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
could kind of do it the average Joe way

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.890 
could kind of do it the average Joe way
which<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.920> mean<00:04:38.100> it's<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.730> same<00:04:38.760> thing<00:04:39.210> you

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
which I mean it's the same thing you

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.040 
which I mean it's the same thing you
know<00:04:40.020> get<00:04:40.350> your<00:04:40.500> code<00:04:41.330> do<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.450> same<00:04:42.630> tests<00:04:42.960> I

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
know get your code do the same tests I

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.120 
know get your code do the same tests I
did<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.410> do<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.560> again<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.950> only<00:04:44.040> difference

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
did and do it again the only difference

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.010 
did and do it again the only difference
is<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.640> won't<00:04:44.730> have<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.120> live<00:04:45.330> data<00:04:45.570> but<00:04:45.930> it

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
is you won't have the live data but it

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.630 
is you won't have the live data but it
wouldn't<00:04:46.169> really<00:04:46.410> what<00:04:46.590> matter<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:47.520> would

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
wouldn't really what matter you would

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.310 
wouldn't really what matter you would
see<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.940> code<00:04:48.120> change<00:04:48.450> from<00:04:48.720> three<00:04:48.990> or<00:04:49.080> two<00:04:49.200> to

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
see the code change from three or two to

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.070 
see the code change from three or two to
three<00:04:49.500> or<00:04:49.680> five<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.730> wouldn't<00:04:50.940> have<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.210> you

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
three or five you wouldn't have to you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.590 
three or five you wouldn't have to you
know<00:04:52.140> have<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.440> fancy<00:04:52.800> scan<00:04:53.040> tool<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.340> do<00:04:53.430> that

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
know have the fancy scan tool to do that

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.450 
know have the fancy scan tool to do that
okay<00:04:54.600> so<00:04:54.660> if<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.050> swapped<00:04:55.380> two<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:56.250> five

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
okay so if you swapped two and five

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.500 
okay so if you swapped two and five
coils<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.120> two<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.110> three<00:04:58.140> plugs<00:04:59.000> if<00:05:00.000> there

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
coils and two and three plugs if there

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.390 
coils and two and three plugs if there
was<00:05:00.630> still<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.870> misfire<00:05:01.290> on<00:05:01.620> number<00:05:01.980> two<00:05:02.160> and

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
was still a misfire on number two and

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.850 
was still a misfire on number two and
it's<00:05:02.520> still<00:05:02.700> set<00:05:02.970> a<00:05:03.000> P<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.360> three<00:05:03.570> or<00:05:03.690> two<00:05:03.900> well

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
it's still set a P of three or two well

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.980 
it's still set a P of three or two well
you've<00:05:05.310> ruled<00:05:05.520> out<00:05:05.640> ignition<00:05:06.150> your<00:05:06.570> next<00:05:06.840> step

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
you've ruled out ignition your next step

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.190 
you've ruled out ignition your next step
is<00:05:07.080> going<00:05:07.169> to<00:05:07.380> be<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:08.310> check<00:05:08.600> compression<00:05:09.600> but

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
is going to be to check compression but

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.500 
is going to be to check compression but
that's<00:05:10.530> for<00:05:10.740> another<00:05:10.770> video<00:05:11.100> I<00:05:11.520> do<00:05:12.150> have<00:05:12.390> to

I've seen personally if the plugs are

he just did some coil swapping and you
know<00:06:31.680> he<00:06:31.800> determined<00:06:32.310> that<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.730> number<00:06:32.970> two

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
know he determined that the number two

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.760 
know he determined that the number two
coil<00:06:33.390> is<00:06:33.540> bad<00:06:33.720> or<00:06:34.020> number<00:06:34.260> three<00:06:34.470> I<00:06:34.530> camera

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
coil is bad or number three I camera

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.890 
coil is bad or number three I camera
which<00:06:35.040> one<00:06:35.160> it<00:06:35.250> was

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900
