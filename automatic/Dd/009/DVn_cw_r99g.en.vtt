00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
especially formulas out there right now

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.450 
especially formulas out there right now
this<00:00:26.590> is<00:00:26.680> one<00:00:26.830> reason<00:00:26.860> why<00:00:27.100> is<00:00:27.220> the

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
this is one reason why is the

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.650 
this is one reason why is the
temperature<00:00:27.699> formula<00:00:28.119> all<00:00:28.240> the<00:00:28.330> time<00:00:28.510> is

because<00:00:28.960> it<00:00:29.080> it<00:00:29.350> sets<00:00:29.680> itself<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:30.400> eyes<00:00:30.490> are

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
because it it sets itself the eyes are

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.500 
because it it sets itself the eyes are
always<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:30.940> first<00:00:31.180> thing<00:00:31.240> I<00:00:31.449> do<00:00:33.510> because

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
always the first thing I do because

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.319 
always the first thing I do because
