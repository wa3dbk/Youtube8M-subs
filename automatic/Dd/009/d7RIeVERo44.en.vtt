00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the useful life of the buses so we want

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.049 
the useful life of the buses so we want
to<00:00:31.080> make<00:00:31.170> sure<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> buses<00:00:31.830> are<00:00:32.640> extended

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
to make sure that the buses are extended

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.940 
to make sure that the buses are extended
as<00:00:33.149> best<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.480> possible<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:34.320> way<00:00:34.559> every<00:00:34.920> day

as best as possible this way every day
we<00:00:35.850> meet<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> street<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.600> provide<00:00:39.020> some<00:00:40.020> of

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
we meet the street we provide some of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.450 
we meet the street we provide some of
the<00:00:40.170> issues<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.379> go<00:00:40.620> wrong<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.160> could<00:00:41.309> be

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the issues that go wrong it could be

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.479 
the issues that go wrong it could be
engine<00:00:42.300> lights<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.140> could<00:00:43.260> be

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
engine lights that go on it could be

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.799 
engine lights that go on it could be
various<00:00:44.489> things<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.329> horn<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
various things that there the horn is

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.779 
various things that there the horn is
not<00:00:46.230> actively<00:00:46.590> working<00:00:46.710> those<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.550> brought

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
not actively working those get brought

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.670 
not actively working those get brought
in<00:00:48.000> some<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.960> things<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.440> there's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
in some of the things that if there's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200 
in some of the things that if there's
smoke<00:00:50.250> coming<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> exhaust

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
smoke coming out of one of the exhaust

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.569 
smoke coming out of one of the exhaust
pipes<00:00:51.510> those<00:00:52.170> will<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.379> brought<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.250> really

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
pipes those will be brought in so really

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.799 
pipes those will be brought in so really
it's<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.910> could<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> whole<00:00:54.420> range<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it's it could be a whole range of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's it could be a whole range of
different<00:00:55.140> things<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> ensure<00:00:57.390> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
different things to just to ensure that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
different things to just to ensure that
if<00:00:57.960> any<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.289> drivers<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.739> any<00:00:58.859> problems

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
if any of the drivers have any problems

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.500 
if any of the drivers have any problems
with<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> buses<00:00:59.820> when<00:00:59.940> they're<00:01:00.059> operating

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
with the buses when they're operating

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330 
with the buses when they're operating
them<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.260> called<00:01:01.469> back<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.100> example

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
them they get called back in for example

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.470 
them they get called back in for example
there<00:01:02.550> could<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.699> cases<00:01:03.030> where<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> fare<00:01:03.449> box

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
there could be cases where the fare box

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840 
there could be cases where the fare box
is<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.930> working<00:01:04.320> properly<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.670> course

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
is not working properly and of course

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
is not working properly and of course
now<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> hybrid<00:01:06.750> buses<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.740> guessing

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
now with the hybrid buses I'm guessing

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.039 
now with the hybrid buses I'm guessing
there's<00:01:08.369> extra<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.360> extra<00:01:09.810> just

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
there's extra or not extra just

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.570 
there's extra or not extra just
different<00:01:10.470> types<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.920> maintenance<00:01:11.100> yeah

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
different types of maintenance yeah

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.740 
different types of maintenance yeah
there's<00:01:12.060> definitely<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.540> lot<00:01:12.720> more

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
there's definitely a lot more

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.300 
there's definitely a lot more
maintenance<00:01:13.200> involved<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> hybrids<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
maintenance involved in the hybrids the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.870 
maintenance involved in the hybrids the
cost<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.970> fuel<00:01:16.040> filters<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.700> than

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
cost for fuel filters are much more than

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.700 
cost for fuel filters are much more than
a<00:01:17.970> regular<00:01:18.060> diesel<00:01:18.479> buses<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.350> lot<00:01:19.680> more

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
a regular diesel buses so a lot more

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.550 
a regular diesel buses so a lot more
time<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.759> effort<00:01:20.820> spent<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.479> repairing<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
time and effort spent on repairing and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
time and effort spent on repairing and
replacing<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.280> fixing<00:01:23.610> some<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> our<00:01:23.970> hybrids

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
replacing and fixing some of our hybrids

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
replacing and fixing some of our hybrids
even<00:01:24.780> though<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.080> we're<00:01:25.290> realizing<00:01:25.710> some

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
even though that we're realizing some

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
even though that we're realizing some
fuel<00:01:26.159> savings<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.909> also<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.600> cost<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
fuel savings but also to the cost to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.179 
fuel savings but also to the cost to
maintain<00:01:28.140> these<00:01:28.530> hybrids<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.070> was<00:01:29.159> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
maintain these hybrids there was a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.350 
maintain these hybrids there was a
learning<00:01:29.400> curve<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:30.000> there's<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.210> new

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
learning curve because there's a new

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
learning curve because there's a new
technology<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.930> came<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> transit<00:01:31.710> Windsor

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
technology that came the transit Windsor

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
technology that came the transit Windsor
so<00:01:32.189> our<00:01:32.670> mechanics<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> speed

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
so our mechanics are going up to speed

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.149 
so our mechanics are going up to speed
and<00:01:34.049> making<00:01:34.290> sure<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.530> they're<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.860> speed

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and making sure that they're up to speed

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
and making sure that they're up to speed
on<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.700> needs<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.030> done<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:37.200> want<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
on what needs to be done and we want to

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.780 
on what needs to be done and we want to
make<00:01:37.530> sure<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.680> those<00:01:37.829> buses<00:01:38.250> are<00:01:38.430> working

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
make sure that those buses are working

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.390 
make sure that those buses are working
because<00:01:38.880> right<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.810> 29<00:01:40.159> percent<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
because right now we have 29 percent of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.609 
because right now we have 29 percent of
our<00:01:41.490> buses<00:01:41.759> are<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:42.689> hybrid<00:01:43.049> buses<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
our buses are actually hybrid buses and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
our buses are actually hybrid buses and
then<00:01:44.070> what<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:45.090> make<00:01:45.210> sure<00:01:45.420> those

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
then what we do is we make sure those

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.880 
then what we do is we make sure those
ones<00:01:45.840> are<00:01:45.930> being<00:01:46.049> used<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.380> much<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:46.680> possible

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
ones are being used as much as possible

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.830 
ones are being used as much as possible
in<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.759> cases<00:01:47.970> they're<00:01:48.210> actually<00:01:48.240> being

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
in some cases they're actually being

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
in some cases they're actually being
used<00:01:49.049> 41<00:01:49.530> percent<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.860> time<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.100> really

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
used 41 percent of the time so really

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.819 
used 41 percent of the time so really
we're<00:01:51.030> using<00:01:51.329> us<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.869> work<00:01:52.140> forces<00:01:52.500> they're

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
we're using us as work forces they're

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.690 
we're using us as work forces they're
really<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> ones<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.549> are<00:01:53.640> driving<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
really the ones that are driving and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.520 
really the ones that are driving and
use<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:55.000> our<00:01:55.119> one<00:01:55.299> season<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.780> Crosstown<00:01:56.229> so

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
use on our one season the Crosstown so

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.190 
use on our one season the Crosstown so
when<00:01:57.039> that<00:01:57.159> happens<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.700> more<00:01:57.850> you're<00:01:58.000> using

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
when that happens the more you're using

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.660 
when that happens the more you're using
particular<00:01:59.200> types<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.560> bus<00:01:59.740> you're<00:02:00.340> gonna<00:02:00.460> see

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
particular types of bus you're gonna see

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.310 
particular types of bus you're gonna see
more<00:02:00.850> repairs<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.539> when<00:02:01.659> those<00:02:01.780> repairs<00:02:02.049> come

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
more repairs and when those repairs come

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.319 
more repairs and when those repairs come
in<00:02:02.469> they're<00:02:02.950> being<00:02:03.159> brought<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:04.000> regular

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
in they're being brought in on a regular

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.690 
in they're being brought in on a regular
basis<00:02:04.689> so<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:05.229> way<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.770> do<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.890> regular<00:02:06.130> p.m.
