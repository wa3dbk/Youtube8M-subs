think i would have kept it along the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.370 
think i would have kept it along the
same<00:01:28.880> thing<00:01:29.090> but<00:01:29.240> more<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:29.539> goblin<00:01:29.929> outlook

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.679 
same thing but more of a goblin outlook
there's<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.219> new<00:01:31.429> guy<00:01:31.579> that<00:01:31.880> warps<00:01:32.420> when<00:01:32.600> he

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
there's this new guy that warps when he

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:33.880
