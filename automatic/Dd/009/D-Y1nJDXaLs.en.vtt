everything<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.330> good<00:02:34.599> in<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.900> movie<00:02:35.200> is

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
everything that is good in the movie is

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.960 
everything that is good in the movie is
what<00:02:35.590> they're<00:02:35.739> showing<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.129> trailers<00:02:36.489> but

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
what they're showing in the trailers but

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.970 
what they're showing in the trailers but
that<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.360> definitely<00:02:37.569> not<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.470> case<00:02:38.500> with

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
that is definitely not the case with

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.789 
that is definitely not the case with
Jurassic<00:02:39.489> world<00:02:40.260> everything<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.410> see<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.739> the

Jurassic world everything you see in the

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.360 
Jurassic world everything you see in the
trailer<00:02:41.920> really<00:02:42.819> is<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:43.510> teasers<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.950> movie

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
trailer really is just teasers the movie

trailer really is just teasers the movie
is<00:02:45.579> even<00:02:46.510> better<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.799> parts<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:48.220> you

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
is even better and the parts that you

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.390 
is even better and the parts that you
see<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.209> trailers<00:02:49.599> there<00:02:50.470> are<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:51.010> few

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
see in the trailers there are a few

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.050 
see in the trailers there are a few
little<00:02:51.849> hidden<00:02:52.360> things<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.849> maybe<00:02:54.849> you

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
little hidden things that maybe you

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.309 
little hidden things that maybe you
don't<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.510> don't<00:02:55.720> actually<00:02:55.810> see<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
don't you don't actually see in the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.470 
don't you don't actually see in the
trailer<00:02:56.440> because<00:02:56.829> it's<00:02:57.310> missing<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.180> clip

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
trailer because it's missing the clip

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.780 
trailer because it's missing the clip
right<00:02:58.690> before<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.890> know<00:03:00.010> what<00:03:00.220> they<00:03:00.340> show<00:03:00.730> on

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
right before you know what they show on

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.030 
right before you know what they show on
the<00:03:00.940> trailer<00:03:01.329> so<00:03:01.750> it's<00:03:01.900> actually<00:03:02.319> even<00:03:02.500> cooler

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
the trailer so it's actually even cooler

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.630 
the trailer so it's actually even cooler
than<00:03:03.670> it<00:03:03.700> looks<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.599> trailers<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.489> if<00:03:06.489> you

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
than it looks in the trailers so if you

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.490 
than it looks in the trailers so if you
guys<00:03:06.880> have<00:03:07.090> not<00:03:07.239> seen<00:03:07.630> Jurassic<00:03:08.110> world<00:03:08.140> I
