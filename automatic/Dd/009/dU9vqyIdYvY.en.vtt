head<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:33.330> anyways<00:01:34.330> so<00:01:34.770> much<00:01:35.770> concerns<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.369> lot

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
head but anyways so much concerns a lot

head but anyways so much concerns a lot
better<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:38.289> think<00:01:38.350> part<00:01:38.800> of<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.950> reason

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
better and I think part of the reason

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.510 
better and I think part of the reason
that<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.180> is<00:01:40.299> is<00:01:40.360> because<00:01:40.780> not<00:01:41.590> only<00:01:41.619> am<00:01:41.979> I

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
that it is is because not only am I

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.219
