especially<00:02:01.610> with<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.090> lighting<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.479> all

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
especially with the lighting and all

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.929 
especially with the lighting and all
that<00:02:02.869> next<00:02:03.530> up<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:03.950> why<00:02:04.130> your<00:02:04.280> Colosseum<00:02:04.729> from

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
that next up is why your Colosseum from

that next up is why your Colosseum from
double<00:02:05.329> -<00:02:05.509> this<00:02:05.869> already<00:02:06.289> was<00:02:06.500> an<00:02:06.649> amazing

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
double - this already was an amazing

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.910 
double - this already was an amazing
amazing<00:02:08.090> track<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.840> Gamecube<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.470> it

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
amazing track on the Gamecube and it

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.350 
amazing track on the Gamecube and it
just<00:02:10.160> kind<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.759> fits<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.120> antigravity

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
just kind of fits the antigravity

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.059 
just kind of fits the antigravity
mechanic<00:02:12.140> too<00:02:12.319> well<00:02:12.500> for<00:02:12.709> them<00:02:12.829> not<00:02:12.920> to

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
mechanic too well for them not to

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.890 
mechanic too well for them not to
include<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.760> all<00:02:13.880> said<00:02:14.090> that's<00:02:14.269> really

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
include so we all said that's really

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.490 
include so we all said that's really
everything<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.380> have<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.650> say<00:02:15.680> next<00:02:16.430> up<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:17.000> have

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
everything I have to say next up we have

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.380 
everything I have to say next up we have
mushroom<00:02:18.500> grades<00:02:18.799> from<00:02:19.099> Double<00:02:19.489> Dash<00:02:19.610> this

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
mushroom grades from Double Dash this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.180 
mushroom grades from Double Dash this
track<00:02:20.720> already<00:02:21.230> got<00:02:21.500> remade<00:02:21.799> in<00:02:21.950> Mario<00:02:22.160> Kart

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190

DS<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:22.849> seeing<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.269> they've<00:02:23.420> already

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
DS but seeing that they've already

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.600 
DS but seeing that they've already
brought<00:02:24.019> back<00:02:24.290> tracks<00:02:24.620> multiple<00:02:25.190> times<00:02:25.400> like

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
brought back tracks multiple times like

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.009 
brought back tracks multiple times like
guilty<00:02:25.940> circuit<00:02:26.359> that<00:02:26.450> doesn't<00:02:26.870> really

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
guilty circuit that doesn't really

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.420 
guilty circuit that doesn't really
handle<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.440> chance<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.829> this<00:02:27.950> track<00:02:28.220> being

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
handle the chance of this track being

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.210 
handle the chance of this track being
back<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:28.910> one<00:02:29.630> bit<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.109> just<00:02:30.170> really<00:02:30.920> like<00:02:31.069> the

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
back in one bit I just really like the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.650 
back in one bit I just really like the
course<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.760> while<00:02:31.940> there<00:02:32.060> isn't<00:02:32.450> really<00:02:32.540> that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
course and while there isn't really that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.210 
course and while there isn't really that
much<00:02:32.810> they<00:02:33.109> could<00:02:33.170> do<00:02:33.440> with<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.709> in<00:02:33.829> terms<00:02:34.069> of

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
much they could do with it in terms of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.400 
much they could do with it in terms of
anti-gravity<00:02:34.549> that's<00:02:35.540> ok<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.049> mean<00:02:36.290> that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
anti-gravity that's ok to mean that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.050 
anti-gravity that's ok to mean that
every<00:02:36.680> track<00:02:36.889> has<00:02:37.069> to<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:37.549> super<00:02:37.940> crazy

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
every track has to be like super crazy

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.120 
every track has to be like super crazy
with<00:02:38.450> anti-gravity<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.350> think<00:02:39.650> the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
with anti-gravity and I think the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.400 
with anti-gravity and I think the
district<00:02:40.549> would<00:02:40.670> be<00:02:40.790> really<00:02:41.239> really<00:02:41.450> cool<00:02:42.170> I

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
district would be really really cool I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.229 
district would be really really cool I
know<00:02:43.130> I'm<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.370> only<00:02:43.459> one<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.910> goddamn

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
know I'm the only one on the goddamn

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.680 
know I'm the only one on the goddamn
planet<00:02:44.269> by<00:02:44.720> every<00:02:45.109> last<00:02:45.470> retro<00:02:46.310> track<00:02:46.690> Rainbow

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
planet by every last retro track Rainbow

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.080 
planet by every last retro track Rainbow
Road<00:02:47.930> from<00:02:48.290> Mario<00:02:48.680> Kart<00:02:48.709> yes<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.459> mean<00:02:49.790> just

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
Road from Mario Kart yes I mean just

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.809 
Road from Mario Kart yes I mean just
look<00:02:50.480> at<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.889> almost<00:02:52.280> seems<00:02:52.489> like<00:02:52.579> it

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
look at this this almost seems like it

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.150 
look at this this almost seems like it
was<00:02:53.000> made<00:02:53.359> for<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.019> antigravity<00:02:54.319> mechanic

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
was made for the antigravity mechanic

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.470 
was made for the antigravity mechanic
and<00:02:55.250> they<00:02:55.400> could<00:02:55.609> make<00:02:55.639> this<00:02:55.940> track<00:02:56.209> even

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
and they could make this track even

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.900 
and they could make this track even
crazier<00:02:57.319> this<00:02:57.829> is<00:02:58.040> definitely<00:02:58.489> like<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
crazier this is definitely like the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.400 
crazier this is definitely like the
crazies<00:02:59.359> Rainbow<00:02:59.780> Road<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.139> Mario<00:03:00.380> Kart

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
crazies Rainbow Road in Mario Kart

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.229 
crazies Rainbow Road in Mario Kart
history<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.370> think<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.910> would<00:03:02.000> make

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
history so I think that it would make

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.780 
history so I think that it would make
perfect<00:03:02.599> sense<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:03.980> they<00:03:04.130> go<00:03:04.310> ahead<00:03:04.579> and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
perfect sense that they go ahead and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.610 
perfect sense that they go ahead and
make<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:04.940> even<00:03:05.329> crazier<00:03:05.780> if<00:03:05.959> they<00:03:06.230> let<00:03:06.440> this

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
make it even crazier if they let this

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.080 
make it even crazier if they let this
course<00:03:06.889> though<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.489> will<00:03:07.609> mean<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:07.819> we

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
course though that will mean that we

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.900 
course though that will mean that we
have<00:03:08.329> for<00:03:08.750> rainbow<00:03:09.380> roads<00:03:09.620> which<00:03:09.950> well<00:03:10.190> could

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
have for rainbow roads which well could

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.330 
have for rainbow roads which well could
maybe<00:03:11.060> be<00:03:11.299> pushing<00:03:11.599> it<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.750> bit<00:03:11.810> but<00:03:12.200> anyway<00:03:12.650> now

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
maybe be pushing it a bit but anyway now

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.900 
maybe be pushing it a bit but anyway now
for<00:03:13.609> new<00:03:13.790> tracks<00:03:14.120> all<00:03:14.450> right<00:03:14.959> if<00:03:15.260> any<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.730> these

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
for new tracks all right if any of these

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.110 
for new tracks all right if any of these
tracks<00:03:17.269> were<00:03:18.139> to<00:03:18.319> make<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.650> in<00:03:18.799> it<00:03:19.120> absolutely

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
tracks were to make it in it absolutely

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.650 
tracks were to make it in it absolutely
has<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.870> be<00:03:21.139> this<00:03:21.530> one<00:03:21.859> Nintendo<00:03:22.489> for<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.359> love

has to be this one Nintendo for the love
of<00:03:23.930> Jesus<00:03:24.019> Christ<00:03:24.859> himself<00:03:25.370> make<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.299> course

I<00:03:30.620> mean<00:03:31.090> just<00:03:32.090> imagine<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.019> guys<00:03:33.229> all<00:03:33.500> the

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
I mean just imagine it guys all the

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.430 
I mean just imagine it guys all the
flashes

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
flashes

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.920 
flashes
the<00:03:35.160> roller<00:03:35.400> coaster<00:03:35.880> has<00:03:36.000> course<00:03:36.330> design<00:03:36.720> I

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the roller coaster has course design I

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.350 
the roller coaster has course design I
mean<00:03:37.140> this<00:03:37.620> could<00:03:38.010> very<00:03:38.340> well<00:03:38.460> be<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.850> best

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
mean this could very well be the best

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.930 
mean this could very well be the best

bros<00:04:14.970> series<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.480> don't<00:04:15.780> really<00:04:15.930> like<00:04:16.140> the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
bros series I don't really like the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.770 
bros series I don't really like the
series<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.799> much<00:04:17.010> myself<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.450> hasn't

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
series that much myself but it hasn't

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.270 
series that much myself but it hasn't
really<00:04:18.989> ever<00:04:19.320> been<00:04:19.500> featured<00:04:19.830> in<00:04:19.920> Mario<00:04:20.220> Kart

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
really ever been featured in Mario Kart

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.160 
really ever been featured in Mario Kart
and<00:04:20.520> I<00:04:20.640> think<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.060> would<00:04:21.270> be<00:04:21.450> really<00:04:21.630> cool<00:04:21.930> to

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
and I think it would be really cool to

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.140 
and I think it would be really cool to
drive<00:04:22.620> around<00:04:22.800> acorn<00:04:23.280> plains<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.790> then<00:04:23.940> go<00:04:24.090> to

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
drive around acorn plains and then go to

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.060 
drive around acorn plains and then go to
the<00:04:24.360> desert<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.840> snow<00:04:25.200> world<00:04:25.440> all<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.710> a

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
the desert and snow world all in a

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.040 
the desert and snow world all in a
single<00:04:26.250> lab<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:27.030> will<00:04:27.420> kind<00:04:27.630> of<00:04:27.690> be<00:04:27.780> like<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
single lab it will kind of be like the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.660 
single lab it will kind of be like the
animal<00:04:28.290> crossing<00:04:28.500> track<00:04:28.950> except<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.550> the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
animal crossing track except that the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.850 
animal crossing track except that the
environment<00:04:30.180> changes<00:04:30.690> within<00:04:30.960> race<00:04:31.410> itself

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
environment changes within race itself

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.430 
environment changes within race itself
and<00:04:32.220> now<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.910> final<00:04:33.540> course<00:04:33.780> that<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.170> would

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
and now the final course that I would

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.860 
and now the final course that I would
like<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.740> see<00:04:34.950> is<00:04:35.160> something<00:04:35.520> based<00:04:36.060> off<00:04:36.360> Paper

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870

like to see is something based off Paper
Mario<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.620> really<00:04:38.100> like<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.400> Paper<00:04:38.640> Mario

games<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.480> I'm<00:04:39.570> actually<00:04:39.840> surprised<00:04:40.500> that

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
games and I'm actually surprised that

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.070 
games and I'm actually surprised that
again<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.730> they<00:04:41.850> haven't<00:04:42.150> ever<00:04:42.570> made<00:04:43.050> a

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
again that they haven't ever made a

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.170 
again that they haven't ever made a
stage<00:04:43.410> based<00:04:43.770> off<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.190> yet<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.370> mean<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.820> lot<00:04:45.090> of

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
stage based off it yet I mean a lot of

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.580 
stage based off it yet I mean a lot of
people<00:04:45.510> really<00:04:45.690> seem<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.020> like<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.380> Paper

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590
