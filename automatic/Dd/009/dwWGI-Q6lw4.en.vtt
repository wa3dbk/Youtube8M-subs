00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.380
 human anatomy dot net presents 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.340
 chest 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.340
 the thorax lodges the heart the lungs and 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.830
 many other important formations its 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.099
 skeleton that encloses and protects these 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.170
 organs and some of the abdominals are 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.380
 composed of the dorsal vertebrae and 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.120
 intervertebral discs the ribs and 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.820
 rib cartilages as well as the sternum 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.470
 the thoracic skeleton is constructed of 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.440
 way that the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.030
 movements appropriately to increase 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.340
 or decrease the volume of the cavity 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.530
 thoracic 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.570
 communicates the thoracic cavity with the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.480
 anterior part of the neck by the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.580
 upper thoracic opening limited 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.420
 dorsally mind by the upper edge of the 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.059
 dorsal vertebra 1 in front of the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.489
 upper edge of the handlebar external to 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.120
 the sides by the first two ribs 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.760
 and its cartilages this opening is 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.100
 small is about 5 centimeters 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.460
 forward back and about 10 centimeters 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.590
 transversally is occupied by the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.440
 vertices of the lungs and the pleura 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.680
 and by many other situated formations 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.560
 between the neck and the thorax due to 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.240
 obliquity of the first ribs 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.140
 this opening looks down and 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.140
 ahead 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.000
 the thoracic cavity communicates with the 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.729
 abdomen through the thoracic opening 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.640
 lower which is closed by the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.570
 diaphragm this opening is wide and 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.170
 limited by the dorsal vertebra 12 the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.940
 bodies of pair 12 of ribs 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.759
 free ends of the 6 pairs 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.610
 inferiors of costal cartilages and the 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.850
 articulation if it was external the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.909
 costal cartilages 7 to 10 come together in 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.360
 each side and its internal edges form 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.729
 the rib flange the rib flanges 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.090
 they constitute the sides of the angle infra 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.570
 external the sub-costal joint if 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.750
 it was external form its vertex the 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.200
 caudal apophysis is extends caudal 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.780
 mind in the angle infra this bad and bad 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.580
 of ventral pressure to the apophysis is the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.680
 epigastric fossa of the abdominal wall 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.560
 previous 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.019
 the adult's chest is elliptical in 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.700
 wider horizontal section 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.609
 transversally that in sense 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.060
 anteroposterior the relationship between 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:38.480
 anteroposterior and transverse diameter are 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.359
