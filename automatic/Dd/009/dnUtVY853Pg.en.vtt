you want to call it because all you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.940 
you want to call it because all you
could<00:01:43.670> only<00:01:43.820> see<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.090> back<00:01:44.119> sprites<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.770> once

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
could only see the back sprites so once

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.650 
could only see the back sprites so once
I<00:01:46.039> see<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.280> front<00:01:46.640> of<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.940> sprites<00:01:47.330> I'm

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
I see the front of the sprites I'm

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.120 
I see the front of the sprites I'm
probably<00:01:47.930> going<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.200> be<00:01:48.289> able<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.560> determine

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
probably going to be able to determine

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.240 
probably going to be able to determine
more<00:01:49.850> but<00:01:50.179> from<00:01:50.509> what<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.660> could<00:01:50.750> see<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:51.920> one

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
more but from what I could see that one

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.279 
more but from what I could see that one
looks<00:01:52.700> kind<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:53.240> like<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.420> tarantula<00:01:53.810> or

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
looks kind of like a tarantula or

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.660 
looks kind of like a tarantula or
something<00:01:54.679> or<00:01:55.550> maybe<00:01:55.610> some<00:01:55.940> type<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.210> bug<00:01:57.670> yeah

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
something or maybe some type of bug yeah

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.260 
something or maybe some type of bug yeah
and<00:01:58.939> also<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.509> other<00:01:59.689> Pokemon<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:01.210> since<00:02:02.210> I

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
and also the other Pokemon I since I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and also the other Pokemon I since I
can't<00:02:02.450> really<00:02:02.570> see<00:02:02.990> too<00:02:03.290> well<00:02:03.320> i'm<00:02:03.830> thinking<00:02:04.520> a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
can't really see too well i'm thinking a

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.139 
can't really see too well i'm thinking a
it<00:02:06.290> looks<00:02:06.470> kind<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.070> maybe<00:02:07.430> some<00:02:07.790> kind<00:02:08.030> of

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it looks kind of like maybe some kind of

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.719 
it looks kind of like maybe some kind of
phantom<00:02:08.780> or<00:02:09.649> something<00:02:10.009> because<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.369> has<00:02:10.489> like

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
phantom or something because it has like

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.569 
phantom or something because it has like
a<00:02:10.759> ghost-like<00:02:11.390> hand<00:02:11.840> coming<00:02:12.140> out<00:02:12.320> of<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.549> uh

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
moment but it could be told something

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.150 
moment but it could be told something
totally<00:03:20.360> different<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.840> if<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.770> is<00:03:21.860> something

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
totally different and if it is something

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.280 
totally different and if it is something
totally<00:03:22.430> different<00:03:22.700> i<00:03:22.850> really<00:03:23.060> like<00:03:23.270> it<00:03:23.480> then

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
totally different i really like it then

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
be triple battles yeah this is pretty

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.070 
be triple battles yeah this is pretty
interesting<00:03:52.299> I'm<00:03:53.299> wondering<00:03:53.510> how<00:03:53.660> little

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
interesting I'm wondering how little

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.740 
interesting I'm wondering how little
work<00:03:54.380> though<00:03:54.440> because<00:03:54.980> uh<00:03:55.100> I<00:03:55.610> can<00:03:56.209> competitive

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
work though because uh I can competitive

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.600 
work though because uh I can competitive
battles<00:03:57.140> people<00:03:57.380> probably<00:03:57.560> use<00:03:57.769> explosion<00:03:58.549> a

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
battles people probably use explosion a

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.150 
battles people probably use explosion a
lot<00:03:58.819> so<00:03:59.480> I'm<00:03:59.870> wondering<00:04:00.350> how<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.769> will<00:04:01.130> work

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
lot so I'm wondering how that will work

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.199 
lot so I'm wondering how that will work
out<00:04:01.580> especially<00:04:02.000> if<00:04:02.769> like<00:04:03.769> since<00:04:04.640> its<00:04:04.850> turtle

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
out especially if like since its turtle

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.610 
out especially if like since its turtle
battles<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.750> only<00:04:05.840> have<00:04:05.989> six<00:04:06.260> both<00:04:06.440> going

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
battles and you only have six both going

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.990 
battles and you only have six both going
to<00:04:06.650> choose<00:04:06.830> from<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.430> will<00:04:07.549> probably<00:04:07.700> like

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
to choose from it will probably like

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.060 
to choose from it will probably like
wipe<00:04:08.209> out<00:04:08.390> your<00:04:08.540> entire<00:04:08.600> team<00:04:09.049> of<00:04:09.200> like<00:04:09.470> if

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
wipe out your entire team of like if

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.490 
wipe out your entire team of like if
your<00:04:10.459> opponent<00:04:10.609> uses<00:04:10.850> explosion<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:12.350> you're

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
your opponent uses explosion and you're

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.170 
your opponent uses explosion and you're
like<00:04:12.590> his<00:04:12.680> other<00:04:12.799> Pokemon<00:04:13.400> just<00:04:13.700> use<00:04:13.790> protect

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
like his other Pokemon just use protect

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.849 
like his other Pokemon just use protect
or<00:04:14.329> something<00:04:14.690> so<00:04:15.230> I'm<00:04:15.290> wondering<00:04:15.380> how<00:04:15.590> well

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
or something so I'm wondering how well
