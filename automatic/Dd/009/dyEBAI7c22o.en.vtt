attraction to have audio-animatronic

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.170 
attraction to have audio-animatronic
technology<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:45.059> bit

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
technology it was just a little bit

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.190

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and became the the new tech that would

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.180 
and became the the new tech that would
be<00:00:52.890> put<00:00:53.219> later<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.730> almost<00:00:54.030> every<00:00:54.390> attraction

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190

of course birds were the great way to

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880 
of course birds were the great way to
test<00:01:02.730> animatronics<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> technology

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
test animatronics as a technology

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
test animatronics as a technology
because<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.970> had<00:01:06.180> birds<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.960> you've<00:01:07.080> ever

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
robotic like movement very fast and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.960 
robotic like movement very fast and
jerky<00:01:12.330> movement<00:01:12.720> which<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> sort<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.970> what

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
slow because you would have people

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310 
slow because you would have people
sitting<00:01:53.369> there<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> full<00:01:54.149> meal<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.689> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
sitting there for a full meal and you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.929 
sitting there for a full meal and you
wouldn't<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.740> able<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> fit<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> whole<00:01:56.610> lot<00:01:56.820> of

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
wouldn't be able to fit a whole lot of

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.580 
wouldn't be able to fit a whole lot of
people<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.659> because<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.020> had<00:01:58.320> all<00:01:58.560> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
people in it because you had all of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.889 
people in it because you had all of
these<00:01:58.740> animatronics<00:01:59.430> set<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.210> he<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.750> then

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
these animatronics set up he was then

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.380 
these animatronics set up he was then
converted<00:02:01.530> into<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:02.009> sit-down<00:02:02.399> show<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.240> was

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
converted into a sit-down show that was

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.120 
converted into a sit-down show that was
shortened<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.710> could<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:04.979> more

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
shortened so that you could get more

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.920 
shortened so that you could get more
people<00:02:05.549> through<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:06.810> actually

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
people through it and it was actually

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.589 
people through it and it was actually
one<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.680> first<00:02:08.069> buildings<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.940> Disneyland

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
to be completely air-conditioned and the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.730 
to be completely air-conditioned and the
reason<00:02:11.910> for<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.780> by<00:02:12.959> being<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
reason for that was by being the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.520 
reason for that was by being the
first<00:02:13.890> attraction<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:15.450> used<00:02:15.720> animatronics

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
creating and luckily in I want to say

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.890 
creating and luckily in I want to say
2011<00:03:11.640> there<00:03:11.790> was<00:03:11.910> actually<00:03:12.270> an<00:03:12.360> accident

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
2011 there was actually an accident

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.260 
2011 there was actually an accident
where<00:03:13.080> one<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.530> birds<00:03:13.800> caught<00:03:14.580> fire<00:03:14.940> and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
where one of the birds caught fire and

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.540 
where one of the birds caught fire and
they<00:03:15.900> had<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.140> shut<00:03:16.320> down<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.650> ride<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.280> I

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
they had to shut down the ride and I

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.450 
they had to shut down the ride and I
think<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.880> was<00:03:17.970> Iago<00:03:18.620> or<00:03:19.620> Zazu<00:03:20.040> I'm<00:03:20.160> not<00:03:20.280> sure

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
think it was Iago or Zazu I'm not sure

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.620 
think it was Iago or Zazu I'm not sure
which<00:03:20.610> one<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.820> them<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.180> they<00:03:21.270> were<00:03:21.330> very

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
which one of them but they were very

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.100 
which one of them but they were very
badly<00:03:22.290> damaged<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.570> Disney<00:03:24.570> sort<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.900> took

badly damaged and Disney sort of took

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.230 
badly damaged and Disney sort of took
this<00:03:25.260> opportunity<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:26.220> refurbish<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.060> ride

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
this opportunity to refurbish the ride

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.950 
this opportunity to refurbish the ride
once<00:03:27.570> again<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.850> restore<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.300> back<00:03:30.510> into<00:03:30.720> its

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
once again and restore it back into its

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.730 
once again and restore it back into its
original<00:03:30.990> form<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:31.890> on<00:03:32.160> August<00:03:32.490> 15<00:03:32.850> 2011<00:03:33.750> it

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
original form so on August 15 2011 it

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.130 
original form so on August 15 2011 it
opened<00:03:35.220> as<00:03:35.400> Walt<00:03:36.000> Disney's<00:03:36.450> Enchanted<00:03:36.630> Tiki

that<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:44.760> might<00:03:44.880> want<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.060> check<00:03:45.210> out<00:03:45.390> the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
that you might want to check out the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.970 
that you might want to check out the
next<00:03:45.660> time<00:03:45.900> you're<00:03:46.050> in<00:03:46.080> Adventureland<00:03:46.770> in

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
next time you're in Adventureland in

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.240 
next time you're in Adventureland in
Walt<00:03:47.160> Disney<00:03:47.520> World<00:03:47.550> it's<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.300> fun<00:03:48.480> little<00:03:48.510> show

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
Walt Disney World it's a fun little show

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.010 
Walt Disney World it's a fun little show
it's<00:03:50.250> got<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.550> lot<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.820> history<00:03:51.330> behind<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.870> and

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
it's got a lot of history behind it and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.600 
it's got a lot of history behind it and
I<00:03:52.050> think<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.350> alone<00:03:52.860> makes<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.310> sort<00:03:53.520> of

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
I think that alone makes it sort of

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.850 
I think that alone makes it sort of
worth<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.000> time<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.510> because<00:03:55.410> it's<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.680> less

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
worth the time and because it's a less

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.920 
worth the time and because it's a less
popular<00:03:56.370> attraction<00:03:56.910> you're<00:03:57.180> probably<00:03:57.510> never

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
popular attraction you're probably never

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.890 
popular attraction you're probably never
gonna<00:03:58.110> see<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.440> long<00:03:58.710> wait<00:03:59.040> for<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.120> if
