dine<00:02:00.360> i<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.500> might<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.100> my

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
dine i think it might be because of my

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.109 
dine i think it might be because of my
belligerent<00:02:02.969> position<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.719> humanity<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:05.119> eat
