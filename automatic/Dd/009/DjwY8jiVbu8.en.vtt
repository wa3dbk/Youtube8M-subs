00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
a do-or-die situation and I think again

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.079 
a do-or-die situation and I think again
this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.889> me<00:00:14.009> I'm<00:00:14.190> sorry<00:00:14.460> guys<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.790> know<00:00:14.849> I'm

praise<00:00:18.119> for<00:00:18.300> Savior<00:00:18.539> but<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> think<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.050> is

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
praise for Savior but I think this is

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.230

going<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.180> 10<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:24.900> 11<00:00:24.930> well<00:00:25.289> he's<00:00:25.410> really

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
going about 10 or 11 well he's really

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.320 
going about 10 or 11 well he's really
got<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> decent<00:00:26.010> economy<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:26.939> compared

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
got a decent economy going as compared

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330 
got a decent economy going as compared
to<00:00:27.359> flash<00:00:27.660> whose<00:00:28.439> economy<00:00:28.859> he's<00:00:28.949> really

reinforcements to arrive and say me does
go<00:03:45.030> back<00:03:45.209> so<00:03:45.599> see<00:03:46.229> if<00:03:46.290> I'm<00:03:46.409> doing<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.709> great<00:03:46.859> job

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
go back so see if I'm doing a great job

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.490 
go back so see if I'm doing a great job
with<00:03:47.159> his<00:03:47.250> needless<00:03:47.519> harass<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.569> a<00:03:48.900> flash

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
with his needless harass and a flash

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.990 
with his needless harass and a flash
playing<00:03:49.859> a<00:03:49.949> little<00:03:50.069> tentatively<00:03:50.579> here<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:50.940> I

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
playing a little tentatively here and I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.280 
playing a little tentatively here and I
think<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.389> maybe<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.659> wonder<00:03:51.930> if<00:03:52.049> it's<00:03:52.169> just

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
think just maybe I wonder if it's just

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.539 
think just maybe I wonder if it's just
down<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.560> him<00:03:52.680> not<00:03:52.799> knowing<00:03:52.949> the<00:03:53.129> map<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.430> well

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
down to him not knowing the map so well

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.619 
down to him not knowing the map so well
or<00:03:53.699> him<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:53.970> getting<00:03:54.150> caught<00:03:54.359> caught

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
or him just getting caught caught

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:55.819 
or him just getting caught caught
off-guard<00:03:54.780> by<00:03:54.959> saving<00:03:55.290> single<00:03:55.560> should<00:03:55.680> rush

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
off-guard by saving single should rush

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.080 
off-guard by saving single should rush
see<00:03:56.250> even<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:56.489> looks<00:03:56.639> like<00:03:56.760> he's<00:03:56.849> setting<00:03:56.940> up

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
see even now looks like he's setting up

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.460 
see even now looks like he's setting up
for<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.269> fourth<00:03:57.540> Hashi<00:03:57.720> for<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.019> second<00:03:58.319> gas

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
for that fourth Hashi for the second gas

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.099 
for that fourth Hashi for the second gas
and<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.489> really<00:03:59.970> pulley<00:04:00.239> far<00:04:00.540> ahead<00:04:00.659> of<00:04:00.840> flash

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
and and really pulley far ahead of flash

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.409 
and and really pulley far ahead of flash
in<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.379> game<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:02.159> flash<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.729> really<00:04:03.209> really

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
in this game and flash is really really

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.670 
in this game and flash is really really
struggling<00:04:03.659> to<00:04:03.840> cope<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.169> those<00:04:04.290> Marines<00:04:04.590> are

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
struggling to cope and those Marines are

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.719 
struggling to cope and those Marines are
just<00:04:04.799> getting<00:04:05.010> picked<00:04:05.159> off<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.430> think<00:04:05.609> at<00:04:05.669> this

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
just getting picked off I think at this

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:06.920 
just getting picked off I think at this
stage<00:04:05.790> if<00:04:06.299> say<00:04:06.419> we<00:04:06.540> could<00:04:06.659> get<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.780> few

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
stage if say we could get a few

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.360 
stage if say we could get a few
zerglings<00:04:07.349> in<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.500> support<00:04:07.709> those<00:04:07.859> muta<00:04:08.099> lists

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
zerglings in to support those muta lists

flash flash has his forces divided

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.349 
flash flash has his forces divided
because<00:04:11.040> he's<00:04:11.159> he's<00:04:11.639> forced<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.000> defend<00:04:12.269> his

center before his forbearance is what is

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.789 
center before his forbearance is what is
really<00:04:18.690> her<00:04:18.810> fashion<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.289> fact<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.560> he<00:04:19.620> went

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
really her fashion the fact that he went

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.170 
really her fashion the fact that he went
for<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.010> command<00:04:20.250> center<00:04:20.489> first<00:04:20.760> instead<00:04:21.060> of

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
for the command center first instead of

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.560 
for the command center first instead of
going<00:04:21.329> for<00:04:21.450> the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
going for the

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.390 
going for the
rocks<00:04:21.720> he<00:04:22.470> went<00:04:22.650> for<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.830> fastest<00:04:23.160> man

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
rocks he went for the fastest man

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.430 
rocks he went for the fastest man
unfortunately<00:04:24.300> Savior<00:04:24.930> went<00:04:25.080> for<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.260> rush

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
unfortunately Savior went for the rush

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
unfortunately Savior went for the rush
even<00:04:25.710> though<00:04:25.770> save<00:04:25.950> one<00:04:26.130> for<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.310> Hashi

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
even though save one for the Hashi

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.430 
even though save one for the Hashi
before<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.000> spawning<00:04:27.210> pool<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.080> he<00:04:28.170> got<00:04:28.320> the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
before the spawning pool and he got the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.290 
before the spawning pool and he got the
speed-up<00:04:28.740> upgrade<00:04:29.190> his<00:04:29.340> early<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.850> observing

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
speed-up upgrade his early and observing

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.910 
speed-up upgrade his early and observing
so<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.420> think<00:04:30.480> those<00:04:30.690> are<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.930> two<00:04:31.110> key<00:04:31.680> things

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
so I think those are the two key things

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.170 
so I think those are the two key things
that<00:04:31.980> made<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.340> difference<00:04:32.520> in<00:04:32.820> Savior

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
that made the difference in Savior

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.790 
that made the difference in Savior
search<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.510> fact<00:04:33.720> that<00:04:33.810> first<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.260> all<00:04:34.350> he

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
search the fact that first of all he

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.380 
search the fact that first of all he
didn't<00:04:35.070> just<00:04:35.190> rush<00:04:35.400> he<00:04:35.520> got<00:04:35.700> speed-up<00:04:36.150> rated

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
didn't just rush he got speed-up rated

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.330 
didn't just rush he got speed-up rated
zergling<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.930> was<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.350> was<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.890> perforation

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
zergling so it was it was a perforation

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.190 
zergling so it was it was a perforation
and<00:04:38.580> ironically<00:04:39.240> enough<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.600> was<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.750> way

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
and ironically enough that was the way

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.690 
and ironically enough that was the way
Savior<00:04:40.620> beat<00:04:40.830> flash<00:04:41.040> in<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.220> first<00:04:41.430> game<00:04:41.610> is

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
Savior beat flash in the first game is

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.830 
Savior beat flash in the first game is
speed<00:04:41.850> up<00:04:41.970> resurgence<00:04:42.420> of<00:04:42.450> that<00:04:42.600> time<00:04:42.750> he

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
speed up resurgence of that time he

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.330 
speed up resurgence of that time he
finished<00:04:43.140> flash<00:04:43.560> off<00:04:43.740> with<00:04:43.860> his<00:04:43.980> earnings<00:04:44.250> on

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
finished flash off with his earnings on

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.300 
finished flash off with his earnings on
their<00:04:44.460> own<00:04:44.630> but<00:04:45.630> as<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:45.870> was<00:04:45.960> saying<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.410> was

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
their own but as I was saying that was

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.650 
their own but as I was saying that was
the<00:04:47.430> big<00:04:47.580> difference<00:04:47.670> here<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.060> think<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.480> say

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
the big difference here I think and say

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.790 
the big difference here I think and say
we're<00:04:48.810> now<00:04:48.900> bringing<00:04:49.080> those<00:04:49.230> earnings<00:04:49.560> true

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
we're now bringing those earnings true

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.350 
we're now bringing those earnings true
that<00:04:50.130> he<00:04:50.220> needs<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.460> break<00:04:50.730> that<00:04:50.910> marine<00:04:51.180> line

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
that he needs to break that marine line

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.140 
that he needs to break that marine line
off<00:04:51.990> flashes<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:53.160> he's<00:04:53.580> not<00:04:53.730> going<00:04:53.880> all-in

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
off flashes and he's not going all-in

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.000 
off flashes and he's not going all-in
he's<00:04:54.660> not<00:04:54.840> committing<00:04:55.350> himself<00:04:55.470> with<00:04:55.890> the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
he's not committing himself with the

he's not committing himself with the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
rubies on the marines with the meat was

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.120 
rubies on the marines with the meat was
undeserving<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.410> flash<00:04:58.590> just<00:04:58.770> doesn't<00:04:59.040> have

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
undeserving the flash just doesn't have

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
little bit annoyed with himself I think

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.940 
little bit annoyed with himself I think
he<00:05:36.570> feels<00:05:36.720> that<00:05:36.900> he<00:05:37.170> should<00:05:37.200> have<00:05:37.500> he<00:05:37.710> probably

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
he feels that he should have he probably

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.410 
he feels that he should have he probably
came<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.280> US<00:05:38.490> this<00:05:38.760> match<00:05:38.940> feeling<00:05:39.330> that

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
came to the US this match feeling that

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.880 
came to the US this match feeling that
he<00:05:39.480> should<00:05:39.600> have<00:05:39.630> been<00:05:39.750> Savior<00:05:40.110> there<00:05:40.470> isn't<00:05:40.740> a

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
he should have been Savior there isn't a

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.560 
he should have been Savior there isn't a
decent<00:05:41.010> amount<00:05:41.250> of<00:05:41.400> money<00:05:41.460> on<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:41.820> line<00:05:42.000> but<00:05:42.540> I

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
decent amount of money on the line but I

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.300 
decent amount of money on the line but I
still<00:05:42.840> question<00:05:43.050> how<00:05:43.500> much<00:05:43.650> commitment<00:05:44.010> flash

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
still question how much commitment flash

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.190 
still question how much commitment flash
would<00:05:44.520> have<00:05:44.610> had<00:05:44.790> to<00:05:45.210> practice<00:05:45.690> for<00:05:45.870> this<00:05:45.960> for

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
would have had to practice for this for

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.670 
would have had to practice for this for
this<00:05:46.290> match<00:05:46.790> considering<00:05:47.790> that<00:05:48.500> he<00:05:49.500> would

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
this match considering that he would

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.900 
this match considering that he would
probably<00:05:49.950> be<00:05:50.040> focusing<00:05:50.190> on<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.610> maps<00:05:50.790> that

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
probably be focusing on the maps that

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.640 
probably be focusing on the maps that
would<00:05:51.030> be<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.300> new<00:05:51.450> OSL<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.080> starlings

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
would be the new OSL and starlings

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.710
