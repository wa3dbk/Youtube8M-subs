today I just want to do a little lesson
on<00:00:09.889> sea<00:00:10.889> stars<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.460> how<00:00:11.550> they<00:00:11.580> regenerate

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
on sea stars and how they regenerate

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.650 
on sea stars and how they regenerate
missing<00:00:13.200> rays<00:00:13.769> or<00:00:14.040> limbs<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.519> I've<00:00:15.269> been<00:00:15.480> down

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
missing rays or limbs so I've been down

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.960 
missing rays or limbs so I've been down
to<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.470> beach<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.980> I've<00:00:17.640> got<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> whole

to the to the beach and I've got a whole

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.849 
to the to the beach and I've got a whole
pail<00:00:18.270> here<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:19.640> northern<00:00:20.640> sea<00:00:20.880> stars<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.859> I'd

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
pail here of northern sea stars and I'd

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.029 
pail here of northern sea stars and I'd
like<00:00:23.010> people<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.490> able<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
like people to be able to see is the

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.560 
like people to be able to see is the
different<00:00:26.119> types<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:28.670> growth<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:30.000> these

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
different types of growth in these

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.420 
different types of growth in these
starfish<00:00:30.990> as<00:00:31.230> they're<00:00:31.470> regenerating<00:00:32.219> limbs

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
starfish as they're regenerating limbs

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.880 
starfish as they're regenerating limbs
so<00:00:32.669> we've<00:00:33.090> got<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> bunch<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.660> different<00:00:34.590> stars

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
so we've got a bunch of different stars

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.010 
so we've got a bunch of different stars
and<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.210> we've<00:00:36.360> got<00:00:36.390> some<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.899> are

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and you can see we've got some that are

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.459 
and you can see we've got some that are
missing<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.530> regrowing<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:38.910> two<00:00:39.090> limbs

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
missing and regrowing one or two limbs

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.310 
missing and regrowing one or two limbs
we've<00:00:40.469> got<00:00:40.680> some<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:42.200> here's<00:00:43.200> an

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
we've got some that here's an

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.990 
we've got some that here's an
interesting<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.129> one<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.460> actually<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
interesting one this one is actually I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
interesting one this one is actually I
don't<00:00:45.629> know<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.989> mutation<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.710> what

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
don't know if it's a mutation or what

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.250 
don't know if it's a mutation or what
the<00:00:47.039> situation<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.270> got<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.079> limb

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the situation is it's got one limb

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.279 
the situation is it's got one limb
that's<00:00:49.469> damaged<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.430> that's<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:51.020> ray<00:00:52.020> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that's damaged one that's a ray that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.069 
that's damaged one that's a ray that
looks<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.070> growing<00:00:53.550> two<00:00:54.390> new<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.899> buds

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
looks like growing two new little buds

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.080 
looks like growing two new little buds
there<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> bud<00:00:56.100> coming<00:00:56.969> out

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
there and then we have a bud coming out

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
there and then we have a bud coming out
of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> top<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.590> particular<00:00:58.890> arm<00:01:00.920> here's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
of the top of that particular arm here's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.369 
of the top of that particular arm here's
an<00:01:02.070> interesting<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.899> looks<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.049> he

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
an interesting one that looks like he

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
an interesting one that looks like he
there's<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> lot<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> fishing<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:05.729> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
there's a lot of fishing out here that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480 
there's a lot of fishing out here that
sometimes<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.260> think<00:01:07.320> may<00:01:07.560> damage<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> stars

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
sometimes I think may damage the stars

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
sometimes I think may damage the stars
and<00:01:08.700> that's<00:01:08.850> why<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.180> found<00:01:09.450> quite<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.049> few<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and that's why we found quite a few that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.390 
and that's why we found quite a few that
are<00:01:10.500> regenerating<00:01:12.590> is<00:01:13.590> interesting<00:01:14.220> right

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
are regenerating is interesting right

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.929 
are regenerating is interesting right
this<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.119> star<00:01:15.780> has<00:01:15.990> four<00:01:16.740> arms<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.880> don't

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this this star has four arms and I don't

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
this this star has four arms and I don't
see<00:01:18.299> any<00:01:18.450> evidence<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.110> fifth<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.530> budding

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
see any evidence of a fifth one budding

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.550 
see any evidence of a fifth one budding
but<00:01:20.130> obviously<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.210> normal<00:01:21.900> starfish<00:01:22.320> will

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
but obviously the normal starfish will

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.660 
but obviously the normal starfish will
have<00:01:22.710> five<00:01:23.810> arms<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:25.049> rays<00:01:25.520> here's<00:01:26.520> an

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
have five arms or rays here's an

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.960 
have five arms or rays here's an
interesting<00:01:26.930> large<00:01:27.930> northern<00:01:28.680> sea<00:01:28.920> star<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
interesting large northern sea star and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.300 
interesting large northern sea star and
this<00:01:30.299> guy<00:01:30.770> down<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:32.930> one<00:01:33.930> arm<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:35.189> is

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
this guy down has one arm that is

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.060 
this guy down has one arm that is
actually<00:01:35.990> in<00:01:36.990> two<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.500> regrowing<00:01:39.979> like<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
actually in two and regrowing like a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
actually in two and regrowing like a
fork<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:44.899> those<00:01:45.899> are

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
fork if you can see that there those are

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.819 
fork if you can see that there those are
obviously<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.610> variety<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.299> how<00:01:48.509> these

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
obviously a lot of variety and how these

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.039 
obviously a lot of variety and how these
sea<00:01:49.829> stars<00:01:49.860> regrow<00:01:50.759> their<00:01:51.060> their<00:01:51.780> limbs

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
sea stars regrow their their limbs

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.389 
sea stars regrow their their limbs
here's<00:01:52.380> an<00:01:52.530> interesting<00:01:52.740> ones<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:55.399> looks

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
here's an interesting ones that looks

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.690 
here's an interesting ones that looks
like<00:01:56.579> he's<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:58.070> surfer<00:01:59.070> or<00:01:59.280> something

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
like he's a surfer or something

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.800 
like he's a surfer or something
this<00:02:02.300> one<00:02:02.510> has<00:02:02.720> three<00:02:03.110> arms<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.190> not<00:02:04.729> not<00:02:05.120> or

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
this one has three arms and not not or

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.510 
this one has three arms and not not or
no<00:02:05.990> evidence<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.590> another<00:02:06.740> one<00:02:06.950> growing<00:02:07.370> yet

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
no evidence of another one growing yet

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.550 
no evidence of another one growing yet
but<00:02:07.729> takes<00:02:08.209> about<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.450> year<00:02:08.539> for<00:02:08.869> starfish<00:02:09.350> to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
but takes about a year for starfish to

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.150 
but takes about a year for starfish to
regrow<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.399> limb<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.759> its<00:02:11.140> usual<00:02:12.140> size<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:13.010> this

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
regrow a limb to its usual size so this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.550 
regrow a limb to its usual size so this
particular<00:02:13.400> guy<00:02:13.730> here<00:02:14.150> depending<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.260> how

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
particular guy here depending on how

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.040 
particular guy here depending on how
