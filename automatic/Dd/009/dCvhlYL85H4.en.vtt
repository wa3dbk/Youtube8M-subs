see<00:00:23.850> there's<00:00:24.029> obviously<00:00:24.420> gear<00:00:24.869> there's<00:00:25.340> level

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
see there's obviously gear there's level

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.400 
see there's obviously gear there's level
at<00:00:26.490> an<00:00:26.609> equivalent<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.240> levels<00:00:27.599> there's<00:00:28.320> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
at an equivalent to levels there's a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.800 
at an equivalent to levels there's a
power<00:00:28.710> scale<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> guess<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.570> didn't<00:00:30.750> know

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
power scale I guess I really didn't know

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.240 
power scale I guess I really didn't know
what<00:00:30.840> you'd<00:00:31.019> call<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.650> progress<00:00:32.009> your

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
what you'd call it but you progress your

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.680 
what you'd call it but you progress your
character<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.940> more<00:00:33.059> powerful<00:00:33.540> as

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
character do you get more powerful as

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.440 
character do you get more powerful as
you<00:00:33.840> go<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.920> top<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.309> there's<00:00:36.270> also

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
you go but on top of that there's also

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.020 
you go but on top of that there's also
skill<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.350> obviously<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:38.070> an<00:00:38.219> FPS<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
skill you know obviously it's an FPS to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
skill you know obviously it's an FPS to
their<00:00:39.149> skill<00:00:39.480> involved<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.040> it's<00:00:41.040> really

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.340 
cannon which does a ton of damage it
shoots<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.829> big<00:00:50.039> plasma<00:00:50.700> beam<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.629> if

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
shoots out this big plasma beam that if

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
shoots out this big plasma beam that if
it<00:00:52.500> direct<00:00:52.890> impacts<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> will<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> ton

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480

of damage and it also has a little bit
of<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> splash<00:00:57.149> radius<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.930> get<00:00:58.410> close<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
of a splash radius so if I get close to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.959 
of a splash radius so if I get close to
a<00:00:58.800> ting<00:00:58.949> somebody<00:00:59.280> it'll<00:00:59.489> hit<00:00:59.609> him<00:00:59.699> for<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.910> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
200 or 150 but if I hit him directly

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.310 
200 or 150 but if I hit him directly
it'll<00:01:02.460> hit<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> 400<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.170> right

here<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.739> pull<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> pretty<00:01:05.549> good<00:01:05.670> little

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
here I pull a pretty good little

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.640 
here I pull a pretty good little
flanking<00:01:06.270> maneuver<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.750> here<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
flanking maneuver right here and if I

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.399 
flanking maneuver right here and if I
made<00:01:08.010> some<00:01:08.310> better<00:01:08.460> decisions<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.409> just

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
made some better decisions and just

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200 
made some better decisions and just
stuck<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.189> my<00:01:11.430> plasma<00:01:11.700> cannon

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
stuck it out with my plasma cannon

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.219 
stuck it out with my plasma cannon
rather<00:01:12.360> than<00:01:12.479> switching<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.869> my<00:01:12.990> assault

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
rather than switching to my assault

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.770 
rather than switching to my assault
rifle<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.850> fucked<00:01:15.479> them<00:01:15.689> up

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
rifle I would have really fucked them up

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.820 
rifle I would have really fucked them up
and<00:01:15.960> anyone<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.259> played<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.530> game

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and anyone that's played this game

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.859 
and anyone that's played this game
realizes<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:17.790> much<00:01:17.909> damage<00:01:18.150> I'm<00:01:18.420> doing<00:01:18.689> right

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
realizes how much damage I'm doing right

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
realizes how much damage I'm doing right
here<00:01:18.900> I'm<00:01:19.140> getting<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.500> 400<00:01:20.070> splashes<00:01:20.580> on

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
here I'm getting like 400 splashes on

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.090 
here I'm getting like 400 splashes on
three<00:01:21.030> people<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.990> tearing<00:01:22.320> them<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.950> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
three people just tearing them up if I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.140 
three people just tearing them up if I
was<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.610> better<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.030> game

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
was a little bit better at this game

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
was a little bit better at this game
this<00:01:24.840> would<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.110> been<00:01:25.140> an<00:01:25.350> incredible<00:01:26.340> clip

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
this would have been an incredible clip

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.219 
this would have been an incredible clip
because<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.850> could<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.090> easily<00:01:27.390> taken<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.080> all

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
because I could have easily taken on all

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.840 
because I could have easily taken on all
those<00:01:28.350> guys<00:01:28.590> my<00:01:28.890> aim<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.369> point<00:01:29.579> but

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
those guys my aim was on point but

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
those guys my aim was on point but
unfortunately<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> missed<00:01:30.930> way<00:01:31.140> too<00:01:31.170> many

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
unfortunately I missed way too many

right here and the way this game works
is<00:02:33.920> it's<00:02:34.100> kind<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:34.430> Gears<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.790> War<00:02:34.910> you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
is it's kind of like Gears of War you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.600 
is it's kind of like Gears of War you
have<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> downstate<00:02:36.410> definitely<00:02:37.190> not<00:02:37.280> i<00:02:37.310> go

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
have a downstate definitely not i go

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.280 
have a downstate definitely not i go
worse<00:02:37.790> tues<00:02:38.060> downstate<00:02:38.630> when<00:02:39.050> you're<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
worse tues downstate when you're the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.570 
worse tues downstate when you're the
downstate<00:02:39.770> ninety<00:02:40.100> percent<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.490> time

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
downstate ninety percent of the time

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.070 
downstate ninety percent of the time
you're<00:02:40.760> gonna<00:02:40.850> die<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:41.180> there's<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.990> know

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
you're gonna die but there's a you know

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.300 
you're gonna die but there's a you know
there's<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.320> chance<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.680> someone<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.160> pick

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
there's a chance that someone can pick

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.760 
there's a chance that someone can pick
you<00:02:43.490> up<00:02:43.550> most<00:02:44.270> likely<00:02:44.510> you're<00:02:44.900> gonna<00:02:45.020> die<00:02:45.410> and

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
you up most likely you're gonna die and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.850 
you up most likely you're gonna die and
you<00:02:46.520> can't<00:02:46.820> fight<00:02:47.270> back<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.110> can't<00:02:48.440> be

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
you can't fight back and you can't be

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.500 
you can't fight back and you can't be
recovered<00:02:49.340> out<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.670> downstate<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.300> just

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
recovered out of the downstate you just

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.890 
recovered out of the downstate you just
die<00:02:50.990> so<00:02:51.770> basically<00:02:52.160> when<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:52.880> when<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.390> get

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
die so basically when you when you get

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.210 
die so basically when you when you get
put<00:02:54.140> into<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.350> downstate<00:02:54.770> you<00:02:54.920> have<00:02:55.040> 10

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
put into the downstate you have 10

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.070 
put into the downstate you have 10
seconds<00:02:55.580> for<00:02:55.730> someone<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.030> pick<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.330> up<00:02:56.390> if<00:02:56.690> no

don't know I kind of I kind of didn't

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.750 
don't know I kind of I kind of didn't
like<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.860> maybe<00:03:22.010> it's<00:03:22.190> just<00:03:22.220> not<00:03:22.400> my<00:03:22.520> play

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
like it maybe it's just not my play

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.850 
like it maybe it's just not my play
style<00:03:23.000> it's<00:03:23.300> it's<00:03:23.480> very<00:03:23.720> tanky<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.440> can<00:03:24.650> take

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
style it's it's very tanky you can take

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.990 
style it's it's very tanky you can take
a<00:03:24.890> lot<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.100> damage<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.490> have<00:03:25.580> this<00:03:25.730> big

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
a lot of damage you have this big

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.030 
a lot of damage you have this big
Gatling<00:03:26.959> gun<00:03:27.140> thing<00:03:27.440> it's<00:03:27.620> kind<00:03:27.770> of<00:03:27.800> like<00:03:27.890> the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
Gatling gun thing it's kind of like the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.650 
Gatling gun thing it's kind of like the
heavy<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.400> TSU<00:03:28.670> which<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:29.060> also<00:03:29.240> didn't<00:03:29.630> like

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
heavy and TSU which I also didn't like

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.080 
heavy and TSU which I also didn't like
so<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.890> guess<00:03:31.100> it's<00:03:31.130> just<00:03:31.340> that's<00:03:31.610> just<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.940> play

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
so I guess it's just that's just a play

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.340 
so I guess it's just that's just a play
style<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.540> don't<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.050> you're<00:03:33.170> kind

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
style that I don't like but you're kind

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.000 
style that I don't like but you're kind
of<00:03:33.410> slower<00:03:33.890> more<00:03:34.280> slumbering<00:03:34.850> um<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:36.010> guess

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
of slower more slumbering um I guess

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.210 
of slower more slumbering um I guess
class<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.680> can<00:03:39.800> do<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.010> can<00:03:40.040> do<00:03:40.190> a

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
class and you you can do you can do a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.770
