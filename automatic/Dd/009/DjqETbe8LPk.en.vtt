00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.900
 you with one of the heirs of this 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.119
 dynasty of merchants and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.060
 collectors sir elina fashion 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.059
 story will begin at the end of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.290
 50s and early 60s 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.649
 because at that time my father and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 his brother is would david live in 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.530
 Milan where it was a place really 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.090
 extraordinary it is an art capital 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.730
 modern and contemporary 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.879
 there were almost a hundred 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.550
 highly respected galleries in Italy 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.600
 they unfortunately had the problem 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.280
 that their older brother had lost all his 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.430
 money 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.670
 and unfortunately he had to sell his 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.580
 house moved his parents they have 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.890
 had to sell their art collections but 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.960
 fortunately that at the same time as that 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.549
 they discovered a trade by selling 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.490
 the collection of their older brother 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.080
 they wanted to restore this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.450
 collection that they had been forced to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.710
 sell and milan was the perfect place and 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.290
 they worked a lot they did 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.240
 ddd as they say they did some 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.369
 friendships relationships with the most 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.270
 large modern galleries of paris 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.159
 especially the picasso gallery which 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.079
 was called the gallery louise the risks 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.759
 which belonged to daniel henry 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.259
 kahnweiler and thanks to his relationships and 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.299
 for example also with the foundation 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.210
 maeght that was wrong that you have the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.049
 gallery maeght of course in paris they have 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.610
 they restored by doing their 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.739
 craft of art they tried to 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.450
 restore their collections they have 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.510
 always had the mentality 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.379
 of art lovers and that's why 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.379
 indeed even early enough they have 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.690
 started buying paintings 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:29.550
 extraordinary who wanted to keep and he 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.660
 buy them without having any idea of 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.950
 how was he going to pay them how 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.459
 and where he was going to sell 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.030
 they were really merchants and 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.790
 collectors 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.000
 today obviously it's picasso who 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:50.190
 is the central pillar of the collection 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.720
 since picasso and the capital of the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.610
 world of modern art picasso at 1 a 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.880
 so much created so evolved and that 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.579
 no artists of the twentieth century could 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.680
 escape from his influence 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.900
 picasso's philosophy of looking at 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.920
 in depth and give especially 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.150
 a lot of love to his job a lot 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:24.950
 of intelligence a lot of energy and 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.500
 dedicate 100% to something that's 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.430
 this has certainly influenced our 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.560
 work ethic 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.609
 what will be the major works that 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.150
 you will present to the public 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.850
 Monegasque there are of course the works 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.799
 very famous as by the water in 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.840
 harlequin the son of picasso 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.420
 there are the women of Algiers who is a 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.400
 series of fifteen paintings that picasso 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.730
 had wished to sell a single 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.950
 collectors and this is a series that 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.489
 is based on 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.370
 it's a tribute to matisse actually and 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.079
 it's a pity too of the cross 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.730
 is called the women of Algeria and we 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.810
 you present three paintings of this 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.440
 series and then of course the lunches on 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.180
 grass that are tributes to Manet 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.019
 sending a series it's like 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:20.820
 saw a movie and we saw how the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.870
 objects are metamorphosing between a 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.960
 chart and the other and how the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.020
 the thought of the artist evolves on seeing 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.880
 a painting alone is very 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.030
 different than seeing the table that has 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.660
 was painted the same day in the morning and 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.400
 the afternoon 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.650
 physically has never seen them together 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.340
 like that since we do not have the 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.620
 place like at the museum and it's going to be 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.350
 very interesting to see the reports 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.680
 between the tables the dialogues the 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.740
 comparisons and public reactions 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.310
 that's the first thing and it's very 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.020
 different than seeing them one by one in 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.800
 a city ​​in another city in a 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.780
 exposure 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.680
 I think it's really going to be like 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.220
 a summary of almost 50 years of work 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.640
 from my family and then of course I am 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.080
 very very proud for my father and his 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:22.380
 brother to see this exhibition as a 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.410
 kind of claim their work 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.690
 of their passion for their love for art 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.220
 this consecration finally is a 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.290
 beautiful gift that makes you the principality 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.420
 of Monaco and its more that makes us 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.860
 pleasure since my family from Monaco 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:40.500
 for almost 50 years and she always 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.990
 wanted to do something there for 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.350
 show our instant appreciation 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:50.210
 extraordinary rights very rich in 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.880
 characters in intelligence and 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.290
 quality of person and so we 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.590
 will want to continue working with 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.380
 monaco especially that monaco has enormously 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.870
 artistic links with the most 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.630
 great artists of the twentieth century and for 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:13.430
 that this exhibition come from 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.430
 share to crown all that is magic
