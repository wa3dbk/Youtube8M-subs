 television a few moments ago 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.310

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.679
 from the civil protection system to 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.150
 federal level headed by the owner 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.189

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.130
 alcohol intel and also by luis felipe 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.630
 bridge that is the general coordinator of 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.000
 civil protection of the secretariat of 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.130
 government that have reported on this 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.840
 they indicate edil that has impacted the 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.329
 Baja California Peninsula Its On 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.230
 point out that there is a 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.899
 connected by air sea and land 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.079
 cases that is to say San Jose Cape and Cape 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.269
 San Lucas in Baja California Sur Account 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.940
 the impact of Hurricane or that I have 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.640
 with category 3 in this southern low area 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.480
 california from a california city ​​that 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.210
 this part is kept incommunicado and 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.000
 well there are 30,000 tourists 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.100
 found in hotels that 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.770
 they were shelters for 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.720
 you can wait for this step of the hurricane that 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.090
 has already decreased intensity is found 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.009
 order in category 1 is in 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.520
 this moment in the central part of low 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.560
 Southern California in a mountainous area 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.950
 they have also reported that the airport 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.759
 of the changes is extremely 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.350
 damaged is there is no possibility for 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.810
 the takeoff and arrival of aircraft 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.909
 no affectations in commercial 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.979
 tracks and in the control tower of 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.960
 los cabos airport there are other 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.880
 affects in this in communication and 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.909
 in san jose del cabo and cabo san lucas 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.700
 because there is no electric power there is no 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.940
 telephony there are not either fell the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.800
 cell phone antennas and not 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.350
 have electricity there is a problem in 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.539
 this moment of drinking water is to say 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.360
 the water treatment plants can not 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.880
 can make water drinkable there in the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.799
 population ends so already 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.990
 is working with the federal commission 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.539
 of electricity so that you can 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.549
 establish electrical power over 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.650
 all in neuralgic points like 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.970
 hospitals like 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.820
 water treatment that is the scheme 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.070
 affect on changes and has happened in 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.840
 this moment the worst there are also strong 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.280
 affectations in peace also with 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.340
 power supply problems 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.550
 electric but what they have reported is 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.190
 that bill will now enter the sea of 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.500
 Cortez in the Gulf of California and there 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.300
 will lose strength will perhaps become 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.260
 tropical depression in tropical storm 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.580
 and it will go to its place but in 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.830
 sound according to what we 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.050
 they commented a felipe bridge and david 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.480
 korenfeld the affectation will not be so 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.220
 strong will be basically rainy and 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.920
 this will be in the next days already 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.110
 mid late this week and 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.420
 David also with him pointed out that a 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.810
 low pressure system is located at 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.760
 south of acapulco in the pacific ocean 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.770
 it will be taking force and there 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.860
 odds that it can become 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.840
 in the next five days on plates in 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.550
 the peaceful ocean and that too 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.770
 possibly follows a path 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.740
 parallel to the Pacific coast 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.520
 Mexican also with address 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.550
 toward 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.140
 the north towards baja california then 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.180
 would come out we are talking about a 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.130
 delicate situation particularly in 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.890
 San Jose Cabo and Cabo San Lucas 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.290
 there is no transit through the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.120
 roads because then you have to 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.340
 point out that the road that reaches the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.710
 cars comes from the north from low 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.140
 california and it's in that part where 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.870
 continue the impacts of the hurricane bill 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.150
 also point out that perhaps a 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.130
 airlift in the next hours a 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.920
 Once the situation can be improved 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.890
 from los cabos airport to take 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.990
 help from tijuana from the airport 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.420
 from tijuana to the fields and from the 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.520
 Mazatlan airport to the fields 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.290
 and another important issue that Luis reported 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.140
 felipe puente the general coordinator of 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.060
 civil protection is that airplanes 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.360
 the air force that tomorrow they were going to 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.130
 participate in the parade in the air 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.860
 furrowing the air of the city of mexico 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.170
 those planes are not going to participate 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.180
 air force will be used to 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.020
 make an airlift 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.440
 towards the streets to bring help for 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.780
 also carry food items from 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.210
 medicine and especially also to take out 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.199
 to the 30,000 tourists of which 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.780
 26,000 are foreigners and 4,000 nationals 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.180
 to take them to other areas so that 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.620
 can return to their destinations to large 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.900
 traits this is what has been reported 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.960
 about the impact of hurricane bill 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.600
 andrián in the capes and in the low part 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.400
 california south andrea as it expanded the 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.410
 panorama with the panorama that paints us 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.380
 sector 30,000 tourists the most 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.360
 foreigners and some national failures 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.160
 of electric power in peace with both 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.020
 the ends and good in general a 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.729
 situation still delicate but as well 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.130
 you mention the worst happened of course 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.509
 that we are going to continue what is pending and about 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.330
 everything will interest us to know when 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.009
 these tourists begin to return as 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.320
 to their homes we hope they can 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.000
 then climb maybe 16 17 already being 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.490
 in their houses sector we are still pending 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.800
 the information you can provide 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.660
 expand has a last point they told us 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.449
 that there are no reports of people 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.610
 deceased by the impact of the hurricane 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:31.699
 prevailed the most important thing that is 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.819
 people save lives equals 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.129
 the nature shelters of the capes are 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.610
 enabled as shelters and the report 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.919
 official 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.990
 there are no dead people new people 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.659
 deceased by this passage of the hurricane 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.999
 bill in baja california blue and is what 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.830
 I had to inform Andrea and I 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.809
 We really appreciate that white balance is 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.219
 something very important thank you hector 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:55.950
 figueroa we have an excellent afternoon 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:58.170
 we also continue to see 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:02.000
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.000
 information with the following videos
