the<00:00:57.690> conclusion<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.230> at<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> moment<00:00:58.949> there

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the conclusion that at the moment there

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.490 
the conclusion that at the moment there
are<00:00:59.460> probably<00:00:59.969> enough<00:01:00.300> puzzles<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.989> fill<00:01:01.289> out

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
are probably enough puzzles to fill out

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.520 
are probably enough puzzles to fill out
it<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:01.829> either<00:01:02.010> five<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:02.840> six<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> atriums

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it was either five or six of the atriums

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.039 
it was either five or six of the atriums
and<00:01:04.790> one<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> admins<00:01:06.210> suggested<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.990> for

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and one of the admins suggested that for

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.620 
and one of the admins suggested that for
the<00:01:07.320> remainder<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.979> actually<00:01:08.400> holds<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.970> puzzle

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the remainder we actually holds a puzzle

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.890 
the remainder we actually holds a puzzle
contest<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.260> building<00:01:10.740> puzzle<00:01:11.400> building

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
contest a building puzzle building

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.390 
contest a building puzzle building
contest<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.530> thought<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.070> would<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.220> an

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
contest and I thought that would be an

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.670 
contest and I thought that would be an
awesome<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.689> some<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.200> involved

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
awesome way to get some of you involved

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.740 
awesome way to get some of you involved
who<00:01:16.830> might<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:18.360> creation

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
who might like to have your creation

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
who might like to have your creation
showcased<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.710> map<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.729> it's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
showcased in the map so the way it's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
showcased in the map so the way it's
gonna<00:01:20.970> work<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.290> built

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
gonna work is if you have built

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
gonna work is if you have built
something<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> past<00:01:23.340> or<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.360> like

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
something in the past or you would like

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.179 
something in the past or you would like
to<00:01:24.750> build<00:01:24.900> something<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.890> think

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to build something now that you think

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
to build something now that you think
would<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.490> cool<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.210> included<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
would be cool to have included in the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.770 
would be cool to have included in the
map<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:29.009> ahead<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.280> record<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.939> upload<00:01:30.479> it
