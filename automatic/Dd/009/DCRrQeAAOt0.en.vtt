00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.840 
possible their sport is as close to 100%
anaerobic<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.860> any<00:00:47.820> sport<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
anaerobic as any sport can be and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.180 
anaerobic as any sport can be and
they're<00:00:50.850> working<00:00:51.170> totally<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.410> an<00:00:52.559> anaerobic

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
they're working totally in an anaerobic

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.049 
they're working totally in an anaerobic
phase<00:00:53.699> while<00:00:54.180> they<00:00:54.390> run<00:00:54.600> 100<00:00:55.050> meters<00:00:56.059> what

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
phase while they run 100 meters what

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.150 
phase while they run 100 meters what
this<00:00:57.270> means<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:57.930> they're<00:00:58.859> using<00:00:59.489> almost

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
this means is that they're using almost

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.850 
this means is that they're using almost
exclusively<00:01:02.160> sugar<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.300> fuel<00:01:03.750> during<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
exclusively sugar for fuel during that

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.600 
exclusively sugar for fuel during that
period<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.280> time<00:01:05.930> up<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.229> almost<00:01:07.409> 200<00:01:07.950> meters

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
period of time up to almost 200 meters

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.390 
period of time up to almost 200 meters
or<00:01:08.820> somewhere<00:01:09.390> around<00:01:09.600> 200<00:01:10.320> meters<00:01:10.650> they're

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
or somewhere around 200 meters they're

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.219 
or somewhere around 200 meters they're
using<00:01:11.970> exclusively<00:01:13.460> sugar<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:15.240> fuel<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.140> they

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
using exclusively sugar for fuel so they

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.530 
using exclusively sugar for fuel so they
want<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.590> sugar<00:01:16.909> available<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.270> their

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
want to have sugar available in their

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
want to have sugar available in their
muscles<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.470> load<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:20.040> their

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
muscles the more they load up their

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.469 
muscles the more they load up their
muscles<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.780> sugar<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.310> max<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.270> better

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
muscles with sugar to the max the better

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.170 
muscles with sugar to the max the better
they're<00:01:24.720> gonna<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.500> course<00:01:26.030> fruit<00:01:27.030> is

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
they're gonna do and of course fruit is

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.510 
they're gonna do and of course fruit is
a<00:01:27.210> great<00:01:27.360> source<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.810> sugar<00:01:27.990> an<00:01:28.520> easily

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a great source of sugar an easily

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.460 
a great source of sugar an easily
digestible<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.439> symbol<00:01:32.130> source<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.090> sugar

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
digestible and a symbol source of sugar

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.890 
digestible and a symbol source of sugar
so<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.740> sprinters<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.299> best<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.810> the
