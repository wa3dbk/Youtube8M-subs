races<00:00:19.230> they've<00:00:20.220> worked<00:00:20.490> well<00:00:20.760> together<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.449> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
races they've worked well together and I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.689 
races they've worked well together and I
think<00:00:21.570> that's<00:00:21.869> an<00:00:21.990> asset<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.740> team<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.250> we

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
think that's an asset to the team so we

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.519 
think that's an asset to the team so we
don't<00:00:23.910> envy<00:00:24.300> any<00:00:24.779> other<00:00:24.990> teams<00:00:25.199> driver

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
very intelligent drivers and i think for

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
very intelligent drivers and i think for
the<00:00:49.710> engineers<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.520> whole<00:00:50.640> team<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.149> have

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the engineers for the whole team to have

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.779 
the engineers for the whole team to have
the<00:00:51.840> benefit<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> their<00:00:52.410> input<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.550> them

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the benefit of their input to have them

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.209 
the benefit of their input to have them
being<00:00:54.210> involved<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.899> enthusiastic<00:00:55.559> about<00:00:55.920> the

really have a passion and enthusiasm for

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.700 
really have a passion and enthusiasm for
what<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.210> car<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
what this car is and for the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010 
what this car is and for the
championship<00:01:05.129> ahead<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.390> both<00:01:06.600> believe

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
championship ahead so they both believe

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.399

moving from twenty ten to twenty eleven

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.790 
moving from twenty ten to twenty eleven
the<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.580> double<00:01:16.850> diffusers<00:01:17.480> were<00:01:18.380> removed

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
the the double diffusers were removed

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.950 
the the double diffusers were removed

and a lot of constraints were placed on

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.200 
and a lot of constraints were placed on
the<00:01:21.110> cars<00:01:21.350> with<00:01:22.040> regard<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.550> their<00:01:22.850> rear

slow them up because year-on-year the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
designers working hard make them quicker

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.640 
designers working hard make them quicker
and<00:01:32.090> quicker<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.140> that's<00:01:33.380> been<00:01:33.590> very

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
and quicker so that's been very

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.120

the carbon footprint to undertake to

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.960 
the carbon footprint to undertake to
continue<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.590> review<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.130> monitor<00:03:12.520> and

reduce<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:14.110> carbon<00:03:14.530> footprint<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.010> think

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
reduce that carbon footprint I think

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.800 
reduce that carbon footprint I think
that's<00:03:15.400> important<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.030> think<00:03:16.090> we've<00:03:16.390> got<00:03:16.630> to

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
that's important I think we've got to

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.830 
that's important I think we've got to
demonstrate<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:18.430> we<00:03:18.880> mean<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.180> do<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.510> and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
demonstrate that we mean to do that and

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.680 
demonstrate that we mean to do that and
we<00:03:19.900> mean<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.140> do<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.350> very<00:03:20.470> seriously
