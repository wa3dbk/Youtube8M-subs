00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.910
 People decided to do some tests here. 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.950

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.700
 recipes that are good friends 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.650

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.910

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.680

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.940

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.780

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.210

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.250
 soon gained fame of weight loss 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.660
 data on the composition of the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.370
 fruit are not yet fully 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.530
 defined 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.120
 however, research indicates that ingestion 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.800
 fat and brings energy benefits 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 and antioxidants in the body 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.010
 Let's start by making granola pasta 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.049
 of the pie 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.970
 for this you will have to if they are 200 degrees 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.400
 with flour and butter 1 in two ways 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.640
 with 10 cm in diameter that bottom 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.640
 removable 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.670
 take a medium bowl and the crescent 6 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.979
 tablespoons of granola place 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.649
 half a cup of natural honey and a 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.649
 tablespoon unsalted butter 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.649
 softened 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 mix well was the bottoms of the molds 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.890
 with the mixture 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.600
 then put everything in a form 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.770
 large and baked preheated by 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.770
 about 15 minutes 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.450
 Remove from the oven and let cool 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.640
 you must remove ours from the phone 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.530
 when the edges are golden 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.080
 You'll realize they're still going. 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.540
 be a little soft on the inside so 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.650
 you should let them cool very well 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.870
 to be crispy and crispy with 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:29.620
 care and make the pasta 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:31.780
 on a plate full 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.520
 each door with a 90-gram pot of 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.200
 Greek yogurt and a dessert spoon 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.200
 of the Iberian Gojra of Christmas 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.810
 if you want to finalize with mint 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.810
 enjoy your food 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.760
 It's interesting to start the little tart 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.740
 while it is very cold 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.730
 if you want to refrigerate until the 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.360
 time to serve 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.980
 I recommend leaving at the maximum for 12 hours 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.690
 before I decide I want to give a quick 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.890

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.180
 pineapple and apricot strawberry 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.350
 in addition they should have been light 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.560
