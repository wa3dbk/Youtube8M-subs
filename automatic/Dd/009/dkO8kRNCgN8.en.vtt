00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the playlist just seemed to kind of go

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.389 
the playlist just seemed to kind of go
downhill<00:01:48.840> i<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.409> had<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.560> race<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
downhill i think we had like race and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.850 
downhill i think we had like race and
some<00:01:51.030> other<00:01:51.210> kind<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.540> weird<00:01:51.780> game<00:01:52.170> types<00:01:52.470> or

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
some other kind of weird game types or

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.200 
some other kind of weird game types or
playlists<00:01:53.310> after<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> think<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.090> like

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
playlists after that I think was like

playlists after that I think was like
big<00:01:54.420> team<00:01:54.600> rumble<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.560> something<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.979> i

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

and if you get an assassination without
that<00:04:28.810> radar<00:04:29.320> being<00:04:29.560> on<00:04:29.680> there<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.070> should<00:04:30.220> be

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
that radar being on there that should be

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.510 
that radar being on there that should be
pretty<00:04:30.580> easy<00:04:30.880> or<00:04:31.750> easier<00:04:32.140> than<00:04:32.830> normal<00:04:33.190> then

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
pretty easy or easier than normal then

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.280 
pretty easy or easier than normal then
you're<00:04:33.610> going<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:33.760> get<00:04:33.850> 30<00:04:34.270> points<00:04:34.750> or<00:04:34.930> what

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
you're going to get 30 points or what

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.570 
you're going to get 30 points or what
they<00:04:35.380> say<00:04:35.530> is<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.650> equivalent<00:04:35.860> of<00:04:36.190> three

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
they say is the equivalent of three

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.300 
they say is the equivalent of three
kills<00:04:36.940> so<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.260> way<00:04:38.410> this<00:04:38.560> works<00:04:38.620> is<00:04:38.980> it's<00:04:39.190> I

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
kills so the way this works is it's I

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.340 
kills so the way this works is it's I
reminds<00:04:39.910> me<00:04:40.060> honestly<00:04:40.390> a<00:04:40.480> lot<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.780> juggernauts

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
reminds me honestly a lot of juggernauts

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.990 
reminds me honestly a lot of juggernauts
except<00:04:41.890> everybody<00:04:42.250> has<00:04:42.430> their<00:04:42.580> chance<00:04:42.790> to<00:04:42.910> be

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
except everybody has their chance to be

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.080 
except everybody has their chance to be
juggernauts<00:04:43.480> in<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> same<00:04:44.169> time<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.760> what<00:04:46.060> I

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090
