00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:08.670
Windy sounds...

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.500
Hello everyone, this is Tri again

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.880
and this tutorial, I would show you guys how to make the Classic Blue Jay

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.360
If you like this paper airplane, please give me credit for making this one.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.400
Unfold the paper, and now I can start from the top edge fold it to this edge.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.580
I repeat the same step for the other side.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.820
I turn the paper over

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.040
Start from this edge. I meant this crease to this crease

00:01:22.774 --> 00:01:26.254
and use this edge as your reference.

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:29.414
and you can see the center point here. It will help you fold down.

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:33.314
I fold it a little bit far for now.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.540
Then unfold the paper 

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:40.351
Turn it this way! start from this crease fold it to this crease.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.920
Start from the top here. Just fold it down.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.440
It is SO easy, right?

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.900
Next step, just as folding the Swallow. I start from this point, juts fold it straight up.

00:01:58.093 --> 00:02:00.973
Then, I repeat the same step for this sisde.

00:02:03.814 --> 00:02:07.894
Then, I just start from this edge fold it to this edge.

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:15.374
Then, I repeat the same step for the other side.

00:02:20.537 --> 00:02:21.897
Same thing for here

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.740
Then we create the beak of the bird

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.240
Same thing here

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.500
Then, Ifold it down

00:02:48.874 --> 00:02:50.874
It looks just like the Swallow

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:55.774
And next step, I will turn the paper over and fold this paert down.

00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:59.834
and here you go! You almost have the Swallow, right?

00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:05.405
However, I will tweak it a little bit by folding this part down.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.500
make it like this and same thing here... down a little bit

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.580
I fold it like this

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.780
so. I'm going to make the Blue Jay Fighter, not just the Blue Jay. :)

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.580
and here you can see, we have a really weird part.

00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:37.861
like the engine of the plane. Then, I fold the paper in half.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.800
Then, now, I can start from the top here.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.700
I start from there, and just fold it down.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.660
and make sure that this, this side

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.180
the distance from here to here is longer than the this

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:02.394
so, this is about 1in , and this is about 1.5in

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.480
and repeat the same thing for this side.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.780
I call it a Classic Blue jay. You can consider it a new plane

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.660
Here you go. After you have done all the steps. You can create the stabilizers 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.220
to make the planes flies better.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.460
I just fold this part like this. Same thing here. It is about 1/2 in

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.440
Just fold it like this

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.620
Then, unfold the stabilizers 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.496
Then, you have a shape of the plane like this.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.260
You can see the shape of the plane. 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.654
Then, take a look at this

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.700
This is a very important part of the palne

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.300
it is like the stabilizer and also like the wing

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:02.400
This is a unique paper airplane that I just made, and I call it the Classic Blue jay

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.700
because it is designed based on the Swallow 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.520
I hope you guys will enjoy making it

00:05:07.581 --> 00:05:12.301
and test it out. If it flies well for you, like the video, 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.200
share it with your friends and give credit to me if you link it somewhere else.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.820
and finally thank you for watching.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.820
