00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.210
 so that such friends from the leisure corner 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.070
 and something else again be behind friend 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.680
 I already have the fabulous stadium 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.350
 ninja turtle game in time 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.470
 it was the last videogame that they took 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.840
 for arcades and this video game in 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.210
 special was the best adaptation of the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.700
 super nintendo console for your 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.130
 emulation once downloaded to the 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.649
 we will have this icon of the turtles 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.079
 ninja we will simply give double integer 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.640
 click and start your emulation we give enter 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.440
 Double click 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.440
 as you can see here is the video game 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.490
 the song really is bad to me in what 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.180
 staff I do not like the video game is 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.700
 very good at least for those then and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.650
 we'll start with the tab button 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.190
 we will find without general equipment inside 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.460
 where can we configure 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.380
 because the buttons say why 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.030
 will always give us the control button 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.950
 general to play and the truth is 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.080
 too 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.270
 annoying because you can not play well 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.560
 but now we will configure it we will begin 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.120
 in this game 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.260
 one 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.490
 we give a button to a button 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.920
 while a love 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.479
 and so he has is the second player 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.830
 well here configured with the buttons 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.130
 or if you have a usb control of either 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.820
 play of nest or xbox we can 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.820
 set up here 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.820
 and when we start 15 credits 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.159
 and with the number one we will start playing 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.429
 one 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.569
 we will arrive at leonardo here we have the 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.569
 Portuguese select 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.370
 and it started to be habitual 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.340
 as you can see the animation has been 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.030
 improved a little bit has a bit more of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.940
 sprites 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.700
 the game mode similar to its predecessor 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.480
 those all the ancestors 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.690
 but how do they all explode and 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.799
 either a little better to graphic engine 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.650
 they added new movements that if 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:46.030
 you leave pressed forward will run 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.709
 account risks that is not clear 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.090
 I am have that movement you finish 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.090
 to see where they are shot 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.140
 and they have others more 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.980
 the only thing that I did not like about all the 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.550
 versions that stick fast because nothing 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.550
 more will give a blow 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.630
 so you have to do it the most 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.630
 calculated that you can 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.740
 and it's a little harder to get them out 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.620
 the blow that we had before 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.739
 is an actor 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.690
 the jump and the blow 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.400
 and here we are with the enemy 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.300
 in music he did not remember the name of 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.300
 baxter doctor 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.250
 and good guys this is all as you 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.410
 I say is one of the best series of 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.660
 Ninja Turtles 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.540

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.400

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.079
