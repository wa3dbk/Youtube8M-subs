00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.179
 [Music] 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:17.190
 like to say something that are not those 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.880
 photos I would not put any will not matter 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.800
 realistic targets what I do want 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.510
 tell you support the boys as well or 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.220
 be a record amount and we show it to you 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.220
 in our as the step by step look 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.400
 my name is Mariano June and today I show you 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.370
 how to make a portrait 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.880
 we need a cardboard box that 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.300
 let's cut out a square and think a 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.960
 design it occurred to me to make a fish 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.840
 banana that is a parrot fish ready and 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.840
 palsson with a big banana smile 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.530
 let's make the space where it will go 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.050
 stuck the photo 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.340
 Well , we have the motive ready now 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.820
 what we have to do is cut it 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.700
 for that we need a typical 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 we cut by the edge 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.430
 [Music] 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.670
 now that we have the little fish 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.500
 clipped we need a bit of 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.650
 clay 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.370
 and a sharp pencil we put the plasticine 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 under the cardboard and the pencil to make 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.620
 the hole now if we go to cut 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.700
 [Music] 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.040
 is already trimmed 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.500
 Now let's choose the color I chose 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.850
 the yellow color 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.990
 then we take a brush and we're going 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.060
 coloring the cardboard once it 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.120
 we paint it, let it dry and then there 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.910
 When it dries, we pass the 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.420
 bookmark now that it is already dry we are going to 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.420
 draw it 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.290
 and finally we have to paste the photo in 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.539
 the picture frame we turn the 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:14.440
 export portrait we put a little bit of 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.440
 the tail and we proceed to stick things 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.300
 to make the closeup I had to 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.760
 draw then trim paint and 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.020
 then highlight and finally paste the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.660
 Photo 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.320
 this is how we get the photo frame 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.320
 of the banana tea
