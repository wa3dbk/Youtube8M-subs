all<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> Borderlands<00:00:56.820> 2<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.750> game

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
all of Borderlands 2 is in this game

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.069 
all of Borderlands 2 is in this game
which<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> impressive<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:00.930> big

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
which is impressive it's a really big

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.420 
which is impressive it's a really big
game<00:01:02.390> but<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.100> gotten<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
game but it's it's it's it's gotten a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.969 
game but it's it's it's it's gotten a
pretty<00:01:05.610> significant<00:01:06.240> downgrade<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:07.590> terms<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
pretty significant downgrade in terms of

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.330 
pretty significant downgrade in terms of
graphics<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> playability<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.070> don't

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
graphics and playability that I don't

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.950 
graphics and playability that I don't
love<00:01:11.600> it's<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.900> kind<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.430> maybe<00:01:14.840> just<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
love it's it's kind of maybe just a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.050 
love it's it's kind of maybe just a
symptom<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.530> issue<00:01:16.890> which<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
symptom of the issue which is that this

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.300 
symptom of the issue which is that this
game<00:01:18.270> came<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> couple<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.470> years<00:01:19.619> ago<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
game came out a couple of years ago and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.210 
game came out a couple of years ago and
we've<00:01:20.880> probably<00:01:21.540> already<00:01:22.350> played<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.979> or<00:01:23.130> at

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
we've probably already played it or at

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
we've probably already played it or at
least<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.790> people<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.270> I'm<00:01:25.049> imagining

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
least a lot of people have I'm imagining

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.440 
least a lot of people have I'm imagining
that<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> audience<00:01:26.369> for<00:01:26.610> Borderlands<00:01:26.909> 2<00:01:27.090> on

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that the audience for Borderlands 2 on

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.810 
that the audience for Borderlands 2 on
Vita<00:01:27.659> who's<00:01:27.840> never<00:01:28.170> played<00:01:28.380> Borderlands<00:01:29.009> 2<00:01:29.070> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
Vita who's never played Borderlands 2 is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.219 
Vita who's never played Borderlands 2 is
probably<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.329> pretty<00:01:30.450> small<00:01:30.780> percentage<00:01:30.900> of

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
probably a pretty small percentage of

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
probably a pretty small percentage of
people<00:01:31.290> who<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
people who want to be this so if you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760 
people who want to be this so if you
never<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.450> played<00:01:33.689> Borderlands<00:01:34.170> 2<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.650> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
never have played Borderlands 2 and you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
never have played Borderlands 2 and you
only<00:01:34.950> own<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> Vita<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:35.790> pretty<00:01:36.060> cool<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
only own a Vita that's pretty cool you

which i think is easily the sort of best
version<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.840> looks<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:04.320> good<00:02:04.619> and

there<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.430> just<00:03:29.459> kind<00:03:29.849> of<00:03:29.940> freezes<00:03:30.690> up<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.200> a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
there it just kind of freezes up and a

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.250 
there it just kind of freezes up and a
lot<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.370> things<00:03:32.609> are<00:03:32.760> kind<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.030> kind<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.019> buggy

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
lot of things are kind of kind of buggy

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.110 
lot of things are kind of kind of buggy
or<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.799> not<00:03:35.130> buggy<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.489> guess<00:03:35.700> it's<00:03:35.910> kind<00:03:36.060> of

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
or just not buggy I guess it's kind of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.140 
or just not buggy I guess it's kind of
laggy<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.780> if<00:03:37.680> we<00:03:37.799> get<00:03:37.980> out<00:03:38.099> here<00:03:38.400> like<00:03:38.700> we'll

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
laggy so if we get out here like we'll

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.520 
laggy so if we get out here like we'll
have<00:03:39.299> gage<00:03:39.540> go<00:03:39.750> into<00:03:39.959> our<00:03:40.079> inventory<00:03:40.819> and<00:03:42.530> it

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
have gage go into our inventory and it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.800 
have gage go into our inventory and it
just<00:03:43.739> takes<00:03:44.099> a<00:03:44.250> while<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.430> load<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.269> then<00:03:45.299> you

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
just takes a while to load and then you

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.089 
just takes a while to load and then you
kind<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.049> flip<00:03:46.349> around<00:03:46.500> through<00:03:46.829> but<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.010> can

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
kind of flip around through but you can

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.259 
kind of flip around through but you can
see<00:03:47.190> I'm<00:03:47.280> pressing<00:03:47.430> buttons<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:47.970> it's<00:03:48.120> not

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
see I'm pressing buttons and it's not

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.629 
see I'm pressing buttons and it's not
really<00:03:48.480> responding<00:03:49.079> like<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:50.310> menus<00:03:50.609> just

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
really responding like the menus just

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.780 
really responding like the menus just
aren't<00:03:51.030> very<00:03:51.060> responsive<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.340> then<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.579> flip

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
aren't very responsive and then you flip

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.849 
aren't very responsive and then you flip
through<00:03:54.030> them<00:03:54.209> but<00:03:54.599> also<00:03:54.959> everything<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.590> very

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
through them but also everything is very

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.740 
through them but also everything is very
small<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.790> know<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.329> is<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.569> Vita

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
small like you know this is the Vita

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.720 
small like you know this is the Vita
screen<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:58.349> a<00:03:58.410> nice<00:03:58.560> big<00:03:58.769> screen<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
screen so it's a nice big screen but the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.250 
screen so it's a nice big screen but the
text<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.060> really<00:04:00.359> small<00:04:00.720> especially<00:04:00.900> on

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
text is really small especially on

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.000 
text is really small especially on
things<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:01.590> message<00:04:02.549> like<00:04:02.849> messages<00:04:03.299> for

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
things like message like messages for

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.710 
things like message like messages for
different<00:04:05.030> different<00:04:06.030> missions<00:04:06.569> you're

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
different different missions you're

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.629 
different different missions you're
doing<00:04:07.109> or<00:04:07.349> sort<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.620> notifications<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.459> things

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
doing or sort of notifications of things

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.430 
doing or sort of notifications of things
you've<00:04:08.819> just<00:04:09.030> unlocked<00:04:09.359> it's<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.079> very<00:04:10.319> very

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
you've just unlocked it's just very very

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.259 
you've just unlocked it's just very very
small<00:04:10.919> and<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.250> feels<00:04:11.459> like<00:04:11.639> it's<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.120> been

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
small and it feels like it's just been

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.240 
small and it feels like it's just been
straight-up<00:04:12.750> ported<00:04:13.290> over<00:04:13.410> from<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:14.069> bigger

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
straight-up ported over from a bigger

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.220 
straight-up ported over from a bigger
screen<00:04:14.639> that<00:04:15.000> worked<00:04:15.150> better<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:19.340> so

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
screen that worked better so so

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.620 
screen that worked better so so
you<00:04:23.220> can<00:04:23.370> just<00:04:23.520> see<00:04:23.670> their<00:04:23.850> like<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.240> way<00:04:24.360> like

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
you can just see their like the way like

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.540 
you can just see their like the way like
enemies<00:04:24.990> always<00:04:25.230> blow<00:04:25.590> up<00:04:25.800> because<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.460> know

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
enemies always blow up because you know

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.340 
enemies always blow up because you know
there's<00:04:26.700> not<00:04:26.820> enough<00:04:27.000> memory<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.570> have<00:04:27.870> bodies

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
there's not enough memory to have bodies

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.170 
there's not enough memory to have bodies
lying<00:04:28.590> around<00:04:28.740> or<00:04:29.010> anything<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.850> just<00:04:30.030> leaves

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
lying around or anything it just leaves

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.570 
lying around or anything it just leaves
the<00:04:30.330> game<00:04:30.480> feeling<00:04:30.720> kind<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.580> lackluster

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
the game feeling kind of lackluster

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.300 
the game feeling kind of lackluster
compared<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.540> compared<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.410> its<00:04:34.680> predecessors

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
compared to compared to its predecessors

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.430 
compared to compared to its predecessors
I<00:04:35.460> wasn't<00:04:35.730> gonna<00:04:36.060> go<00:04:37.040> I<00:04:38.040> also<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.700> know<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.440> just

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
I wasn't gonna go I also you know I just

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.810 
I wasn't gonna go I also you know I just
would<00:04:40.650> rather<00:04:40.860> be<00:04:41.070> playing<00:04:41.340> with<00:04:41.460> an<00:04:41.580> actual

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
would rather be playing with an actual

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.790 
would rather be playing with an actual
controller<00:04:42.270> rather<00:04:43.050> than<00:04:43.410> these<00:04:43.560> thumb

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
controller rather than these thumb

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.630 
controller rather than these thumb
sticks<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.780> these<00:04:46.260> these<00:04:47.250> these

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
sticks and and these these these

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.870 
sticks and and these these these
triggers<00:04:48.150> which<00:04:48.510> just<00:04:48.750> don't<00:04:48.960> feel<00:04:49.080> like<00:04:49.110> that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
triggers which just don't feel like that

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.520 
triggers which just don't feel like that
there's<00:04:50.880> also<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.210> issue<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.510> online<00:04:52.020> which

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
there's also the issue of online which

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.840 
there's also the issue of online which
you<00:04:52.800> can<00:04:52.950> only<00:04:53.040> play<00:04:53.280> with<00:04:53.400> one<00:04:53.460> other<00:04:53.760> person

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
you can only play with one other person

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.780 
you can only play with one other person
in<00:04:54.390> this<00:04:54.570> version<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.020> game<00:04:55.640> compared<00:04:56.640> to

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
in this version of the game compared to

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.580 
in this version of the game compared to
you<00:04:56.970> know<00:04:57.000> proper<00:04:57.810> Borderlands<00:04:58.200> 2<00:04:58.230> which<00:04:58.470> is

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
you know proper Borderlands 2 which is

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.840 
you know proper Borderlands 2 which is
for<00:04:58.770> players<00:04:59.040> which<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.280> definitely<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.700> big

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
for players which is definitely a big

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.610 
for players which is definitely a big
part<00:04:59.880> of<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.210> game<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.660> a<00:05:01.170> kind<00:05:01.350> of<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.470> big

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
part of the game and a kind of a big

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.930 
part of the game and a kind of a big
part<00:05:01.770> of<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.950> balancing<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.610> some<00:05:02.760> of<00:05:02.880> the

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
part of the balancing and some of the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.300 
part of the balancing and some of the
lake<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.390> stuff<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:03.960> it's<00:05:04.680> very<00:05:04.920> different<00:05:05.160> in

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
lake and stuff so it's very different in

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.440 
lake and stuff so it's very different in
that<00:05:05.340> respect<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:05.790> can<00:05:05.970> only<00:05:06.090> really<00:05:06.270> only

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
that respect you can only really only

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.050 
that respect you can only really only
play<00:05:06.630> with<00:05:06.720> one<00:05:06.780> person<00:05:07.230> which<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.610> know<00:05:08.730> I've

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
play with one person which you know I've

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.460 
play with one person which you know I've
played<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.300> lot<00:05:09.480> of<00:05:09.570> two-player<00:05:09.900> Borderlands<00:05:10.410> 2

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
played a lot of two-player Borderlands 2

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.160 
played a lot of two-player Borderlands 2
and<00:05:10.620> is<00:05:10.860> really<00:05:11.010> fun<00:05:11.370> but<00:05:12.210> it's<00:05:12.450> not<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.960> full

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
and is really fun but it's not the full

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.960 
and is really fun but it's not the full
experience<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.770> basically<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:17.640> know<00:05:17.760> it's

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
experience so basically you know it's

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.760 
experience so basically you know it's
kind<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.300> laggy<00:05:18.540> it's<00:05:18.900> kind<00:05:19.140> of<00:05:19.230> slow<00:05:19.470> the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
kind of laggy it's kind of slow the

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.860 
kind of laggy it's kind of slow the
framerate<00:05:20.010> isn't<00:05:20.490> great<00:05:20.730> it's<00:05:21.630> still

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
framerate isn't great it's still

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.780 
framerate isn't great it's still
Borderlands<00:05:22.350> 2<00:05:22.410> but<00:05:22.980> it<00:05:23.130> doesn't<00:05:23.400> control

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
Borderlands 2 but it doesn't control

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.580 
Borderlands 2 but it doesn't control
amazingly<00:05:24.330> especially<00:05:24.870> like<00:05:25.020> when<00:05:25.140> I<00:05:25.200> compare

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
amazingly especially like when I compare

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.750 
amazingly especially like when I compare
it<00:05:25.620> to<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.860> just<00:05:26.100> went<00:05:26.250> back<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.580> played<00:05:26.730> a

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
it to I just went back and played a

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.790 
it to I just went back and played a
bunch<00:05:26.910> of<00:05:27.090> Killzone<00:05:27.510> mercenary<00:05:27.650> which<00:05:28.650> is<00:05:28.770> a

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
bunch of Killzone mercenary which is a

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.320 
bunch of Killzone mercenary which is a
really<00:05:29.130> good<00:05:29.370> first-person<00:05:29.880> shooter<00:05:30.150> for<00:05:30.270> the

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
really good first-person shooter for the

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.870 
really good first-person shooter for the
Vita<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:30.930> just<00:05:31.440> that<00:05:31.620> game<00:05:31.800> placed<00:05:32.490> so<00:05:32.820> much

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
Vita and just that game placed so much

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.150 
Vita and just that game placed so much
better<00:05:33.210> across<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.780> board<00:05:34.020> it's<00:05:34.560> tighter

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
better across the board it's tighter

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.800 
better across the board it's tighter
it's<00:05:35.430> more<00:05:35.550> responsive<00:05:35.970> its<00:05:36.210> smoother<00:05:36.570> frame

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
it's more responsive its smoother frame

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.050 
it's more responsive its smoother frame
rate<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.710> touchscreen<00:05:38.250> stuff<00:05:38.640> is<00:05:38.790> really

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
rate the touchscreen stuff is really

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.940 
rate the touchscreen stuff is really
just<00:05:39.480> a<00:05:39.540> lot<00:05:39.720> easier<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.440> use<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:40.890> more

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
just a lot easier to use and more

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.880 
just a lot easier to use and more
effective<00:05:41.630> so<00:05:42.630> playing<00:05:43.380> again<00:05:43.590> like<00:05:43.710> this

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
effective so playing again like this

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.430 
effective so playing again like this
just<00:05:44.100> feels<00:05:44.220> a<00:05:44.460> lot<00:05:44.610> more<00:05:44.670> like<00:05:44.940> a<00:05:45.150> port<00:05:45.540> it's

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
just feels a lot more like a port it's

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.350 
just feels a lot more like a port it's
fine<00:05:46.860> if<00:05:47.250> you're<00:05:47.400> buying<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.790> new<00:05:47.820> Vita<00:05:48.150> slim

and playing you know putting in about 50
hours<00:06:06.390> into<00:06:06.840> it<00:06:06.870> unless<00:06:07.020> you<00:06:07.140> just<00:06:07.290> really

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
hours into it unless you just really

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.560 
hours into it unless you just really
love<00:06:07.860> Borderlands<00:06:08.430> if<00:06:09.060> you're<00:06:09.180> on<00:06:09.300> ps3

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
love Borderlands if you're on ps3

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.760 
love Borderlands if you're on ps3
there's<00:06:09.900> also<00:06:10.080> the<00:06:10.230> fact<00:06:10.410> that<00:06:10.470> you<00:06:10.590> can

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
there's also the fact that you can

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.590 
there's also the fact that you can
transfer<00:06:11.250> your<00:06:11.370> save<00:06:11.580> between<00:06:12.060> the<00:06:12.420> two

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
transfer your save between the two

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.850 
transfer your save between the two
versions<00:06:12.780> of<00:06:13.020> the<00:06:13.110> game<00:06:13.260> which<00:06:13.530> is<00:06:13.680> pretty

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
versions of the game which is pretty

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.400 
versions of the game which is pretty
cool<00:06:14.160> and<00:06:14.370> if<00:06:15.270> I<00:06:15.360> had<00:06:15.480> played<00:06:15.630> on<00:06:15.750> ps3<00:06:15.990> I<00:06:16.170> would

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
cool and if I had played on ps3 I would

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.280 
cool and if I had played on ps3 I would
definitely<00:06:17.010> do<00:06:17.130> that<00:06:17.340> but<00:06:17.670> I<00:06:17.850> didn't<00:06:18.090> and<00:06:18.290> I'm

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
definitely do that but I didn't and I'm

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.600 
definitely do that but I didn't and I'm
guessing<00:06:19.650> a<00:06:19.710> lot<00:06:19.860> of<00:06:19.950> other<00:06:20.070> people<00:06:20.340> didn't

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
guessing a lot of other people didn't

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.830 
guessing a lot of other people didn't
either<00:06:21.260> so<00:06:22.260> anyway<00:06:22.590> that's<00:06:23.460> that's<00:06:24.240> the<00:06:24.510> gist

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
either so anyway that's that's the gist

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.060 
either so anyway that's that's the gist
of<00:06:25.820> Borderlands<00:06:26.820> 2<00:06:26.880> which<00:06:27.660> you<00:06:28.110> know<00:06:28.200> pretty

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
of Borderlands 2 which you know pretty

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.460 
of Borderlands 2 which you know pretty
fun<00:06:29.370> but<00:06:29.690> just<00:06:30.690> because<00:06:30.780> it's<00:06:31.020> a<00:06:31.110> pretty<00:06:31.260> fun

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
fun but just because it's a pretty fun

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.110 
fun but just because it's a pretty fun
based<00:06:31.680> game<00:06:31.950> but<00:06:32.250> it's<00:06:32.370> definitely<00:06:32.520> not<00:06:33.060> the

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
based game but it's definitely not the

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.620 
based game but it's definitely not the
best<00:06:33.420> version<00:06:33.810> of<00:06:33.900> the<00:06:33.990> game

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
best version of the game

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.740 
best version of the game
so<00:06:36.630> there<00:06:36.780> you<00:06:36.810> go<00:06:38.000> okra<00:06:39.000> is<00:06:39.060> kind<00:06:39.210> of<00:06:39.240> like<00:06:39.360> my

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
so there you go okra is kind of like my

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.330 
so there you go okra is kind of like my
attempt<00:06:40.230> at<00:06:40.290> making<00:06:40.410> a<00:06:40.590> minimalist<00:06:41.070> sports

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340
