 hello to everybody well found we are 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.220
 always in the company of lg g3 and we want 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.500
 show you the dimensions a little 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.540
 indeed of this new 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.430
 smartphone lg 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.010
 first we compare it to an htc 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.490
 one m8 then a smartphone with a 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.500
 display smaller than the tg3 in 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.350
 how much we have 5.1 inches was a 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.480
 5.5 as you can see the dimensions 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.660
 they are quite similar we have the same 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.340
 height while changing the width a little 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.429
 because we have a width 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.449
 slightly higher for lg c3 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:41.539
 actually it holds better 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.399
 htc one m8 however the weight is a lot 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.469
 lower than that of lcc 3 like 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.850
 thickness is practically the same 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.559
 thickness 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.199
 let's go see another one too 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.030
 very portable smartphone with a weight 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.399
 really very light which is the way it has 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.199
 chosen 7 as size is slightly 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.260
 smaller much more portable liu wei 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.519
 we have lower height and width though 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.560
 is the display is a 5 inch compared to 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.259
 15.5 inches 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.090
 so however we both have a lg g3 that 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.009
 is a frame screen optimization 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.990
 truly exceptional we are to see 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.500
 then a comparison with instead a 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.189
 device that has the same dimensions 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.679
 of display that the htc desire 816 you see 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.330
 the display is the same size 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.789
 but the device is really really 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.679
 much bigger we have both 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:35.619
 largest width for htc desire 816 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.299
 is a really excessive height a 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.119
 this point regarding the htc 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.100
 desire 816 as the screen is it 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.979
 same then obviously the characteristics 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.649
 hardware are different as we have 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.340
 as regards the treasury 316 a 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.319
 quite entry level device like 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.200
 hardware because we have a snapdragon 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:59.920
 400 a hd display while a quad display 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.770
 hd for the lg g3 and above all one 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.959
 snapdragon 801 quad core 2.5 c 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.060
 different so it has an extra gear 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.519
 this lg g3 we wanted to show you 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.400
 a bit the size difference between 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.150
 these devices so we have a lg 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.760
 c3 that has 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.420
 tablet display because that's why 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.770
 has the capacity and 816 is a tablet but 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.770
 despite the display fabri age 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.200
 actual size closer to those 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.940
 of a smartphone then optimization 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.330
 I really repeat the screen frame 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.069
 exceptional i think i said it all 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.660
 any more information you want 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.330
 have us write to you in the comments 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.569
 hi to all from daniele for hi space 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.569
