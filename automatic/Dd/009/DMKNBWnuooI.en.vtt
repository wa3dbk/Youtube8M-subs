use a five needle outline which will

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.700 
use a five needle outline which will
show<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> minute<00:02:02.899> this<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> basic

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
show you in a minute this is a basic

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.639 
show you in a minute this is a basic
flat<00:02:05.520> shader<00:02:05.909> notice<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> size<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.439> hole

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
flat shader notice the size of the hole

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.940 
flat shader notice the size of the hole
this<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.190> hold<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> 22<00:02:09.509> needles<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.229> they

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
this can hold up to 22 needles and they

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.240 
this can hold up to 22 needles and they
will<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.459> flat<00:02:12.110> configuration

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
will be a flat configuration

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.100 
will be a flat configuration
which<00:02:13.340> will<00:02:13.520> show<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.790> also<00:02:14.090> these<00:02:14.750> are<00:02:14.960> two

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
which will show you also these are two

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.260 
which will show you also these are two

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
different types of grips that come on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.140 
different types of grips that come on
the<00:02:17.810> tubes<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.800> can<00:02:18.830> see<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.370> one<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.760> much

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
the tubes you can see this one is much

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.720 
the tubes you can see this one is much
fatter<00:02:20.870> than<00:02:21.230> this<00:02:21.440> one<00:02:21.680> there's<00:02:22.340> two<00:02:22.430> reasons

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
fatter than this one there's two reasons

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.910 
fatter than this one there's two reasons
for<00:02:23.120> those<00:02:23.210> one<00:02:23.540> reason<00:02:23.960> for<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.590> heavier

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
for those one reason for the heavier

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.100 
for those one reason for the heavier
grip<00:02:25.310> some<00:02:26.000> people<00:02:26.300> prefer<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:26.990> their

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
grip some people prefer that in their

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.800 
grip some people prefer that in their
hand<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.620> just<00:02:27.800> feels<00:02:28.010> more<00:02:28.130> comfortable<00:02:28.810> also

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
hand it just feels more comfortable also

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.020 
hand it just feels more comfortable also
if<00:02:30.080> you're<00:02:30.290> putting<00:02:30.590> in<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.950> lot<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.220> black<00:02:31.610> ink

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
if you're putting in a lot of black ink

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.750 
if you're putting in a lot of black ink
it<00:02:32.270> works<00:02:33.230> as<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.560> counterweight<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
it works as a counterweight on the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.130 
it works as a counterweight on the
tattoo<00:02:35.150> machine<00:02:35.450> they'll<00:02:35.600> give<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.900> little
