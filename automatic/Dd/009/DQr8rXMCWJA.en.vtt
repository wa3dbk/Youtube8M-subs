the<00:00:35.489> compass<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.180> time<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.690> some

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the compass on this time like some

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.680 
the compass on this time like some
people<00:00:37.200> are<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.550> firstly<00:00:38.969> starting<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:39.510> there

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
people are so firstly starting off there

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.810 
people are so firstly starting off there
on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> attack<00:00:40.140> than<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.440> play<00:00:40.739> ak-47<00:00:41.730> on

on the attack than I do play ak-47 on

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.190 
on the attack than I do play ak-47 on
this<00:00:41.969> map<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.360> they<00:00:42.480> probably<00:00:42.690> won't<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.050> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
this map so they probably won't be that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.410 
this map so they probably won't be that
much<00:00:43.350> exciting<00:00:43.800> stuff<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.850> course<00:00:44.879> pro<00:00:45.270> my

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
to get my AK so we can start scouting

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.820 

again<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:44.659> first<00:01:44.900> smoke<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.320> cover<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.619> jump

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
again I first smoke to cover the jump

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.170 
again I first smoke to cover the jump
and<00:01:45.920> also<00:01:46.189> Farrah<00:01:46.430> needed<00:01:46.729> in<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.850> street<00:01:47.090> to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
and also Farrah needed in the street to

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.789 
and also Farrah needed in the street to
try<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.450> get<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.600> kill<00:01:47.780> on<00:01:47.810> NESN<00:01:48.380> GG<00:01:48.590> my

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
try and get a kill on NESN GG my

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.890 
try and get a kill on NESN GG my
division<00:01:49.280> but<00:01:49.729> this<00:01:49.880> time<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.090> kind<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.750> guessed

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
division but this time I kind of guessed

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.510 
division but this time I kind of guessed
that<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.140> SMG<00:01:51.500> won't<00:01:51.710> push<00:01:51.979> since<00:01:52.250> he<00:01:52.340> died

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
that the SMG won't push since he died

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.810 
that the SMG won't push since he died
last<00:01:52.790> time<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:54.619> instead<00:01:54.890> i<00:01:55.009> watch<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.400> cross

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
last time so instead i watch the a cross

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.700 
last time so instead i watch the a cross
I<00:01:56.090> do<00:01:56.509> just<00:01:56.869> get<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.020> glimpse<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.380> somebody

to<00:02:03.049> my<00:02:03.170> advantage<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.680> get<00:02:03.799> across<00:02:04.039> the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
to my advantage you get across the

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.820 
to my advantage you get across the
street<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.759> try<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.060> help<00:02:05.149> out<00:02:05.360> be<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:09.619> reason

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
street to try and help out be the reason

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.140 
street to try and help out be the reason
I<00:02:09.890> do<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.039> because<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.580> wouldn't<00:02:10.729> say<00:02:10.910> wide

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
I do this because we wouldn't say wide

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.760 
I do this because we wouldn't say wide
the<00:02:11.360> chances<00:02:11.690> are<00:02:11.780> he<00:02:11.930> probably<00:02:12.170> won't<00:02:12.440> see<00:02:12.620> me

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
the chances are he probably won't see me

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.680 
the chances are he probably won't see me
across<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.130> street<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.940> really<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.510> just

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
across the street so really I can just

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.059 
across the street so really I can just
make<00:02:14.840> my<00:02:15.020> way<00:02:15.140> over<00:02:15.170> there<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.800> they'll<00:02:15.920> have

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
make my way over there and they'll have

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:29.470 
make my way over there and they'll have
no<00:02:16.280> idea<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.760> I'm<00:02:16.819> coming<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:27.940> do<00:02:28.940> get<00:02:29.239> to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
no idea that I'm coming I do get to

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.210 
no idea that I'm coming I do get to
pretty<00:02:29.840> quick<00:02:30.080> kills<00:02:30.380> but<00:02:30.680> get<00:02:30.800> too<00:02:30.950> greedy

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
pretty quick kills but get too greedy

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.250 
pretty quick kills but get too greedy
and<00:02:31.459> die<00:02:31.610> when<00:02:31.850> looking<00:02:32.090> at<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.269> third<00:02:32.540> by

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
and die when looking at the third by

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.930 
and die when looking at the third by
this<00:02:33.470> point<00:02:33.620> my<00:02:33.830> teammate<00:02:34.190> has<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.700> chance

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
this point my teammate has to a chance

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.490 
this point my teammate has to a chance
to<00:02:35.120> get<00:02:35.269> everyone<00:02:35.450> behind<00:02:35.780> their<00:02:36.049> spawn<00:02:36.290> and

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.880 

it<00:03:10.360> takes<00:03:10.569> me<00:03:10.720> awhile<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.140> realize<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.739> one

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
it takes me awhile to realize that one

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.410 
it takes me awhile to realize that one
person<00:03:12.310> seemed<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.610> be<00:03:12.670> missing<00:03:12.819> every<00:03:13.209> bullet

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
the compass the street is open so I make

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.039 
the compass the street is open so I make
my<00:03:26.920> way<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.129> guard<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.549> as<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.629> chances<00:03:29.019> are

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
my way to guard that as the chances are

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.509 
my way to guard that as the chances are
pretty<00:03:29.290> high<00:03:29.410> for<00:03:29.590> them<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.069> want<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.370> rotate

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
pretty high for them to want to rotate

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.430 
pretty high for them to want to rotate
around<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.150> front<00:03:31.360> of<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:31.690> into<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.140> stream

probably<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.550> views<00:05:36.820> before<00:05:36.970> he<00:05:37.210> gets<00:05:37.390> near

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
probably the views before he gets near

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.480 
probably the views before he gets near
me<00:05:40.380> because<00:05:41.380> I<00:05:41.500> make<00:05:41.680> him<00:05:41.830> think<00:05:42.040> I'm<00:05:42.220> running

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
me because I make him think I'm running

me because I make him think I'm running
away<00:05:42.580> this<00:05:42.880> causes<00:05:43.330> him<00:05:43.450> to<00:05:43.480> jump<00:05:43.810> out<00:05:43.960> into
