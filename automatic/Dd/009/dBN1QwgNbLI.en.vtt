00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:10.710
 so now setbacks fun it okay the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:26.519
 mod it installs mom's matthias 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:31.740
 stadler minecraft new good then so is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.690
 that hacker it did not work in yes 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 minecraft shredded faster 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.020
 youtube and the typus commentary 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 write that he is to blame that one 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:50.489
 minecraft is so hello people shredded 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.809
 of course it would be wrong to do that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.949
 You can always minecraft again 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.770
 activates relationship to the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.719
 set standard format without moth and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.820
 without anything in there so that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.500
 working again is simply her 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.830
 can you have the problem that here in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 then loading is or one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.840
 black screen is or minecraft 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.780
 crashes then gets an error message 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.439
 and vista something like what you go on 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.409
 So you just close it 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.830
 minecraft then goes in in minecraft 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.939
 and you see your folders first 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.939
 Once we secure our first 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.200
 For simplicity's sake, yes , see it 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.790
 which folder important industry 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:53.320
 folder important yes somehow lay the grave 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:57.220
 a little bit around the fair anyway 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.960
 is very important and here we have it 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.480
 window unimportant that should not now 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.350
 so you do not care 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.660
 Now slide when the important things 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.760
 which in any case nothing to do with it 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.320
 did that your minecraft crashed 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.540
 these are your saves that are your worlds 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.270
 then your texture pack could also be one 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.560
 but it does not have to be a mistake if it is 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.790
 Still, it does not work if you do 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.170
 has done or that then imagines 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.170
 Today, the tags take out even then 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.750
 you still need to be very important otherwise 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.750
 would have to enter the password last login 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.430
 but the server olsen is here 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.380
 ok these folders are the folders 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.790
 in any case still brown world 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.730
 once your tips from autumn one 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.000
 anwältin and this could server the 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.019
 have entered and your last login 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.190
 otherwise you really need of 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.410
 minecraft nothing at all in the first place 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.700
 if we have everything we have here 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:13.150
 always get out and delete the whole thing 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.900
 completely not fun right here 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.110
 two parts 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.110
 because of the mark we are allowed to 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:30.440
 and delete that now take everything 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.840
 important is pure again 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.640
 you can of course also individually around 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.750
 delete and keep that i have that 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.239
 now just done so you too 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.680
 can see which folders and which 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.739
 Files are important to you 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.380
 then we can have that 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.580
 made 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.069
 the folder important could be a heavy one 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.690
 away ton in bauma not anymore and so must 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.340
 then look at you in the end 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.819
 minecraft folder no longer not 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.480
 fewer 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.970
 and now state minecraft minecraft 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:07.640
 you start seeing everyone now 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:17.139
 patches again down folder was 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:20.030
 hella to the minecraft and minecraft 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.430
 starts again wonderful no problems 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.530
 Everything is back to the old standard 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.590
 minecraft is here and currently the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.660
 By the way, current version 1.5 applies to 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.850
 every version of minecraft this video 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.479
 So it does not matter what you do her 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.000
 See my servers are still there 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.590
 because texture they still pack everything 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.970
 since without anything flew long and 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.970
 anyway, my complete minecraft is 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.300
 again in the form of the germ I can 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.280
 now start a lot with a motto 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.410
 to install 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.470
 if you wanted to spare that like 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.720
 I always say my videos are expensive 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.710
 clear minecraft 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.120
 important is you get your minecraft 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.620
 clearly not loaded down when he gets it 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.479
 deletes that means he would have practically the 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.560
 then delete the folder then then 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.650
 everything can be down again because 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.410
 these files control the download 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.900
 if the trend is not check it out 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.630
 more if a file fails or not 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.190
 that's why you have to complete the folder 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.930
 Clear 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.500
 otherwise if you are sure 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.639
 always wanted the minecraft first 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.919
 secure as coupé I'll do it 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.370
 copy right click and then add stands 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.930
 come back to his and now 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.789
 edited minecraft and if anything 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.419
 goes wrong delete minecraft and two the 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.229
 other 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.300
 however, it can happen now 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.030
 Of late yes that does not have to 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.190
 then work spoke again 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.290
 folder of the is of course only there if 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.100
 you also lose minecraft for jazz 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.800
 have and very important what i also in 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.600
 Always tell my videos where I am now 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:59.910
 I'm always here in the minecraft 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.620
 Of course , a nice one in this folder is clear 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.960
 many are making mistakes especially now 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.070
 minecraft before you get this folder 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.650
 do not delete 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.330
 important before he is a crawford 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.150
 This folder must be installed on everyone 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.590
 his case cleared 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.449
 minecraft has its own metal in 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.880
 front with the leather has its updates 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.199
 round is not so far with the 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.510
 here that means he definitely has to 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.100
 if he then mine if you mine 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.350
 should have experienced progress then 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.240
 of course the weather.info folder is not 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.729
 delete more then applies for minecraft 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.090
 imagine is okay then that does not bother 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.229
 more 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:37.200
 but if you whats installed before he 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:41.550
 think forge have on then you have to 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.830
 also delete with a folder as soon as you do 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.960
 Minecraft on it you have him with 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.180
 not delete the folder in because he 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.550
 for one comes ford so i hope so 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.460
 that survived a bit 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:56.039
 complicated but that's the only way it works 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.330
 so otherwise i have masters with that 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:58.919
 show videos of you again because 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.450
 These questions come up very often 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.889
 or any 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.750
 verbal abuse of any people 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.520
 realized I worked out thinking theirs 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.300
 Minecraft of the broken you can never 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.449
 do something 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:13.139
 that should help you all up and 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:15.150
 I hope it does and in any case 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.949
 wish you much success with one 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.949
 minecraft and I hope that finally 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:22.889
 the nazis actively updated when on 15 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.960
 so that it goes on here so far 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:27.570
 There charles spa on youtube makes 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.199
 expensive for the kadow I am for you 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.199
 was there
