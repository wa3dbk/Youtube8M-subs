model Scotland a couple of years ago and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.500 
model Scotland a couple of years ago and
I<00:01:03.750> thought<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.650> sounds<00:01:05.100> promising<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.909> this

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
I thought that sounds promising so this

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.140 
I thought that sounds promising so this
is<00:01:06.659> why<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.740> opted<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.520> Hornby<00:01:08.880> unit

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
is why I have opted for the Hornby unit

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.820 
is why I have opted for the Hornby unit
because<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.420> talks<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.200> software

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
because it talks to that software

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.510 
because it talks to that software
perfectly<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:12.750> tell<00:01:12.960> me

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
perfectly or so they tell me

perfectly or so they tell me

it<00:05:41.550> turning<00:05:41.820> it<00:05:41.910> turning<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.420> from

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
it turning it turning it and from

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.760 
it turning it turning it and from
there's<00:05:42.780> another<00:05:42.960> 110<00:05:43.740> that<00:05:43.890> wee<00:05:43.980> bit<00:05:44.100> more

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
there's another 110 that wee bit more

there's another 110 that wee bit more
another<00:05:46.770> one<00:05:47.010> I<00:05:47.190> suppose<00:05:47.730> it's<00:05:47.850> all<00:05:47.940> during

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
another one I suppose it's all during

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.420 
another one I suppose it's all during
the<00:05:48.210> acceleration<00:05:48.420> you<00:05:48.930> say<00:05:49.200> so<00:05:49.860> anything<00:05:50.160> the

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
the acceleration you say so anything the

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.010 
the acceleration you say so anything the
Queen<00:05:50.820> Mother<00:05:51.000> is<00:05:51.150> on<00:05:51.270> its<00:05:51.420> way<00:05:51.480> around<00:05:51.600> and

Queen Mother is on its way around and
I'll<00:05:52.980> get<00:05:53.250> I'll<00:05:53.790> press<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:55.020> other<00:05:55.110> button

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
I'll get I'll press the other button

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.300 
I'll get I'll press the other button
that's<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:57.150> class<00:05:57.450> 26<00:05:58.440> won't<00:05:58.890> do<00:05:59.040> or<00:05:59.190> when

that's the class 26 won't do or when

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.590 

I've<00:06:04.720> set<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.020> acceleration<00:06:05.710> rates

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
I've set the acceleration rates

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.490 
I've set the acceleration rates
relatively<00:06:07.860> in<00:06:08.860> quick<00:06:09.670> it's<00:06:10.350> not<00:06:11.350> as

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
relatively in quick it's not as

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.900 
relatively in quick it's not as
realistic<00:06:11.710> as<00:06:12.010> it<00:06:12.100> will<00:06:12.250> be<00:06:12.280> when<00:06:12.520> I<00:06:12.580> get<00:06:12.700> the

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
realistic as it will be when I get the

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.850 
realistic as it will be when I get the
lid<00:06:13.090> up<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.450> running<00:06:13.720> so<00:06:14.410> there<00:06:14.530> we<00:06:14.650> have<00:06:14.830> it

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
lid up and running so there we have it

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.510 
lid up and running so there we have it
the<00:06:15.460> Hornby<00:06:15.910> unit<00:06:16.860> titties<00:06:17.860> up<00:06:17.890> to<00:06:18.130> full<00:06:18.310> speed

the Hornby unit titties up to full speed

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.930 
the Hornby unit titties up to full speed

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
just a shoe you turn the dial tick was

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.030 
just a shoe you turn the dial tick was
all<00:06:22.120> the<00:06:22.300> way<00:06:22.360> up<00:06:22.480> to<00:06:22.600> full<00:06:22.750> speed<00:06:22.990> and<00:06:23.320> the<00:06:23.470> 47

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
all the way up to full speed and the 47

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.939 
all the way up to full speed and the 47
will<00:06:24.130> be<00:06:24.220> coming<00:06:24.490> towards<00:06:24.850> us<00:06:24.940> now

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.770 

quite<00:06:30.460> pulled<00:06:30.759> up<00:06:30.969> here<00:06:31.150> today<00:06:31.330> so<00:06:31.509> I'm

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
quite pulled up here today so I'm

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.939 
quite pulled up here today so I'm
assuming<00:06:32.139> these<00:06:32.229> liquids<00:06:32.680> we<00:06:32.800> may<00:06:32.889> be

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
assuming these liquids we may be

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.700 
assuming these liquids we may be
retained<00:06:33.310> to<00:06:33.610> dig<00:06:34.120> it<00:06:34.270> up<00:06:34.360> this<00:06:34.870> L<00:06:35.169> Jen's<00:06:35.500> are

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
retained to dig it up this L Jen's are

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.580 
retained to dig it up this L Jen's are
terrific<00:06:36.340> little<00:06:36.669> run<00:06:36.879> up<00:06:37.000> and<00:06:37.210> quite<00:06:38.139> rapid

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
terrific little run up and quite rapid

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.110 
terrific little run up and quite rapid
up<00:06:38.740> to<00:06:38.979> it<00:06:39.509> but<00:06:40.509> what's<00:06:40.689> a<00:06:40.780> small<00:06:41.050> local<00:06:41.530> and

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
up to it but what's a small local and

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.969 
up to it but what's a small local and
it's<00:06:43.120> a<00:06:43.180> good<00:06:43.330> performer<00:06:43.750> so<00:06:44.590> there<00:06:44.710> we<00:06:44.830> have

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
it's a good performer so there we have

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.170 
it's a good performer so there we have
it<00:06:45.210> the<00:06:46.210> Hornby<00:06:46.629> elite<00:06:47.699> good<00:06:48.699> value<00:06:49.000> for<00:06:49.030> money

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
it the Hornby elite good value for money

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.129 
it the Hornby elite good value for money
if<00:06:49.960> you<00:06:50.110> don't<00:06:50.319> buy<00:06:50.500> it<00:06:50.560> direct<00:06:50.889> from<00:06:50.949> Hornby

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
if you don't buy it direct from Hornby

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.439 
if you don't buy it direct from Hornby
simplistic<00:06:53.139> to<00:06:53.289> use<00:06:53.530> you<00:06:54.430> can<00:06:54.490> go<00:06:54.969> into<00:06:55.090> depth

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:55.449 
simplistic to use you can go into depth

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.270 
simplistic to use you can go into depth
with<00:06:55.629> with<00:06:56.080> the<00:06:56.229> manual<00:06:56.620> and<00:06:56.710> really<00:06:56.949> do<00:06:57.069> some

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
with with the manual and really do some

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.520 
with with the manual and really do some
fancy<00:06:57.550> things<00:06:57.759> I'm<00:06:58.180> sure<00:06:58.389> I've<00:06:58.960> not<00:06:59.199> got<00:06:59.409> to

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
fancy things I'm sure I've not got to

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.649 
fancy things I'm sure I've not got to
that<00:06:59.560> stage<00:06:59.949> yet<00:07:00.250> the<00:07:00.669> what<00:07:00.849> let's<00:07:01.060> it<00:07:01.150> down<00:07:01.389> is

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:01.659 
that stage yet the what let's it down is

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:03.719 
that stage yet the what let's it down is
a<00:07:01.689> corresponding<00:07:02.529> movement<00:07:02.979> of<00:07:03.099> these<00:07:03.250> dials

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
a corresponding movement of these dials

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.269 
a corresponding movement of these dials
it's<00:07:04.419> a<00:07:04.479> small<00:07:04.779> point<00:07:05.110> right<00:07:05.349> enough<00:07:05.590> it's<00:07:06.069> not

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:06.279 
it's a small point right enough it's not

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:08.820 
it's a small point right enough it's not
going<00:07:06.610> to<00:07:06.819> a<00:07:07.210> look<00:07:07.750> at<00:07:07.870> a<00:07:07.900> deal-breaker<00:07:08.139> and
