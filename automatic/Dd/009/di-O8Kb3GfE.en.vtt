00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
it off a little bit and I did not take

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.130 
it off a little bit and I did not take
time<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.879> look<00:03:45.000> at<00:03:45.150> all<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.390> ingredients<00:03:46.019> to

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
time to look at all the ingredients to

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.449 
time to look at all the ingredients to
see<00:03:46.290> what<00:03:46.500> was<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.129> might<00:03:47.310> have

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
see what was in it that might have

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.280 
see what was in it that might have
caused<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.090> just<00:03:48.239> stopped<00:03:48.629> using<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.080> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
caused it I just stopped using it the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.770 
caused it I just stopped using it the
next<00:03:49.620> one<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:49.980> called<00:03:50.250> crystal<00:03:50.700> eco<00:03:51.510> styler

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
next one is called crystal eco styler

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.369 
next one is called crystal eco styler
gel<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.349> this<00:03:53.250> one<00:03:53.580> is<00:03:53.879> in<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.569> clear<00:03:55.080> container

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
gel and this one is in a clear container

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.880 
gel and this one is in a clear container
and<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:56.189> think<00:03:56.400> some<00:03:56.580> people<00:03:56.730> call<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.060> ice<00:03:57.390> -<00:03:57.890> it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
and I think some people call it ice - it

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.759 
and I think some people call it ice - it
has<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.159> hold<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.610> tin<00:03:59.879> the<00:04:00.480> scent<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:01.019> clean<00:04:01.530> and

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
has a hold of tin the scent is clean and

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.610 
has a hold of tin the scent is clean and
fresh<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.909> benefits<00:04:03.360> are<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.870> reduces

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
fresh and the benefits are it reduces

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.570 
fresh and the benefits are it reduces
porosity<00:04:05.569> improve<00:04:06.569> shine<00:04:07.019> builds<00:04:07.980> body<00:04:08.280> and

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
porosity improve shine builds body and

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.660 
porosity improve shine builds body and
maintains<00:04:09.150> hold<00:04:09.510> wait<00:04:10.439> a<00:04:10.470> minute<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.189> said

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
maintains hold wait a minute it said

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.020 
maintains hold wait a minute it said
that<00:04:12.290> reduces<00:04:13.290> porosity<00:04:13.650> maybe<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.909> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
that reduces porosity maybe this is the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.999 
that reduces porosity maybe this is the
one<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.510> should<00:04:15.780> be<00:04:15.870> using<00:04:15.900> okay<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.620> might

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
one that I should be using okay I might

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.830 
one that I should be using okay I might
have<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.280> try<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.759> and<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.180> have<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.359> big<00:04:18.660> one<00:04:18.780> of

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
have to try that and I have a big one of

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.060 
have to try that and I have a big one of
this<00:04:19.079> too<00:04:19.229> because<00:04:19.350> my<00:04:19.560> daughters<00:04:19.889> have<00:04:20.040> been

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
this too because my daughters have been

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.500 
this too because my daughters have been
using<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:20.669> I<00:04:20.729> might<00:04:20.940> have<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.120> snap

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
using it so I might have to snap

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.540 
using it so I might have to snap
that<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.960> give<00:04:22.170> it<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.290> go<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:23.040> next<00:04:23.370> one

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
that and give it a go and the next one

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.630 
that and give it a go and the next one
is<00:04:23.730> all<00:04:24.390> black<00:04:24.810> ecostyler<00:04:25.470> gel<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.430> is

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
is all black ecostyler gel and this is

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.820 
is all black ecostyler gel and this is
super<00:04:27.150> protein<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.140> if<00:04:28.230> your<00:04:28.380> hair<00:04:28.560> really

super protein so if your hair really

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.830 
super protein so if your hair really
loves<00:04:29.160> protein<00:04:29.640> then<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:30.270> would<00:04:30.420> be<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.660> Jo

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
loves protein then this would be the Jo

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.370 
loves protein then this would be the Jo
for<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:32.310> says<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.510> has<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.050> hold

this<00:05:30.630> might<00:05:30.900> be<00:05:31.020> another<00:05:31.230> one<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.500> need<00:05:31.620> to

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
this might be another one I need to

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.350 
this might be another one I need to
check<00:05:31.860> out<00:05:32.040> because<00:05:32.190> my<00:05:32.370> hair<00:05:32.400> loves<00:05:32.760> glycerin

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
check out because my hair loves glycerin

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.630 
check out because my hair loves glycerin
but<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.140> benefits<00:05:34.530> are<00:05:34.620> it<00:05:35.100> provides

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
but the benefits are it provides

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.820 
but the benefits are it provides
additional<00:05:35.940> moisture<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.840> protection<00:05:37.680> for

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
additional moisture and protection for

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.490 
additional moisture and protection for
chemical<00:05:38.310> or<00:05:38.550> sun<00:05:38.850> damaged<00:05:39.390> hair<00:05:39.750> now<00:05:40.140> I<00:05:40.410> think

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
chemical or sun damaged hair now I think

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.620 
chemical or sun damaged hair now I think
there<00:05:41.070> are<00:05:41.100> like<00:05:41.550> three<00:05:41.910> or<00:05:42.150> four<00:05:42.450> of<00:05:42.540> them

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
there are like three or four of them

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.510 
there are like three or four of them
that<00:05:42.780> they<00:05:42.930> did<00:05:43.080> not<00:05:43.230> sin<00:05:43.530> there's<00:05:44.070> one<00:05:44.340> that's

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
that they did not sin there's one that's

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.470 
that they did not sin there's one that's
in<00:05:44.730> a<00:05:44.820> blue<00:05:45.060> container<00:05:45.510> there's<00:05:46.380> one<00:05:46.710> that<00:05:47.070> is

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
in a blue container there's one that is

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.260 
in a blue container there's one that is
in<00:05:48.480> a<00:05:49.290> all<00:05:49.890> black<00:05:50.130> container<00:05:50.610> that<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:50.880> did<00:05:51.120> not

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
in a all black container that I did not

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.450 
in a all black container that I did not
get<00:05:51.570> but<00:05:52.170> I<00:05:52.200> think<00:05:52.560> that's<00:05:52.770> enough<00:05:53.100> for<00:05:53.310> us<00:05:53.370> to

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
get but I think that's enough for us to

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.640 
get but I think that's enough for us to
kind<00:05:53.820> of<00:05:53.910> figure<00:05:54.330> out<00:05:54.510> what<00:05:55.020> type<00:05:55.230> of<00:05:55.380> gel<00:05:55.530> we

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
kind of figure out what type of gel we

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.530 
kind of figure out what type of gel we
want<00:05:55.890> but<00:05:56.220> I<00:05:56.280> will<00:05:56.580> link<00:05:56.790> the<00:05:56.880> website<00:05:57.330> below
