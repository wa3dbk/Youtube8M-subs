for a second right here just just put

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.220 
for a second right here just just put
your<00:00:20.279> mind<00:00:20.640> around<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.930> little

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
your mind around this if this little

possibly<00:00:26.760> at<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> max<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.420> think<00:00:27.630> she's

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
possibly at the max but I think she's

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.009

at that particular point what could she

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
at that particular point what could she
possibly<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> future<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.829> she

there's<00:00:56.370> some<00:00:56.489> discrepancies<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.270> some

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
there's some discrepancies because some

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.180 
there's some discrepancies because some
people<00:00:57.870> say<00:00:57.989> no<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.649> he<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.890> supposed<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.100> be

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
born with that what do you mean

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.970 
born with that what do you mean
activated<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.680> since

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
activated this and that I think since

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.650 
activated this and that I think since
because<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.550> Hyuga<00:01:03.000> genes<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.390> mixed

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
because the Hyuga genes are mixed

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
because the Hyuga genes are mixed
because<00:01:03.750> almost<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> Hyuga<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.010> I'm

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
because almost all the Hyuga if I'm

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:05.539 
because almost all the Hyuga if I'm
correct

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
correct

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.010 
correct
they<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:05.880> mix<00:01:06.299> within<00:01:06.479> each<00:01:06.720> other<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
they all just mix within each other you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.480 
they all just mix within each other you
know<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.409> guys<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.799> go<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.250> stay

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
know it's you guys you go they stay

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.010 
know it's you guys you go they stay
within<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.760> race<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> fact<00:01:09.930> that

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
within that race so the fact that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.679 
within that race so the fact that
they're<00:01:10.200> mixed<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:11.010> Naruto<00:01:11.280> Uzumaki<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.450> as

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
they're mixed with Naruto Uzumaki and as

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.750 
they're mixed with Naruto Uzumaki and as
well<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:12.960> renounce<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.439> genes<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
well as renounce of genes you know it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.039 
well as renounce of genes you know it
gives<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.210> bit<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> difference<00:01:15.869> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
gives a little bit of a difference so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.289 
gives a little bit of a difference so
they<00:01:16.200> don't<00:01:16.439> automatically<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.729> born<00:01:18.060> with

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
they don't automatically be born with

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.249 
they don't automatically be born with
this<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> speak<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:18.960> kind<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> like

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
this so to speak it's kind of like

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
this so to speak it's kind of like
mixing<00:01:19.590> sage<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.189> DNA<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:20.820> whatever<00:01:21.090> they

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
mixing sage in DNA or whatever they

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
mixing sage in DNA or whatever they
don't<00:01:21.420> immediately<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.560> same<00:01:22.799> Drive

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
don't immediately have that same Drive

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.770 
don't immediately have that same Drive
in<00:01:23.310> power<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:24.030> ultimately<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.630> could

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
in power but ultimately they could

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.179 
in power but ultimately they could
achieve<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.350> some<00:01:25.530> given<00:01:25.619> point<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
achieve it at some given point and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.950 
achieve it at some given point and
speaking<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.759> honestly<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> me<00:01:27.479> Himawari

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
speaking of that honestly to me Himawari

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.530 
speaking of that honestly to me Himawari
just<00:01:28.259> seems<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.710> Kishimoto<00:01:29.700> figured<00:01:30.390> out

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
just seems like Kishimoto figured out

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
to show up I think that's one of the

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
to show up I think that's one of the
things<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.470> kind<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.680> made<00:04:38.830> me<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:38.950> little<00:04:39.070> bit

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
things that kind of made me a little bit

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.820 
things that kind of made me a little bit
like<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:40.110> really<00:04:41.110> wish<00:04:41.320> she<00:04:41.440> would<00:04:41.590> have<00:04:41.680> been

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
like I really wish she would have been

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.920 
like I really wish she would have been
there<00:04:41.950> cuz<00:04:42.190> it's<00:04:42.700> been<00:04:42.970> leading<00:04:43.300> up<00:04:43.450> onto<00:04:43.780> this

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
there cuz it's been leading up onto this

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.170 
there cuz it's been leading up onto this
and<00:04:44.200> then<00:04:44.470> he's<00:04:45.130> sleeping<00:04:45.639> for<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.000> maybe

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
and then he's sleeping for it maybe

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.940 
and then he's sleeping for it maybe
they'll<00:04:46.389> do<00:04:46.510> a<00:04:46.540> rien<00:04:46.990> duction<00:04:47.470> or<00:04:47.590> some<00:04:47.800> other

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950

they'll do a rien duction or some other

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
celebration I guess and Himawari like do

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.170 
celebration I guess and Himawari like do
you<00:04:50.919> think<00:04:51.190> at<00:04:51.310> some<00:04:51.460> given<00:04:51.730> point<00:04:51.790> if<00:04:52.060> she

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
you think at some given point if she

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.970 
you think at some given point if she
continues<00:04:52.660> on<00:04:52.870> she<00:04:53.350> could<00:04:53.440> potentially<00:04:53.560> be

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
continues on she could potentially be

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.230 
continues on she could potentially be
stronger<00:04:54.430> than<00:04:54.520> everyone<00:04:55.000> in<00:04:55.120> this

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
stronger than everyone in this

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.890 
stronger than everyone in this
generation
