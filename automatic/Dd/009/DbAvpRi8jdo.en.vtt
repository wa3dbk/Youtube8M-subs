course<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.679> that<00:00:58.859> we're<00:00:59.039> not<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.460> storing

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
course is that we're not just storing

you<00:01:08.049> know<00:01:08.140> when<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:08.439> think<00:01:08.500> about<00:01:08.770> hydrogen

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
you know when you think about hydrogen

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.749 
you know when you think about hydrogen
right<00:01:09.880> now<00:01:10.500> hydrogen<00:01:11.500> is<00:01:11.710> typically<00:01:12.130> reformed

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
right now hydrogen is typically reformed

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.120 
right now hydrogen is typically reformed
from<00:01:12.969> natural<00:01:13.450> gas<00:01:13.479> one<00:01:14.289> one<00:01:14.710> of<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.890> most

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
from natural gas one one of the most

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.340 
from natural gas one one of the most

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.410 
readily available fuels in the world
right<00:01:18.189> here<00:01:18.219> in<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.520> United<00:01:18.789> States<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.270> it's

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
right here in the United States so it's

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.459 
right here in the United States so it's
a<00:01:19.509> completely<00:01:20.609> homegrown<00:01:21.609> fuel<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.200> so

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
a completely homegrown fuel and so

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.410 
a completely homegrown fuel and so
regardless<00:01:23.979> of<00:01:24.250> what<00:01:24.520> source<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.060> hydrogen
