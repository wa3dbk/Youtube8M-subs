00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.770 
reef this really reminds me of a like a
red<00:02:11.440> lipstick<00:02:12.310> but<00:02:12.610> with<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> lot<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.060> pink<00:02:13.480> in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.190 
red lipstick but with a lot of pink in

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
it and sometimes during spring I just

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.110 
it and sometimes during spring I just
don't<00:02:17.560> want<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.830> wear<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.069> red<00:02:18.280> lip<00:02:18.519> that's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
don't want to wear a red lip that's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.229 
don't want to wear a red lip that's
probably<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.989> only<00:02:20.019> time<00:02:20.349> I<00:02:20.590> don't<00:02:21.069> wear<00:02:21.430> red

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
probably the only time I don't wear red

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.270 
probably the only time I don't wear red
lips<00:02:22.510> too<00:02:22.750> often<00:02:23.110> I'll<00:02:23.319> bust<00:02:23.709> them<00:02:23.980> out<00:02:24.099> again

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
lips too often I'll bust them out again

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.110 
lips too often I'll bust them out again
in<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.569> summer<00:02:25.810> but<00:02:26.379> during<00:02:26.680> spring<00:02:27.159> not<00:02:27.819> so

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
in the summer but during spring not so

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.259 
in the summer but during spring not so
much<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:29.049> one<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.500> like<00:02:29.709> my<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.970> know<00:02:31.120> my

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
much and this one is like my you know my

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.170 
much and this one is like my you know my
red<00:02:31.750> lip<00:02:32.260> kind<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.799> look<00:02:32.950> because<00:02:33.160> it's<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.640> dark

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
red lip kind of look because it's a dark

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.710 
red lip kind of look because it's a dark
dark<00:02:34.900> coral<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.060> even<00:02:37.060> though<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.480> looks

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
dark coral and even though this looks

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.410 
dark coral and even though this looks
like<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.019> gloss<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:39.069> kind<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.790> like<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.970> stain

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
like a gloss it's kind of like a stain

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.380 
like a gloss it's kind of like a stain
and<00:02:41.019> that's<00:02:41.739> why<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:41.920> consider<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.579> a<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:43.360> a

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
and that's why I consider this a like a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.770 
and that's why I consider this a like a
liquid<00:02:43.629> lipstick<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.860> it's<00:02:45.489> just<00:02:45.700> really

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
liquid lipstick and it's just really

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.770 
liquid lipstick and it's just really
pretty<00:02:46.780> um<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:48.250> almost<00:02:48.849> it's<00:02:49.180> got<00:02:49.420> orange

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
pretty um it's almost it's got orange

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.860 
pretty um it's almost it's got orange
and<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.890> coral<00:02:51.310> in<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.690> even

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
and the coral in it but you can even

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.520 
and the coral in it but you can even
wear<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.440> with<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.370> know<00:02:54.519> like<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:56.230> know<00:02:56.260> as

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
wear this with you know like you know as

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.069 
wear this with you know like you know as
a<00:02:56.560> red<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.519> really<00:02:58.030> think<00:02:58.239> it's<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.660> really

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
a red I just really think it's a really

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.099 
a red I just really think it's a really
good<00:02:59.349> one<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.739> have<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:01.239> formula<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.780> good

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
good one to have and the formula is good

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.190 
good one to have and the formula is good
it<00:03:02.379> lasts<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:03.099> long<00:03:03.459> time<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:04.569> don't<00:03:04.840> even<00:03:05.019> think

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
it lasts a long time I don't even think

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.830 
it lasts a long time I don't even think
I<00:03:05.560> usually<00:03:05.920> reapply<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.579> by<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.420> end<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
I usually reapply it by the end of the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.479 
I usually reapply it by the end of the
day<00:03:07.989> it's<00:03:08.200> really<00:03:08.650> good<00:03:08.859> and<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.129> stings

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
day it's really good and it stings

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.390
