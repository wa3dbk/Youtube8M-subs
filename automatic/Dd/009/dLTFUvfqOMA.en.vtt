00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 how about friends how are they assassin soul 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.240
 here in a tutorial more for you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.929
 this time the tutorial that I bring you is 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.269
 how can we apply x- rays here in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.880
 minecraft so that the rays serve us 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.910
 x well, more than anything to find what 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 better chests that are hidden under 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.470
 the earth or also fortresses and so on 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.849
 I already know that this tutorial has been very 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.189
 seen and done by other people but 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.439
 Well here I leave my touch and then 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.809
 I hope you like the material that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.329
 let's occupy is dynamite and so what 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.879
 what is the ndr but it is the only thing 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.710
 I need then hidden what is 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.020
 bright stone to see a little more 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.170
 but then the only thing we need in itself 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.879
 dynamite and ender but the first thing that 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.160
 you have to do and it's very easy 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.680
 break down breaks to break 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.500
 break break break and then once 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.200
 that we are 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.989
 a depth distance let's 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.400
 break here two blocks here I can already 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.280
 apply what is the trick but I'm going to 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.010
 break another two here arribita going to go a 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.800
 dynamite block and right away we're going to 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.440
 put what is the ndr web 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.660
 and as you see here we already have the most famous 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.870
 x-ray trick 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.510
 we can usually find and I then 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.550
 he used it in creative mode to for 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.230
 see if I find music discs 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.840
 or covers with pumpkins etc or spawn 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.720
 and then in this case we do not find anything 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.820
 we are going to good I recommend that once 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.659
 that they do it here opposite also what 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 make here back 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.179
 let's put the dynamite up and 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.390
 lander down and there it is we already have 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.850
 an inverse view what would be our 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.290
 our world to see if it is that that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.570
 we can find something interesting 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.820
 something I can tell you is that I do not 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.520
 use the trick when you are flying 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.730
 because it was time then to put what 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.940
 is the ndr pearl we put on and like I know 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.060
 how it works the game is blocked 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.979
 I stop so I do not get like this I should 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.580
 to remove the mode in mode where I am 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.560
 flying and then here we go back to what 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.820
 which is the normal view, let's do it 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.300
 in another place to see if we find 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.190
 something interesting and like I'm very 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.590
 We are going to go to the shore 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.360
 but in case doing this tutorial helps us 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.020
 very much to find what they are 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.970
 strengths as I said there are times 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.700
 we want to find pumpkin seeds 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.440
 etcetera and then this view of x-rays 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.110
 it helps us a lot also to 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.780
 find remains and then once 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.210
 we go down here we break here two others 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.950
 blocks because I then use the stone 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.310
 bright because then I put it when 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.950
 it's a bit dark I put it here 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.930
 and I sometimes play with the high-end to 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.849
 to help me find everything we are going to 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.319
 put here what is dynamite and 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.040
 lander prep 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.200
 As you can see, there is nothing interesting about 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.670
 done I do not think we're not going to use 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.670
 lacquer back 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.990
 As you can see we have found the portal 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.990
 allen and so we can face the inter 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.910
 I hope you like this video and then you 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.460
 I recommend that you use it in mode 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.680
 creative since usually I first 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.900
 When I find a seed, the work 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.810
 creative to explore it and then if I 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.200
 like and I find many biomes and the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.050
 I can create in survivor and already start 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.550
 play really what it looks like 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.530
 I hope you like this video this 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.140
 tutorial remember if you are without soul 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.760
 take care and I send many many 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.880
 Regards, be careful 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.880
 bye
