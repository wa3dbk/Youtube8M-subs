not<00:01:48.619> too<00:01:48.979> much<00:01:49.159> different<00:01:49.520> they're<00:01:49.759> $18

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
not too much different they're $18

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.840 
not too much different they're $18
retail<00:01:50.689> which<00:01:51.079> definitely<00:01:51.799> was<00:01:52.340> holding<00:01:52.759> me

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
retail which definitely was holding me

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.730 
retail which definitely was holding me
back<00:01:53.030> from<00:01:53.060> picking<00:01:53.450> these<00:01:53.630> up<00:01:53.810> compared<00:01:54.649> to

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
back from picking these up compared to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.990 
back from picking these up compared to
these<00:01:54.859> and<00:01:55.159> they're<00:01:55.340> honestly<00:01:55.640> aren't<00:01:55.820> that

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
these and they're honestly aren't that

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.310 
these and they're honestly aren't that
many<00:01:56.119> differences<00:01:56.539> but<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:56.899> haven't<00:01:57.079> played

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
many differences but I haven't played

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.709 
many differences but I haven't played
them<00:01:57.439> yet<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.429> guess<00:01:58.789> we'll<00:01:59.390> have<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.600> wait

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
them yet so I guess we'll have to wait

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.209 
them yet so I guess we'll have to wait
and<00:01:59.869> see<00:02:00.020> can't<00:02:00.500> knock<00:02:00.619> them<00:02:00.770> before<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.039> try

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
and see can't knock them before you try

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.950 
and see can't knock them before you try
them<00:02:01.340> out<00:02:01.460> but<00:02:01.820> um<00:02:01.969> as<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:02.630> can<00:02:02.719> see<00:02:02.810> they're<00:02:02.929> a

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
them out but um as you can see they're a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.080 
them out but um as you can see they're a
completely<00:02:03.320> different<00:02:03.469> material<00:02:03.820> this<00:02:04.820> feels

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
completely different material this feels

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.789 
completely different material this feels
like<00:02:05.149> they're<00:02:05.570> both<00:02:05.689> dry<00:02:06.049> fit<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:06.499> this<00:02:06.590> feels

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
like they're both dry fit but this feels

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.190 
like they're both dry fit but this feels
like<00:02:06.890> more<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.219> a<00:02:07.310> cotton<00:02:07.670> dry<00:02:07.880> fit<00:02:08.119> or<00:02:08.929> this

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
like more of a cotton dry fit or this

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.200 
like more of a cotton dry fit or this
feels<00:02:09.410> X<00:02:09.560> more<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:09.950> polyester<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.670> spandex

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
feels X more like polyester and spandex

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.360 
feels X more like polyester and spandex
and<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.810> kind<00:02:11.960> of<00:02:12.020> stuff<00:02:12.230> doesn't<00:02:13.159> feel<00:02:13.310> like

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and that kind of stuff doesn't feel like

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.869 
and that kind of stuff doesn't feel like
this<00:02:13.489> is<00:02:13.610> much<00:02:13.760> cotton<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:14.239> here<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:16.310> material

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
this is much cotton in here the material

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.700 
this is much cotton in here the material
I<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:17.090> definitely<00:02:17.300> relate<00:02:17.629> them<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:17.930> most

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
I can definitely relate them to most

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.730 
I can definitely relate them to most
is<00:02:18.770> these<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:20.180> vapor<00:02:20.450> crew<00:02:21.110> football<00:02:21.500> socks

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
is these the vapor crew football socks

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.100 
is these the vapor crew football socks
are<00:02:21.920> almost<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> same<00:02:22.370> exact<00:02:22.610> material<00:02:23.110> and

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
are almost the same exact material and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.590 
are almost the same exact material and
that's<00:02:24.560> why<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:24.800> was<00:02:25.550> not<00:02:25.730> feeling<00:02:26.180> picking

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
that's why I was not feeling picking

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.080 
that's why I was not feeling picking
these<00:02:26.690> up<00:02:26.750> because<00:02:27.530> these<00:02:28.310> personally<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.820> do

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
these up because these personally I do

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.910

can see right there they tend to get

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.900 
can see right there they tend to get
these<00:02:32.390> little<00:02:32.680> rips<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.920> them<00:02:34.070> not<00:02:34.850> very

these little rips in them not very
durable<00:02:35.240> material<00:02:35.960> type<00:02:36.950> assumes<00:02:37.190> right

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
see that but it's almost like fraying

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.610 
see that but it's almost like fraying

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.690 
you get those on the bottom and that
really<00:03:05.330> annoys<00:03:05.540> me<00:03:05.800> that's<00:03:06.800> why<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:06.980> definitely

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
really annoys me that's why I definitely

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.200 
really annoys me that's why I definitely
prefer<00:03:07.820> this<00:03:08.090> material<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:10.760> far<00:03:10.820> as

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
prefer this material as far as

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.240 
prefer this material as far as
aesthetics<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.990> mean<00:03:12.350> I<00:03:12.650> think<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:12.980> like<00:03:13.130> these

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
aesthetics I mean I think I like these

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.950 
aesthetics I mean I think I like these
ones<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.670> little<00:03:13.790> bit<00:03:14.000> butters<00:03:14.210> as<00:03:14.660> far<00:03:14.870> as

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
ones a little bit butters as far as

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.280 
ones a little bit butters as far as
looks<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:17.030> biggest<00:03:17.720> difference<00:03:18.050> you<00:03:18.110> guys

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
looks the biggest difference you guys

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.770 
looks the biggest difference you guys
can<00:03:18.470> see<00:03:18.620> pardon<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.130> stripe<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:20.630> have<00:03:20.750> a

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
can see pardon the stripe you have a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.420 
can see pardon the stripe you have a
little<00:03:20.990> knot<00:03:21.140> right<00:03:21.380> there<00:03:21.440> cut<00:03:21.830> out<00:03:21.980> or<00:03:22.340> if

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
little knot right there cut out or if

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.850 
little knot right there cut out or if
these<00:03:22.550> just<00:03:22.730> go<00:03:22.850> straight<00:03:23.120> down<00:03:23.860> also

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
these just go straight down also

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.620 
these just go straight down also
probably<00:03:25.370> one<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.910> biggest<00:03:26.180> differences

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
probably one of the biggest differences

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.210 
probably one of the biggest differences
is<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.960> bottom<00:03:27.380> padding<00:03:27.590> as<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.130> can<00:03:28.250> see

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
is the bottom padding as you can see

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.250 
is the bottom padding as you can see
this<00:03:31.220> comes<00:03:31.550> up<00:03:31.730> like<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:32.930> almost

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
this comes up like this to like almost

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.010 
this comes up like this to like almost
mimic<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.460> squid<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:35.270> last<00:03:35.540> square<00:03:35.780> right

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
mimic the squid the last square right

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.740 
mimic the squid the last square right
there<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.470> then<00:03:37.250> we<00:03:38.060> also<00:03:38.090> have<00:03:38.420> like<00:03:38.600> this

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
there and then we also have like this

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.310 
there and then we also have like this
kind<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.080> ridged<00:03:39.320> padding<00:03:39.830> its<00:03:40.670> ribbed<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.450> we

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
kind of ridged padding its ribbed so we

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.170 
kind of ridged padding its ribbed so we
can<00:03:42.560> it'll<00:03:43.250> probably<00:03:43.430> add<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.730> little<00:03:43.940> bit<00:03:44.060> more

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
can it'll probably add a little bit more

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.460 
can it'll probably add a little bit more
grip<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.510> your<00:03:44.630> shoe<00:03:44.810> maybe<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.170> little<00:03:45.290> bit

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
grip to your shoe maybe a little bit

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.860 
grip to your shoe maybe a little bit
better<00:03:45.830> ankle<00:03:46.490> lock<00:03:46.670> down<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.120> did<00:03:47.600> try<00:03:47.810> these

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
better ankle lock down I did try these

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.040 
better ankle lock down I did try these
on<00:03:48.230> with<00:03:49.070> my<00:03:49.310> Kobe<00:03:49.670> eight<00:03:49.760> your<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.780> snakes

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
on with my Kobe eight your the snakes

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.110 
on with my Kobe eight your the snakes
and<00:03:51.320> that's<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.340> reason<00:03:52.580> I<00:03:52.640> got<00:03:52.670> these<00:03:52.940> is

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
and that's the reason I got these is

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.490 
and that's the reason I got these is
actually<00:03:53.240> because<00:03:53.600> they<00:03:53.720> match<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.260> have<00:03:54.380> them

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
actually because they match I have them

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.590 
actually because they match I have them
right<00:03:54.650> here<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.940> color<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.300> these<00:03:56.420> is

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
right here the color on these is

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.940 
right here the color on these is
actually<00:03:56.870> kind<00:03:57.020> of<00:03:57.140> hard<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.320> explain<00:03:57.470> and

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
actually kind of hard to explain and

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.620 
actually kind of hard to explain and
personal<00:03:58.820> definitely<00:03:59.180> looks<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.330> little<00:03:59.420> bit

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
personal definitely looks a little bit

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.830 
personal definitely looks a little bit
orange<00:03:59.960> din<00:04:00.140> pink<00:04:00.380> then<00:04:00.920> on<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:01.670> camera<00:04:02.000> it's

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
orange din pink then on the camera it's

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.540 
orange din pink then on the camera it's
kind<00:04:03.050> of<00:04:03.080> like<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.260> total<00:04:03.830> crimson<00:04:04.190> if<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.400> guys

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
kind of like a total crimson if you guys

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.010 
kind of like a total crimson if you guys
know<00:04:04.700> what<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:04.850> color<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.360> it's<00:04:05.540> on<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.780> coat

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
know what that color is it's on the coat

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.330 
know what that color is it's on the coat
it's<00:04:06.110> like<00:04:06.230> on<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.530> swoosh<00:04:06.740> of<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.010> Kobe

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
it's like on the swoosh of the Kobe

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.360 
it's like on the swoosh of the Kobe
eight<00:04:07.520> let's<00:04:07.850> blues<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.570> it's<00:04:09.410> on<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.100> those

black in total crimson LeBron lows but

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.000 
black in total crimson LeBron lows but
basically<00:04:15.080> it<00:04:15.230> matches<00:04:15.530> pretty<00:04:15.710> nice<00:04:15.860> with

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
basically it matches pretty nice with

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.520 
basically it matches pretty nice with
the<00:04:16.100> inner<00:04:16.220> liner<00:04:16.489> of<00:04:16.670> these<00:04:17.049> as<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.170> guys<00:04:18.320> can

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
the inner liner of these as you guys can

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.740 
the inner liner of these as you guys can
see<00:04:18.590> right<00:04:18.950> there<00:04:19.250> put<00:04:20.030> them<00:04:20.180> actually<00:04:20.480> inside

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
see right there put them actually inside

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.280 
see right there put them actually inside
the<00:04:20.810> shoe<00:04:21.610> as<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:22.910> can<00:04:23.030> see<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:23.810> it's<00:04:24.050> pretty

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
the shoe as you can see so it's pretty

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.500 
the shoe as you can see so it's pretty
close<00:04:24.530> not<00:04:25.280> an<00:04:25.400> exact<00:04:25.700> match<00:04:25.880> but<00:04:26.240> it's<00:04:26.330> pretty

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
close not an exact match but it's pretty

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.880 
close not an exact match but it's pretty
close<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:27.110> definitely<00:04:27.470> looks<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> little<00:04:27.680> bit

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
close it definitely looks a little bit

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.350 
close it definitely looks a little bit
more<00:04:28.010> orange<00:04:28.370> than<00:04:28.460> it's<00:04:28.940> showing<00:04:29.150> up<00:04:29.240> on

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
more orange than it's showing up on

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.970 
more orange than it's showing up on
camera<00:04:29.660> though<00:04:29.780> it's<00:04:30.350> basically<00:04:30.620> just<00:04:30.770> like<00:04:30.860> a

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
camera though it's basically just like a

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.850 
camera though it's basically just like a
really<00:04:31.160> bright

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
really bright

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.600 
really bright
orange<00:04:32.129> /<00:04:33.060> red<00:04:33.719> /<00:04:34.319> pink<00:04:34.710> either<00:04:35.460> definitely

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
orange / red / pink either definitely

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.830 
orange / red / pink either definitely
the<00:04:35.849> brightest<00:04:36.150> socks<00:04:36.389> I've<00:04:36.539> ever<00:04:36.659> seen

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
the brightest socks I've ever seen

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.200 
the brightest socks I've ever seen
though<00:04:37.050> they're<00:04:37.289> extremely<00:04:37.919> bright<00:04:38.210> anyway

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
though they're extremely bright anyway

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.550 
though they're extremely bright anyway
back<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.419> what<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:39.930> was<00:04:40.020> saying

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
back to what I was saying

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.450 
back to what I was saying
kind<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:40.889> got<00:04:40.979> sidetracked<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:43.020> padding<00:04:43.460> is

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
kind of got sidetracked the padding is

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.399 
kind of got sidetracked the padding is
basically<00:04:44.819> just<00:04:44.939> ribbed<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:45.870> if<00:04:46.259> just

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 
basically just ribbed and if just

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:48.860 
basically just ribbed and if just
ignorant<00:04:46.620> maybe<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:46.979> little<00:04:47.189> bit<00:04:47.340> more<00:04:47.599> than<00:04:48.599> a

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
ignorant maybe a little bit more than a

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.020 
ignorant maybe a little bit more than a
traditional<00:04:49.080> pair<00:04:49.590> of<00:04:49.830> elites<00:04:50.189> but

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
traditional pair of elites but

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.420 
traditional pair of elites but
definitely<00:04:51.360> underfoot<00:04:51.960> padding<00:04:52.379> as<00:04:53.189> you<00:04:53.280> can

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
definitely underfoot padding as you can

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.369 
definitely underfoot padding as you can
see<00:04:53.639> it<00:04:54.569> definitely<00:04:54.960> doesn't<00:04:55.080> feel<00:04:55.199> like

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
see it definitely doesn't feel like

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.649 
see it definitely doesn't feel like
there's<00:04:55.560> as<00:04:55.680> much<00:04:55.860> as<00:04:56.099> your<00:04:56.939> traditional<00:04:57.419> pair

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
there's as much as your traditional pair

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.679 
there's as much as your traditional pair
of<00:04:57.750> elites<00:04:58.789> because<00:04:59.789> as<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.210> can<00:05:00.300> see<00:05:00.360> on<00:05:00.599> the

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 
of elites because as you can see on the

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.420 
of elites because as you can see on the
elites<00:05:00.960> hickey<00:05:01.259> we<00:05:01.349> have<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.740> cushioning

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
elites hickey we have the cushioning

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.610 
elites hickey we have the cushioning
then<00:05:03.060> we<00:05:03.240> have<00:05:03.389> your<00:05:03.599> compression<00:05:04.110> in<00:05:04.319> the<00:05:04.349> mid

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
then we have your compression in the mid

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.379 
then we have your compression in the mid
foot<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.250> then<00:05:05.430> we<00:05:05.520> have<00:05:05.699> more<00:05:05.969> cushioning<00:05:06.270> on

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
foot and then we have more cushioning on

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.570 
foot and then we have more cushioning on
the<00:05:06.479> heel<00:05:06.659> that<00:05:06.870> goes<00:05:07.050> up<00:05:07.199> to<00:05:07.289> the<00:05:07.379> ankle<00:05:07.580> on

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
the heel that goes up to the ankle on

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.429 
the heel that goes up to the ankle on
these<00:05:08.849> it's<00:05:09.120> basically<00:05:09.389> just<00:05:09.479> straight

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:10.439 
these it's basically just straight

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.140 
these it's basically just straight
cushioning<00:05:10.949> all<00:05:11.159> over<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.819> then<00:05:11.909> we<00:05:11.939> have

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
cushioning all over and then we have

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.260 
cushioning all over and then we have
right<00:05:13.080> here's<00:05:13.349> a<00:05:13.439> little<00:05:13.710> bit<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:13.919> compression

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
right here's a little bit of compression

one<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.139> main<00:05:28.289> reasons<00:05:28.620> I<00:05:28.680> picked<00:05:28.889> them<00:05:29.039> up

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
one of the main reasons I picked them up

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:30.559 
one of the main reasons I picked them up
I<00:05:29.400> thought<00:05:29.849> you<00:05:29.969> guys<00:05:30.090> would<00:05:30.300> like<00:05:30.419> to<00:05:30.449> see

I thought you guys would like to see
also<00:05:31.469> like<00:05:31.830> I<00:05:31.949> said<00:05:32.159> the<00:05:32.370> colorway<00:05:32.699> looks

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
also like I said the colorway looks

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.490 
also like I said the colorway looks
pretty<00:05:33.090> nice<00:05:33.270> with<00:05:33.419> these<00:05:33.599> so<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.050> decided<00:05:34.439> to

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
pretty nice with these so I decided to

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.709 
pretty nice with these so I decided to
pick<00:05:34.650> them<00:05:34.800> up<00:05:34.949> and<00:05:35.759> I<00:05:35.819> just<00:05:36.330> really<00:05:36.539> curious

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
pick them up and I just really curious

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:37.309

about<00:05:37.050> them

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
about them

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.689 
about them
another<00:05:37.740> thing<00:05:37.949> that<00:05:38.129> I<00:05:38.159> definitely<00:05:38.310> think<00:05:38.520> is

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
another thing that I definitely think is

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.300 
another thing that I definitely think is
really<00:05:38.909> cool<00:05:39.229> as<00:05:40.229> you<00:05:40.589> guys<00:05:40.710> might<00:05:40.919> noticed

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
really cool as you guys might noticed

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.809 
really cool as you guys might noticed
the<00:05:41.699> swoosh<00:05:42.029> is<00:05:42.330> actually<00:05:42.810> pretty<00:05:43.050> low<00:05:43.289> on<00:05:43.819> the

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:44.819 
the swoosh is actually pretty low on the

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:47.570 
the swoosh is actually pretty low on the
sock<00:05:45.289> compared<00:05:46.289> to<00:05:46.560> your<00:05:46.949> regular<00:05:46.979> pair<00:05:47.550> of

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
sock compared to your regular pair of

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.149 
sock compared to your regular pair of
elite<00:05:47.909> wears<00:05:48.360> this<00:05:48.509> right<00:05:49.469> here<00:05:49.740> as<00:05:49.919> you<00:05:50.009> can

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
elite wears this right here as you can

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.899 
elite wears this right here as you can
see<00:05:50.279> definitely<00:05:51.029> a<00:05:51.330> lot<00:05:51.839> lower<00:05:52.430> so<00:05:53.430> when<00:05:53.819> you

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
see definitely a lot lower so when you

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.760 
see definitely a lot lower so when you
fold<00:05:54.089> this<00:05:54.330> down<00:05:54.389> I<00:05:54.900> actually<00:05:55.349> have<00:05:55.589> enough

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
fold this down I actually have enough

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.499 
fold this down I actually have enough
room<00:05:56.009> to<00:05:56.039> fold<00:05:56.339> it<00:05:56.520> down<00:05:56.550> without<00:05:57.150> covering<00:05:57.449> up

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
room to fold it down without covering up

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.499 
room to fold it down without covering up
a<00:05:57.539> swoosh<00:05:57.870> it<00:05:58.589> says<00:05:58.800> hyper<00:05:59.069> elite<00:05:59.699> in<00:05:59.909> the

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
a swoosh it says hyper elite in the

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.869 
a swoosh it says hyper elite in the
front<00:06:00.949> which<00:06:01.949> is<00:06:01.979> definitely<00:06:02.219> really<00:06:02.610> cool<00:06:02.849> I

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:02.879 
front which is definitely really cool I

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:03.980 
front which is definitely really cool I
think<00:06:03.060> that's<00:06:03.270> how<00:06:03.360> I'm<00:06:03.419> gonna<00:06:03.539> be<00:06:03.629> rocking

think that's how I'm gonna be rocking

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.730 
think that's how I'm gonna be rocking
them<00:06:04.110> I<00:06:04.319> think<00:06:04.710> that<00:06:04.860> looks<00:06:05.039> pretty<00:06:05.159> nice

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.019 
them I think that looks pretty nice
but<00:06:07.740> yeah<00:06:08.009> that's<00:06:08.129> pretty<00:06:08.219> much<00:06:08.400> it<00:06:08.610> for<00:06:08.909> the

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.029 
but yeah that's pretty much it for the

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:10.640

understand the point of that but kind of

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.540 
understand the point of that but kind of
it<00:06:16.349> really<00:06:16.529> felt<00:06:16.710> weird<00:06:16.949> when<00:06:17.099> I<00:06:17.129> first<00:06:17.339> tried

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
socks and the hyper leads i'll put them

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.629 
socks and the hyper leads i'll put them
on<00:06:40.139> top<00:06:40.349> of<00:06:40.500> each<00:06:40.649> other<00:06:40.770> for<00:06:41.039> you<00:06:41.159> guys<00:06:41.310> right

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
on top of each other for you guys right

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.340 
on top of each other for you guys right
here<00:06:41.909> like<00:06:42.750> just<00:06:42.930> parallel

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.770 

so<00:06:46.350> as<00:06:46.500> you<00:06:46.650> can<00:06:46.740> see<00:06:46.800> the<00:06:47.700> bottoms<00:06:48.120> are<00:06:48.330> lined

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
so as you can see the bottoms are lined

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.180 
so as you can see the bottoms are lined
up<00:06:49.020> and<00:06:51.200> there's<00:06:52.200> that<00:06:52.380> the<00:06:52.620> hyper<00:06:52.860> leads<00:06:53.100> are

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
up and there's that the hyper leads are

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.640 
up and there's that the hyper leads are
definitely<00:06:53.610> longer<00:06:53.850> I<00:06:54.210> think<00:06:54.990> that's<00:06:55.140> just

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
definitely longer I think that's just

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.310 
definitely longer I think that's just
because<00:06:55.770> they're<00:06:56.580> liking<00:06:57.240> it<00:06:57.420> intended<00:06:58.110> to<00:06:58.170> do
