00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.139 
PDP is um I guess a company based in
China<00:00:45.120> probably<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.500> anyway<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.879> handy

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
China probably but anyway it's a handy

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.819 
China probably but anyway it's a handy
little<00:00:48.180> device<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.020> big<00:00:49.320> hands<00:00:49.590> like

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the grip just like it would be on a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.539

controller<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.520> PlayStation<00:01:32.520> 3

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
controller like a PlayStation 3

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.179 
controller like a PlayStation 3
controller<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.869> yeah<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> mean<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.680> it's

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
controller so yeah I mean it's it's

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.710 
controller so yeah I mean it's it's
really<00:01:35.520> something<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> know<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> look

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
really something that you know to look

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.630 
really something that you know to look
forward<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.799> big<00:01:38.009> hands<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
forward to if you have big hands and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.130 
forward to if you have big hands and
you're<00:01:38.909> doing<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.180> lot<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.360> fighting<00:01:39.630> games<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you're doing a lot of fighting games and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
you're doing a lot of fighting games and
stuff<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.130> mean<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.759> think<00:01:41.820> actually

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
stuff like that I mean I think actually

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.050 
stuff like that I mean I think actually
it<00:01:42.840> still<00:01:43.140> leaves<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> back<00:01:44.159> open<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it still leaves the back open for the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
it still leaves the back open for the
touchscreen<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> back<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.710> see

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
touchscreen on the back as you can see

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.069 
touchscreen on the back as you can see
and<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.430> little<00:01:47.670> spot<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> camera<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.049> you

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and a little spot for the camera so you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.859 
and a little spot for the camera so you
don't<00:01:49.320> lose<00:01:49.470> anything<00:01:49.740> which<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> great<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.540> um

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
don't lose anything which is great so um

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.240 
don't lose anything which is great so um
