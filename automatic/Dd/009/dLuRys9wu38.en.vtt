00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
comes from Jacob Pruitt I believe and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.560 
comes from Jacob Pruitt I believe and
his<00:00:43.410> question<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.980> why<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.730> big<00:00:44.910> bucks<00:00:45.210> so

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
his question is why are big bucks so

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
his question is why are big bucks so
hard<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> kill<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.710> that's<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> great<00:00:47.309> question

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
hard to kill and that's a great question

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.060 
hard to kill and that's a great question
and<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.510> think<00:00:48.570> I'm<00:00:49.170> constantly

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and one that I think I'm constantly

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
and one that I think I'm constantly
asking<00:00:50.460> myself<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.000> I'm<00:00:51.059> sure<00:00:51.239> many<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.570> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
asking myself and I'm sure many of you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.600 
asking myself and I'm sure many of you
are<00:00:51.840> too<00:00:52.160> it's<00:00:53.160> kind<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.370> complicated

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
are too it's kind of complicated

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520 
are too it's kind of complicated
question<00:00:54.270> two<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.629> could<00:00:54.780> talk<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.199> four

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
question two and we could talk for four

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.990 
question two and we could talk for four
hours<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.340> I'll<00:00:56.430> try<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.670> kind<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
hours about it but I'll try to kind of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.439 
hours about it but I'll try to kind of
break<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> down<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.750> three<00:00:57.980> major<00:00:58.980> points

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
break it down to three major points

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.260 
break it down to three major points
number<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.780> big<00:01:01.710> bucks<00:01:01.980> became<00:01:02.789> big<00:01:03.030> bucks

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
number one big bucks became big bucks

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.440 
number one big bucks became big bucks
for<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> reason<00:01:04.080> they're<00:01:04.680> old<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.339> old<00:01:06.119> bucks

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
for a reason they're old and old bucks

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.390 
for a reason they're old and old bucks
get<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.869> way<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:07.979> things

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
get that way because they do things

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.710 
get that way because they do things
differently<00:01:08.820> than<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> deer<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.540> get

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
differently than the deer that get

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
differently than the deer that get
killed<00:01:10.080> when<00:01:10.260> they're<00:01:10.439> young<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> would<00:01:11.850> say

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
killed when they're young so I would say

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.260 
killed when they're young so I would say
that<00:01:12.060> big<00:01:12.390> bucks<00:01:12.659> are<00:01:12.900> naturally

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
that big bucks are naturally

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.060 
that big bucks are naturally
predisposition<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.960> become<00:01:16.259> older<00:01:16.590> by<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
predisposition to become older by that I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070 
predisposition to become older by that I
mean<00:01:17.310> natural<00:01:17.729> selection<00:01:18.299> has<00:01:18.330> allowed<00:01:18.780> them

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
mean natural selection has allowed them

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.649 
mean natural selection has allowed them
to<00:01:19.110> make<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.830> other<00:01:20.369> bucks<00:01:20.640> didn't<00:01:21.180> y

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
to make it and other bucks didn't y

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.200 
to make it and other bucks didn't y
prime<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.860> these<00:01:22.979> deer<00:01:23.280> were<00:01:23.490> smarter<00:01:24.000> in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
prime because these deer were smarter in

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
prime because these deer were smarter in
regards<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.900> maybe<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.409> movie<00:01:25.619> as<00:01:25.770> much

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
regards to maybe that movie as much

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.249 
regards to maybe that movie as much
during<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> daylight<00:01:26.460> maybe<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.570> were<00:01:27.630> more

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
during the daylight maybe they were more

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.440 
during the daylight maybe they were more
I'm<00:01:28.560> adverse<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.280> human<00:01:29.790> pressure<00:01:30.090> whatever

I'm adverse to human pressure whatever

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179 
I'm adverse to human pressure whatever
was<00:01:30.900> there's<00:01:31.259> something<00:01:31.560> naturally<00:01:32.100> about

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
was there's something naturally about

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
was there's something naturally about
these<00:01:32.520> deer<00:01:32.790> individually<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.990> allow<00:01:34.320> them

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
these deer individually that allow them

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
these deer individually that allow them
to<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.890> mature<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.610> allowed<00:01:35.939> them<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> get

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
to get mature that allowed them to get

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.100 
to get mature that allowed them to get
big<00:01:36.890> now<00:01:37.890> number<00:01:38.220> two<00:01:38.490> big<00:01:39.329> bucks<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:39.810> hard<00:01:39.990> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
big now number two big bucks are hard to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.800 
big now number two big bucks are hard to
kill<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:41.250> once<00:01:42.000> they<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.600> big

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
kill because once they get to be big

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899 
kill because once they get to be big
again<00:01:43.049> they've<00:01:43.649> gotten<00:01:43.979> old<00:01:44.130> they've<00:01:44.640> learned

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
again they've gotten old they've learned

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.910 
again they've gotten old they've learned
a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.299> lessons<00:01:45.479> once<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.229> deer<00:01:46.439> makes<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
a lot of lessons once a deer makes to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.039 
a lot of lessons once a deer makes to
that<00:01:47.040> age<00:01:47.250> they've<00:01:47.909> been<00:01:48.420> through<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> ringer

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that age they've been through the ringer

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
that age they've been through the ringer
they've<00:01:49.530> seen<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> lot<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.100> hunters<00:01:50.460> they've

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
they've seen a lot of hunters they've

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.130 
they've seen a lot of hunters they've
seen<00:01:51.119> what<00:01:51.240> we're<00:01:51.420> doing<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.869> they've

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
seen what we're doing and they've

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.560 
seen what we're doing and they've
learned<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.560> adapt<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.329> when<00:01:54.329> they<00:01:54.450> had

learned to adapt to that when they had
death<00:01:54.810> they've<00:01:55.110> essentially<00:01:55.439> become

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
death they've essentially become

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.859 
death they've essentially become
different<00:01:56.100> kinds<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.490> animals<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.060> mean<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.570> four

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
different kinds of animals I mean a four

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
different kinds of animals I mean a four
year<00:01:58.049> old<00:01:58.170> buck<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:59.060> completely<00:02:00.060> different

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
year old buck is completely different

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.760 
year old buck is completely different
than<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.600> year<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.960> half<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> way<00:02:01.619> he

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
than a year and half just the way he

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.679 
than a year and half just the way he
behaves<00:02:02.159> where<00:02:02.520> he<00:02:02.670> spends<00:02:02.909> his<00:02:03.000> time<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.630> he

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
behaves where he spends his time how he

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.630 
behaves where he spends his time how he
moves<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.290> he<00:02:04.380> moves<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:04.860> those<00:02:05.310> things<00:02:05.549> are

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
moves when he moves all those things are

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.280 
moves when he moves all those things are
so<00:02:05.820> different<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:06.570> why<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.020> much

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
so different so that's why it's so much

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.740 
so different so that's why it's so much
harder<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.710> kill<00:02:07.920> big<00:02:08.099> buck<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
harder to kill big buck because if you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.240 
harder to kill big buck because if you
aren't<00:02:09.929> out<00:02:10.140> there<00:02:10.170> trying<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.770> hunt<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.069> big

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
aren't out there trying to hunt a big

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
aren't out there trying to hunt a big
buck<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.730> same<00:02:11.940> way

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
buck the same way

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.030 
buck the same way
would<00:02:12.390> hunt<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.870> three-pointer<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.980> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
would hunt that three-pointer that you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.640 
would hunt that three-pointer that you
see<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> time<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:15.260> completely<00:02:16.260> different

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
see all the time is completely different

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.130 
see all the time is completely different
those<00:02:16.860> two<00:02:17.100> deer<00:02:17.370> live<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.210> rec<00:02:18.660> two<00:02:18.900> things

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
those two deer live and rec two things

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.750 
those two deer live and rec two things
completely<00:02:19.560> different<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.550> can't

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
completely different so you just can't

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.960 
completely different so you just can't
have<00:02:20.940> hunt<00:02:21.210> them<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> same<00:02:21.690> way<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.280> again

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
have hunt them the same way so again

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.030 
have hunt them the same way so again
these<00:02:24.480> big<00:02:24.750> bucks<00:02:24.990> are<00:02:25.200> mature<00:02:25.590> bucks<00:02:25.800> they've

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
these big bucks are mature bucks they've

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.770 
these big bucks are mature bucks they've
been<00:02:26.220> through<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.430> rare<00:02:26.610> they<00:02:27.030> learn<00:02:27.300> lessons

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
been through the rare they learn lessons

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.260 
been through the rare they learn lessons
they<00:02:28.410> are<00:02:28.530> doing<00:02:28.740> things<00:02:29.010> much<00:02:29.220> differently

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
they are doing things much differently

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.680 
they are doing things much differently
now<00:02:30.410> what<00:02:31.410> does<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.710> mean<00:02:32.240> really<00:02:33.240> kind<00:02:33.540> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
now what does that mean really kind of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.080 
now what does that mean really kind of
in<00:02:33.890> connection<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.920> humans<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.520> means<00:02:35.940> that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
in connection to humans it means that

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.120 
in connection to humans it means that
these<00:02:36.210> big<00:02:36.420> bucks<00:02:36.720> they<00:02:37.020> react<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.560> humans

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
these big bucks they react to humans

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.890 
these big bucks they react to humans
much<00:02:38.430> differently<00:02:38.910> than<00:02:39.000> small<00:02:39.630> bucks

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
much differently than small bucks

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.980 
much differently than small bucks
meaning<00:02:40.410> young<00:02:40.680> bucks<00:02:40.950> big<00:02:41.700> bucks<00:02:41.730> /<00:02:42.510> mature

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
meaning young bucks big bucks / mature

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.040 
meaning young bucks big bucks / mature
bucks<00:02:43.260> don't<00:02:44.070> take<00:02:44.490> pressure<00:02:44.910> when<00:02:45.720> human

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
bucks don't take pressure when human

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.900 
bucks don't take pressure when human
pressure<00:02:46.350> comes<00:02:46.740> in<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.400> when<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.610> hunter

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
pressure comes in so when a hunter

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.670 
pressure comes in so when a hunter
starts<00:02:48.180> hunting<00:02:48.360> an<00:02:48.540> area<00:02:48.810> those<00:02:49.260> big<00:02:49.440> bucks

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
starts hunting an area those big bucks

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.350 
starts hunting an area those big bucks
immediately<00:02:50.220> pick<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.030> they're

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
immediately pick up on it and they're

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.150 
immediately pick up on it and they're
out<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.510> there<00:02:51.750> or<00:02:51.930> they<00:02:52.170> become<00:02:52.260> nocturnal<00:02:52.620> or

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
out of there or they become nocturnal or

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.190 
out of there or they become nocturnal or
they<00:02:53.400> change<00:02:53.760> their<00:02:53.970> travel<00:02:54.300> patterns<00:02:54.660> they

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
they change their travel patterns they

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.020 
they change their travel patterns they
know<00:02:55.440> how<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.650> react<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.010> humans<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.670> avoid

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
know how to react to humans to avoid

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.520 
know how to react to humans to avoid
them<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.020> biggest<00:02:58.260> difference

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
them and that's the biggest difference

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.860 
them and that's the biggest difference
between<00:02:58.740> big<00:02:59.160> bucks<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.610> little<00:03:00.480> ones<00:03:00.630> and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
between big bucks and little ones and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.570 
between big bucks and little ones and
why<00:03:00.990> it's<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.320> much<00:03:01.500> harder<00:03:01.530> because<00:03:02.220> big

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
why it's so much harder because big

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.400 
why it's so much harder because big
bucks<00:03:02.850> will<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.270> tolerate<00:03:03.630> hunting<00:03:04.230> pressure

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
bucks will not tolerate hunting pressure

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.370 
bucks will not tolerate hunting pressure
and<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:05.610> really<00:03:05.970> can't<00:03:06.480> make<00:03:06.630> mistakes<00:03:07.080> if

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
and you really can't make mistakes if

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.980 
and you really can't make mistakes if
you<00:03:07.950> blow<00:03:08.220> up<00:03:08.250> one<00:03:08.640> time<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.240> you<00:03:09.330> spoke<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.810> big

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
you blow up one time and you spoke a big

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.320 
you blow up one time and you spoke a big
buck<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.650> may<00:03:10.770> never<00:03:10.920> see<00:03:11.040> him<00:03:11.280> again<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.880> you

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
buck you may never see him again if you

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.600 
buck you may never see him again if you
screw<00:03:12.810> up<00:03:12.900> one<00:03:13.320> time<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.620> walk<00:03:14.070> across<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
screw up one time and walk across the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.130 
screw up one time and walk across the
path<00:03:14.820> that<00:03:15.030> deer<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.420> going<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.900> walking

path that deer is going to be walking

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.080 
path that deer is going to be walking
later<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.770> day<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.190> he<00:03:17.220> smells<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.820> because

later that day and he smells you because

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.340 
later that day and he smells you because
you<00:03:18.270> weren't<00:03:18.420> careful<00:03:18.660> about<00:03:18.990> your<00:03:19.140> son

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
you weren't careful about your son

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.199 
you weren't careful about your son
control<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.190> may<00:03:20.310> never<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.760> big<00:03:21.030> buck

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
control you may never see that big buck

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.860 
control you may never see that big buck
again<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.730> no<00:03:23.940> room<00:03:24.480> for<00:03:24.690> error

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
again so you just have no room for error

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.770 
again so you just have no room for error
with<00:03:25.200> big<00:03:25.380> deer<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.640> think<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.420> know<00:03:27.450> in

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
with big deer so I think you know in

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.840 
with big deer so I think you know in
summary<00:03:28.380> if<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.830> had<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.130> really<00:03:29.310> narrow<00:03:29.580> down

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
summary if I had to really narrow down

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.150 
summary if I had to really narrow down
to<00:03:29.910> these<00:03:30.090> three<00:03:30.420> things<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:31.380> know<00:03:31.470> big<00:03:31.950> bucks
