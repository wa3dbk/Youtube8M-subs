00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
to ino hammocks one of these is my

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.479 
to ino hammocks one of these is my
single<00:00:35.410> nest<00:00:35.590> you<00:00:35.800> know<00:00:35.830> and<00:00:36.130> when<00:00:36.220> it<00:00:36.280> was<00:00:36.370> my

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
single nest you know and when it was my

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:37.740 
single nest you know and when it was my
SS<00:00:36.910> you<00:00:37.059> know<00:00:37.090> and<00:00:37.300> actually<00:00:37.360> this<00:00:37.570> is<00:00:37.720> the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
SS you know and actually this is the

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.930 
SS you know and actually this is the
singleness<00:00:38.140> you<00:00:38.470> know<00:00:38.650> and<00:00:38.890> this<00:00:39.610> is<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.790> double

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
singleness you know and this is a double

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.270 
singleness you know and this is a double
at<00:00:40.150> nest<00:00:40.390> so<00:00:40.780> you<00:00:41.080> know<00:00:41.200> this<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.680> size<00:00:41.860> is<00:00:42.160> the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
at nest so you know this the size is the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.100 
at nest so you know this the size is the
difference<00:00:42.640> but<00:00:43.059> of<00:00:43.150> course<00:00:43.360> all<00:00:43.629> packed<00:00:43.900> up

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
difference but of course all packed up

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.799 
difference but of course all packed up
their<00:00:44.260> relatively<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.830> same<00:00:44.920> size<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:46.210> i<00:00:46.510> just

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
their relatively the same size so i just

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:47.939 
their relatively the same size so i just
got<00:00:46.960> this<00:00:47.050> one<00:00:47.230> for<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.379> holidays<00:00:47.650> haven't

the double nest on top and the single
nest<00:01:14.110> on<00:01:14.290> bottom<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:14.770> at<00:01:14.860> first<00:01:15.070> I<00:01:15.220> was

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
nest on bottom and at first I was

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.950 
nest on bottom and at first I was
actually<00:01:15.399> very<00:01:15.580> difficult<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.360> perceive<00:01:16.690> any

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
actually very difficult to perceive any

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.170 
actually very difficult to perceive any
difference<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.590> let<00:01:18.190> me<00:01:18.280> just<00:01:18.460> show<00:01:18.970> you<00:01:19.000> my

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
difference and let me just show you my

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.969 
difference and let me just show you my
crude<00:01:19.450> way<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.600> measurement<00:01:20.140> grabbing<00:01:20.890> the

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
crude way of measurement grabbing the

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.680 
crude way of measurement grabbing the
syndrome<00:01:21.340> where<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.550> bag<00:01:21.759> is<00:01:21.789> right<00:01:22.270> here<00:01:22.539> I

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
syndrome where the bag is right here I

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.050 
syndrome where the bag is right here I
just<00:01:23.470> push<00:01:23.710> down<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.100> center<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.909> this

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
just push down to the center and this

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.850 
just push down to the center and this
will<00:01:25.210> cover<00:01:25.330> up<00:01:25.570> my<00:01:25.690> shoulder<00:01:25.990> up<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.710> my

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
will cover up my shoulder up to my

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.390 
will cover up my shoulder up to my
armpit<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.810> one<00:01:28.930> below<00:01:29.290> doing<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.190> same

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
armpit on the one below doing the same

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.149 
armpit on the one below doing the same
test<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:34.180> goes<00:01:34.450> right<00:01:34.750> past<00:01:35.229> my<00:01:35.619> elbow<00:01:35.950> so

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
test it goes right past my elbow so

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.200 
test it goes right past my elbow so
there's<00:01:36.310> definitely<00:01:36.490> some<00:01:36.850> volume

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
there's definitely some volume

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.240 
there's definitely some volume
difference<00:01:37.420> even<00:01:37.810> though<00:01:38.170> in<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.740> packing

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
difference even though in the packing

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.280 
difference even though in the packing
and<00:01:39.400> when<00:01:39.549> I<00:01:39.610> you<00:01:39.670> know<00:01:40.000> actually<00:01:40.299> unfolded<00:01:41.049> I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
and when I you know actually unfolded I

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.780 
and when I you know actually unfolded I
didn't<00:01:41.710> perceive<00:01:41.979> much<00:01:42.220> difference<00:01:42.610> and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
didn't perceive much difference and

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.190 
didn't perceive much difference and
actually<00:01:43.270> we<00:01:43.330> had<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.479> volunteer<00:01:43.600> you're

like yours so pretty good I actually at

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.350 
like yours so pretty good I actually at
first<00:02:51.130> thought<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.819> hardware<00:02:52.209> is<00:02:52.330> a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
first thought that the hardware is a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.090 
first thought that the hardware is a
little<00:02:52.600> bit<00:02:52.720> more<00:02:52.840> heavier<00:02:53.170> gauge<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:54.040> it

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
little bit more heavier gauge but it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.350 
little bit more heavier gauge but it
looks<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.370> be<00:02:54.489> about<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.819> same<00:02:55.000> thickness

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
looks to be about the same thickness

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.020 
looks to be about the same thickness
this<00:02:56.110> right<00:02:56.380> here's<00:02:56.590> my<00:02:56.799> my<00:02:57.670> hammock

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.370 
spring time actually I use this probably
exclusively<00:04:13.450> last<00:04:13.840> summer<00:04:14.110> when<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.350> was

a little bit more superior choice I

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.290 
a little bit more superior choice I
always<00:04:21.160> felt<00:04:21.430> kind<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.730> cramped<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.210> the

shoulders<00:04:22.750> with<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.380> single<00:04:23.770> nest<00:04:23.950> unless<00:04:24.190> I

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
shoulders with the single nest unless I

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.330 
shoulders with the single nest unless I
had<00:04:24.520> my<00:04:24.700> mat<00:04:25.480> in<00:04:25.690> there<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.960> kind<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.170> help

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
course this is damaged someone so I'm

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.860 
course this is damaged someone so I'm
probably<00:05:12.100> find<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.520> way<00:05:12.669> to<00:05:12.730> patch<00:05:13.600> that<00:05:13.810> up

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
probably find a way to patch that up

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.420 
probably find a way to patch that up
somehow<00:05:14.169> this<00:05:14.680> is<00:05:14.890> probably<00:05:15.100> going<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.340> be

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
somehow this is probably going to be

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.520 
somehow this is probably going to be
going<00:05:15.669> by<00:05:16.030> pretty<00:05:16.810> soon<00:05:17.080> I'm<00:05:17.230> not<00:05:17.260> going<00:05:17.470> to

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
going by pretty soon I'm not going to

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.870 
going by pretty soon I'm not going to
take<00:05:17.800> this<00:05:17.950> anymore<00:05:18.250> trips<00:05:18.550> i'll<00:05:18.730> probably

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
take this anymore trips i'll probably

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.040 
take this anymore trips i'll probably
leave<00:05:19.030> this<00:05:19.210> for<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.419> kids<00:05:19.600> because<00:05:19.870> they're

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
leave this for the kids because they're

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.620 
leave this for the kids because they're
lighter<00:05:20.320> weight<00:05:20.700> probably<00:05:21.700> won't<00:05:21.850> affect<00:05:22.480> us

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630
