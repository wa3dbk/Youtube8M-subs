stockinette<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> nature<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
stockinette because of the nature of

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.660 
stockinette because of the nature of
having<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:22.110> knit<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.440> one<00:01:22.649> side<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.280> purl

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

on<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.030> other<00:01:24.240> side<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.430> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
on the other side just like it is it is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.109 
on the other side just like it is it is
going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.329> curl<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.470> counteract<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.310> by

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
going to curl you can counteract that by

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.960 
going to curl you can counteract that by
doing<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.750> different<00:01:31.229> stitch<00:01:31.970> combination

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
along the edge here I did a seed stitch

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.539 
along the edge here I did a seed stitch

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
have to do it as big you can use much

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.510 
have to do it as big you can use much
less<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.060> border<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.469> do<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.399> will

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
less of a border and if you do you will

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.139 
less of a border and if you do you will
still<00:01:50.820> get<00:01:50.969> the<00:01:51.030> same<00:01:51.360> results<00:01:52.140> of

still get the same results of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.370 
still get the same results of
stabilizing<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> edge<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.869> having<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> not

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
stabilizing the edge and having it not

stabilizing the edge and having it not
curl<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.719> thing<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.079> keep<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.380> mind

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
curl so just one thing to keep in mind

when<00:01:58.979> you're<00:01:59.100> doing<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.479> just

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
when you're doing this is that just

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.959 
when you're doing this is that just
because<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.950> curl<00:02:02.310> doesn't<00:02:02.790> mean

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
because it's going to curl doesn't mean

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.179 
because it's going to curl doesn't mean
you<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.079> suck<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.409> up<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.680> live<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
you have to suck it up and live with it

you have to suck it up and live with it
there<00:02:05.340> are<00:02:05.369> ways<00:02:05.759> around<00:02:05.789> it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.880

Row one and this pattern is knit the
stitches<00:02:33.220> across<00:02:33.520> that's<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:39.060> once<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.240> reach

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
stitches across that's it once I reach

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.300 
stitches across that's it once I reach
the<00:02:41.170> end<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> row<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.190> go<00:02:42.940> ahead<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:44.040> turn<00:02:45.040> my

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the end of the row I go ahead I turn my

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.740 
the end of the row I go ahead I turn my
work<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.200> once<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.560> turn<00:02:50.830> my<00:02:51.040> work<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.640> am<00:02:52.360> going

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
work and once I turn my work I am going

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:06.250 
work and once I turn my work I am going
to<00:02:53.050> purl<00:02:54.040> all<00:02:54.460> the<00:02:54.670> stitches<00:02:55.060> across

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.410 

so<00:03:07.260> essentially<00:03:07.770> stockinette<00:03:08.700> stitch<00:03:08.910> is

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
so essentially stockinette stitch is

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.960 
so essentially stockinette stitch is
just<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.710> two<00:03:10.920> row<00:03:11.130> repeat<00:03:11.750> with<00:03:12.750> Row<00:03:13.740> 1<00:03:13.970> being

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
just a two row repeat with Row 1 being

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.270 
just a two row repeat with Row 1 being
knit<00:03:15.660> across<00:03:15.920> row<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.450> purl<00:03:18.450> across<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:19.280> once

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
knit across row to purl across and once

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.880 
knit across row to purl across and once
you<00:03:20.520> reach<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.030> end<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.480> Row<00:03:21.690> 2<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:22.500> simply

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
you reach the end of Row 2 you simply

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.570 
you reach the end of Row 2 you simply
turn<00:03:23.100> your<00:03:23.340> work<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.760> begin<00:03:24.750> again<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.550> or<00:03:26.550> a

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
turn your work and begin again with or a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.930 
turn your work and begin again with or a
1<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:31.590> will<00:03:31.770> get<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:34.910> swatch<00:03:35.910> of

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
1 and you will get a swatch of

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.180 
1 and you will get a swatch of
stockinette<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.990> as<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.709> see<00:03:37.920> with<00:03:38.160> just

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
stockinette and as you can see with just

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.850 
stockinette and as you can see with just
this<00:03:38.670> small<00:03:39.090> piece<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.510> stockinette<00:03:40.080> the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
this small piece of stockinette the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.400 
this small piece of stockinette the
bottom<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.310> already<00:03:41.459> curling<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.810> outsides

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
bottom is already curling the outsides

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.110 
bottom is already curling the outsides
already<00:03:43.890> wanting<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.430> curl<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.640> usually

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
already wanting to curl so it is usually

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.290 
already wanting to curl so it is usually
a<00:03:48.150> good<00:03:48.330> idea<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:49.580> unless<00:03:50.580> you're<00:03:50.790> making<00:03:50.970> a

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
a good idea that unless you're making a

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.000 
a good idea that unless you're making a
sweater<00:03:51.720> were<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.080> going<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.290> be<00:03:52.440> seaming<00:03:52.860> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
sweater were you going to be seaming the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.510 
sweater were you going to be seaming the
edges<00:03:53.310> together<00:03:54.260> or<00:03:55.260> you're<00:03:55.830> doing<00:03:55.980> something

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
edges together or you're doing something

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.740 
edges together or you're doing something
in<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.730> round<00:03:56.970> where<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.300> don't<00:03:57.480> have<00:03:57.600> to

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
in the round where you don't have to

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.310 
in the round where you don't have to
worry<00:03:57.989> about<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.440> curl<00:03:58.739> factor<00:03:59.310> that<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:01.080> do

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
worry about the curl factor that you do

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.550 
worry about the curl factor that you do
something<00:04:01.800> on<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.280> edge<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:03.050> is<00:04:04.050> going<00:04:04.410> to

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
something on the edge that is going to

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.940 
something on the edge that is going to
break<00:04:04.920> up<00:04:05.190> this<00:04:05.940> being<00:04:06.300> all<00:04:06.480> stockinette<00:04:07.410> that

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
break up this being all stockinette that

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.699 
break up this being all stockinette that
way<00:04:08.190> you'll<00:04:08.400> be<00:04:08.430> able<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:09.030> not<00:04:09.360> have<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.750> Karl

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
way you'll be able to not have it Karl

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.160 
way you'll be able to not have it Karl
but<00:04:11.489> that's<00:04:11.700> really<00:04:11.910> your<00:04:12.420> discretion<00:04:13.019> what

you want to do so this is how to make a
stockinette<00:04:17.580> stitch
