00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.609 

so<00:01:10.540> I<00:01:10.570> had<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:10.930> cut<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.110> video<00:01:11.200> because<00:01:11.530> I'm

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
so I had to cut the video because I'm

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.350 
so I had to cut the video because I'm
sure<00:01:11.770> nobody<00:01:11.920> wants<00:01:12.189> to<00:01:12.250> see<00:01:12.460> me<00:01:12.610> match<00:01:13.060> up<00:01:13.240> all

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
sure nobody wants to see me match up all

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.760 
sure nobody wants to see me match up all
these<00:01:13.420> numbers<00:01:13.479> it<00:01:13.840> took<00:01:13.990> me<00:01:14.080> forever<00:01:14.259> but<00:01:14.560> I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
these numbers it took me forever but I

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.620 
these numbers it took me forever but I
finally<00:01:15.250> found<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.520> missing<00:01:15.790> code<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.509> when

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
finally found the missing code and when

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.060 
finally found the missing code and when
you<00:01:16.750> get<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:16.960> right<00:01:17.110> answer<00:01:17.140> as<00:01:17.619> you<00:01:17.680> can<00:01:17.890> see

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
you get the right answer as you can see

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.960 
you get the right answer as you can see
the<00:01:18.250> lights<00:01:18.490> there

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
the lights there

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.060 
the lights there
lights<00:01:19.240> up<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.630> indicate<00:01:19.990> tingling<00:01:20.890> mean

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
lights up to indicate tingling mean

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.410 
lights up to indicate tingling mean
you've<00:01:21.430> got<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.729> right<00:01:21.850> answer<00:01:22.000> what<00:01:22.270> we<00:01:22.330> do

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
you've got the right answer what we do

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.940 
you've got the right answer what we do
is<00:01:22.540> we<00:01:22.630> use<00:01:22.750> these<00:01:22.869> numbers<00:01:23.049> these<00:01:23.740> are<00:01:23.799> the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
is we use these numbers these are the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.380 
is we use these numbers these are the
missing<00:01:24.250> numbers<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.759> coordinates<00:01:25.210> so

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
missing numbers in the coordinates so

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.020 
missing numbers in the coordinates so
let<00:01:25.930> me<00:01:26.049> add<00:01:26.740> this<00:01:26.799> to<00:01:27.040> my<00:01:27.070> GPS<00:01:27.430> I'll<00:01:27.729> take<00:01:27.940> you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
let me add this to my GPS I'll take you

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.520 
let me add this to my GPS I'll take you
to<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.210> final<00:01:28.479> container<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.200> see<00:01:29.320> what<00:01:29.440> we

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
to the final container and see what we

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.880 
to the final container and see what we
get

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
get

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.960 
get
nicely<00:01:30.420> implemented<00:01:31.420> this<00:01:31.539> geocache<00:01:31.810> like<00:01:32.170> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
nicely implemented this geocache like it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.700 
nicely implemented this geocache like it
and<00:01:33.970> as<00:01:34.119> you<00:01:34.240> may<00:01:34.390> know<00:01:34.600> with<00:01:34.720> geocaching<00:01:35.320> it's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
and as you may know with geocaching it's

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.350 
and as you may know with geocaching it's
a<00:01:35.770> multi<00:01:36.070> I've<00:01:36.610> got<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:36.820> actually<00:01:36.940> sign<00:01:37.210> the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
a multi I've got to actually sign the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.760 
a multi I've got to actually sign the
logbook<00:01:37.539> which<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:37.990> at<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.170> coordinates<00:01:38.619> they

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
logbook which is at the coordinates they

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.160 
logbook which is at the coordinates they
provided<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.880> logbook<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.450> hidden<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.990> this

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
provided the logbook is hidden in this

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.520 
provided the logbook is hidden in this
container<00:01:41.530> here<00:01:42.300> so<00:01:43.300> let's<00:01:43.810> rehired

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
container here so let's rehired

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.080 
container here so let's rehired
nicely<00:01:47.530> done<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:48.069> enjoyed<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.520> geocache

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
nicely done that I enjoyed that geocache

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.880 
nicely done that I enjoyed that geocache
