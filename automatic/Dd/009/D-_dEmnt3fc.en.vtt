by enemies within the shielded area by

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.490 
by enemies within the shielded area by
an<00:00:36.300> additional<00:00:36.719> fifteen<00:00:37.050> percent<00:00:39.230> yeah<00:00:40.230> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
an additional fifteen percent yeah and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.250 
an additional fifteen percent yeah and
that<00:00:40.680> ranks<00:00:41.040> six<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.850> chose<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.660> line<00:00:42.899> protection

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that ranks six I chose a line protection

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.360 
that ranks six I chose a line protection
decrease<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> damage<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.840> shielded<00:00:45.840> allies

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
decrease the damage that shielded allies

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.670 
decrease the damage that shielded allies
take<00:00:47.370> by<00:00:47.610> ten<00:00:47.969> percent<00:00:48.020> also<00:00:49.020> decrease<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
take by ten percent also decrease the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.100 
take by ten percent also decrease the
delay<00:00:50.430> before<00:00:50.940> shields<00:00:51.539> regenerate<00:00:51.989> my

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
delay before shields regenerate my

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.799 
delay before shields regenerate my
temper<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.550> took<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.329> instead<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
temper so I took that one instead of the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.340 
temper so I took that one instead of the
warp<00:00:55.170> effect<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:56.160> effect<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.730> its<00:00:57.510> hit

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
warp effect what effect on its hit

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.709 
warp effect what effect on its hit
enemies<00:00:58.770> inside<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> shield<00:00:59.670> with<00:01:00.449> walk

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
enemies inside the shield with walk

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.229 
enemies inside the shield with walk

dearly 50 damage per second and reducing

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.250 
dearly 50 damage per second and reducing
alibi<00:01:04.309> 25%<00:01:05.309> effect<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.510> three<00:01:06.810> enemies<00:01:07.140> at

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
alibi 25% effect up to three enemies at

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.490 
a time set an enemy on for a biotic
detonation<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:11.090> chose<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.570> ally<00:01:12.930> protection

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
detonation I chose the ally protection

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
detonation I chose the ally protection
because<00:01:13.700> enemies<00:01:14.700> don't<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.180> come<00:01:15.360> into

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
because enemies don't really come into

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
because enemies don't really come into
the<00:01:15.720> shield<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.049> often<00:01:16.470> when<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.130> playing

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the shield that often when I was playing

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.760 
the shield that often when I was playing
as<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.700> character<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.619> does

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770

the warp effect move on to Reeve went to

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
the warp effect move on to Reeve went to

protection<00:01:37.950> by<00:01:38.280> ten<00:01:38.520> percent<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.840> take

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
protection by ten percent so you take

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.969 
protection by ten percent so you take
less<00:01:40.890> damage<00:01:42.290> instead<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> retailer

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

fifteen percent instead of the barriers

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.859 
fifteen percent instead of the barriers
and<00:01:56.399> armor<00:01:56.640> increase<00:01:56.969> effectiveness<00:01:57.420> against

percent<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.820> wanted<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.719> damage<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
percent I wanted the damage and

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.940 
percent I wanted the damage and
generation<00:02:03.210> basically<00:02:04.210> because<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:05.080> did

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
generation basically because I did

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.490 
generation basically because I did
notice<00:02:06.100> you'd<00:02:06.370> like<00:02:07.210> take<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.690> lot<00:02:07.900> of<00:02:07.930> hits<00:02:08.259> as

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
notice you'd like take a lot of hits as

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.440 
notice you'd like take a lot of hits as
this<00:02:08.619> character<00:02:10.530> yeah<00:02:11.640> also<00:02:12.640> when<00:02:13.330> you're

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
this character yeah also when you're

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.300 
this character yeah also when you're
increasing<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:13.990> duration<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.650> goes<00:02:14.770> up<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.040> 10

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
