00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.150
 for a tag 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.070
 yes I know it was a very long time 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.360
 that I did not do tak and 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.889
 however it's my fault because this 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.599
 is not lack of having been tagged 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.740
 many times today as you 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.260
 have seen in the title I you 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.720
 presents the tag harry potter I was 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.430
 tagged by my gallery trick which is a 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.810
 chain youtube beauty besides corn you 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.820
 passes by there quickly made big kisses 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.189
 one you see I can not imagine human I'm coming 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.000
 so we start right away with the 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.920
 first question 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.050
 your favorite book my favorite book 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.430
 of harry potter it's harry potter and the 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.140
 prince of mixed blood who is so the 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.850
 sixth volume because I find that 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 really that's where we learn 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.640
 a lot is there to understand 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.920
 a lot of things and I really 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.730
 enjoyed this volume for that your movie 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.649
 prefer 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.020
 my favorite movie I think it's the 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.280
 this first part the relics of the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.200
 dead because I really found 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.239
 the adaptation very well done very faithful 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.309
 to the book and that's good for that at 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.739
 cinema from time to time the book that you 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.930
 did you like the book I have 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.579
 less to like it will be the volume 5 the order 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.950
 phoenix because I had a little bit 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.350
 more trouble with the female character 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.090
 from the ministry's envoy how 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.570
 is called said you will hit him 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.290
 his real name does not do it any more for 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.240
 the dishes that are all the time in 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.070
 pink the law a little bit about the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.420
 nerves but I promise you it's not 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.049
 at all because it was a huge cobblestone 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.420
 of 1150 pages something like that I am 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.280
 remember so here I do not win anything 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.990
 what part of the movies or books you 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.310
 did crying so I admit that I have 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.880
 a lot cried with harry potter 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.590
 first when our dear serious friend 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.259
 black offers me 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.140
 it's a tearing but I really 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.259
 also cried when gold wheels 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.789
 the same 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.159
 this must then god dumbledore and 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.130
 I especially have a lot a lot 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.020
 cried when I arrived at the end of 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.549
 seventh volume because I knew that his 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.319
 niece was finished harry potter there 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.240
 will have more harry potter after that has been 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.280
 a heartbreak to separate me from this 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.759
 saga that really had really sold me 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.920
 of the dream 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.179
 that's it, I cried a lot 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.829
 for harry potter and even 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.149
 now I think I'm crying I 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.720
 could cry very easily 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.519
 twilight or harry potter harry potter 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.739
 yeah even though i read twilight more 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.569
 pointed out once what would your bossus be 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.500
 do I really need to 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.019
 answer this question 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.090
 a dog of course necessarily does that 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.739
 if you could choose between the stone of 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 resurrection the invisibility cloak or 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.450
 the elder stick that would choose 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.069
 I think I would choose the cape 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.209
 of invisibility these still too cool 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.819
 to be able to do whatever you want without 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.010
 nobody sees us of man here 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.690
 I do not care if I want 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.500
 can I actually own the boat from the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.750
 elder and for the resurrection 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.430
 a life is already good French you are 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.079
 disappointed or angry that some 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.420
 parts of the books were set aside 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.220
 for movies so yes and no because 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.600
 that I know 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.820
 all made a movie adapted from a book 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.620
 it's always difficult to put everything 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.480
 otherwise we would not be able to do that anymore 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.890
 lasts hours and hours but I 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.480
 am still a little bit angry 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.340
 against him especially for the movie number 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.560
 6 the half-breed prince because there 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.810
 not only did they not put the stuff 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.970
 very important where they have forgotten but in 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.400
 plus they did an american thing 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.140
 with a love story between Ron and 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.780
 hermione absolutely ridiculous that they have 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.680
 invented just for the show rather than 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.390
 put some interesting stuff 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.240
 so here yes I'm angry for that 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.340
 but unfortunately it's the game 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.260
 my poor lucette 1 as we say in 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.990
 what house would have killed was seeing that I 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.390
 am very vicious I think I would have 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.560
 been to Slytherin yeah I think 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.820
 I like graft in let's go 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.520
 answer that the founders we mean 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.220
 Slytherin because because some 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.290
 see trail penelope here is your subject 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.060
 favorite of Hogwarts the matter where they 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.650
 learn to fly on brooms that's it 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.790
 must really cool anyway it would 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.959
 too well that this is really the case 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.280
 in the disease 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.740
 I always do it your teacher 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.910
 favorite then my favorite teacher of 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.400
 all the time without any hesitation 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.620
 this is the professor mcgonagall she has 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.630
 really too classy but really 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.920
 she's so cool I love them if you 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.470
 could meet any actor 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.209
 from the movie series that would be this if I 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.040
 could meet a single actor of 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.989
 movies from the movie series I think that 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.280
 it would be emma watson to put him 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.540
 a little flicking because she is 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.910
 too perfect and it really does 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.919
 balls in little Baptist in half and so 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.810
 this is emma watson and then for 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.139
 the future because even if it annoys me 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.949
 she is really very 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.479
 nyala too the place as poor if you 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.400
 could realize that only one spell in the 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.960
 real life which would this be the fate of 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.360
 metamorphosis like that I could 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.090
 metamorphosed in full animal this would be 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.159
 become too nice a dog that 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.020
 would be too cool if you ever played one or 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.719
 Harry Potter games I've never 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.020
 played any Harry Potter video game and 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:50.319
 I do not know if I have to regret it 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.699
 that was parra was necessary to my life I 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.889
 think we will probably not 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.569
 never if you were in the team of 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.849
 quidditch in which position days are you 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.620
 if I was in the quidditch team I 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.319
 think I 'll have the place of greg and 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.939
 legs for cum shots with truncheon 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.080
 opponents I like it I 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:05.680
 may i liban go back perhaps this 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.689
 would be nice 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.400
 were you happy with the conclusion of 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.830
 the series I found the conclusion of the 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.639
 absolutely horrible series that was it was 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.909
 really sucks us the movie scene there I 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.000
 spoken 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:20.529
 after the series of books I have a lot 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.300
 appreciated but I'm sad that it 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.680
 not continue I think there was some 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.999
 potential to make a small leak 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.889
 so ok I understand it would have been 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:29.199
 really a bit long but that's it 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.339
 but on the other hand the really bad movies 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.650
 we could have done without it I think 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:35.110
 really how harry potter is 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.969
 or was important in your life harry 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.409
 potter it's really a series that is 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.639
 important to me because I'm 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.649
 always remember all the moments 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.060
 happy that I spent reading this 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:45.129
 book I remember places where 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.740
 I was in the weather 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.779
 really really a super period 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.159
 awesome I got harry potter very very 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.990
 late since I read them I was already 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.759
 in high school but it's true that I was able to 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.039
 chained and suddenly I really 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.319
 dive into this wonderful universe and 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.180
 I think it helped my passion for 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:02.380
 reading maybe less than some 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.240
 those who have discovered reading at 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.310
 through harry potter but it does not take away 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.810
 no duo it does not remove any charm to this 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.490
 series is really she is very very 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.370
 dear in my heart the proof I 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.000
 do not stop reading it here it is 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.740
 like that 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.030
 short harry potter will have marked my life 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.680
 but also that of my entourage 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.400
 as is the case for many and 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.990
 it's better this way 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.090
 so that's all for this video 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.650
 tag I hope it will please you I do not 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.060
 would hold nobody because I think 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.740
 that I am so labored that all the 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.270
 world had to do it if you ever did 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.949
 did not do it and it interests you 20 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.789
 do not hesitate to trove all alone I 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.050
 gives you permission 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.669
 so let's say I'm typing all the 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.030
 world if the state we miss on the 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.830
 chain 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.599
 do not hesitate to tell me do not hesitate 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.250
 to propose to me others I tell you 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.630

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.770
 next video I wish you very much 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.280
 very nice readings I make you 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.889
 lots of love
