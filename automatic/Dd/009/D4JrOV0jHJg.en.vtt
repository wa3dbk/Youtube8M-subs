00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
because most of the stuff I've been

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.900

on<00:00:38.370> spider-man<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.390> Broadway<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
on spider-man on Broadway and it's a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.130 
on spider-man on Broadway and it's a
really<00:00:40.980> hard-hitting<00:00:41.489> kind<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> rock<00:00:42.809> show

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
really hard-hitting kind of a rock show

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.100 
really hard-hitting kind of a rock show
and<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.559> usually<00:00:43.950> use<00:00:44.129> wood<00:00:44.700> tip<00:00:45.000> 5<00:00:45.480> these<00:00:45.750> for

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and I usually use wood tip 5 these for

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.860 
and I usually use wood tip 5 these for
that<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:47.340> decided<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> test

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that and I decided to kind of do a test

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.540 
that and I decided to kind of do a test
of<00:00:49.079> these<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.680> how<00:00:49.800> they<00:00:49.980> stack<00:00:50.520> up

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
of these and see how they stack up

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.150 
of these and see how they stack up
against<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.570> five<00:00:51.809> B's<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> wood

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
against the the five B's or the wood

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
against the the five B's or the wood
buddies<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:55.110> take<00:00:55.379> them<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
buddies and just now take them out of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.310 
buddies and just now take them out of
the<00:00:55.770> box<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> first<00:00:56.399> time<00:00:56.989> it's<00:00:57.989> it's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the box for the first time it's it's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.619 
the box for the first time it's it's
interesting<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.520> really<00:00:59.730> feel<00:01:00.180> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
interesting they don't really feel that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.229 
interesting they don't really feel that
they<00:01:01.559> feel<00:01:01.800> remarkably<00:01:02.129> close<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.969> wood

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
they feel remarkably close to wood

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.549 
they feel remarkably close to wood
that's<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> first<00:01:04.140> thing<00:01:04.260> I'm<00:01:04.379> noticing

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that's the first thing I'm noticing

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.130 
that's the first thing I'm noticing
they're<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.159> well<00:01:05.280> balanced<00:01:05.909> -<00:01:06.150> normally

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
they're really well balanced - normally

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320 
they're really well balanced - normally
um<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:07.650> not<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.920> fan<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.280> sticks<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.180> not

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
um I'm not a fan of sticks that are not

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.880 
um I'm not a fan of sticks that are not
made<00:01:09.570> from<00:01:09.720> wood<00:01:09.960> because<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.380> don't<00:01:10.619> have

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
made from wood because they don't have

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.130 
made from wood because they don't have
the<00:01:11.369> same<00:01:11.580> give<00:01:11.970> especially<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:13.020> you're

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the same give especially if you're

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.590 
the same give especially if you're
hitting<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.650> hard<00:01:14.100> tends<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.180> mess<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.570> my

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
hitting really hard tends to mess up my

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.270 
hitting really hard tends to mess up my
arm<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.350> especially<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:16.950> doing<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
arm here especially if I'm doing it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580 
arm here especially if I'm doing it
consistent<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> tour<00:01:19.049> thing<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.439> I'm

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
consistent like a tour thing if I'm

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.410 
consistent like a tour thing if I'm
doing<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> rock<00:01:20.100> thing<00:01:20.400> every<00:01:20.909> night<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.330> we're

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
doing a rock thing every night and we're

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.390 
doing a rock thing every night and we're
hitting<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:21.840> hard<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.830> give<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
hitting really hard the give of the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.490 
hitting really hard the give of the
stick<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> important<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
stick it's really kind of important to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.960 
stick it's really kind of important to
me<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.159> doesn't<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.670> it's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
me that if it doesn't have that it's

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.700 
me that if it doesn't have that it's
kind<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.360> hitting<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.020> baseball<00:01:28.200> bat

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
kind of like hitting a baseball bat

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.380 
kind of like hitting a baseball bat
against<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.159> brick<00:01:29.430> wall<00:01:29.460> every<00:01:30.030> night<00:01:30.210> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
against a brick wall every night you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020 
against a brick wall every night you
know<00:01:31.009> but<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> first<00:01:32.340> thing<00:01:32.460> I'm<00:01:32.549> noticing<00:01:32.579> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
know but the first thing I'm noticing is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.600 
know but the first thing I'm noticing is
how<00:01:33.869> these<00:01:34.049> feel<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> mean<00:01:35.100> they're<00:01:35.280> really

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
how these feel I mean they're really

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.270 
how these feel I mean they're really
close<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.180> wood<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.500> interesting<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.100> see

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
close to wood so the interesting to see

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.539 
close to wood so the interesting to see
how<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.509> stack<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.590> against<00:01:40.950> five<00:01:41.159> BS

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
how they have a stack up against five BS

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.240 
how they have a stack up against five BS
on<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.090> show<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:43.409> show<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.799> really

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
on this show the show is really

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.210 
on this show the show is really
hard-hitting<00:01:44.729> as<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.450> said<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.740> gonna<00:01:46.979> do

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
hard-hitting as I said and I'm gonna do

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.270 
hard-hitting as I said and I'm gonna do
I<00:01:47.250> think<00:01:47.610> 10<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.540> row<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.280> just

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
I think 10 of them in a row and just

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
I think 10 of them in a row and just
sort<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.579> see<00:01:50.850> how<00:01:51.030> these<00:01:51.180> things<00:01:51.390> stack<00:01:51.869> up

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
sort of see how these things stack up

00:01:52.140 --> 00:03:01.520 
sort of see how these things stack up
through<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> through<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.700> process

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.500 

so<00:03:02.530> usually<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.430> spider-man<00:03:03.909> thing<00:03:04.239> if<00:03:04.390> I

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
so usually on the spider-man thing if I

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.270 
so usually on the spider-man thing if I
do<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:05.080> any<00:03:05.319> more<00:03:05.560> than<00:03:05.739> three<00:03:06.099> or<00:03:06.190> four

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
do it for any more than three or four

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.180 
do it for any more than three or four
shows<00:03:06.700> or<00:03:07.030> for<00:03:07.299> five<00:03:07.510> days<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:08.200> start<00:03:08.890> going

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
shows or for five days I start going

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.759 
shows or for five days I start going
through<00:03:09.220> five<00:03:09.700> B<00:03:09.940> wood<00:03:10.540> sticks<00:03:10.900> they<00:03:11.409> usually

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
through five B wood sticks they usually

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.770 
through five B wood sticks they usually
kind<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.040> break<00:03:12.370> right<00:03:12.879> in<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.150> middle<00:03:13.390> here

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
kind of break right in the middle here

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.740 
kind of break right in the middle here
you<00:03:14.680> can<00:03:14.799> see<00:03:15.040> in<00:03:15.159> the<00:03:15.250> video<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.659> there's<00:03:16.659> a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
you can see in the video that there's a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.059 
you can see in the video that there's a
spot<00:03:17.049> right<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.440> middle<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> stick

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
spot right in the middle of the stick

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.589 
spot right in the middle of the stick
where<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.340> starts<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.790> kind<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.060> come<00:03:19.239> apart

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
where it starts to kind of come apart

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.119 
where it starts to kind of come apart
that's<00:03:20.290> because<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.739> whole<00:03:20.890> thing<00:03:21.099> is

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
that's because the whole thing is

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.789 
that's because the whole thing is
rimshot<00:03:21.909> Eng<00:03:22.120> with<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.420> left<00:03:22.629> hand<00:03:22.930> and

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
rimshot Eng with the left hand and

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.710 
rimshot Eng with the left hand and
hitting<00:03:24.159> really<00:03:24.430> hard<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:25.030> you're<00:03:25.390> trying<00:03:25.659> to

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
hitting really hard and you're trying to

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.449 
hitting really hard and you're trying to
be<00:03:25.810> as<00:03:25.900> consistent<00:03:26.260> as<00:03:26.530> possible<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:27.190> tends

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
be as consistent as possible that tends

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.479 
be as consistent as possible that tends
to<00:03:27.640> wear<00:03:27.909> out<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.120> middle<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.659> the<00:03:28.720> stick<00:03:29.489> I'm

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
to wear out the middle of the stick I'm

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.910 
to wear out the middle of the stick I'm
noticing<00:03:30.940> with<00:03:31.209> these<00:03:31.390> sticks<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:32.019> after

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
noticing with these sticks that after

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.460 
noticing with these sticks that after
now<00:03:33.670> looking<00:03:34.150> at<00:03:34.299> them<00:03:34.480> after<00:03:34.629> maybe<00:03:35.019> four

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
now looking at them after maybe four

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.490 
now looking at them after maybe four
days<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:36.129> gigs<00:03:36.750> there's<00:03:37.750> not<00:03:37.959> really<00:03:38.319> very

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
days of gigs there's not really very

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.819 
days of gigs there's not really very
much<00:03:39.690> there's<00:03:40.690> there's<00:03:40.930> not<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.170> lot<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.530> wear

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
much there's there's not a lot of wear

00:03:41.829 --> 00:04:19.150 
much there's there's not a lot of wear
on<00:03:41.859> it<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.519> middle

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.430 

not<00:04:20.160> too<00:04:20.459> much<00:04:20.639> damage<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.449> mean<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.229> like

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
not too much damage I mean this is like

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.760 
not too much damage I mean this is like
five<00:04:22.710> or<00:04:22.860> six<00:04:22.889> shows<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.669> really<00:04:24.000> hitting

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
five or six shows of really hitting

00:04:24.770 --> 00:05:03.020 
five or six shows of really hitting
quite<00:04:25.770> hard

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.330 

after<00:05:04.030> about<00:05:04.180> a<00:05:04.240> week<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.750> using<00:05:04.990> these<00:05:05.380> I<00:05:05.919> was

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
after about a week of using these I was

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.800 
after about a week of using these I was
pretty<00:05:06.580> impressed<00:05:07.030> with<00:05:07.270> them<00:05:07.389> they<00:05:07.540> didn't

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
pretty impressed with them they didn't

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.290 
pretty impressed with them they didn't
really<00:05:08.020> get<00:05:08.770> beat<00:05:09.040> up<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.430> much<00:05:09.669> despite<00:05:10.120> the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
really get beat up that much despite the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.240 
really get beat up that much despite the
fact<00:05:10.539> I<00:05:10.690> was<00:05:10.840> hitting<00:05:11.139> really<00:05:11.560> really<00:05:11.889> hard

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
fact I was hitting really really hard

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.460 
fact I was hitting really really hard
with<00:05:12.729> them<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.509> middle<00:05:13.840> section<00:05:14.080> as<00:05:14.380> I

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
with them the middle section as I

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.960 
with them the middle section as I
mentioned<00:05:14.919> before<00:05:15.009> is<00:05:15.400> like<00:05:15.430> not<00:05:15.820> even

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
mentioned before is like not even

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.950 
mentioned before is like not even
touched<00:05:16.479> barely<00:05:17.259> at<00:05:17.380> all<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.850> I<00:05:19.539> didn't<00:05:19.840> have

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
touched barely at all and I didn't have

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.570 
touched barely at all and I didn't have
any<00:05:20.139> problems<00:05:20.590> with<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.860> give<00:05:21.070> of<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.310> stick

any problems with the give of the stick
as<00:05:21.729> I<00:05:21.850> mentioned<00:05:22.300> before<00:05:22.389> I<00:05:22.930> dug<00:05:23.830> in<00:05:23.979> pretty

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
as I mentioned before I dug in pretty

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.700 
as I mentioned before I dug in pretty
hard<00:05:24.460> for<00:05:24.669> the<00:05:24.759> most<00:05:24.970> part<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.509> I<00:05:26.080> didn't<00:05:26.620> have

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
hard for the most part and I didn't have

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.680 
hard for the most part and I didn't have
any<00:05:26.860> arm<00:05:27.130> problems<00:05:27.699> as<00:05:27.880> a<00:05:27.910> result<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:28.509> these

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
any arm problems as a result of these

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.920 
any arm problems as a result of these
not<00:05:28.960> being<00:05:29.259> wood<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:31.000> sound<00:05:31.270> was<00:05:31.449> relatively

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
not being wood the sound was relatively

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.930 
not being wood the sound was relatively
consistent<00:05:32.800> they<00:05:33.220> didn't<00:05:33.490> leave<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.639> lot<00:05:33.910> of

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
consistent they didn't leave a lot of

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.909 
consistent they didn't leave a lot of
marks<00:05:34.360> on<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:34.630> drums<00:05:34.960> or<00:05:35.169> the<00:05:35.229> cymbals<00:05:35.710> either

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
marks on the drums or the cymbals either

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.159 
marks on the drums or the cymbals either
which<00:05:36.250> is<00:05:36.280> something<00:05:37.060> that<00:05:37.270> some<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.780> us<00:05:38.020> have

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
which is something that some of us have

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.960 
which is something that some of us have
had<00:05:38.289> complaints<00:05:38.710> on<00:05:39.010> with<00:05:39.160> other<00:05:39.340> sticks<00:05:39.729> that

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
had complaints on with other sticks that

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.270 
had complaints on with other sticks that
are<00:05:40.090> not<00:05:40.270> made<00:05:40.630> from<00:05:40.870> wood<00:05:41.080> sometimes<00:05:42.010> they

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
are not made from wood sometimes they

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.800 
are not made from wood sometimes they
leave<00:05:42.460> black<00:05:42.729> marks<00:05:43.240> or<00:05:43.389> things<00:05:43.600> like<00:05:43.690> that

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
leave black marks or things like that

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.170 
leave black marks or things like that
but<00:05:44.020> these<00:05:44.710> didn't<00:05:45.010> really<00:05:45.250> do<00:05:45.460> that<00:05:45.490> my

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
but these didn't really do that my

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.450 
but these didn't really do that my
initial<00:05:46.449> response<00:05:46.810> after<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.620> week<00:05:47.889> of<00:05:48.100> really

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
initial response after a week of really

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.310 
initial response after a week of really
putting<00:05:49.150> these<00:05:49.360> through<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:49.720> ringers<00:05:50.139> that

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
putting these through the ringers that

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.920 
putting these through the ringers that
they're<00:05:50.470> really<00:05:50.710> strong<00:05:51.419> I'm<00:05:52.419> sure<00:05:52.720> that

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
they're really strong I'm sure that

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.810 
they're really strong I'm sure that
they'll<00:05:53.260> break<00:05:53.560> at<00:05:53.800> some<00:05:54.039> point<00:05:54.370> but<00:05:54.580> I<00:05:54.639> don't

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
they'll break at some point but I don't

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.240 
they'll break at some point but I don't
see<00:05:55.090> any<00:05:55.240> sign<00:05:55.539> of<00:05:55.570> it<00:05:55.840> yet<00:05:56.139> so<00:05:56.500> I'll<00:05:56.979> keep

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
see any sign of it yet so I'll keep
