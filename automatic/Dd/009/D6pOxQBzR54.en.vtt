of the Collins is that the price is
ninety<00:02:41.870> nine<00:02:42.019> dollars<00:02:42.320> which<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.769> kind<00:02:43.010> of

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
ninety nine dollars which is kind of

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.220 
ninety nine dollars which is kind of
high<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.269> lot<00:02:44.600> for<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:45.019> type<00:02:45.200> of

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
high that is a lot for this type of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.780 
high that is a lot for this type of
keyboard<00:02:45.500> but<00:02:45.950> since<00:02:46.220> it's<00:02:46.400> got<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.640> rear

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790

facing<00:02:46.970> touchpad<00:02:47.510> new<00:02:47.750> technology<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.410> guess

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
facing touchpad new technology I guess

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.350 
facing touchpad new technology I guess
it<00:02:49.070> can<00:02:49.220> be<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.489> high<00:02:49.640> but<00:02:49.910> if<00:02:50.209> you're

where<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.340> keypad<00:02:52.730> has<00:02:52.910> no<00:02:53.120> functionality

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
where the keypad has no functionality

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.849 
where the keypad has no functionality
but<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.989> mean<00:02:54.139> the<00:02:54.200> touchpad<00:02:54.560> has<00:02:54.709> no

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
but I mean the touchpad has no

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.280 
but I mean the touchpad has no
functionality<00:02:55.340> on<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:55.730> back<00:02:55.910> then<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:57.109> not

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
functionality on the back then it's not

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.900

a<00:02:57.350> goodbye<00:02:57.620> because<00:02:57.950> I've<00:02:58.130> tried<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.489> out<00:02:58.639> on

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
a goodbye because I've tried this out on

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.800 
a goodbye because I've tried this out on
the<00:02:59.209> UM

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
the UM

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.350 
the UM
computer<00:03:00.290> works<00:03:00.530> great<00:03:00.830> as<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.400> mouse<00:03:02.090> you

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
computer works great as a mouse you

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.880 
computer works great as a mouse you
can't<00:03:02.540> roll<00:03:02.720> around<00:03:02.870> with<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.290> while<00:03:03.770> the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
can't roll around with it while the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.729 
can't roll around with it while the
iDevices<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.730> android<00:03:05.150> devices<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
iDevices and android devices to the

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.260 
iDevices and android devices to the
touch<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.160> rear-facing<00:03:07.340> touchpad<00:03:07.940> has<00:03:08.090> no

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
touch the rear-facing touchpad has no

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.790 
touch the rear-facing touchpad has no
functionality<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.110> can't<00:03:09.319> move<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.709> around

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
functionality you can't move it around

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.470 
functionality you can't move it around
as<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> mouse<00:03:10.250> or<00:03:10.489> scroll<00:03:10.880> through<00:03:11.060> pages<00:03:11.239> or

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
as a mouse or scroll through pages or

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.050 
as a mouse or scroll through pages or
anything<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.170> that's<00:03:12.440> kind<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.980> that's<00:03:13.550> not

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
anything so that's kind of a that's not

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.020 
anything so that's kind of a that's not
the<00:03:14.330> best<00:03:14.569> but<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.200> can<00:03:16.040> understand<00:03:16.489> since<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
the best but I can understand since the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.449 
the best but I can understand since the
iphone<00:03:17.239> doesn't<00:03:17.690> use<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.140> mouse<00:03:18.410> at<00:03:18.620> all<00:03:18.739> but

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
iphone doesn't use a mouse at all but

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.720 
iphone doesn't use a mouse at all but
anyways<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.680> pro<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.190> does<00:03:22.370> type

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
anyways a pro is that it does type

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.180 
anyways a pro is that it does type
really<00:03:23.090> easily<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.690> got<00:03:23.840> those<00:03:24.019> um<00:03:24.319> grips<00:03:25.010> on

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
really easily it's got those um grips on

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.530 
really easily it's got those um grips on
the<00:03:25.280> back<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.459> help<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.849> easily<00:03:26.060> grip<00:03:26.390> it

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the back that help you easily grip it

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.210 
the back that help you easily grip it
and<00:03:26.569> it<00:03:26.780> types<00:03:27.230> really<00:03:27.410> fast<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:27.950> it's<00:03:28.069> very

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
and it types really fast and it's very

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.759 
and it types really fast and it's very
responsive<00:03:28.880> another<00:03:29.660> flaw<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.080> found<00:03:30.349> is<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
responsive another flaw I found is the

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.920 
responsive another flaw I found is the
function<00:03:31.310> it's<00:03:31.910> kind<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.390> pain<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.750> have<00:03:32.780> to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
function it's kind of a pain to have to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.570 
function it's kind of a pain to have to
hit<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.230> function<00:03:33.650> at<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:33.920> spot<00:03:34.250> if<00:03:34.459> they

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
hit the function at that spot if they

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.490 
hit the function at that spot if they
had<00:03:34.730> put<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.000> around<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.360> top<00:03:35.569> maybe<00:03:35.900> where

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
had put it around the top maybe where

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.960 
had put it around the top maybe where
you<00:03:36.620> could<00:03:36.739> hit<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.010> with<00:03:37.040> your<00:03:37.160> pointer

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
you could hit it with your pointer

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.340 
you could hit it with your pointer
finger<00:03:38.299> while<00:03:38.510> you're<00:03:38.720> typing<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.170> would<00:03:39.290> be

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
finger while you're typing that would be

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.110 
finger while you're typing that would be
much<00:03:39.590> easier<00:03:39.830> than<00:03:40.250> having<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.549> move<00:03:40.910> your

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
much easier than having to move your

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.580 
much easier than having to move your
thumb<00:03:41.299> back<00:03:41.510> up<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.900> hit<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.019> function<00:03:42.500> and

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
thumb back up and hit the function and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.370 
thumb back up and hit the function and
then<00:03:42.680> started<00:03:43.040> racing<00:03:43.190> they<00:03:43.850> could<00:03:44.030> just

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
then started racing they could just

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.229 
then started racing they could just
replace<00:03:45.380> that<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.799> function<00:03:46.430> key<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:46.880> put<00:03:47.150> it

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
replace that a function key and put it

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.250 
replace that a function key and put it
somewhere<00:03:47.269> else<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.840> would<00:03:47.900> be<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.019> lot

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
somewhere else that would be a lot

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.690 
somewhere else that would be a lot
better<00:03:48.410> where<00:03:48.739> it's<00:03:48.860> more<00:03:49.010> easy<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.370> access

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
better where it's more easy to access

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.309 
better where it's more easy to access
since<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.060> have<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.299> use<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.599> a<00:03:50.630> lot<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:51.019> erase

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
since you have to use it a lot to erase

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.530 
since you have to use it a lot to erase
so<00:03:52.280> overall<00:03:52.670> if<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:52.970> want<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.180> check<00:03:53.269> out<00:03:53.450> this

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
so overall if you want to check out this

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.210 
so overall if you want to check out this
keyboard<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:54.080> can<00:03:54.110> go<00:03:54.470> down<00:03:54.620> in<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.860> link<00:03:55.130> in
