was<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.840> was<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.989> really<00:02:42.500> really<00:02:43.070> cool

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
was it was a really really cool

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:55.380 
was it was a really really cool
experience

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.210 

great

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
great

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.180 
great
alright<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.270> as<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.990> this<00:02:59.170> part<00:02:59.470> when<00:03:00.100> you're

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
alright and as of this part when you're

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.900 
alright and as of this part when you're
fighting<00:03:00.400> shredder<00:03:01.270> I<00:03:01.620> don't<00:03:02.620> know<00:03:02.740> if<00:03:03.220> this

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
fighting shredder I don't know if this

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.340 
fighting shredder I don't know if this
is<00:03:03.970> just<00:03:04.270> my<00:03:04.510> memory<00:03:04.930> failing<00:03:05.380> me<00:03:05.680> or<00:03:05.920> what<00:03:06.160> but

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
is just my memory failing me or what but

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.490 
is just my memory failing me or what but
as<00:03:08.350> far<00:03:08.770> as<00:03:08.830> i<00:03:09.040> remember<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.750> always<00:03:10.990> want<00:03:11.410> to

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
as far as i remember you always want to

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.070 
as far as i remember you always want to
attack<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:13.090> always<00:03:13.420> want<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.660> attack<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
attack you always want to attack the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.570 
attack you always want to attack the
shredder<00:03:14.710> that<00:03:14.950> still<00:03:15.610> has<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.910> mask<00:03:16.270> on

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.520 

so<00:03:21.290> try<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.320> keep<00:03:22.440> track<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.920> them<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:24.450> if<00:03:25.170> you

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
so try to keep track of them and if you

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.890 
so try to keep track of them and if you
see<00:03:25.740> one<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:25.980> their<00:03:26.100> masks<00:03:26.460> pop<00:03:26.670> off<00:03:26.910> focus<00:03:27.780> on

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
see one of their masks pop off focus on

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.290 
see one of their masks pop off focus on
the<00:03:28.020> other<00:03:28.170> shredder<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:32.030> really<00:03:33.030> don't<00:03:33.210> know

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
the other shredder I really don't know

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.060 
the other shredder I really don't know
if<00:03:33.420> that's<00:03:33.840> how<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.140> mechanics<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.920> this

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
if that's how the mechanics of this

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.270 
if that's how the mechanics of this
fight<00:03:35.490> work<00:03:36.470> but

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
fight work but

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.190 
fight work but
it's<00:03:40.090> always<00:03:40.720> seemed<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.530> work<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:41.860> me<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:43.200> so

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
it's always seemed to work for me so so

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.110 
it's always seemed to work for me so so
right<00:03:44.380> here<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.620> got<00:03:44.890> two<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.190> them<00:03:45.310> cornered

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
right here I got two of them cornered

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.090 
right here I got two of them cornered
one<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.870> their<00:03:46.990> masks<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.470> probably<00:03:47.920> going<00:03:48.040> to

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
one of their masks is probably going to

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.000 
one of their masks is probably going to
pop<00:03:48.310> off<00:03:48.520> shortly<00:03:51.060> if<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.360> don't<00:03:52.420> die<00:03:52.830> great<00:03:53.830> now

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
pop off shortly if I don't die great now

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.300 
pop off shortly if I don't die great now
I<00:03:54.040> got<00:03:54.280> separated<00:03:55.319> all<00:03:56.319> right<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:56.800> his<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.130> off

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
I got separated all right so his is off

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.360 
I got separated all right so his is off
so<00:03:57.550> I'm<00:03:57.640> going<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.819> focus<00:03:58.000> on<00:03:58.239> this<00:03:58.420> one<00:03:58.660> and

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
so I'm going to focus on this one and

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.530 
so I'm going to focus on this one and
eventually<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.400> other<00:04:00.700> one<00:04:00.880> will<00:04:01.150> just<00:04:01.360> end

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
eventually that other one will just end

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.080 
eventually that other one will just end
up<00:04:01.660> taking<00:04:02.020> damage<00:04:02.230> for<00:04:02.620> me<00:04:02.790> randomly<00:04:03.790> by

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
up taking damage for me randomly by

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.440 
up taking damage for me randomly by
coming<00:04:04.420> into<00:04:04.540> my<00:04:05.850> coming<00:04:06.850> into<00:04:07.000> my<00:04:07.120> attack

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
coming into my coming into my attack

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.670 
coming into my coming into my attack
range<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.989> know<00:04:11.110> he's<00:04:11.290> going<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.470> die

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
range so you know he's going to die

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.030 
range so you know he's going to die
anyway<00:04:12.150> regardless<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.540> what<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:13.959> do<00:04:14.080> but<00:04:14.590> I'm

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
anyway regardless of what I do but I'm

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.210 
anyway regardless of what I do but I'm
just<00:04:15.370> focusing<00:04:15.790> on<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.540> actual<00:04:17.049> shredder<00:04:17.500> if

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
just focusing on the actual shredder if

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.009 
just focusing on the actual shredder if
that<00:04:18.609> is<00:04:18.760> in<00:04:18.910> fact<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.329> actual<00:04:19.720> shredder

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
that is in fact the actual shredder

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.560 
that is in fact the actual shredder
because<00:04:20.980> like<00:04:21.669> I<00:04:21.790> said<00:04:21.850> I'm<00:04:22.090> just<00:04:22.270> talking<00:04:22.510> out

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
because like I said I'm just talking out

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.810 
because like I said I'm just talking out
of<00:04:22.630> my<00:04:22.750> ass<00:04:22.810> here<00:04:23.230> that's<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:23.820> remembered

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
of my ass here that's I remembered

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.700 
of my ass here that's I remembered
hearing<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.960> know<00:04:26.080> that's<00:04:26.500> what<00:04:26.650> we

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
hearing that you know that's what we

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.920 
hearing that you know that's what we
used<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.950> go<00:04:27.210> that's<00:04:28.210> what<00:04:28.390> we<00:04:28.450> used<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.660> go<00:04:28.780> by

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
used to go that's what we used to go by

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.260 
used to go that's what we used to go by
back<00:04:29.230> in<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.470> day<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.890> you<00:04:30.520> know<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:30.880> far<00:04:30.910> it

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
back in the day and you know so far it

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.850 
back in the day and you know so far it
seems<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:32.350> be<00:04:32.500> proven<00:04:32.919> true<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:34.229> then<00:04:35.229> yeah

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
seems to be proven true and then yeah

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.730 
seems to be proven true and then yeah
you<00:04:35.890> get<00:04:36.190> down<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.580> last<00:04:36.850> two<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:38.680> think

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
you get down to the last two and I think

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.760 
you get down to the last two and I think
both<00:04:39.040> of<00:04:39.100> their<00:04:39.340> masks<00:04:40.050> will<00:04:41.050> probably<00:04:41.590> come

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
both of their masks will probably come

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.510 
both of their masks will probably come
off

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:05:03.610

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
over 20 years ago uh I guess I have a

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.290 
over 20 years ago uh I guess I have a
little<00:05:51.660> bit<00:05:51.840> of<00:05:51.870> time<00:05:52.050> so<00:05:52.640> can<00:05:53.640> I<00:05:53.730> recommend

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
little bit of time so can I recommend

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.880 
little bit of time so can I recommend
paying<00:05:55.080> for<00:05:55.410> this<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:57.200> would<00:05:58.200> not<00:05:58.560> recommend

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
paying for this I would not recommend

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.350 
paying for this I would not recommend
paying<00:05:59.400> for<00:05:59.640> this<00:05:59.760> no<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:01.070> bought<00:06:02.070> it<00:06:02.130> because<00:06:02.550> i

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
paying for this no I bought it because i

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.080 
paying for this no I bought it because i
had<00:06:03.810> that<00:06:04.040> nostalgic<00:06:05.040> tie<00:06:05.250> because<00:06:05.820> i

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
had that nostalgic tie because i

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.590 
had that nostalgic tie because i
actually<00:06:06.630> beat<00:06:07.140> it<00:06:07.430> way<00:06:08.430> back<00:06:08.820> when<00:06:08.880> i<00:06:09.090> was<00:06:09.180> a

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
actually beat it way back when i was a

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.150 
actually beat it way back when i was a
kid<00:06:10.310> so<00:06:11.310> for<00:06:11.670> that<00:06:11.790> alone<00:06:12.090> for<00:06:12.600> me<00:06:12.780> it<00:06:13.470> sort<00:06:14.100> of

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
kid so for that alone for me it sort of

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.000 
kid so for that alone for me it sort of
justifies<00:06:14.700> it<00:06:14.970> in<00:06:15.120> my<00:06:15.300> opinion<00:06:15.680> it's<00:06:16.680> a<00:06:16.800> really

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
justifies it in my opinion it's a really

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.250 
justifies it in my opinion it's a really
short<00:06:17.250> game<00:06:17.550> and<00:06:17.940> you<00:06:18.720> know<00:06:18.810> if<00:06:18.960> you<00:06:19.050> want
