00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.530
 Those who did not start yesterday with the Model Train Hobby can often 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.300
 after a short time provided the gift ideas of the family 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.459
 coordinates a proud number of modern vehicles of the Federal Railways 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.460
 to the already historic steam trains sign 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.849
 At the latest now many collectors are drifting 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.099
 but it also raises the question of what to say 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.300
 It is not easy to answer this and that is how we understand our suggestions 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.319
 even as a suggestion the three locomotives are similar externally 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.579
 strong that one could confuse superficially 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.030
 however, all the different ones are from different sources 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.480
 years of construction 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 an important criterion for the special collection 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.670
 another theme the different models of the famous crocodiles 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.520
 Crocodiles often run south Germany of Switzerland 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.320
 Austria 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.240
 and that helps only the normal but also in a narrow track like this model 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.320
 the Rhaetian Railway 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.300
 Not every modeler has so much space around all vehicles on the road 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.450
 Plant or in shadow stations accommodate here an example like this 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.540
 still different 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.620
 the completely assembled train will be on a track just to the 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.990
 Plate set and the entrance then then participate in general driving 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.530
 who likes to be engaged in history can be found among the historical ones 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.800
 Trains an interesting gathering 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.320
 one can pursue the question 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.800
 when exactly the names were built are important issues and when their 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800
 last ride was 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
 You start to specialize like a stamp collector 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.570
 if you have all the construction reactions from a locomotive together that results 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.550
 Among experts an ideal and material value growth of over the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.550
 Has single prices 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.959
 By no means only in Europe were beautiful steam locomotives 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.769
 these American painters want bells because of 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.479
 At the time it was the longest steam lock in the world 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.600
 even her life 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600
 in h0 model it still has a length of 48 centimeters 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:46.909
 These famous American Forest Railways with the weird shell 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:47.840
 Automotive 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.199
 not alone because of her daily 20 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:53.489
 it is a pity that so many model railroad friends at foreign 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.489
 Vehicles and strange passing 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.190
 Who does not know the old trains? 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.270
 Often the center of dramatic western films here demands a self 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.939
 Sion in the rare track s 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.620
 those who are less interested in the traits of the past and who are 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.619
 Collection area that selects seventies and present 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:17.679
 70 a large series of diesel locomotives and bailouts 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:20.860
 We will stay with the diesel locomotives first 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.230
 The Federal Railways offers a wide range of this one sheer locomotive 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.909
 Persons and freight train locomotives 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.769
 interesting models can also be found in the neighboring countries 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.769
 here some examples 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.229
 This locomotive triple traction is used in the US for long distances 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.749
 used to relieve the individual drive units 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.199
 Double traction at this modern June in Kassel the container train are the 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.199
 normally, 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.880
 that the locomotives do not always show the usual paint 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.979
 this example 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.839
 back to Germany and his newest parade horse on the Rhine route 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.419
 who decides to pick up the locomotives and then pick them up again 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.860
 Here are a few examples given also the locomotives of some European 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 Include countries 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.789
 the fastest train in Europe the French www the traffic between 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.789
 Paris and Lyon peak well over 200 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.930
 the subject in the product range is unmanageably diverse 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.009
 even with the passenger cars of the individual countries there is one 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.280
 Such diversity that the survey pointed out to Walter 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.630
 to the replicas of the real goods transport carriages join the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.130
 Models variations Celebration Fantasy the industrial customers as party favors 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.080
 could make the smart collector informed beforehand if only one 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.379
 promotional gag is present 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.319
 Who now absolutely with none of our proposed collection areas 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.539
 Anfunden that can be mentioned here is still a peripheral area operating vehicles 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.430
 the federal railway 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.069
 There are facilities where the trains drive through the seasons 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.410
 that is not strange when on a mountain org a train from the 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.190
 Italian spring drives into the wintry high mountains
