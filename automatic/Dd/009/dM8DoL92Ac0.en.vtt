maybe oh right this damn it that was
brilliant<00:02:41.630> let's<00:02:42.630> try<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:42.960> again<00:02:43.110> only<00:02:43.740> this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
brilliant let's try that again only this

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.790 
brilliant let's try that again only this
time<00:02:43.980> without<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.490> falling<00:02:45.030> down<00:02:45.300> part<00:02:45.800> see

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
time without the falling down part see

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.380 
time without the falling down part see
what<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.070> was<00:02:47.220> supposed<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.520> do<00:02:47.670> was<00:02:47.850> jump<00:02:48.180> to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
what I was supposed to do was jump to

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.850 
what I was supposed to do was jump to
that<00:02:48.510> was<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.990> know<00:02:49.110> instead<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.560> jump

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
that was you know instead of jump

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.380 
that was you know instead of jump
walking<00:02:50.310> across<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.670> ice<00:02:50.820> bridge<00:02:50.850> that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
walking across the ice bridge that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.570 
walking across the ice bridge that
should<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.780> there<00:02:51.990> but<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.280> because<00:02:53.520> I

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
should be there but is it because I

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.620 
should be there but is it because I
already<00:02:53.670> walked<00:02:53.940> across<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.300> there<00:02:54.600> for

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
already walked across it there for

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.610 
already walked across it there for
breaking<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.410> was<00:02:55.920> going<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.190> jump<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.620> jump

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
breaking it I was going to jump and jump

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.760 
breaking it I was going to jump and jump
and<00:02:59.420> let's<00:03:00.420> see<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:07.380> don't<00:03:07.560> want<00:03:07.740> like

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
and let's see but I just don't want like

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.650 
and let's see but I just don't want like
glass<00:03:08.130> shattering<00:03:08.610> then<00:03:08.880> ice<00:03:09.090> shattering

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
glass shattering then ice shattering

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.020 
glass shattering then ice shattering
them<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.350> least<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.620> me<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.769> does<00:03:11.040> by<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.850> way

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
them that least to me it does by the way

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.850 
them that least to me it does by the way
it's<00:03:12.510> breakable<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.200> I'm<00:03:13.290> breaking<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.739> by

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
it's breakable and I'm breaking it by

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.470 
it's breakable and I'm breaking it by
walking<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.459> McMahon's<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.030> fatass

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
walking on it McMahon's a fatass

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.680 
walking on it McMahon's a fatass
apparently<00:03:16.760> next<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.820> know<00:03:17.940> its<00:03:18.180> public<00:03:18.480> ADIZ

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
apparently next you know its public ADIZ

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.930 
apparently next you know its public ADIZ
you<00:03:18.959> know<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.350> robot<00:03:19.830> or<00:03:19.860> something<00:03:20.160> robots<00:03:20.640> I

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
you know a robot or something robots I

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.040 
you know a robot or something robots I
mean<00:03:21.180> there<00:03:21.300> does<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.480> lot<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.690> middle<00:03:21.870> and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
mean there does a lot of middle and

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.270 
mean there does a lot of middle and
robust<00:03:22.380> metal<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.860> not<00:03:23.040> lightweight

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
robust metal is not lightweight

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.540 
robust metal is not lightweight
therefore<00:03:24.060> robots<00:03:24.510> are<00:03:24.630> probably<00:03:24.900> ah<00:03:25.110> yes<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
therefore robots are probably ah yes the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.310 
therefore robots are probably ah yes the
spring<00:03:26.850> set<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.410> spring<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.709> said<00:03:31.790> he

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
spring set the spring like I said he

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.350 
spring set the spring like I said he
know<00:03:34.320> John<00:03:34.620> your<00:03:35.550> voice<00:03:35.670> acting<00:03:36.060> cut<00:03:36.209> out<00:03:36.330> I

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
know John your voice acting cut out I

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.520 
know John your voice acting cut out I
guess<00:03:36.630> we're<00:03:36.750> not<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.989> look<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.230> just<00:03:37.260> won't

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
guess we're not to look I just won't

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.949 
guess we're not to look I just won't
have<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.800> ignore<00:03:38.010> her<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.519> old<00:03:39.510> bone<00:03:39.720> that's

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
have to ignore her I old bone that's

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.780 
have to ignore her I old bone that's
another<00:03:40.230> one<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.860> can<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.220> think<00:03:41.580> yeah

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
another one that you can I think yeah

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.860 
another one that you can I think yeah
yeah<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:41.970> think<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.239> take<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.950> museum

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
yeah I think you take that to the museum

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.910 
yeah I think you take that to the museum
but<00:03:45.870> yeah<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.170> there's<00:03:46.320> apparently<00:03:46.440> no<00:03:46.680> big

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
but yeah so there's apparently no big

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.380 
but yeah so there's apparently no big
river<00:03:47.190> bots<00:03:47.370> here<00:03:47.610> how<00:03:48.600> peculiar<00:03:49.019> yeah<00:03:49.739> oh

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
river bots here how peculiar yeah oh

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.470 
river bots here how peculiar yeah oh
damn<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.600> hate<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.920> see<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.480> there

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
damn it I hate this you see that there

damn it I hate this you see that there
are<00:03:54.540> three<00:03:54.750> shields<00:03:55.019> there<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.550> green<00:03:56.550> one<00:03:56.730> an

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
are three shields there a green one an

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.509 
are three shields there a green one an
orange<00:03:57.000> one<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.420> purple<00:03:57.750> one<00:03:58.250> we<00:03:59.250> have<00:03:59.400> to

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
orange one and a purple one we have to

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.460 
orange one and a purple one we have to
disable<00:03:59.790> all<00:04:00.120> three<00:04:00.480> shields<00:04:00.780> which<00:04:01.230> seems

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
disable all three shields which seems

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.039 
disable all three shields which seems
simple<00:04:01.800> enough<00:04:01.830> step<00:04:02.400> on<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.580> button<00:04:02.930> step<00:04:03.930> on

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
simple enough step on the button step on

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.210 
simple enough step on the button step on
the<00:04:04.170> button<00:04:05.330> dip<00:04:06.330> step<00:04:07.140> on<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.410> button<00:04:07.980> but<00:04:08.100> if

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
the button dip step on the button but if

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.890 
the button dip step on the button but if
you<00:04:08.310> move<00:04:08.459> too<00:04:08.610> slow<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.180> shield<00:04:09.420> pops<00:04:09.690> right

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
you move too slow the shield pops right

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.590 
you move too slow the shield pops right
back<00:04:10.080> up<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.790> have<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:11.970> hit<00:04:12.060> them<00:04:12.239> like<00:04:12.269> all

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
back up so you have to hit them like all

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.270 
back up so you have to hit them like all
in<00:04:12.870> rapid<00:04:13.200> succession

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
in rapid succession

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.430 
in rapid succession
it's<00:04:15.030> not<00:04:15.240> exactly<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.900> hardest<00:04:16.230> thing<00:04:16.350> in

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
it's not exactly the hardest thing in

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.660 
it's not exactly the hardest thing in
the<00:04:16.470> world<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.709> do<00:04:16.859> but<00:04:17.040> it's<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.370> pain<00:04:17.549> in

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
the world to do but it's just a pain in
