00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.550
 so first thing we have to print 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.099
 all of our acceptance bakur and also i 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.409
 leave a reference in the description of the print on 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.230
 ordinary paper because we take 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:23.569
 the printout is the background of the forms no 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.759
 another listing after you 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:28.339
 broadcast and need all cut found 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.279
 also here are the individual parts and singular 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.350
 here it is to see details here everywhere 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.390
 lying around we won't like it here 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.340
 one detail 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.820
 for example on the one hand here she is for 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.050
 I am only 1 and that is, it will need 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.230
 three pairs, we redraw twice 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.120
 Replace all on corrugated cardboard 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.960
 from under the boxes there is a figure 1 digit 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.719
 yes and so on every detail here 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.579
 almost all parts have two digits and so 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.980
 that's what I have in the end slowly 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.010
 it turns out that is 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:10.220
 the tip here and see what many 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.710
 there is a problem and sometimes very well 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.750
 the ball is right what to sing cardboard house well you all 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.170
 details that at least to the fire 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.560
 they must bend the ball knead the cardboard 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.380
 otherwise we will have a cracking tear and 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.230
 would be ugly so angular 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.320
 this is the main problem she was mine of 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.880
 I had a lot of cardboard 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.980
 thrown out crafts because I did not know 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.230
 Sizki you then I myself came to her 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.230
 that nobody tells her on the Internet 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.100
 after a tremendous amount of time and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.850
 I finally collected the work 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.990
 glued the helmet must say that this helmet 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:06.640
 glued much more difficult than the same helmet 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.759
 iron man is seriously harder so 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.830
