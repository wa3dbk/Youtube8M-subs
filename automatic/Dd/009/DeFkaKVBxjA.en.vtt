00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
here as well clever little system which

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.680 
here as well clever little system which
take<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.740> look<00:00:27.860> in<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.039> second<00:00:28.490> but<00:00:29.150> first<00:00:29.210> seat

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
take a look in a second but first seat

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.180 
take a look in a second but first seat
towards<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.199> base<00:00:30.500> we've<00:00:30.770> got<00:00:30.890> your<00:00:31.010> standard

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
towards the base we've got your standard

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.849 
towards the base we've got your standard
mesh<00:00:31.940> panels<00:00:32.390> this<00:00:33.050> runs<00:00:33.320> all<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:33.590> way<00:00:33.710> around

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:33.859 
mesh panels this runs all the way around

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.219 
mesh panels this runs all the way around
from<00:00:34.219> the<00:00:34.340> bottom<00:00:34.699> up<00:00:35.210> around<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.749> sides<00:00:36.019> as

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:36.229 
from the bottom up around the sides as

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:37.689 
from the bottom up around the sides as
well<00:00:36.409> so<00:00:36.620> you<00:00:36.679> can<00:00:36.769> get<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.979> good<00:00:37.249> amount<00:00:37.339> of<00:00:37.550> air

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
well so you can get a good amount of air

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.059 
well so you can get a good amount of air
circulating<00:00:38.300> through<00:00:38.659> here<00:00:38.929> we<00:00:39.589> can<00:00:39.859> prevent

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:40.069 
circulating through here we can prevent

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:41.950 
circulating through here we can prevent
that<00:00:40.280> lens<00:00:40.519> from<00:00:40.760> fogging<00:00:41.059> up<00:00:41.300> or<00:00:41.510> getting<00:00:41.780> any

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
that lens from fogging up or getting any

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.979 
that lens from fogging up or getting any
condensation<00:00:42.319> on<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:44.030> top<00:00:44.329> however<00:00:44.780> they've

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
condensation on the top however they've

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.500 
condensation on the top however they've
gone<00:00:45.170> through<00:00:45.559> a<00:00:45.589> new<00:00:46.159> design<00:00:46.519> this<00:00:46.850> season<00:00:47.329> to

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
gone through a new design this season to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.349 
gone through a new design this season to
run<00:00:47.659> on<00:00:47.809> we<00:00:48.620> have<00:00:48.799> a<00:00:48.829> slightly<00:00:49.309> thicker<00:00:49.760> mesh

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
run on we have a slightly thicker mesh

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.869 
run on we have a slightly thicker mesh
inside<00:00:50.780> here<00:00:51.170> now<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.829> idea<00:00:52.129> of<00:00:52.399> this<00:00:52.519> is<00:00:52.729> to

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
inside here now the idea of this is to

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.209 
inside here now the idea of this is to
stop<00:00:53.059> any<00:00:53.239> melting<00:00:53.629> snow<00:00:54.079> or<00:00:54.379> stronger<00:00:54.979> winds

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
stop any melting snow or stronger winds

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.369 
stop any melting snow or stronger winds
from<00:00:55.459> getting<00:00:55.850> through<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.359> top<00:00:57.049> part<00:00:57.289> of

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
from getting through to the top part of

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.739 
from getting through to the top part of
the<00:00:57.559> frame<00:00:58.399> onto<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:59.149> lens<00:00:59.389> because

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
the frame onto the lens because

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:01.000 
the frame onto the lens because
obviously<00:00:59.839> get<00:01:00.109> melting<00:01:00.440> snow<00:01:00.649> on<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.859> lens

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
obviously get melting snow on the lens

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.009 
obviously get melting snow on the lens
is<00:01:01.190> going<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.399> freeze<00:01:01.729> and<00:01:02.299> obviously<00:01:02.600> obscure

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
is going to freeze and obviously obscure

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.960 
is going to freeze and obviously obscure
your<00:01:03.139> vision<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.129> this<00:01:04.250> thicker<00:01:04.549> mesh<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:04.940> the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
your vision so this thicker mesh in the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.640 
your vision so this thicker mesh in the
top<00:01:05.299> here<00:01:05.540> just<00:01:05.720> prevents<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:06.200> from<00:01:06.229> getting

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
top here just prevents that from getting

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.430 
top here just prevents that from getting
through<00:01:07.270> now<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:08.330> can<00:01:08.630> completely<00:01:09.200> remove

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
through now you can completely remove

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.350 
through now you can completely remove
this<00:01:09.830> section<00:01:10.340> if<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:10.520> want<00:01:10.700> more<00:01:10.850> air<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.210> get

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
this section if you want more air to get

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.230 
this section if you want more air to get
through<00:01:11.690> into<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.110> goggle<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:13.730> if<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:14.060> just

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
through into the goggle this if you just

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.840 
through into the goggle this if you just
pushes<00:01:14.570> through<00:01:14.720> onto<00:01:15.230> the<00:01:15.350> sides<00:01:15.590> here<00:01:15.950> and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
pushes through onto the sides here and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.790 
pushes through onto the sides here and
you<00:01:17.180> can<00:01:17.300> then<00:01:17.420> peel<00:01:17.690> it<00:01:17.840> right<00:01:17.990> back<00:01:18.410> all<00:01:18.650> the

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
you can then peel it right back all the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.380 
you can then peel it right back all the
way<00:01:18.890> off<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.340> take<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.610> off<00:01:19.700> completely<00:01:19.910> so

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
way off and take it off completely so

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.060 
way off and take it off completely so
this<00:01:20.630> then<00:01:20.810> opens<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.320> channel<00:01:21.590> right<00:01:21.800> up<00:01:21.980> at

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
this then opens the channel right up at

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.340 
this then opens the channel right up at
the<00:01:22.100> top<00:01:22.160> to<00:01:22.820> get<00:01:22.970> good<00:01:23.360> strong<00:01:23.840> amount<00:01:24.080> of<00:01:24.200> air
