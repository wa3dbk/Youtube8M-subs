00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.919
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.290

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.650
 Today we sat the track for you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.619
 he in the industry edition 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.570
 that is different from the standard re 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:25.350
 where do we have a mama monster engine here 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:30.840
 and the matching regulator we have 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.410
 the remote control with the docking station 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 that means you can do your ipod or 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.079
 connect directly to iphone and it is 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.489
 Also two in her hair with three 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.250
 Let's take a look at the technical 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:56.460
 data as I said castration mum 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:02.000
 monster 2200 kv the tracks the sticky 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.239
 2,4 gigahertz and here you see the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.670
 to dye 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.260
 there are red black red gray blue and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.680
 blue 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.010
 and we have the black red here 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010
 variant 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.119
 here comes the control to the fore 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.119
 nice handy and as you can see 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.369
 be docking connection directly 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.689
 built-in 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.600
 so there is the possibility in 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.299
 ipod and the iphone directly 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.590
 nice small and compact worth mentioning 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:58.270
 is also that only four aaa batteries 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.789
 to be plugged in compared to others 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.789
 Remote controls need the eight batteries 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.550
 First, the complete accessory package 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:49.340
 again with the instructions different 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.060
 tools key for the wheels too 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.819
 but also change silicone oil in the around 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.310
 do not meet shock absorbers 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:03.560
 There are different feathers 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.050
 included in the exchange also the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:12.799
 Spring lengths can be changed 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:20.540
 stedter away then more documents for 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:24.200
 the ipod dock a key to switch 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.000
 the wheels say it comes a lot 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.000
 more interesting but the vehicle 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:59.940
 very beautiful body black and gray red 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.670
 So this note but on it 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.049
 make attentive that this you evo 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:31.790
 with the castle what the system 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:36.340
 the direct view is delivered here 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:41.930
 on the vehicle in comparison to the standard 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:47.600
 the huge engine turns up and the 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:51.500
 russel regulator the batteries are already in 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.840
 the shafts knitted here would 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.230
 I strongly recommend this through nico 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:03.200
 exchange batteries 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:06.440
 then the ride time increases yes 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:12.470
 compared to the standard he evo is next to 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:15.050
 the engine as far as I can see that 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.090
 other mature built-in empowered with 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.090
 takers are already others 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:33.409
 two very big that is also in the standard 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:36.050
 revo actually looks the same 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.699
 from standard to which the states 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:43.069
 in fact here only the motorization 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:44.809
 and the other films take away a lot 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.849
 nice vehicle am curious how the 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:51.349
 go that's it 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:56.709
 I wish you a lot of fun thanks for 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:56.709
