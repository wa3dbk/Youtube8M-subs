00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.350
 yours plays an axis of right 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.340
 balance between speed and weight 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.980
 arcata immediately finds the right speed 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.190
 without accelerating the absence to loosen 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.920
 and distributes the weight of the arm well 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.600
 throughout the arc if the sound accesses 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.210
 marco baffles don't stop for 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.410
 start over keep looking for yours 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.649
 always sound with the balance between weight and 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.290
 speed day after day I improve 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.500
 lean on the agreement in a non- mannered way 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.890
 add strength 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.739
 choose a metronome 40 ideals but six 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.510
 too slow then choose for 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.420
 start at 60 and you'll see that in a few 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.899
 days to check the speed 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.250
 of the given the arc can be divided into two 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:09.530
 parts in three parts or in four if desired 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.530
 parts begins 4 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.300
 then 4 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.420
 and return to the starting point until 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:46.040
 4 then on the other strings on the first one 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.049
 on the door yes the third dedicated to the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.230
 only a few discoveries of your sound 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:54.129
 minutes five minutes for court in total 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.129
 20 minutes a day
