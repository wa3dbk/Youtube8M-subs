you<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> all<00:01:27.930> mixed<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:29.570> we're<00:01:30.570> gonna

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you get that all mixed in we're gonna

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.440 
you get that all mixed in we're gonna
take<00:01:30.990> our<00:01:31.259> shrimp<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.850> simply<00:01:33.119> coat

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
take our shrimp and just simply coat

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.560 
take our shrimp and just simply coat
those<00:01:33.720> shrimp<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:35.130> cornstarch<00:01:35.640> we've

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
those shrimp in that cornstarch we've

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230 
those shrimp in that cornstarch we've
purposely<00:01:37.049> made<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.619> slurry<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:39.150> bit

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
purposely made that slurry a little bit

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.670 
purposely made that slurry a little bit
thick<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.840> gonna<00:01:39.960> make<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.530> nice

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
thick so it's gonna make a really nice

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.599 
thick so it's gonna make a really nice
coating<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.400> shrimp<00:01:41.640> there

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.249

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
so now we're gonna turn our attention to

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.050 
so now we're gonna turn our attention to
the<00:01:48.439> oil<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:49.100> have<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> candy<00:01:49.939> thermometer

the oil and I have a candy thermometer

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.480 
the oil and I have a candy thermometer
in<00:01:50.479> here<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:50.869> it's<00:01:51.020> 350<00:01:51.950> degrees<00:01:52.250> you're

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
in here and it's 350 degrees you're

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.130 
in here and it's 350 degrees you're
gonna<00:01:52.609> leave<00:01:52.850> your<00:01:52.969> heat<00:01:53.210> about<00:01:53.509> medium<00:01:53.990> and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
you're gonna adjust the heat as you put

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.249 
you're gonna adjust the heat as you put
your<00:01:56.179> shrimp<00:01:56.299> in<00:01:56.539> because<00:01:56.719> it's<00:01:56.840> gonna<00:01:56.929> start

your shrimp in because it's gonna start
to<00:01:57.319> cool<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.649> down<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.859> little<00:01:58.130> bit<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:59.030> 350

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
to cool it down a little bit so 350

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.389 
to cool it down a little bit so 350
degrees<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.259> where<00:02:00.469> I'm<00:02:00.560> at<00:02:00.679> and<00:02:01.189> you're<00:02:01.310> gonna

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.449 
degrees is where I'm at and you're gonna
do<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:01.789> in<00:02:01.969> two<00:02:02.240> batches<00:02:03.009> take<00:02:04.009> each<00:02:04.159> shrimp

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
do this in two batches take each shrimp

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:10.080 
do this in two batches take each shrimp
drop<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.240> in<00:02:05.360> individually<00:02:06.110> into<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.219> oil

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.360 

half<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.299> shrimp<00:02:11.569> go<00:02:11.690> in<00:02:11.870> about<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.769> minute<00:02:13.099> per

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
half the shrimp go in about a minute per

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.460 
half the shrimp go in about a minute per
side<00:02:13.450> it's<00:02:14.450> gonna<00:02:14.569> get<00:02:14.720> really<00:02:14.959> nice<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
side it's gonna get really nice and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.809 
side it's gonna get really nice and
crisp<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:15.890> then<00:02:16.010> we're<00:02:16.099> gonna<00:02:16.190> drain<00:02:16.549> it<00:02:16.580> on<00:02:16.790> a

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
crisp and then we're gonna drain it on a

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.770 
crisp and then we're gonna drain it on a
couple<00:02:17.480> paper<00:02:17.780> towels<00:02:18.079> to<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.410> side<00:02:19.780> all

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
couple paper towels to the side all

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.300 
couple paper towels to the side all
right<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.079> we're<00:02:21.230> removing<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.650> last<00:02:21.890> batch

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
right so we're removing the last batch

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.520 
right so we're removing the last batch
of<00:02:22.519> shrimp<00:02:22.790> here<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.269> what<00:02:23.720> I'm<00:02:23.810> looking<00:02:24.170> for<00:02:24.410> is

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
of shrimp here I what I'm looking for is

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.990 
of shrimp here I what I'm looking for is
this<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.799> get<00:02:24.950> really<00:02:25.250> nice<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.579> brown<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.880> the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
this to get really nice and brown on the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.330 
this to get really nice and brown on the
outside<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:27.260> like<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.590> said<00:02:27.650> we're<00:02:27.950> cooking<00:02:28.250> at

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
outside and like I said we're cooking at

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.300 
outside and like I said we're cooking at
350<00:02:28.819> degrees<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.660> we're<00:02:30.290> using<00:02:30.440> thawed<00:02:30.860> shrimp

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
350 degrees so we're using thawed shrimp

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.270 
350 degrees so we're using thawed shrimp
so<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.269> minute<00:02:32.690> per<00:02:32.840> side<00:02:33.079> is<00:02:33.319> plenty<00:02:33.860> enough<00:02:34.129> to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
so a minute per side is plenty enough to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.220 
so a minute per side is plenty enough to
get<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.549> shrimp<00:02:34.849> up<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.329> 140<00:02:35.930> degrees

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
get this shrimp up to that 140 degrees

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.229 
get this shrimp up to that 140 degrees
where<00:02:36.500> we<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:36.769> our<00:02:36.950> shrimp<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.220> be<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:38.090> now
