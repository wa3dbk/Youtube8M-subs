and look at the instructions for details
on<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.930> correct<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.559> now<00:00:49.710> let's<00:00:50.309> explore

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
on how to correct it now let's explore

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.170 
on how to correct it now let's explore
the<00:00:50.969> interface<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.719> bit<00:00:52.010> if<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.940> click

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the interface a little bit if you click

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 
the interface a little bit if you click
on<00:00:54.300> options<00:00:54.989> you'll<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.070> will<00:00:56.219> let

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
on options you'll see that this will let

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
on options you'll see that this will let
you<00:00:56.519> change<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.969> path<00:00:57.239> where<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> material

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
you change the path where the material

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
you change the path where the material
schemes<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.530> saved<00:00:58.800> will<00:00:59.519> use<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.910> default

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
schemes are saved will use the default

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.270 
schemes are saved will use the default
for<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:00.660> you'll<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.590> there's<00:01:01.829> three<00:01:02.039> columns

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
for now you'll see there's three columns

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.670 
for now you'll see there's three columns
saved<00:01:02.789> schemes<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.600> material<00:01:04.050> listing<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
saved schemes the material listing and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
saved schemes the material listing and
then<00:01:05.070> thumbnails<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.910> materials<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
then thumbnails of the materials the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.289 
then thumbnails of the materials the
Save<00:01:07.140> button<00:01:07.170> actually<00:01:08.130> saves<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.790> current

the first step in creating different
material<00:01:25.810> schemes<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:27.190> sign<00:01:27.430> materials

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.070 
material schemes is to sign materials
using<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.600> NXT<00:01:29.020> interface<00:01:30.690> after<00:01:31.690> you've

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
using the NXT interface after you've

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.560 
using the NXT interface after you've
finished<00:01:32.290> assigning<00:01:32.979> your<00:01:33.100> materials<00:01:33.729> go

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
finished assigning your materials go

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.130 
finished assigning your materials go
ahead<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:34.990> relaunch<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:36.550> next<00:01:37.300> layers

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.780 
ahead and relaunch the next layers
material<00:01:38.860> scheme<00:01:40.080> interface<00:01:41.080> now<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.580> can

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
material scheme interface now you can

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.120 
material scheme interface now you can
create<00:01:43.180> your<00:01:43.810> different<00:01:44.200> schemes<00:01:44.500> I've

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
create your different schemes I've

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.980 
create your different schemes I've
created<00:01:45.520> light<00:01:46.000> medium<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.720> dark<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.720> change

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990

materials are updated in your view then
from<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:57.940> point<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.360> can<00:01:58.450> render<00:01:59.020> each<00:01:59.500> view

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
from this point you can render each view

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.290 
from this point you can render each view
based<00:02:00.550> on<00:02:00.729> your<00:02:00.850> material<00:02:01.149> schemes<00:02:03.300> this
