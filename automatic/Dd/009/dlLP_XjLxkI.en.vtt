 his presentation in society was with all the pomp 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.449
 almost a matter of status 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.869
 when the new Uruguayan President José Mujica took office 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.820
 He made his first tour as agent in this truck 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.349
 will develop in guayaquil quito 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.749
 well load fuel 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.720
 and this is the engine here we have the induction motor motors book of 

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:27.429
 brushless friction 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.210
 in high-performance engines that taking advantage of the 8 percent street 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.130
 energy 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.690
 that they have available from the batteries 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.920
 and also adapts to any type of vehicle 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.820
 based on a traditional vehicle 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.210
 a combustion engine can be more dangerous right another one is transformed 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.740
 All the original grammy is removed from the grammar and converted to electric 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.819
 it may be that they see a person in need of a vehicle that 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.470
 he can drive at 140 kilometers per hour 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.690
 that needs 200 kilometers of autonomy per load and well it is said neither 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.180
 to the star system in that vehicle p covering the needs of the user 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.360
 according to its promoters 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.820
 In the SUSANA system, most of the problems that are usually attributed to 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.110
 electric vehicles as their lack of autonomy 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.000
 and speed 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.880
 they say it's applicable to all kinds of cars sporting vintage cars as well as 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.520
 buses trucks trucks agricultural machinery 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.590
 transport may 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.110
 and that also adapts to any pace of life or work there 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.450
 statistics that indicate that 80% of the users of vehicles the common one is 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.530
 more in more than 80 kilometers per day 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.869
 so that eventually a vehicle with 100 kilometers 1 mile could cover 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.180
 the needs of the majority of the population 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.500
 that vehicle can be recharged normally the night in six hours 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.200
 but if the company needs fast loading it needed a vehicle to stay 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.409
 without in the morning return the company and I return to have 100 or more kilometers 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.350
 for the afternoon 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.280
 High speed loaders can be installed 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 The system can be used in any vehicle 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.420
 from a utility van 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.530
 there iqueño automobile stipp for fast displacements in the city the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.610
 true that the comparison is this much prettier of all electric or not 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.220
 it has that noise also being automatic and not having beade 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.590
 also simply depends on the accelerator and brake nothing else and the brake 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.180
 it is used quite little because the vehicle has 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.750
 regenerative braking so that by the mere fact of your releasing the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.869
 accelerator but vehicles until having a 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:30.589
 a retention in its functioning and that energy that is recovered for 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.479
 charge the battery 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.759
 in addition to comfort and efficiency 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.710
 the advantage goes much further 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.280
 one of the best causes of the recession to drive a vehicle 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.999
 electric 3

 after edition 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.769
 the private vehicle does not have an exhaust pipe

 around the environment or polluting the heiress of 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.790
 it's renewable energy clean energy

 the latest technology 98 percent recyclable and investment 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:08.849
 quickly amortizing the consumption of the vehicle if we compare it with what is 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.879
 Usual consumption with internal combustion engine 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.639

 be all that is a general maintenance that according to motor vehicle of 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.309
 internal combustion that in the electric vehicle is not necessary in short 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.169
