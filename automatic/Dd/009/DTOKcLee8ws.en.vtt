00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the basis of this hairstyle is the ability to weave 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.930
 french pigtail 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.809
 resulting in a quirky 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.820
 zigzag and the whole look is romantic 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.570
 and free all pretty simple 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.210
 let's try if you have long 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.820
 hair then such a bun braid is one of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 options how to diversify your image to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.750
 This hairstyle fits and small 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.550
 black dress and pantsuit and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.189
 luxurious cocktail dress with deep 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 cleavage 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.950
 best of all the hair in a bunch of wasps will 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.780
 stowed on the second day after washing 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.829
 however if you prefer perfect 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.290
 clean hair 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.860
 then you can use mousse or 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.989
 strong hold hairspray 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.629
 do side parting separate the bangs and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.149
 we fix it with an elastic band or a clip to 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.730
 while it did not bother us we begin to weave 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.680
 french braid with temple 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.469
 we take priyati in cash desk only from above 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.910
 the bottom of the pigtail should form an even 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.590
 edge 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.800
 pigtail goes first from one temple to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.800
 to another 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.500
 further we must expand weaving 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.720
 pigtails in the opposite direction 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.560
 grabbing hide-and-seek only from above while 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.259
 bottom edge 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.229
 leave clean we should get 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.570
 clear weave pattern 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.850
 the result should be like the letter z 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.820
 free edge we get into the usual braid 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.800
 and fasten with a rubber band further free 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.409
 the edge of the pigtail is laid in a circle in 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.500
 we fix a small cocoon with pins or 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.500
 invisible 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.630
 remove the clip from the bangs it can be a bit 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.070
 to comb 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.190
 or tousle fingers put five 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.870
 back to the resulting cocoon from the cash register 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.410
 we fasten invisible and sprinkle 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.410
