images reflect offer let's check it out
look<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.270> look<00:01:54.420> closely<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
look at this so if you look closely you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920 
look at this so if you look closely you
see<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.740> zoom<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.850> touch<00:01:57.060> there

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
see if I can zoom in just a touch there

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.370 
see if I can zoom in just a touch there
you<00:01:58.049> go

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you go

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.710 
you go
now<00:01:58.679> as<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.190> spin<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> around<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.539> can<00:02:00.600> see

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
now as you spin it around you can see

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.930
