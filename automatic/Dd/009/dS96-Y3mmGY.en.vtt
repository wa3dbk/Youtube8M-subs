00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.730
 Naples certainly has a story 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.650
 important wonderful story I sing to you 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.440
 of great composers 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.420
 including one of the 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.570
 the favorites notoriously that Sunday 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.760
 scarlatti however many returned 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.250
 others and therefore certainly musical 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.780
 like other parts too 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.989
 maybe there is a combination of Italy here 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.600
 particular let 's say of latitude of 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.540
 vision of the life of sun sea 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 influences that have been the most varied 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.750
 the most 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.150
 intense 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.980
 the Greek one even the Spanish one 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.420
 passing from French pear 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.640
 I generally believe that music lives 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.630
 be universal however certainly in certain 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.390
 places takes on connotations 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.309
 particularly strong 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.260
 I would say that very much associates the idea of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.110
 musicality to naturalness la 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.790
 spontaneity to the physicality of the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 expressions there is a great big the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 award the bartender who was the schieppati 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.260
 which I hope you wrote the first 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.720
 important book on scarlet 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.460
 that in his book on the table well 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.410
 tempered because it was a big one 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.900
 interpreter of both carat gas and you 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.530
 pay says there is no ear for how much 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 good and can not better 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.970
 often musicality is associated with a given 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.380
 immutable native 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.469
 this is absolutely false 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.469
 purpose can be a native given 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:47.439
 but assuming that it is gone then it is 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.030
 modifiable and can be the subject of 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.950
 great great condition 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 it is not a static thing that is the one for 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.539
 all life is certainly a capacity 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.329
 to arrange to say to perceive of 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.649
 react to sounds 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.079
 this is a frame then inside 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.610
 this one can be more inclined to do 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.910
 the instrumentalist or that the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.769
 composer that other both yes 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.500
 it can also be listeners of 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.540
 music you can be a listener 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.330
 an anti listener very musical 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.470
 musical that is incapable of perceiving of 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.200
 enjoy a thrilling market one 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.319
 tremendous question of fi at the end 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.180
 slowly at least we managed to 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.700
 give two coordinates also for those who are there 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.579
 listen to who rightly says but who is the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.440
 musicality some point the piano 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.510
 when they started cv 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.860
 Electronic sayings seemed to have started 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.650
 precisely to attention and extinction 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.960
 as a kind of distinction and I have to 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.990
 to say that in the 70s it was feared then 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.470
 instead he incredibly resumed ha 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.560
 come back to life and it's our piano 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.790
 increases deeply anachronists 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.310
 completely anachronistic because not 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.120
 just because it is a tool that others 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.190
 100 years and more is said to be rare in the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.100
 seven hundred years is simple to work 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.020
 of the brilliant Italian, however 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.150
 bartolomeo at the stop 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.080
 and this is this sure not but I say 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.420
 also wine 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.490
 there are all instruments 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.770
 ancient is not anachronistic because 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.690
 ancient was very serious because it is one 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.030
 complicated tool when it has 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.910
 need a lot of maintenance one 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.380
 tool that easily deteriorates 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.260
 hammers are consumed are consumed i 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.410
 vitarelli vines, ie one 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.200
 complicated tool as a lot of management 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.000
 complete and this in times when the 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.850
 big time is yes 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.080
 try to do everything quickly 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.300
 clearly he could have put it 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.190
 out of the game because we need to 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.870
 storyteller of the tech how to have one 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.330
 nice car for every time 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.810
 you have to walk warned of 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.320
 mechanics around this could do 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.590
 fear that she would disappear when she was one 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.990
 is that of the speed of the era of 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.590
 continuous present but no is a species 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.200
 of paradox of the carbon story 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.959
 also in the context of history 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.220
 there is very little tool 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.919
 therefore not very cheap many cases 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.630
 in fact there are keyboards though 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.220
 instead of supplanting it they live 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.340
 in parallel however they are obviously 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.620
 happy having dealt with for a while 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.800
 months they hardly copy the fact that we have 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.150
 45 to health projects life on 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.440
 floor only no at the moment no 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.509
 there are pour parler of concerts 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.389
 live facts in various parts of the world 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.580
 that could become dishes or 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.440
 several things to listen to in this 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.169
 period I have to listen to them again because then or 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.949
 note that I end up playing 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.020
 I tend to dismiss them blatantly though 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.419
 they sent me some materials from 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.889
 various parts of the world saying this is 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.599
 beautiful you have to make a record a 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.889
 this is beautiful understood I can't 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.920
 but make a record in the week and then 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.470
 There are 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.740
 let's say, however, that there are more projects 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.560
 these opportunities these possibilities 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.729
 which, however , I have a project that is not a 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.639
 project but a particular concert 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.690
 I mean this I will do at Basel e 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:35.139
 I will do it in November and I think 17 and it is 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.030
 a concert dedicated to the musician 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.680
 quite forgotten of the twentieth century that 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.509
 but it's called marvelous boss 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.340
 lamarque useless martin was it is about 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.960
 Czechoslovak origin but then he too 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.300
 lived a lot in france 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.949
 of the various darius milhaud road when 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.680
 there was weirdness when everyone was around 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:06:02.319
 30 addresses a lot we say fed to 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.950
 rich table set of france is 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:09.680
 a great confusion of the high that 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:13.880
 where there is a foundation that will begin 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.080
 you will have lucia disappeared in the dedicated 59 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.400
 they called me to do a 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.220
 concert 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.610
 so I'll do a concert with him on 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.699
 he 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:26.660
 never adopting this method of playing i 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.370
 his pieces and improvising on and 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.320
 also in this case as in the case of 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.830
 scarlet I think it's one thing 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.560
 quite nice and relevant because 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.470
 surely he from how he writes yes 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.620
 he understands that it was a great crisis 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:44.530
 many songs like many are scarlet 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.860
 one senses that they come from an input 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.680
 of physical instrumental character 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.410
 on the instrument this makes it 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.290
 particularly close and therefore I am 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.590
 glad to do this concert in 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.590
 Switzerland
