 Mr. Inaba who used this typing within a recurrence after making this book 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.870
 Is concerned about the worsening of doubt that appeared in Miyazaki Prefecture 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.870
 Did not 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.030
 It was time to talk about this in order to create a body 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.940
 London Joint

 Oshima village and pinch here 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.860
 During that

 Men are done and built by explorer 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.850

 He uses i. 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.520
 Washing scissors far above the conference on US-Europe high shears 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.740
 In the place where each hole is open, the trees that I used to do this are 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.310
 In the udon display 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.240
 It is only such a robot that has been around, only people 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.920

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.859
 In the gymnasium 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.409
 And the rocket is the sixth generation and it becomes one after next year 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.049
 It is a side ditch in the way of 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.670
 If you can get this long, please come 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.680
 And where is the rocket 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.590
 Because advertising 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.899
 I use j 1 leg, so Inazawa distribution is about this too much of the color

 I owe all the results below the launch of the shears 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.299
 I got lots of choices 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.299
 It is not something that was lost once in a few years 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:48.919
 Correspondence which entered 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.919

 It is about doing dilution diamond in the bank 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.359
 I made this kind of cardboard 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.649

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.609
 And then 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.889
 It is not possible that I can not say that I have a nice star tv 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.469
 I understood 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:46.320
 Yes yes because this was the first time 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.100
 Surprising 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.300
 I was able to put in with an easy response

 Disagreeable 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:02.279
 Behind the tires as a partner to be clear on US TV
