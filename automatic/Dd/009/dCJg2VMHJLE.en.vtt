00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello how about friends a greeting ya know 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.020
 Welcome to a simple and practical 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.120
 tutorial video well we continue with 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.830
 windows 8 today the video tutorial that you 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.780
 I bring next we are going to create is 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.119
 a shortcut to the administrator 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
 tasks well probably many of 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.420
 you who work with windows are 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.949
 the computer or a computer has been 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.420
 program that they have opened has been 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.340
 got caught 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.470
 and the first thing they do is turn off the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.840
 computer and you already know it 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.970
 we expel control when suppressing and we're going 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 to the task manager we chose 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.170
 task manager then to show 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.550
 below as how would music 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.380
 keys we would have to press to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.340
 manage of task but what are we going to 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.809
 do let's do a shortcut 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.730
 here on the desk for the case of 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.830
 that for whatever reason a program is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.090
 we block having to click on one that is 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.470
 direct access to the administrator 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.140
 tasks without having to press any of 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.400
 the keys well the keys that we have 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.310
 what to press for 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.570
 take us to the task manager would be 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:01.120
 control alt and suppress control to and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.770
 suppress and it will take us to a 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.300
 blue screen in which in the 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.860
 windows 8 we have to block for 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.840
 change the user to log out 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.420
 change a password and administrator 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.090
 of tasks well then then we would do 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.920
 task manager and will open us 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.230
 this task management window 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.940
 well then this video tutorial that I'm going to 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.770
 do next we are going to create this 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.060
 access to the task manager in the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.570
 desk 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.500
 I'm going to close it and for that we're going to 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.630
 continue with the institute and first thing 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.720
 what are we going to do anywhere 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.890
 right new mouse desk and 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.450
 direct access 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.210
 it's not going to be the window of creating a 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.010
 shortcut and here in this 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.690
 rectangular that we have the one that puts 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.530
 write the location of the item what 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.340
 let's do let's write the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 next command 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.170
 but it will show next well 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.060
 let's copy this mouse command 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.900
 right we copy in the description of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.840
 video I'll leave it 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.330
 right mouse and we paste all that here what 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.420
 let's give next we give you a click and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.720
 here we are going to put administrator of 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.720
 chores 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.830
 come we put this name you can 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.390
 put what they want but good to know 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.910
 that is shortcuts of this is 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.520
 better to put task manager and you 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.790
 we're going to finish well , we'll see 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.340
 that here has already created us an icon like 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.130
 a kind of computer with the symbol 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.360
 of computer administrator then 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.280
 this icon what we're going to do we're going 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.260
 to drag we will take it to the bar 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.360
 Windows tasks and we'll leave it there 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.330
 we can remove this direct access 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.560
 and we will have it here well in the case of 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.230
 that for whatever reason it is 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.220
 blocked a program simply you 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.290
 we click and open it right here in 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.760
 this window we see that we have in the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.800
 applications that we have open in 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.110
 this moment and in this case if by 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.400
 example outside the mozilla firefox what 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.740
 it has stuck simply 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.840
 right mouse and we give you finish task 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.000
 and automatically disappears from the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.260
 applications that are running 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.600
 who says in mozilla firefox any 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.550
 another program well in the administrator 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.800
 of tasks we have here the processes that 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.690
 are working in the background is very 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.270
 different to windows 7 to windows xp 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.030
 here comes a lot more more detailed 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.710
 we see that we have here good 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.810
 percentage of the cpu the memory that is 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.640
 using each program 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.710
 the percentage of disk that is occupying 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.420
 megas and the network here we have in process 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.820
 of background they are working on 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.520
 that moment we keep giving it down 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.590
 We have all the programs and 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.209
 Applications 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.560
 and windows processes that are 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.569
 working at this time administrator 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.150
 of windows here the percentage and the 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.190
 megas that are using well if 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.989
 we follow the performance we have here 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.120
 a few squares that will mark us the 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.440
 performance depending on the programs 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.380
 that we go working because we will go 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.510
 checking 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.280
 in memory exactly the same today 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.500
 we open some program we will upload the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.270
 memory process the disk the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.830
 disk execution 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.770
 we follow the application history 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.750
 here we have all the applications the 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.440
 time they have been running in 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.450
 our computer updates 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.890
 well we have everything here very complete if 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.270
 we are going to start here we have the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.440
 programs is very important 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.670
 these startup programs are the 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.680
 programs that when we started in 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.930
 our computer are the ones that 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.580
 run if they are fixed in this case I have 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.770
 all enabled except one here 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.180
 that so you do not get mexico for you 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.070
 make it faster at the start of the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.390
 windows we would give him the right mouse 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.550
 about the program that we have and we give it 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.310
 disable then what do you mean 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.750
 with this that will no longer start when 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.130
 we started our pc this program 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.900
 new will not start with the start 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.040
 so if we have all the programs 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.200
 enabled will slow us down the 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.060
 start windows well here we have 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.000
 the users in this case is me if 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.950
 we move the bar we see the tasks 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.020
 that are running or that I am 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.750
 using at this time 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.770
 here in the details and services in 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.110
 principle are the processes if we have 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.669
 some process or a program is 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.830
 working more than the account we are going to 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.020
 notice here in the memory and in the cpu 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.540
 let's try so that some in this 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.540
 case this then what we would do 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.580
 we would give him the right mouse and 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.580
 we would finish the process 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.860
 or go to the detail or open the location if 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.090
 we see we distrust a file by the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.060
 whatever it is because we are going to open the 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.889
 location and we can look for the 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.419
 online information search online 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.970
 then we would go to the internet and we will 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.070
 warn about that process if it can be 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.540
 harmful or can not be harmful and 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.760
 a lot of things I will not be able to 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.530
 explain it to no conditions because no 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.450
 I'm a computer technician, not a lot 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.220
 less simply I have tried many 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.810
 of them some of those that tested 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.669
 finish the process and I have been put 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.600
 the screen in the black color 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.190
 I had to restart the computer 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.729
 Then I know that I will not go back 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.000
 to play the most and he comes learning 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.620
 it is working entanglement that 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 it spoils the computer we install ourselves 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.460
 new to windows we install programs 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.770
 this is how you learn by working and 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.129
 working and many hours in front of the 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.459
 computer 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.089
 well nothing more friends I hope it is 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:13.339
 of help 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:13.339
 greetings to the next video chao
