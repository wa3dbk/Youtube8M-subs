here's<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.390> trick<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.690> like<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.930> use<00:04:34.050> for<00:04:34.260> those

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
here's a trick I like to use for those

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.010 
here's a trick I like to use for those
with<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.580> pencil<00:04:35.910> or<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.330> piece<00:04:36.750> of<00:04:36.870> colored

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
with a pencil or a piece of colored

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.760 
with a pencil or a piece of colored
chalk<00:04:37.440> mark<00:04:38.130> around<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.520> edge<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.030> outlet

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
chalk mark around the edge of the outlet

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.690 
chalk mark around the edge of the outlet
then<00:04:40.770> put<00:04:40.980> your<00:04:41.070> board<00:04:41.280> in<00:04:41.400> place<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:43.550> tap<00:04:44.550> it

against the outlet the chalk or graphite

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.080 
against the outlet the chalk or graphite
will<00:04:49.860> leave<00:04:49.950> an<00:04:50.070> outline<00:04:50.490> where<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:50.820> need<00:04:50.970> to

will leave an outline where you need to

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.540 
will leave an outline where you need to
cut<00:04:51.300> measure<00:04:52.140> about<00:04:52.350> half<00:04:52.680> an<00:04:52.800> inch<00:04:52.890> outside

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
cut measure about half an inch outside

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.310 
cut measure about half an inch outside
that<00:04:53.850> line<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.450> make<00:04:54.810> your<00:04:54.960> cut<00:04:55.110> with<00:04:55.290> a

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
that line and make your cut with a

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.200 
that line and make your cut with a
jigsaw

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210
