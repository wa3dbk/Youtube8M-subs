00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830 

all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.989> so<00:00:01.500> we've<00:00:01.770> had<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.250> frontal<00:00:02.639> bone

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:02.840 
all right so we've had the frontal bone

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.249 
all right so we've had the frontal bone
the<00:00:03.840> parietal<00:00:04.620> bone<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:06.270> third<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
the parietal bone and the third is the

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.470 
the parietal bone and the third is the
occipital<00:00:07.710> bone<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.400> there's<00:00:08.580> only<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:09.150> and

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
occipital bone and there's only one and

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.410 
occipital bone and there's only one and
it<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.440> at<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.010> back<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.730> head<00:00:14.120> and<00:00:15.120> of

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
it is at the back of the head and of

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.349 
it is at the back of the head and of
course<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:15.809> not<00:00:15.960> advancing<00:00:17.000> okay<00:00:18.000> there<00:00:18.270> we

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
course it's not advancing okay there we

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.810 
course it's not advancing okay there we
go<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.160> image<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.640> is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
go so you can see in this image this is

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.660 
go so you can see in this image this is
the<00:00:20.970> backside<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.680> skull<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.550> can

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the backside of the skull and you can

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.099 
the backside of the skull and you can
see<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.029> would<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.449> base<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.720> your

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
see this would be the base of your

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.800 
see this would be the base of your
cranium<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:26.070> light<00:00:26.640> purple<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.420> occipital

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
cranium in light purple is the occipital

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.990 
cranium in light purple is the occipital
bone<00:00:28.609> and<00:00:30.230> there's<00:00:31.230> another<00:00:31.500> suture<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.820> that

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
bone and there's another suture one that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.490 
bone and there's another suture one that
was<00:00:33.120> pretty<00:00:33.480> difficult<00:00:33.690> for<00:00:34.050> people<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
was pretty difficult for people to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
was pretty difficult for people to
pronounce<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.130> class<00:00:37.100> lambdoidal<00:00:38.100> okay<00:00:39.000> so

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
pronounce in class lambdoidal okay so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.080 
pronounce in class lambdoidal okay so
there<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> B<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.530> D<00:00:40.760> lambdoidal<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
there is a B and a D lambdoidal and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.520 
there is a B and a D lambdoidal and
that's<00:00:42.629> where<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> parietal<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.410> occipital

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that's where the parietal and occipital

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
that's where the parietal and occipital
bones<00:00:44.190> meet<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.360> this

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
bones meet and you can see that in this

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.369 
bones meet and you can see that in this
image<00:00:47.629> there<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.200> large<00:00:49.800> opening<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
image there is a large opening in the

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.529 
image there is a large opening in the
underside<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.860> cranium<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
underside of the cranium in the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
underside of the cranium in the
occipital<00:00:54.960> bone<00:00:55.199> called<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> foramen<00:00:56.520> magnum

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
occipital bone called the foramen magnum

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.599 
occipital bone called the foramen magnum
remember<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.800> said<00:00:58.949> foramen<00:00:59.250> is

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
remember that we said foramen is

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.569 
remember that we said foramen is
referring<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.300> anything<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.680> hole<00:01:02.219> or

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
referring to anything that is a hole or

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.270 
referring to anything that is a hole or
an<00:01:02.730> opening<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> bone<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.280> magnum

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
an opening in a bone and magnum

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.120 
an opening in a bone and magnum
obviously<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:06.659> means<00:01:07.049> big<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:07.979> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
obviously you know means big think of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.850 
obviously you know means big think of
magnum<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> roller<00:01:10.080> coaster<00:01:10.530> things

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
magnum is like the roller coaster things

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.570 
magnum is like the roller coaster things
like<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.070> opening

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
like that and all that is is the opening

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.200 
like that and all that is is the opening
that<00:01:14.880> leads<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.290> spinal<00:01:16.770> cord<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.280> your

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that leads to the spinal cord so your

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.749 
that leads to the spinal cord so your
brain<00:01:18.540> all<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.470> nerves<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:20.040> your<00:01:20.070> brain<00:01:20.189> or

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
brain all the nerves in your brain or

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.260 
brain all the nerves in your brain or
your<00:01:21.720> brain<00:01:22.020> turns<00:01:22.470> into<00:01:22.799> nerve<00:01:23.340> fibres<00:01:23.939> which

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
your brain turns into nerve fibres which

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.929 
your brain turns into nerve fibres which
then<00:01:24.540> lead<00:01:24.930> into<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.530> spinal<00:01:25.799> cord<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.909> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
then lead into the spinal cord so that

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.670 
then lead into the spinal cord so that
truly<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> only<00:01:28.729> opening<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> outside

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
truly is the only opening to the outside

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.130 
truly is the only opening to the outside
so<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:31.770> somebody<00:01:32.009> has<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.189> brain<00:01:32.460> injury<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
so if somebody has a brain injury and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.260 
so if somebody has a brain injury and
their<00:01:34.140> brain<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.560> swelling<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> only

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
their brain is swelling that is the only

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.910 
their brain is swelling that is the only
place<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.680> some

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
place that can go and there are some

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.399 
place that can go and there are some
very<00:01:38.189> important<00:01:38.759> parts<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.390> your<00:01:39.450> brain<00:01:39.720> just

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
very important parts of your brain just

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.039 
very important parts of your brain just
above<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.040> foramen<00:01:41.310> magnum<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.210> that's<00:01:42.899> why

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
above the foramen magnum so that's why

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.810 
above the foramen magnum so that's why
it's<00:01:43.200> very<00:01:43.320> dangerous<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.250> swelling<00:01:44.610> of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
it's very dangerous to have swelling of

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.870 
it's very dangerous to have swelling of
the<00:01:44.850> brain<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.659> either<00:01:45.930> side<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.880> foramen

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the brain on either side of the foramen

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.139 
the brain on either side of the foramen
magnum<00:01:47.939> are<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> occipital<00:01:49.110> condyles<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
magnum are the occipital condyles and a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.319 
magnum are the occipital condyles and a
condyle<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> rounded<00:01:52.350> process<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.329> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
condyle is a rounded process and the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.330 
condyle is a rounded process and the
condyles<00:01:54.840> articulate<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.860> first

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
condyles articulate with the first

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.420 
condyles articulate with the first
vertebra<00:01:57.030> which<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> atlas<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:59.310> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
vertebra which is the atlas and if you

vertebra which is the atlas and if you
recall<00:01:59.579> when<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.030> made<00:02:00.360> your<00:02:00.390> skeletons<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
recall when you made your skeletons that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.810 
recall when you made your skeletons that
was<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> things<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.610> had<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
was one of the things that you had to
