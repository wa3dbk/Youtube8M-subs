have<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> little<00:01:02.699> idea<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.449> how<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:05.189> past

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
have a little idea of how to get past

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.050 
have a little idea of how to get past
the<00:01:05.700> first<00:01:05.970> part<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.520> started<00:01:08.820> out

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the first part so you get started out

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.960 
the first part so you get started out
there's<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:10.820> guards<00:01:12.020> homies<00:01:13.820> kinda<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
there's like guards homies kinda have to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.179 
there's like guards homies kinda have to
be<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> little<00:01:15.330> sneaky<00:01:15.600> here

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.730 

because<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.369> share<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.789> look<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> really

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
because you share it look like a really

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.419
