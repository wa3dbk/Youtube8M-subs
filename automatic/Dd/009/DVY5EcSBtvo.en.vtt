00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
1/2 degrees if I will make a 8 sided

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.420 
1/2 degrees if I will make a 8 sided
bolt<00:00:34.870> with<00:00:35.110> that<00:00:35.350> I<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:36.700> my<00:00:37.380> saw<00:00:38.380> fence<00:00:38.710> set

up<00:00:39.579> with<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.760> safety<00:00:40.090> block<00:00:40.480> what<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.079> safety

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
up with a safety block what the safety

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.010 
up with a safety block what the safety
block<00:00:41.739> does<00:00:42.010> is<00:00:42.520> after<00:00:42.820> I<00:00:43.000> knew<00:00:43.300> these<00:00:43.540> boards

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
block does is after I knew these boards

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.750 
block does is after I knew these boards
beyond<00:00:44.320> that<00:00:44.500> safety<00:00:44.950> block<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.489> gives<00:00:45.670> a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
beyond that safety block it gives a

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.330 
beyond that safety block it gives a
little<00:00:45.970> space<00:00:46.239> out<00:00:46.510> here<00:00:46.840> so<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.800> blocks

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
little space out here so the blocks

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.569 
little space out here so the blocks
don't<00:00:48.579> bind<00:00:48.910> with<00:00:49.270> with<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.380> saw<00:00:50.590> fence<00:00:50.920> and

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
don't bind with with the saw fence and

00:00:51.579 --> 00:01:13.990 
don't bind with with the saw fence and
get<00:00:51.730> thrown<00:00:52.000> back

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
to glue up the rings I use a type 3

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.819 
to glue up the rings I use a type 3
water-resistant<00:01:17.759> glue<00:01:18.350> apply<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.710> both

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
ends swap it around with another block

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:46.410 
ends swap it around with another block
make<00:01:26.490> sure<00:01:26.700> both<00:01:26.850> ends<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.299> well<00:01:27.509> covered
