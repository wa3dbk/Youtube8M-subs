00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.770
 as such this opportunity I am going to 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.250
 tell what they have as some people 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.350
 with the kind of physical stomach 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.290
 Well, I'm going to recommend that you 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.840
 people who are born under this type of 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.960
 physical if it was physiognomy of the type 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.170
 somatic that the tumor with a thing 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.330
 thin after without moderately strong 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.340
 but that it costs the muscles and 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.949
 at the same time it costs him to gain fat 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.800
 well this person what is going to have to 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.790
 without capitalizing emphasis first of all 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.710
 to eat is protein and carbohydrates 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.320
 like in what way before the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.660
 elimination that is one just gets up 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.559
 can be from the bed or base to your 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.750
 carbohydrate tasks this is going to 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.670
 Acquire directly with just 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.000
 flours 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.589
 in compact for example noodles can be 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.199
 accommodate radio lesson 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.600
 it's all kinds of fresh pasta yummy that 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.239
 before going to the gym the carbohydrate 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.290
 will give you the energy the strength to 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.790
 that eventually when I go to 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.980
 gym has enough explosive strength 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.590
 from where to train 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.990
 and then again when he returns home 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.480
 protein has to eat proteins 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.380
 like the here of the meat of the fish 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.750
 of chicken 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.560
 is heavy is as good as tuna the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.200
 salmon without and above they contribute 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.810
 innumerable his clients and from humid 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.270
 up a lot of good things the barça 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.570
 form muscles quickly this 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.700
 but this amorphous yes good logically what 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.009
 what I'm indicating here is something 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.899
 pretty simple without hairs so you do not 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.579
 they are giving an idea of ​​how you 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.280
 you have to work and how do you have to 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.380
 eat if you want to make a profit very 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.750
 taken care of important and because we remember 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.720
 that if everything with oneself we are not going to 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.880
 have this a good muscle gain 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.470
 as it really is a pain so 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.650
 eat the same with this amorphous yes 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.450
 good about the month or dead was 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.770
 as it is also the same if of something in 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.899
 a coma 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.819
 and old ignacio carbohydrates 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.160
 large carbohydrates half the day 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.860
 from morning to noon and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.290
 then all protein well worth noting 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.810
 that the amorphous month has to be power 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.090
 strong somatic type or the type of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.540
 body that gains muscle quickly 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.760
 and that can also have a force 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.069
 natural innate 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.840
 can be and the other has eaten that 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.140
 eat several times protein during 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.450
 trip 5 or 6 small meals but good 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.470
 for example I do not say that they eat a plate 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.510
 of this size of food is not necessary 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.750
 indispensably do this what yes 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.930
 is for example they grab a sandwich two 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.090
 common parents 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.950
 a truth a seen this is considered 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.450
 like a meal like that because it's really 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.000
 a meal but we're not 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.410
 ham and cheese we all started from 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.320
 proteins 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.090
 good and finally for the two 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.650
 dead and the people who are served 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.690
 be more or sales that are overweight 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.860
 that they have so much for the part of 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.430
 forward as for the back 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.290
 rounded shapes and just response in 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.880
 of progressing duty of eating should 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.850
 agree that just like the person 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.640
 strong and that like enough proteins 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.770
 carbohydrates in this case is the other way around and 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.920
 from elect love for carbohydrates 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.000
 proteins going through the type of month or 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.160
 love because he eats all the time 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.260
 protected above all things and 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.870
 the amorphous happens to be the other way around 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.480
 starts with the proteins and leaves for the 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.280
 last data and it's more obvious with 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.680
 day avoid carbohydrates and by 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.720
 carbohydrates bloat without tend to 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.460
 make the body swell and what 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.250
 last one that a person with a 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.890
 bulky body if it's won over 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.090
 plus size the network is to keep me trained 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.340
 to have to transform your physique 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.560
 to grow 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.870
 of the obese guy do one more person 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.849
 thin you can perfectly know 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.980
 a lot of people and in your die 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.840
 many people with my diets and my 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.239
 advice personally here where 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.830
 established which are grateful 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.780
 and they always ask me for more advice 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.040
 to keep going down without me lately 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.859
 was counting a boy who has 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.410
 helped recently to lose weight was 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.280
 thinking continue to be 22 and up to 80 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.410
 if you can not go doing that only 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.810
 others that exist start running and 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.860
 not the recommendation of commas proteins 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.810
 because the person was eating 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.800
 carbohydrates follow many videos and 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.470
 others not well meat wood if not not worth 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.560
 burgers is not valuable either 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.140
 It is especially riding with eggs 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.960
 fried they go does not fit a piece of meat 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.150
 small with tomato with lettuce and with 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.920
 an expected good but not done 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.660
 logically I work that in the end the 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.390
 only ones that you are going to lose is the 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.070
 person who is going to do this if I do not say 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.450
 you do not like yours because I know 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.360
 that you back when it is 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.120
 appropriately correctly yes good 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.880
 so well let's go over this 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.689
 morpho carbohydrates protein fats 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.319
 few very few fats 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:14.209
 kiss love for proteins still ideal 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.309
 they would be proteins and what do I do all together 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:20.779
 all day at any ideal time 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:23.239
 proteins and endo morpho proteins if 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.649
 we avoid carbohydrates at least for a 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:27.409
 time albeit less in the part of 

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:29.479
 growth how good the person 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.449
 voluminous of the obese fat person 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.840
 it gains muscle more easily than in this 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.699
 dead 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.040
 so it's not worth the probation develops 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.810
 this game you ask me through the door to 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.880
 lose weight or be first in the phase of 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.040
 growth taking advantage of its size 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.720
 you can achieve more musculature 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.889
 important to the string part of a 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.639
 secret the person or another sheep when doing 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.590
 muscles starts 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.569
 and it's going to look more tied up 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.320
 because before it is not the same as once 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:02.570
 did so the rose is like that 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.920
 because then the others are going to be 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.020
 way they will be more round 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.970
 arms also then by consequent 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.620
 in physical is going to see more 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.810
 small and on top of your nation is the 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.880
 my routine to lose weight of 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.690
 abdominal legs and cardio strap 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.980
 it's going to be a perfect change good them 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.930
 I recommend that my videos have been seen 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.880
 subscribe recommends this channel in 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.590
 facebook when you wish upon a 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.480
 eat see you the next video game 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.900
 super routine that is made recent 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.900
 Thank you
