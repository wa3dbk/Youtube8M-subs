00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
oldest I was all by myself and the whole

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.690 
oldest I was all by myself and the whole
team<00:01:01.300> knew<00:01:01.600> I<00:01:01.630> was<00:01:01.870> there<00:01:02.110> and<00:01:02.670> normally<00:01:03.670> I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
team knew I was there and normally I

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.160 
team knew I was there and normally I
don't<00:01:03.910> talk<00:01:04.030> about<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.330> gameplay<00:01:04.750> but<00:01:04.989> I

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
don't talk about the gameplay but I

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.510 
don't talk about the gameplay but I
thought<00:01:05.440> this<00:01:05.590> was<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.770> smart<00:01:06.010> move<00:01:06.220> just

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
thought this was a smart move just

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.920 
thought this was a smart move just
packing<00:01:06.820> up<00:01:06.880> wait<00:01:07.060> for<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.300> cavalry<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.810> come

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
packing up wait for the cavalry to come

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.040 
packing up wait for the cavalry to come
in<00:01:08.050> and<00:01:08.229> then<00:01:09.010> advance<00:01:09.570> turns<00:01:10.570> out<00:01:10.780> this

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
in and then advance turns out this

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.100 
in and then advance turns out this
wasn't<00:01:11.350> one<00:01:11.830> of<00:01:11.860> my<00:01:12.040> best<00:01:12.280> ideas<00:01:12.729> because<00:01:13.120> as<00:01:13.450> I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
wasn't one of my best ideas because as I

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.690 
wasn't one of my best ideas because as I
anticipated<00:01:14.320> they<00:01:14.770> all<00:01:14.979> came<00:01:15.310> rushing<00:01:15.550> back

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
anticipated they all came rushing back

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.210 
anticipated they all came rushing back
just<00:01:16.180> like<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.300> knew<00:01:16.479> they<00:01:16.600> would<00:01:16.860> except<00:01:17.860> yeah

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
just like I knew they would except yeah

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.160 
just like I knew they would except yeah
I<00:01:18.520> tried<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.300> flank<00:01:19.509> him<00:01:19.630> on<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.840> left<00:01:20.020> but

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
I tried to flank him on the left but

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.480

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
and you know what dude that doesn't make

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.039 
and you know what dude that doesn't make
sense<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.560> mean<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:42.269> makes<00:02:43.269> carrying<00:02:43.959> a

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
sense I mean it makes carrying a

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.199 
sense I mean it makes carrying a
secondary<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:45.220> know<00:02:45.340> really<00:02:45.640> important<00:02:46.060> now

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
secondary you know really important now

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.280 
secondary you know really important now
because<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.750> know<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.930> could<00:02:47.049> carry<00:02:47.200> a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
because you know you could carry a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.390 
because you know you could carry a
second<00:02:47.560> air<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.680> could<00:02:47.769> pick<00:02:47.920> up<00:02:48.010> another<00:02:48.100> gun

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
second air you could pick up another gun

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.130 
second air you could pick up another gun
off<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.579> ground<00:02:48.850> if<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.540> don't<00:02:49.780> select<00:02:49.930> a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
off the ground if you don't select a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.750 
off the ground if you don't select a
secondary<00:02:50.530> then<00:02:50.770> you<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.280> only<00:02:51.340> have<00:02:51.580> one

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
secondary then you you can only have one

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.940 
secondary then you you can only have one
gun<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.170> run<00:02:53.380> on<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.530> bullet<00:02:53.770> or<00:02:53.860> a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
gun so if you run on a bullet or a

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.290 
gun so if you run on a bullet or a
primary<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.459> either<00:02:54.640> switch<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.060> your<00:02:55.120> knife

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
primary you either switch to your knife

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.040 
primary you either switch to your knife
or<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.840> have

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
or you have

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.050

for balance purposes that does seem to

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.850
