on tomorrow on the second for north
square<00:00:12.190> room<00:00:12.370> does<00:00:13.180> tempers<00:00:13.570> are<00:00:13.900> based<00:00:14.410> in

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
square room does tempers are based in

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.650 
square room does tempers are based in
water-based<00:00:15.010> paints<00:00:15.430> that<00:00:15.670> are<00:00:16.180> glue<00:00:16.420> bound

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
water-based paints that are glue bound

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.929 
water-based paints that are glue bound
and<00:00:17.020> we've<00:00:17.590> got<00:00:17.710> some<00:00:17.950> of<00:00:18.040> the<00:00:18.130> mix<00:00:18.310> right<00:00:18.580> here

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
and we've got some of the mix right here

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.800 
and we've got some of the mix right here
if<00:00:19.090> you<00:00:19.840> can<00:00:19.990> see<00:00:20.230> the<00:00:20.590> consistency<00:00:20.890> of<00:00:21.279> this

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
if you can see the consistency of this

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.660 
if you can see the consistency of this
basically<00:00:22.810> this<00:00:23.020> is<00:00:23.170> just<00:00:23.200> water<00:00:23.680> calcium

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
basically this is just water calcium

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.690 
basically this is just water calcium
carbonate<00:00:25.470> lampblack<00:00:26.470> and<00:00:26.950> a<00:00:26.980> little<00:00:27.490> bit<00:00:27.610> of

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
carbonate lampblack and a little bit of

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.159 
carbonate lampblack and a little bit of
Prussian<00:00:28.029> blue<00:00:28.060> just<00:00:28.540> to<00:00:28.630> give<00:00:28.779> a<00:00:28.810> little<00:00:29.050> blue

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
Prussian blue just to give a little blue

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.640 
Prussian blue just to give a little blue
gray<00:00:29.410> color<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:29.980> then<00:00:30.989> what<00:00:31.989> you<00:00:32.110> do<00:00:32.230> it<00:00:32.410> just

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
gray color and then what you do it just

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.710 
gray color and then what you do it just
before<00:00:32.739> you<00:00:32.980> apply<00:00:33.340> it<00:00:33.400> you<00:00:34.060> have<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.329> mix<00:00:34.510> in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
before you apply it you have to mix in

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.750 
before you apply it you have to mix in
some<00:00:34.960> high<00:00:35.260> glue<00:00:35.530> it<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:36.010> what<00:00:36.400> that<00:00:36.579> does

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
some high glue it and what that does

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.700 
some high glue it and what that does
again<00:00:37.150> is<00:00:37.180> act<00:00:37.480> as<00:00:37.630> a<00:00:37.660> binder<00:00:38.079> makes<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.410> stick

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
again is act as a binder makes it stick

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.310 
again is act as a binder makes it stick
to<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:38.920> wall<00:00:39.100> or<00:00:39.310> not<00:00:39.340> tomorrow<00:00:39.760> so<00:00:40.720> Carol<00:00:41.170> is

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
to the wall or not tomorrow so Carol is

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.230 
to the wall or not tomorrow so Carol is
going<00:00:41.560> to<00:00:41.740> prepare<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.460> little<00:00:42.700> sample<00:00:43.060> patch

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
going to prepare a little sample patch

00:00:43.240 --> 00:01:05.270 
going to prepare a little sample patch
for<00:00:43.570> us

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.820 

now<00:01:06.280> take<00:01:06.520> my<00:01:06.670> heat<00:01:06.880> gun<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.150> riot<00:01:07.600> I'm<00:01:08.530> sure

now take my heat gun and riot I'm sure

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.940 
now take my heat gun and riot I'm sure
be<00:01:08.979> about<00:01:09.130> 400<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:11.020> stand<00:01:11.439> back<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.650> it'll

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
be about 400 you stand back and it'll

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
be about 400 you stand back and it'll
dry<00:01:12.159> pretty<00:01:12.610> quickly

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.020 

just<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.560> no<00:01:19.680> he's<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> heat<00:01:20.250> gun<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> house

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
just be no he's a heat gun in the house

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.690

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
and we're doing this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.929 
and we're doing this
for<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.000> sample<00:01:23.420> it'll<00:01:24.049> dry<00:01:24.890> naturally<00:01:25.640> and

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
for this sample it'll dry naturally and

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.539 
for this sample it'll dry naturally and
look<00:01:26.149> very<00:01:26.420> striking<00:01:27.380> before<00:01:27.829> it<00:01:27.979> completely

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
look very striking before it completely

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:39.450 
look very striking before it completely
dries<00:01:28.789> out<00:01:29.229> it's<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.380> little<00:01:30.649> deceiving<00:01:31.039> here's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.779 

the<00:01:40.460> finished<00:01:41.090> product<00:01:41.649> this<00:01:42.649> is<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.890> sample

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
the finished product this is the sample

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.969 
the finished product this is the sample
that<00:01:43.819> we're<00:01:44.119> trying<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.569> match<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.170> paint<00:01:45.619> to

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
that we're trying to match this paint to

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.789 
that we're trying to match this paint to
it's<00:01:46.490> really<00:01:46.729> quite<00:01:47.060> close<00:01:47.329> a<00:01:47.659> little<00:01:48.500> bit<00:01:48.710> of

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
it's really quite close a little bit of

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.649 
it's really quite close a little bit of
variation<00:01:49.369> in<00:01:49.490> terms<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:49.939> brush<00:01:50.149> enos<00:01:50.450> of

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
variation in terms of the brush enos of

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.450 
variation in terms of the brush enos of
the<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.229> distemper<00:01:51.560> paint<00:01:51.920> which<00:01:52.189> show

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
the the distemper paint which show

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.910 
the the distemper paint which show
really<00:01:53.450> is<00:01:53.600> part<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.319> nature<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.649> these

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
really is part of the nature of these

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.710 
really is part of the nature of these
these<00:01:55.280> handmade<00:01:55.640> paints<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.539> can't

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
these handmade paints and you can't

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.120 
these handmade paints and you can't
really<00:01:56.899> expect<00:01:57.170> them<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.409> look<00:01:57.649> exactly<00:01:57.830> like

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
really expect them to look exactly like

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.639 
really expect them to look exactly like
modern<00:01:58.610> paints<00:01:58.909> but<00:01:59.479> any<00:01:59.630> rate<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.349> is<00:02:00.500> what

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
modern paints but any rate this is what

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:01.990 
modern paints but any rate this is what
we're<00:02:00.799> going<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:00.979> be<00:02:01.099> putting<00:02:01.640> them<00:02:01.789> all

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
we're going to be putting them all

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.140 
we're going to be putting them all
through<00:02:02.270> your<00:02:02.450> squares<00:02:02.780> model
