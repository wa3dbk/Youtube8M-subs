00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello, my name is Milena, if not 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.980
 tell you how to make colored 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.090
 tips 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.580
 or in English and children and if you 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.070
 interesting stay 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.670
 so let's start with the fact that you first 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.230
 need to evaluate your tips well or fry 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.910
 never mind blonde you brown hair or 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.580
 brunette you still need 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.349
 discolor tips explain why 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.060
 first and hair even if claudine is worth 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.369
 need to provide not even with the purpose of being 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.250
 so that they become even lighter and for 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.140
 to loosen the hair structure to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.260
 it became even more porous there 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.989
 panic paint all blondes think that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.940
 their hair light disappeared will take 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.739
 yes he will take but he will not be so 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.899
 bright as you plan 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.050
 but still between dark and light 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.000
 hair there is a difference to discuss for 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.510
 good results i.e. saintly 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.739
 blonde 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.350
 dark hair you will need to take 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.439
 at least 6 percent oxide i.e. 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.000
 mostly discolored bitch yes it 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.330
 slightly harms the hair 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.400
 but if you do it right, it will be 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.560
 minimal damage and you will stay 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.220
 with her hair on the head and for the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.759
 blondes 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.020
 you need to take a three percent oxide because 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.930
 that their hair they are up to 20 assertive 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.600
 will take ammonia and quickly brighten and 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.060
 you can not even hold 45 minutes 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.090
 chose a 25-30 minutes of this will be quite 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.490
 enough and but for the results sulfur 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.280
 need to follow and if you provide 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.520
 hair wrap their foil every 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.689
 15 minutes to open and watch 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.030
 the result is that it is not necessary to bring 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.549
 hair where perfect as pure ashen 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.590
 white color that's just the same very 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.630
 badly spoils the hair and they just start 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.820
 break off don't worry color 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.130
 It will be taken on a light blond and even on 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.860
 yellow if there is no chicken 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.649
 shade the first time I provided hair in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.950
 Salon we did this special cream 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.910
 from revlon which supposedly me 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.310
 not aggressive for hair here but on and without 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.920
 After all, his so mediocre friends and here on 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.040
 this light naturally took everything dirty and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.110
 I completed the procedure at home myself 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.200
 purchased a kit for lightening 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.260
 from direction's firm and so box a to 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.319
 Sorry lost already somewhere here but 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.630
 I left the powder and the cream itself which 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.000
 I need to dilute the cream powder in my 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.340
 children percentage since i have enough 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.530
 dark hair and lighten them well 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.390
 hard enough especially since this 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.019
 my voice was painted a lot 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.069
 time that's why natural paint 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:50.549
 falls harder and harder 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:54.450
 held for about half an hour then took off 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:57.690
 foil wash note pay off with 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.569
 Hair need without balm 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.489
 that is, if you plan further 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.860
 paint it that way 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.860
 preventing penetration and you will 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.019
 walk with stains you need it so 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.420
 after you explain whether you hair 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.190
 you can do it yourself or if you 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.560
 not familiar with this procedure yet 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.690
 afraid to sport your hair and I do not know what 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.030
 do something very, very simple 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.239
 ask for help now 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.370
 let's get down to painting i'll show all 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:32.269
 clearly and I will try to explain more clearly 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.269
 and so i think whether we need a bowl 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.799
 also any paint you like 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.220
 i use manic panic in elect 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.220
 advertising 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.720
 brush for painting it can 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:03.710
 purchase at any specialized 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:05.690
 the store and so now the two paint out 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.310
 small jars in low help brush 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.610
 have you been Roma as much as you need 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.250
 you for your staining based on 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.270
 an important result for the hair effect 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.910
 teach me quite a bit of artistry 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.590
 paints so x lift shade are very rare and 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.970
 it can be distributed 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.970
 even half of mine 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.949
 Tomsk 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.190
 it is seen 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.900
 Taxi help is good enough 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.060
 moving skin is very hard to wash i 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.850
 I use a robe that you already 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.280
 see many times used for my 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.070
 staining there pink color and red and 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.780
 red and green here you can 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.470
 use any other towel 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.880
 heels or bathrobe too 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.980
 proceed to staining you can 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.960
 dye your hair yourself or ask 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.580
 someone if this is very problematic for 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.260
 you like hair, strand by strand 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:23.090
 so that no hair is left without 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:27.400
 paints are well distributed and so on 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.400
 from the bottom layer of hair to the gear itself 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.810
 after all you 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.139
 little water joins 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.250
 by speech 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.720
 you down 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.460
 let's go 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:17.689
 so I dried my head and that we see 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:23.930
 the result is a bright color and 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:26.509
 saturated and so girls on this all I 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.819
