 green smoothie we all know what life is on 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.130
 this planet is impossible without solar 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.289
 light and also it is impossible without 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.369

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.829
 similar to our blood hemoglobin 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.969
 chlorophyll increases our hemoglobin 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.250
 blood provides organs with iron 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.940

 a blender is not necessarily a powerful blender 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:36.780

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.150
 dried in such a powder 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.680
