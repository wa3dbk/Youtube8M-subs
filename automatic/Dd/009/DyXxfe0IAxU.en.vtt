cooler<00:02:40.470> there's<00:02:41.070> no<00:02:41.280> doubt<00:02:41.520> about<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:42.180> is

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
cooler there's no doubt about it this is

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.229 
cooler there's no doubt about it this is
one<00:02:42.690> massive<00:02:43.110> cooler<00:02:43.680> having<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.610> many<00:02:44.790> fins

heat pipes and a thermoelectric cooler

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.840 
heat pipes and a thermoelectric cooler
is<00:02:48.180> what<00:02:48.600> makes<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.200> large<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.670> also

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
is what makes it so large but it also

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.900 
is what makes it so large but it also
generates<00:02:51.300> more<00:02:51.870> than<00:02:52.050> 200<00:02:52.890> watts<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.459> cooling
