really driven by ATV racing ATVs at the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.380 
really driven by ATV racing ATVs at the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
time in the early 80s was just booming

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.680 
time in the early 80s was just booming
and<00:00:34.219> majority<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> our<00:00:35.399> sales<00:00:35.640> were<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.420> TV

developing<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.470> four-stroke<00:02:01.860> engines<00:02:02.400> on

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
developing the four-stroke engines on

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.060 
developing the four-stroke engines on
motorcycles<00:02:03.300> that<00:02:03.720> technology<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:04.680> carried

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
motorcycles that technology then carried

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.690 
motorcycles that technology then carried
over<00:02:05.250> into<00:02:05.550> all<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> our<00:02:06.180> sport<00:02:06.510> ATVs<00:02:07.429> later<00:02:08.429> on

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
over into all of our sport ATVs later on

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.990 
over into all of our sport ATVs later on
so<00:02:09.090> actually<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:09.690> became<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.560> new<00:02:10.830> TRX<00:02:11.459> 450

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so actually then became the new TRX 450

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.809 
so actually then became the new TRX 450
our<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:13.230> know<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.980> big<00:02:14.310> brother<00:02:14.580> is

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
our you know it's it's big brother is

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.440 
our you know it's it's big brother is
actually<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.660> four-stroke<00:02:16.350> Honda<00:02:16.920> 450<00:02:17.450> our

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
actually the four-stroke Honda 450 our

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.520 
actually the four-stroke Honda 450 our
TRX<00:02:19.020> line<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.380> all

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
TRX line is all

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.710 
TRX line is all
always<00:02:19.680> followed<00:02:19.980> our<00:02:20.100> CRF<00:02:20.670> racing<00:02:21.270> line<00:02:21.480> as

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
always followed our CRF racing line as

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.320 
always followed our CRF racing line as
well<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.830> know<00:02:22.950> red<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.580> black<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.819> white

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
well so you know red and black and white

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.120 
well so you know red and black and white
those<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.810> been<00:02:24.930> standard<00:02:25.410> colors<00:02:25.740> for<00:02:26.010> us

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
those have been standard colors for us

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.309 
those have been standard colors for us
for<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> number<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.640> years<00:02:26.880> for<00:02:26.970> both

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
for a number of years for both

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.680 
for a number of years for both
motorcycle<00:02:28.319> racing<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.950> ATV<00:02:29.430> racing<00:02:29.690> this

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
motorcycle racing and ATV racing this

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.840 
motorcycle racing and ATV racing this
year<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:31.020> came<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.350> with<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.800> red<00:02:32.520> white<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
year we came out with the red white and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.760 
year we came out with the red white and
blue<00:02:33.000> color<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.540> kind<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.900> tribute<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.440> our

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
blue color is kind of a tribute of our

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.040 
blue color is kind of a tribute of our
initial<00:02:35.280> early<00:02:35.670> years<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.180> racing<00:02:36.660> with<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
initial early years in racing with the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.620 
initial early years in racing with the
four<00:02:37.290> tracks<00:02:37.560> 250r<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.239> neat<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
four tracks 250r so it's really neat to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.600 
four tracks 250r so it's really neat to
see<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.989> four<00:02:40.440> pit<00:02:40.620> PR<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> similar

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
see the four pit PR with a similar

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.760 
see the four pit PR with a similar
design<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.840> look<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.350> we've<00:02:43.440> gotten<00:02:43.680> all

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
design and look and we've gotten all

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.920 
design and look and we've gotten all
kinds<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.190> great<00:02:44.370> feedback<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.420> calls<00:02:45.630> from

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
kinds of great feedback and calls from

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.520 
kinds of great feedback and calls from
old<00:02:46.590> racers<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.459> current<00:02:47.940> racers<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.530> want

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
old racers to current racers that want

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.930 
old racers to current racers that want
to<00:02:49.620> start<00:02:49.800> racing<00:02:49.950> again<00:02:50.280> because<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.819> looks

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
to start racing again because it looks

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.530 
to start racing again because it looks
like<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.239> old<00:02:51.330> one

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
like the old one

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.660 
like the old one
yeah<00:02:52.260> these<00:02:52.440> machines<00:02:52.860> are<00:02:52.980> incredible<00:02:53.519> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
yeah these machines are incredible the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.120 
yeah these machines are incredible the
suspension<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.300> they<00:02:54.480> have<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.890> know<00:02:55.920> we've

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
suspension that they have you know we've

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.090 
suspension that they have you know we've
had<00:02:56.280> very<00:02:56.550> good<00:02:56.670> success<00:02:56.820> in<00:02:57.540> motocross<00:02:58.100> with

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
had very good success in motocross with

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.820 
had very good success in motocross with
the<00:02:59.220> four<00:02:59.459> Trax's<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.360> TR<00:03:00.630> X's<00:03:01.110> as<00:03:01.290> well

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the four Trax's and the TR X's as well

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.009 
the four Trax's and the TR X's as well
as<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.190> Baja<00:03:02.580> one<00:03:03.060> thing<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.420> find<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.989> I

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
as in Baja one thing that I find is I

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.320 
as in Baja one thing that I find is I
look<00:03:04.380> at<00:03:04.560> these<00:03:05.069> two<00:03:05.340> machines<00:03:05.519> although<00:03:06.180> they

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
look at these two machines although they

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.360 
look at these two machines although they
have<00:03:06.510> similar<00:03:06.930> colors<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.650> graphics<00:03:07.830> and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
have similar colors and graphics and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.130 
have similar colors and graphics and
that's<00:03:08.850> one<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.209> reasons<00:03:09.540> why<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:09.870> put<00:03:10.110> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
that's one of the reasons why we put it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.390 
that's one of the reasons why we put it
on<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.500> new<00:03:10.620> 2013<00:03:11.250> TRX<00:03:12.209> 450<00:03:12.750> are<00:03:13.190> looking<00:03:14.190> at

on the new 2013 TRX 450 are looking at

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.140 
on the new 2013 TRX 450 are looking at

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
all of the hardware boy it sure has

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.910 
all of the hardware boy it sure has
changed<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.810> really<00:03:19.110> stepped<00:03:19.440> up<00:03:19.680> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
changed and really stepped up the
