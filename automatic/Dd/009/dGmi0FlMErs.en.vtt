00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.429 
that most likely this chicken didn't
live<00:01:22.219> a<00:01:22.429> wonderful<00:01:22.909> life<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.929> someone

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
had to kill it I had to take the life of

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.529 
had to kill it I had to take the life of
his<00:01:26.810> chicken<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.639> he<00:01:28.639> could<00:01:28.880> be<00:01:29.029> eating

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
his chicken so that he could be eating

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
something else and it was just so so

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.590 
something else and it was just so so
rising<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.100> he<00:02:19.340> made<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.790> decision<00:02:19.940> on<00:02:20.360> his

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
very natural for him to make this

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.570 
very natural for him to make this
process<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:28.780> judgment<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.620> over<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.950> next<00:02:31.130> six

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
process of judgment so over the next six

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.440 
process of judgment so over the next six
months<00:02:31.730> or<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.090> he<00:02:32.870> would<00:02:33.470> occasionally<00:02:33.740> eat
