00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
eczema all right then you have mustard

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.420 
eczema all right then you have mustard
and<00:05:21.159> mustard<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:23.009> usually<00:05:24.009> the<00:05:24.219> first

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
and mustard the usually the first

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.249

distilled vinegar and add to that salt

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.429 
distilled vinegar and add to that salt
and<00:05:35.069> probably<00:05:36.069> paprika<00:05:36.580> paprika<00:05:37.360> ice<00:05:38.080> is<00:05:38.409> a

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:38.439 
and probably paprika paprika ice is a

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:42.029 
and probably paprika paprika ice is a
good<00:05:38.680> nightshade<00:05:39.219> to<00:05:39.400> avoid<00:05:40.680> so<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:41.710> would

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
good nightshade to avoid so I would

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.140 
good nightshade to avoid so I would

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
probably stay away from mustard I wanted

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.990
