the drywall paper off the drive that's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.610 
the drywall paper off the drive that's
just<00:02:31.000> 10<00:02:31.209> minutes<00:02:31.480> when<00:02:32.200> you're<00:02:32.290> putting<00:02:32.530> the

just 10 minutes when you're putting the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.110 
just 10 minutes when you're putting the
tape<00:02:32.799> on<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.100> wall<00:02:33.130> with<00:02:33.489> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.680 

take<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:42.610> want<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.700> make<00:02:43.819> sure<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.330> put

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
take and want to make sure that you put

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.190 
take and want to make sure that you put
that<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:45.019> there

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
that in there

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.860 
that in there
both<00:02:47.740> pieces<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.970> makes<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.300> solid<00:02:49.690> bond

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
both pieces it makes a solid bond

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.809 
both pieces it makes a solid bond
between<00:02:50.170> both<00:02:50.470> pieces<00:02:50.740> it<00:02:51.400> isn't<00:02:51.640> going<00:02:51.730> to

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
between both pieces it isn't going to

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.420 
between both pieces it isn't going to
move<00:02:52.230> once<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.410> house<00:02:53.560> settles<00:02:54.010> once<00:02:54.250> it's

move once the house settles once it's

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.000 
move once the house settles once it's
factored<00:02:54.849> this<00:02:55.420> all<00:02:55.780> becomes<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.380> piece<00:02:56.739> but

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
factored this all becomes one piece but

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.309 
factored this all becomes one piece but

typical<00:03:05.350> installation<00:03:06.150> you're<00:03:07.150> putting<00:03:07.690> a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
typical installation you're putting a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.210 
typical installation you're putting a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.009 

corners<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.430> great<00:03:18.819> I'm<00:03:19.630> going<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.870> show<00:03:19.989> you

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
corners it's great I'm going to show you

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.729 
corners it's great I'm going to show you
how<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.380> do<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.769> corner<00:03:21.330> my<00:03:22.330> way<00:03:22.600> I<00:03:22.959> measure<00:03:23.560> out

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
how I do a corner my way I measure out

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.390 
how I do a corner my way I measure out
much<00:03:24.130> more<00:03:24.420> properly<00:03:25.560> now<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.620> take<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.190> tape

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
much more properly now you take the tape

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.190 
much more properly now you take the tape
it<00:03:27.519> has<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.700> crease<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.060> as<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.600> see<00:03:28.810> here<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.110> I

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
it has a crease in as you see here and I

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.960 
it has a crease in as you see here and I
just<00:03:29.440> run<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.769> right<00:03:29.890> down<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.549> see<00:03:30.850> how

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
just run it right down like that see how

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.449 
just run it right down like that see how
fast<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.390> was<00:03:31.510> what<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.440> do<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.010> fold<00:03:33.310> it

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
fast that was what I do is I fold it

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.550 
fast that was what I do is I fold it
like<00:03:33.610> this<00:03:36.330> I'd<00:03:37.330> submerge<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.930> into<00:03:38.049> water<00:03:38.319> all

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
like this I'd submerge it into water all

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.600 
like this I'd submerge it into water all
the<00:03:38.680> way<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.980> don't<00:03:39.010> have<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.370> worry<00:03:39.549> about

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
the way you don't have to worry about

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.699 
the way you don't have to worry about
let<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.000> outside<00:03:40.299> whatever<00:03:40.930> now<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.470> see

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
let the outside whatever now you see

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.309 
let the outside whatever now you see
your<00:03:41.890> crease<00:03:42.160> push<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.299> into<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.600> corner<00:03:44.080> nice

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
your crease push it into the corner nice

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.590 
your crease push it into the corner nice
all<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.130> way<00:03:45.280> down<00:03:45.580> in<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:45.970> corner<00:03:46.000> get<00:03:46.450> your

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
all the way down in the corner get your

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.870 
all the way down in the corner get your
corner<00:03:46.959> set<00:03:47.230> in<00:03:47.410> there<00:03:47.620> then<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.519> just<00:03:48.700> take

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
corner set in there then you just take

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.750 
corner set in there then you just take
your<00:03:48.940> hand<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:50.260> rub<00:03:50.500> each<00:03:50.680> side<00:03:50.980> you

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
your hand and you rub each side you

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.400 
your hand and you rub each side you
don't<00:03:51.940> need<00:03:52.090> no<00:03:52.269> knife<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.720> want<00:03:52.870> your<00:03:53.109> hands

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
don't need no knife you want your hands

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.020 
don't need no knife you want your hands
cuz<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:53.620> get<00:03:53.799> all<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.220> wrinkles<00:03:54.370> out<00:03:54.730> that

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
cuz you get all the wrinkles out that

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.650 
cuz you get all the wrinkles out that
way<00:03:55.239> look<00:03:56.230> how<00:03:56.260> fast<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.980> easy<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.280> was<00:03:57.670> this

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
way look how fast and easy that was this

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.400 
way look how fast and easy that was this
is<00:03:58.840> set<00:03:59.470> in<00:03:59.650> 20<00:03:59.980> minutes<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.340> put<00:04:00.549> your<00:04:00.730> mother

tomorrow you come back one more coat and
you're<00:04:04.090> done<00:04:04.359> if<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:04.750> sand<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.200> you<00:04:05.350> paint<00:04:05.590> it

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
you're done if you sand it you paint it

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.460 
you're done if you sand it you paint it
that's<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.310> now<00:04:07.000> we<00:04:07.060> also<00:04:07.269> have<00:04:07.600> they<00:04:08.290> have<00:04:08.440> a

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
that's it now we also have they have a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.880 
that's it now we also have they have a
quarter<00:04:09.690> tool<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.079> can<00:04:11.260> run<00:04:11.440> down<00:04:11.650> if

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
quarter tool that you can run down if

00:04:11.890 --> 00:05:04.600 
quarter tool that you can run down if
you<00:04:11.980> want<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.250> put<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.489> on<00:04:12.579> like

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.100 

we're<00:05:05.610> saving<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:05.970> lot<00:05:06.060> of<00:05:06.120> time<00:05:06.240> without

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
we're saving a lot of time without

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.070 
we're saving a lot of time without
slipping<00:05:07.830> all<00:05:08.160> that<00:05:08.370> stuff<00:05:08.610> is<00:05:08.870> also<00:05:09.870> another
