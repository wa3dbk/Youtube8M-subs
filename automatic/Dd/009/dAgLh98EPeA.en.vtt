00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
slices so Christy did now she found that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
slices so Christy did now she found that
the<00:01:03.750> thin<00:01:04.080> slices<00:01:04.619> were<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:05.129> more

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the thin slices were a little more

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.130 
the thin slices were a little more
difficult<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> put<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.420> than<00:01:06.869> she<00:01:07.049> expected

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
difficult to put in than she expected

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
difficult to put in than she expected
but<00:01:07.799> eventually<00:01:08.220> she<00:01:08.729> did<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> hang<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
but eventually she did get the hang of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.499 
but eventually she did get the hang of
it<00:01:09.540> 2<00:01:10.140> minutes<00:01:10.350> 20<00:01:10.950> seconds

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.240 

within<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.900> few<00:01:16.170> seconds<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.799> knew<00:01:17.009> we

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
within just a few seconds we knew we

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
in no time at all it was done looks like

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.420 
in no time at all it was done looks like
it<00:01:24.299> cooked<00:01:24.680> taking<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> microwave
