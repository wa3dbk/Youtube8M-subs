till it was cut into four parts and then

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.240 
till it was cut into four parts and then
one<00:05:03.240> of<00:05:03.360> those<00:05:03.539> four<00:05:03.930> parts<00:05:04.320> was<00:05:04.530> actually<00:05:05.010> cut

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
one of those four parts was actually cut

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.730 
one of those four parts was actually cut
in<00:05:05.370> half<00:05:05.639> and<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:06.180> stretched<00:05:06.630> it<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:07.440> get<00:05:07.590> the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
in half and I stretched it to get the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.300 
in half and I stretched it to get the
shorter<00:05:08.130> length<00:05:08.400> on<00:05:08.789> the<00:05:09.750> furthest<00:05:10.199> right<00:05:10.500> now

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
shorter length on the furthest right now

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.879 
shorter length on the furthest right now
the<00:05:11.460> second<00:05:12.120> length<00:05:12.389> that<00:05:12.599> you<00:05:12.810> see<00:05:13.110> is<00:05:13.320> the

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
the second length that you see is the

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.040 
the second length that you see is the
expressions<00:05:14.699> hair<00:05:15.030> that<00:05:15.449> was<00:05:15.599> cut<00:05:15.900> in<00:05:16.020> half

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
expressions hair that was cut in half

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.830 
expressions hair that was cut in half
and<00:05:16.740> then<00:05:17.159> cut<00:05:17.190> in<00:05:17.639> half<00:05:17.880> again<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:18.690> was

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
and then cut in half again so it was

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.530 
and then cut in half again so it was
four<00:05:19.169> parts

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
four parts

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.530 
four parts
I<00:05:20.570> used<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.950> remaining<00:05:22.520> three<00:05:22.790> parts<00:05:23.240> of<00:05:23.450> that

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
I used the remaining three parts of that

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.970 
I used the remaining three parts of that
four<00:05:24.230> to<00:05:24.920> stretch<00:05:25.340> for<00:05:26.150> that<00:05:26.330> second<00:05:26.990> section

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
four to stretch for that second section

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.760 
four to stretch for that second section
the<00:05:28.820> third<00:05:29.090> section<00:05:29.720> that<00:05:29.930> you<00:05:30.140> see<00:05:30.470> is

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
the third section that you see is

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.470 
the third section that you see is
actually<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:32.750> hair<00:05:33.320> stretched<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.700> little<00:05:35.240> bit

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
actually the hair stretched a little bit

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.610 
actually the hair stretched a little bit
longer

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
longer

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.830 
longer
from<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:37.610> fourth<00:05:37.970> as<00:05:38.180> well<00:05:38.480> I<00:05:38.810> just

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
from that fourth as well I just

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.800 
from that fourth as well I just
stretched<00:05:39.770> it<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.070> little<00:05:40.280> longer<00:05:40.690> just<00:05:41.690> to

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
stretched it a little longer just to

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.090 
stretched it a little longer just to
give<00:05:41.990> that<00:05:42.340> length<00:05:43.340> a<00:05:43.610> little<00:05:43.850> bit<00:05:44.030> more<00:05:45.100> if

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
give that length a little bit more if

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.700 
give that length a little bit more if
that<00:05:46.340> makes<00:05:46.550> sense<00:05:46.640> and<00:05:47.090> then<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.930> last<00:05:48.260> hair

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
that makes sense and then the last hair

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.070 
that makes sense and then the last hair
you<00:05:48.830> see<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.400> that<00:05:49.940> expressions<00:05:50.570> hair<00:05:50.840> that

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
you see is that expressions hair that
