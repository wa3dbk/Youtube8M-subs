00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.070
 hello everyone so I present to you 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.540
 finally my face routine I try to go 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.189
 one of the most natural products 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.520
 possible so I show you that all of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.670
 after 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.300
 so first of all I use a lotion 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.550
 cleaning for now to use a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.020
 Cleansing milk 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.769
 otherwise there is also a product I do 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.660
 myself based on natural products that 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.760
 I buy on as roma zone and I you 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.830
 would surely put in the recipe in a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.000
 other video if you're interested if that 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.220
 tell me you are interested in 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.400
 comments for the cleansing milk 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.500
 he is really great he is without ogm 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.960
 not to mention without silicone and so it's 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.990
 here he is Scottish re leaves himself without 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.659
 really will make it smell a little bit 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.619
 fruity not at all tender so it's 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.260
 very pleasant 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.170
 it is very soft to the skin I have 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.330
 nothing to blame him you must know that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.619
 I do not wash myself with that when I 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.170
 am wearing makeup I use wipes 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.869
 cleansers for example where I had a 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.040
 gel also cleans after that 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.210
 I use a tonic 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.130
 so I used my long time a 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.990
 lush product you see 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.240
 now but now I do not use 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.890
 more than the container that registered to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.170
 his little names very handy but 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.840
 now I put in some floral water 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.810
 pink coming from the site as roma zone 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.360
 then depending on whether it's morning or 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.710
 evening I have two different creams creams 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.590
 of day and a night cream that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.100
 come from the organic range of price words 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.460
 I love that very day 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.800
 lightly I admit that six animals adam 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.870
 dry really dry I'll turn 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.630
 to something else but in monoprix's home 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.450
 they also have another cream that is at 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.430
 fashion or if I'm not mistaken and that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 there is much thicker and 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.330
 nourishing but it's more of a cream 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.260
 that I will put in winter for example the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.760
 night cream is a little bit more 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.709
 nourishing but not so much either 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.060
 it is also lighter than the one at 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.090
 the sweet almond and for me it was 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.930
 enough it's crem really have a 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.209
 fruity odor concerns will 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.920
 and frankly I like packaging 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.450
 I like the day before that it is bio etc 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.700
 so nothing to say again then if I have a 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.590
 the expo their nape what I had found 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.730
 on sale actually two days that milk 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.079
 cleanser which was also sold 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.170
 I found that in Denmark so it's 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.030
 a product that gives France and that's it 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.469
 so I took advantage of it because 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.310
 it was really half price I think 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:56.319
 and it's exfoliating there I do it 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.419
 really when I feel that my faith has 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.189
 need you see when she's older if 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:03.189
 smooth that's when I 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.019
 do so ie to be under the 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.030
 10 15 days I think it's an exfoliant 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.530
 really where from there for the very skins 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.760
 sensitive I think it's the ideal 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.879
 because the fears are really 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.260
 very very hungry me I admit that it's me 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.700
 do not bother that the grains on a little 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.400
 bigger but with that one so I 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.569
 put more and I mass longer cut 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.150
 mullet and the tonic 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.510
 I apply them on the skin thanks to 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.040
 Washable disc and makeup remover I you 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.200
 refers to the video I made 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.620
 on that I have an explanation 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.930
 in my cart you may have 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.650
 saw also a small pink and black case 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.159
 so it's a little lip balm 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.019
 in Vaseline a special edition at 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.579
 Champagne 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.470
 I cracked because I was shooting 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.389
 cute box said he had not really 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.459
 but I put it earlier in the morning when 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.650
 I have time after making my face 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.720
 to have lips that shine that makes 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.319
 office of gloss and in addition it smells great 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.639
 so this routine is not something 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.139
 thing that I keep I did not spend the 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.060
 products that I redeem them at each 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.829
 times it is produced in which I 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.269
 come back like the rose floral water by 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.859
 example so products like that 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.419
 sometimes I can not hand over 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.150
 on top like the cleansing milk 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.099
 I found in promo so in general 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.079
 I 'm I'm just turning from 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.810
 the other thing that is as natural or 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.699
 the most natural possible 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.300
 I come back to the rose water in 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.990
 general I really like 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.030
 this floral water and for moisturizers 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.949
 it's the same if Jane will hand over 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.960
 on some I liked I will redeem 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:36.710
 but it's not too bad I find 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.830
 others like the two he's waiting here 2d 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.479
 the skull of monoprix since I am 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.180
 in denmark and there is no monoprix 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.690
 here so I did what I knew 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.069
 I do not have a problem skin 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.300
 I admit that I have a skin whose 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:54.319
 quality is pretty good 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.300
 I do not necessarily need products 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.370
 special so I have I can afford 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.219
 to change product 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.800
 Here I hope it will have pleased you is 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.780
 in fact I'm going to film you at bedtime 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.319
 which is just beautiful 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.460
 and here we are on some pictures 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.060
 tell you see you soon 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.060
 Hi 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.920
 for example here I am in Denmark so 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.070
 upstream we would know
