00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.400
 greetings sought from the mystery and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.080
 thank you for attending great mystery 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.290
 dot org 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.689
 our history is a mystery is a 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.480
 mystery because it is forgotten with the 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.340
 time we only learn from our 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.310
 history the things that have been 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.890
 written in textbooks but 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.040
 to some extent because everything has its 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.190
 origin everything has its beginning and in this 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.170
 video let's try that principle let's 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.720
 to treat the mystery of one of the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.110
 most advanced ancient civilizations of 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.150
 the story 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.910
 which in turn contains multiple 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.829
 unknowns that did not know how to rethink 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.980
 everything we know so far 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.530
 there was the atlántida that classes of 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.219
 people lived in it where is 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.880
 currently and what is more important 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.940
 what knowledge is what they possessed 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.460
 platón in his dialogues timeo and critics 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.130
 gave very accurate data about the island of 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.800
 Atlas was the first to talk about the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.380
 mystery of the atlantic and precision 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.870
 and accuracy in which disclosed 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.900
 he divulged forgiveness about the existence of 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.840
 said island made that throughout the 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.180
 time many researchers and 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 mystery seekers were trying 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 find her 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.060
 platón knew of the existence of said 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.880
 island through rumors rumors that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.840
 they ran more than 99 thousand years between 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.560
 Fathers and sons 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.130
 he indicated the location of said island 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.049
 beyond the columns of hercules the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.170
 columns of Hercules were symbols 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.899
 placed in Gibraltar at sea 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.649
 Mediterranean that delimited the world 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:01.020
 known at the time but because 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:04.229
 that area because particularly that area 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.780
 supposedly the atlantis existed does 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.470
 20,000 years before the Sumerians 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.480
 and disappeared after a great catastrophe 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.930
 related to the universal flood 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.940
 what we know of 20 thousand years ago is 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.120
 that was a corresponding time with the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.920
 pleistocene the Pleistocene so 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.250
 say it would be the ice age that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.860
 many of you will know a glacial age 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.610
 world level where they could only exist 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.610
 civilizations in a small fringe 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.270
 a strip that corresponds to the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.670
 meridian 0 to meridian 30 as 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.920
 limit coincident with Gibraltar 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.810
 the columns of hercules and with the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.370
 'Bermuda triangle' of which 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.980
 We talk later 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.099
 if this civilization existed in the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.830
 Pleistocene where there was an age 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:01.280
 glacial sea level should be 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.349
 much smaller than the current one since the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.140
 world was ice cream was full of 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.540
 ice sheets thus when 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.420
 past the ice age it is possible that 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.579
 the atlántida will be flooded and get into 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.560
 the bottom of the ocean 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.720
 this could correspond with the famous 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.250
 universal flood that is mentioned in 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.250
 almost all ancient cultures 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.500
 if we delve into the ancient tales 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:31.939
 it is said that poseidón had ten children and 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.730
 one of them atlas was the one who named the 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:38.090
 kingdom the atlantis and also named 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.670
 to the atlantic Atlantic ocean forgiveness the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.969
 kingdom at its peak at the end 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.299
 passed the time and fell fell by the 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:50.659
 arrogance of those of the inhabitants a 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.819
 arrogance that made them angry 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.780
 anger the gods imposed a punishment 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.990
 divine 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.120
 leaving the stories behind the cultures 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.150
 ancient like the Sumerian or the Egyptian 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.010
 obtura and obtained knowledge 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.740
 very advanced celestial in very little 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.240
 time as you already know is a mystery 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.069
 currently like the Egyptians 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.920
 they built those great pyramids 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.620
 the Sumerian tablets narrate as a 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.989
 civilization alien to their lands they have 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.410
 one here they were infused with 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.530
 knowledge to cultivate build and 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.560
 to be able to look at the sky 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.860
 they narrate how they have a here 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.500
 they came from the stars before 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.260
 they formed their civilization and 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.300
 they built two kingdoms one in the ocean 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.050
 and another mesopotamia 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.819
 perhaps that kingdom would not be the Atlantic 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.370
 the question that you are asking is the 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:51.099
 following how it is possible that 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.310
 Sumerians knew of the existence of 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:56.110
 a previous civilization and the answer 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.860
 they will do it themselves on their tablets 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.250
 the descendants the descendants of 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.949
 the gods called nefilim half man 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.110
 half something else 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.419
 often expressed as the giants 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.509
 that were almost exterminated by him by 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.659
 the flood after that great catastrophe the 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.969
 nefilim imparted their knowledge to 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.620
 the Sumerians these went from the 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.219
 Egyptians and also many others 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.219
 cultures 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.900
 in the range of possibility that we have 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.970
 described above is also 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.060
 find a zone a peculiar zone 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.740
 called the triangle of Bermuda a 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.139
 place plagued by mysterious 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.660
 disappearances measurements 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:44.380
 electromagnetic also very rare and 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.440
 ghosts of the past and near future a 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.960
 place that emanates a magical something 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.669
 a magical something where recently 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.840
 they found glass pyramids in the 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.600
 background 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.449
 paul wayne cake and paulina boots that 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.910
 they were the discoverers of a great 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.910
 Underwater city with more pyramids 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.880
 great than those of egypt a news 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.910
 real to me that I'm being nagged because it has not 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.940
 made the echo that the 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.639
 world should have known this this 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.650
 news since it was rarely seen 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.810
 few days and nobody else spoke again 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.730
 of it 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.800
 something that as I said I am 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:26.310
 because the evidences are there are 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.680
 real and there are also post reports 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.110
 later that endorse the found 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.030
 after the discovery of the city ​​under 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.430
 the water measurements were taken that 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.460
 they supported the theory of thaw and 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.289
 sinking by the rising sea 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.249
 everything seems to fit and that the data 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.559
 they are precise 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:48.939
 over time we have tried 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:51.949
 many or parts objects out of time 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:55.189
 impossible to explain objects with a 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.019
 age that exceeds 20 thousand years and 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:59.239
 that show us impossible machines 

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:01.669
 like the antich machine and ctera the 

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:04.999
 help wedge and other mechanisms that 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:08.569
 evidence what has been said is 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:11.020
 as if there were only a few pieces of 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:14.760
 those civilizations 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.400
 old with advanced technology 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.190
 I leave this fascinating story in 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.110
 your hands and / or personally 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.450
 I want to continue this mystery to be 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.590
 pending of those researchers who 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:32.240
 by themselves they find the impossible 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.240
 Greetings and we will return with another video
