00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
went back to an x-pipe to flowmasters

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.459 
went back to an x-pipe to flowmasters
but<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> had<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> stock<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.719> cats<00:00:36.989> still<00:00:37.290> on

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
we upgraded the intercooler system this

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.500 
we upgraded the intercooler system this
is<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.760> CX<00:01:00.180> racing<00:01:00.600> front-mount<00:01:01.320> intercooler

okay if you remember from the first

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.230 
okay if you remember from the first
video<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:27.120> intercooler<00:01:27.420> sat<00:01:27.840> right<00:01:28.200> here

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
video the intercooler sat right here

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.730 
video the intercooler sat right here
okay<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> good<00:01:31.229> spot<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.650> an

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
okay that is not a good spot for an

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.540 
okay that is not a good spot for an
intercooler<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.550> front-mount

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
intercooler to be so front-mount

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.060 
intercooler to be so front-mount
intercooler<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> best<00:01:36.330> way<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.510> go<00:01:37.070> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
intercooler is the best way to go the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.980 
intercooler is the best way to go the
next<00:01:38.280> thing<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.490> did<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.450> upgraded<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
next thing we did was we upgraded the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.200 
next thing we did was we upgraded the
blower<00:01:41.000> okay

blower okay

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.260 
blower okay
in<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> first<00:01:43.020> video<00:01:43.110> was<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.590> gen<00:01:43.950> 3<00:01:44.270> Eden

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
in the first video was the gen 3 Eden

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.020 
in the first video was the gen 3 Eden
m90<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:46.440> came<00:01:46.650> on<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.460> 89<00:01:48.300> through<00:01:48.690> 93

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
m90 they came on then the 89 through 93

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.660 
m90 they came on then the 89 through 93
this<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.140> Gen<00:01:52.320> 4<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:53.400> comes<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.790> 94<00:01:54.270> 95

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
this is to Gen 4 that comes on the 94 95

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.930 
this is to Gen 4 that comes on the 94 95
it's<00:01:56.670> got<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> larger<00:01:57.240> plenum<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> back

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
it's got a larger plenum in the back

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
it's got a larger plenum in the back
coated<00:02:00.570> blades<00:02:01.700> which<00:02:02.700> makes<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.149> blower<00:02:03.540> way

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
coated blades which makes the blower way

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.560 
coated blades which makes the blower way
more<00:02:04.229> efficient<00:02:04.800> right<00:02:05.119> here<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.360> stock

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
more efficient right here is the stock

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.760 
more efficient right here is the stock
pulley<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.700> she<00:02:08.700> boosts<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.090> max<00:02:09.540> at<00:02:09.869> 14

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
pulley and she boosts that max at 14

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.660 
pulley and she boosts that max at 14
pounds<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:12.390> stock<00:02:12.630> pulley<00:02:13.400> it's<00:02:14.400> pretty

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
pounds on the stock pulley it's pretty

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.670 
pounds on the stock pulley it's pretty
impressive

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.250 

we<00:02:19.220> also<00:02:19.400> upgraded<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.390> heads<00:02:20.659> we<00:02:20.900> won<00:02:21.080> with

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
we also upgraded the heads we won with

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.710 
we also upgraded the heads we won with
another<00:02:21.530> set<00:02:21.769> of<00:02:21.799> supergroup<00:02:22.280> heads<00:02:22.720> that

have been gasket matched to the exhaust

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.080 
have been gasket matched to the exhaust
