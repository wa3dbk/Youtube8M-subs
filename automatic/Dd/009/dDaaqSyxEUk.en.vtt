00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello people from hd portal i am remco 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:11.490
 there are many drugs in there we have 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:13.230
 for you the spring god ok people 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.770
 lantern on the spring mouth just wants 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.500
 say we have a lantern that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.150
 gives you a dynamic lightning 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.220
 minecraft 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.990
 and this is of course super fat but how 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.359
 do we make a lantern like that i'm going first 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.109
 equally this of this is a winter like you 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.580
 see 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.460
 but how do we make it well I'm going first 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.380
 these do get away and take us through 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.960
 first fat and we go through it 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.969
 gate at two times so the cow potty 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.719
 approach again and then get it 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.550
 we only make the fat with the fat box 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 by adding sugar cane but 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.620
 at the box with that gamble we make a moment 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.510
 with that fry flavor making it string 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.640
 still to add and kendo 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.989
 and with that campbell we make one 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.969
 lantern 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.170
 okay but what do we do with it 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.670
 we know those we can know them too 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.350
 still throw down place and then assign 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.350
 just a moment at steco 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.159
 pass to light so you see and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.470
 you can also break it off with you 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.600
 right mouse button 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.799
 and that is really just super handy as 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.299
 you the mindset and you just want a moment 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.740
 all make good anyway if you feel 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:23.130
 have him on but not that just me away 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.860
 you put your candles away or you 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.759
 torches whatever you used 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.140
 ok what does he wear big marks okay 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.759
 ok what else do we have 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.710
 a spring but it is not lit. 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.470
 how do we do that we are very simple 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.590
 by putting down and with a friend 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.360
 and stole to light and then 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.590
 right mouse button and then you have one 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.259
 lit. 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.509
 spring and that is really good what you do 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.340
 see you follow with you the light follows 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.899
 you just a super easy 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.039
 it is that you have some strange courtyards 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:02.100
 because I am now 60 fps or so 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.720
 very normal game, and yes it was 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.459
 only drawback of this mouth is it too 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.200
 a bit he also sometimes crashes 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.819
 one time and that is what they are 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.979
 actually we have to be ok people 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.049
 we have reached the points of this 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.790
 this mouth and I'm going to judge a bit 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.380
 I don't think it's a super mouth he's not 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.340
 just as good as last time, for example 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.340
 through the display mouth 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.500
 if you haven't seen it yet 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.230
 look for a moment he was stuck with that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.680
 maybe or somewhere in the description 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.019
 along the side but I like and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.000
 which is not as nicely finished as that 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.579
 it is what is less flexible there is 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.410
 frame drops and that is not really fine 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.540
 to play with and it is a bit 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.980
 hold yancham in your hand 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.230
 nevertheless I think it is really super cool 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.000
 done and yes this is just you fat 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.260
 that dynamics is in charge, they have to 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.340
 also just in minecraft standard 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.680
 but they don't 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.480
 so still get this joke for a while 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.370
 a six and a half for the effort and for 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.079
 the ones I am lazy are you and the rest yes 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.650
 I've got a little better 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.120
 so people and six and a half 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.100
 yes this sphere then I want you very much 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.450
 thank for looking again a disadvantage 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.920
 new forest spotlight and then I say till 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.510

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.670
 just a little green thumbs up 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.859
 I do not like cruelty for the game portal 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.480
