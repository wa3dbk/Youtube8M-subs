00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 Y 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.529
 Hello, nice people today, we are going to learn 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.439
 make a make-up wrap nito with 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.439
 glitter the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.360
 is to take a black pencil and we are going to 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.559
 start to give a little color to the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.930
 external area that little one sees in the area 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.120
 external of our eye we are going to do 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.940
 this and we're going to start blurring a 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.949
 little bit with a tiny brush because 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.199
 the black color will serve us as the 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.690
 precise basis so that when we apply 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.019
 our shadows become a little more 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.789
 dark and intensify the look like 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.850
 you can observe I'm blurring a 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.350
 little but without disappearing all 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.299
 the shadow 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.650
 for this makeup we are going to use the 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.549
 120 color palette that I'm going to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.430
 make sure to leave all the 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.590
 information where you can buy it 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.740
 and as you can see I have taken a 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.190
 blue color with some glitter and I'll 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.310
 apply above the part where 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.740
 I applied my black pencil below 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.810
 with the tip of the brush I will start 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.390
 to give a bit of outline to the area of 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.979
 the banana of my eye and I'm also going to 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.040
 bring a little color in the part 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.170
 internally in this way we are going to 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.660
 create a very nice outline with the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.550
 blue and we will leave the center 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.540
 our free eyelid to be able to apply 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.540
 the next color 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.540
 then we are going to move a little 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.310
 to the upper area of the eye socket and 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.770
 let's apply a color that is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.869
 similar to the color of our skin what 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.060
 we are going to apply with a diffused brush 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.830
 that is quite dense so that we 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.000
 helps to spread the shadow in a way 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.620
 more efficient 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.250
 in this way we are going to create a look 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.410
 pretty clean and very nice 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.720
 now let's darken a little more the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.120
 outer area of our eye to give it 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.620
 a little more depth to the look and 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.970
 with a very small brush we are going to 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.170
 apply the black shadow on the part 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.260
 external 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.020
 now let's apply the turquoise shadow 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.720
 in the central part of our eye in 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.209
 that part that we had empty and the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.160
 let's start applying with small 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.720
 little touches so that the shadow is not us 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.720
 water will fall to our cheeks 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.140
 now let's take another blue color 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.720
 electrical and we will apply it for all 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.750
 the edges of that turquoise shadow 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.880
 way we are going to create a small 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.440
 degradation in the colors and goes 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.890
 to make the look look very beautiful and 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.890
 pretty great dramatic and striking 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.319
 after having applied our shadows 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.950
 let's blur briefly how to 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.870
 avoid leaving those traits enough 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.209
 hard in the shade so that we do not 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.890
 there are very strong lines but for 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.090
 that the shadow is spreading 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.069
 slightly 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.110
 after blurring the area of â€‹â€‹our 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.160
 Basin will move on to give some 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.400
 color and light to the eyebrow area the 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.900
 bone of the eyebrows more specifically 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.849
 and we're also going to add a little bit of 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.110
 light in the inner part of our eye 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.930
 with the same shadow that we are 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.940
 using I suggest you use a 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.920
 matte shadow 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.530
 and a shadow that is not so clear that it does not 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.450
 be white but be a little beige 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.450
 and a little bit softer 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.190
 it's time to delineate our eyes and 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:54.380
 As you can see I have taken a 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:57.410
 eyeliner in a pen and what am I 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.530
 going through my whole eye until I reach 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.540
 I trace the outer lashes I will not 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.580
 create any type of tail because all 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.990
 the drama is carried by the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.240
 shadow 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.280
 now the fun moment of 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.500
 apply the glitter I will use 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.720
 this mac glitter is called new 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.720
 world marine but basically it's a 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.280
 Turquoise glitter please 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.680
 I recommend that if you are going to perform 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.600
 this makeup use glitter 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.130
 cosmetics are not going to use that 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.710
 glitter that is used to make 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.040
 manual works because it is very thick and 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.000
 it can irritate their eyes 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.160
 make sure you also use some 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.870
 type of adhesive so that the clicker or 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.860
 the glitter stays fixed for a long time 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.810
 weather 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.280
 Now it's time to apply the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.650
 eye mask 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.050
 I'm going to apply two layers of mask and 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.270
 next I'm going to apply some 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.189
 false eyelashes to complement 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.740
 better the look and makeup look 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:55.360
 much more beautiful and more festive but 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.550
 of course as I always say it is not 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.050
 It is necessary for you to do the same 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.270
 remember that this is just one 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.710
 inspiration you can take what 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.539
 they like and leave what they do not like 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.650
 when applying makeup or 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.900
 when they do it with their own hands 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.729
 let's move to the lower area where 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.820
 let's start by applying the black pencil 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.530
 in the entire line of the eyelashes already 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.110
 Then we will return to our 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.060
 turquoise shade we will apply it in the 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.639
 inner part to give a point of light 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.949
 and color in the in the eye 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.460
 and then we will take the color 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.360
 dark blue we used previously 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.150
 you can go creating a 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.490
 degradation of turquoise and medium blue 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.820
 darker blue but in my case I decided 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.340
 only he gives me the dark blue 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.740
 and finally we are going to apply a 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.570
 Eye mask layer on the eyelashes 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.280
 inferiors also so that they do not 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.490
 enlarge your eyes and look much more 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.690
 pretty and basically that's all I hope 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.970
 that you liked and that have 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.870
 fun well this video thank you very much 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.870
 a little kiss bye
