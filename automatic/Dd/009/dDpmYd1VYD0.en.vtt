inspector<00:00:43.320> clear<00:00:44.010> didn't<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> was

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
inspector clear didn't think it was

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.740 
inspector clear didn't think it was
enough<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> warrant<00:00:46.079> tire<00:00:46.710> replacement<00:00:47.750> so

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
enough to warrant tire replacement so

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.510 
enough to warrant tire replacement so
very<00:00:49.050> very<00:00:49.260> standard<00:00:49.469> example<00:00:50.039> except<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.370> has

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
very very standard example except it has

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.500 
very very standard example except it has
got<00:00:50.670> arch<00:00:50.820> extensions<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.690> front<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.110> rear

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
got arch extensions on it front and rear

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.180 
got arch extensions on it front and rear
we'll<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.629> take<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> closer<00:00:55.559> walk<00:00:55.770> around<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
we'll just take a closer walk around it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
we'll just take a closer walk around it
it's<00:00:56.520> good<00:00:56.730> still<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.570> that's<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it's good still got I think that's the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.500 
it's good still got I think that's the
original<00:00:58.020> military<00:00:58.379> tilt<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.420> bits<00:01:00.420> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the pop-out here and this little bit and

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
the pop-out here and this little bit and
stuff<00:01:03.080> that's<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> original<00:01:04.320> military<00:01:04.650> tilt

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
stuff that's the original military tilt

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.980 
stuff that's the original military tilt
