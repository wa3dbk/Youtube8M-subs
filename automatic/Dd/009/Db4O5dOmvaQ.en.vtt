00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 not all and all friends 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.049
 today it is very pleasant to you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.600
 find again for a new test so 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.690
 a tobacco test that will focus on the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.950
 starbucks citrus mist 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.120
 so what is the star of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.460
 sitruk smith is simply a 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.310
 citrus mix of lemon blueberries 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.840
 orange here is a little mixture and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.910
 it's nice so the blueberry that can me 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 remember citrus the blueberry to say it 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.570
 or at least the bowler so then at 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.949
 level of baysa smell at obvious 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.330
 but whose smell is always present 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.980
 of course so at the level of the smell this 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 we really find ourselves 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.370
 found mostly in sweet enough lemons 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.410
 a high level of smell I would say that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.489
 the marsan crane not really small 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.520
 touches of blueberries but really 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.750
 slight anyway an odor that is 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.890
 really not tender for the part and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.239
 which really makes me want 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.289
 personally I really like the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.489
 Bloc and I hope we will the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.370
 find with a little better of her 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.570
 same and lemon so here at the level 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.760
 accomplished that it's simple 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 found on a pebble with 3com that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.110
 three tomes coach to the mercury lab and 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.220
 so the silicone hose 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.470
 when you are also stuck with hamburg 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:24.380
 Well, here we go, listen, we're going 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:25.640
 start right away with the taste and 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.040
 what do we find with the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.810
 work friends and bah frankly at the level 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.369
 of the group we find the baths a 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.630
 good touch of Gaullist I would say 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.119
 mix with the crane but the lemon 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.050
 frankly as I relate to him is me 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.420
 who likes a lot of the hommist and ben 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.520
 I am really satisfied with it because 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.229
 the smell we do not really smell the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.729
 blueberry and we smell more a little lemon 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.930
 well sweet so me good I'm not a 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.130
 big big fan of lemon but there 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.270
 frankly there frankly we find 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.770
 really a small minister job 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.030
 excuse me I'm a little bad so a 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.410
 little tip but just a little lemon 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.180
 mix with hail frankly 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.550
 really that I really appreciate 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.960
 much less so personally I 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.610
 their advises starbucks so I the 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.200
 question will drop me again yeah we 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.520
 get the starbucks so you can 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.800
 you get it in retail france on 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.450
 paris of the round genres but the sites 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.010
 I recommend it is always 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.140
 the same or kachi cat or four young 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.370
 so American sites when I the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.750
 repeat each time so ordered to 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.860
 many there are risks that's true 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.880
 to be stopped by the customs but 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.460
 I personally ordered 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.080
 with alex and ivory and it was good 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.360
 gone so that's I would say a shot of 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.160
 chance one must try but good here 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.540
 more and it's not too bossy bosses 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.370
 ordered a lot of tobacco because 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.370
 since yesterday quantity more logically 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.490
 been at risk of being stopped really 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.490
 so here you go 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.840
 finally in any case for the taste I am 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.970
 really satisfied a really sweet taste 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.680
 who sweet enough who is really 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.510
 representative of the smell I have nothing to 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.280
 say at this level here I advise you 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.600
 strongly this star buzz for what she 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.180
 play mr bah it's a stroke of luck 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.410
 since I thought we could not 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.550
 found at thank you and good found but 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.870
 with a little more mixture it's 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.760
 as if you mix Gaullist and 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.130
 that you add the star bag citrus 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.400
 toukourou frankly the mixture is 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:14.110
 really perfect me so I find 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.440
 here we will go on the lookout but 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.440
 now 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.250
 and bah frankly the smoke me I the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.569
 find it really suitable it's true 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.739
 that I had a lot of advice for the 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.939
 call or because I had never used 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.620
 this young piece were often two 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.989
 tomes coach to because there is no or more 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.819
 placed there jean lÃ©vy 3 I cut them in 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.140
 two and it really makes nickel and ben 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.159
 I see the result at the snack 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.319
 more powerful to the smoke that is 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.680
 really more presents a frankly 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.680
 it's really better 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.780
 it must be about half an hour 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.640
 I'm on chicha so everything happens 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:13.620
 well really really a very good 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:14.790
 moment personally I like 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.840
 really this ball I think he can 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.609
 to be recurrent for those who are not 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.950
 too much fan of citrus blueberries both 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.630
 lemons so it's really for what 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.950
