I<00:02:19.860> think<00:02:20.550> carpooling<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.510> great<00:02:21.840> way<00:02:21.990> to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
one of our car bullies is a non-drinker

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.900 
one of our car bullies is a non-drinker
so<00:02:35.080> every<00:02:35.920> now<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.160> again<00:02:36.190> we<00:02:36.520> stay<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:36.819> the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
so every now and again we stay in the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.449 
so every now and again we stay in the
city<00:02:37.120> ever<00:02:37.870> drink<00:02:38.170> or<00:02:38.290> two<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.500> she<00:02:39.220> drives

home
one<00:02:40.300> person<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.290> always<00:02:41.530> late<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.160> think<00:02:42.430> I'm

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
one person is always late I think I'm

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.009 
one person is always late I think I'm
the<00:02:42.640> only<00:02:42.760> one<00:02:42.880> that's<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.239> time<00:02:43.450> but<00:02:43.840> that's

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
the only one that's on time but that's

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.240 
the only one that's on time but that's
probably<00:02:44.200> because<00:02:44.590> I've<00:02:44.830> got<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.010> drop<00:02:45.130> my

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
probably because I've got to drop my

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.530 
probably because I've got to drop my
daughter<00:02:45.400> off<00:02:45.550> in<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.819> morning<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.209> she<00:02:46.330> has

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
daughter off in the morning and she has

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.170 
daughter off in the morning and she has
to<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:46.840> somewhere<00:02:47.140> at<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.319> certain<00:02:47.650> time<00:02:47.860> I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
to be somewhere at a certain time I

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.130 
to be somewhere at a certain time I
definitely<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.300> think<00:02:49.330> more<00:02:49.720> people<00:02:49.870> should

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
definitely do think more people should

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.600 
definitely do think more people should
carpool<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.739> would<00:02:50.860> definitely<00:02:51.250> cut<00:02:51.430> down

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
carpool that would definitely cut down

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.790 
carpool that would definitely cut down
on<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.819> number<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.150> cars<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.930> city<00:02:53.110> more

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
on a number of cars in the city more

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.500 
on a number of cars in the city more
people<00:02:54.099> should<00:02:54.220> careful<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.090> many<00:02:55.269> people

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
people should careful is so many people

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.789 
people should careful is so many people
driving<00:02:55.840> by<00:02:55.870> themselves<00:02:56.410> these<00:02:56.530> days

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
driving by themselves these days

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.550 
driving by themselves these days
it<00:02:57.250> seems<00:02:57.459> like<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.640> waste<00:02:58.140> everyone<00:02:59.140> carpool

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
it seems like a waste everyone carpool

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.259 
it seems like a waste everyone carpool
would<00:02:59.739> be<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> lot<00:03:00.069> this<00:03:00.220> traffic<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.150> would

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
would be a lot this traffic and it would

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.300 
would be a lot this traffic and it would
be<00:03:01.450> way<00:03:01.810> better<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.380> would<00:03:02.980> definitely

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
be way better I would definitely

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.520 
be way better I would definitely
recommend<00:03:03.370> carpooling<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.510> everyone<00:03:04.959> it's<00:03:05.290> a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
recommend carpooling to everyone it's a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.900 
recommend carpooling to everyone it's a
lot<00:03:05.709> easier<00:03:06.010> than<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.280> thought<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.640> was<00:03:06.700> going

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
lot easier than I thought it was going

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.150 
lot easier than I thought it was going
to<00:03:07.000> be<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.299> think<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.290> good<00:03:08.440> way<00:03:08.620> for<00:03:08.890> people<00:03:09.010> to

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
to be I think a good way for people to

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160 
to be I think a good way for people to
find<00:03:09.340> carpooling<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.330> mainly<00:03:10.569> just<00:03:10.870> not<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.140> be
