and again it has a spill-proof keyboard
this<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.580> essentially<00:00:14.820> designed<00:00:15.150> for

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
this is essentially designed for

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.720 
this is essentially designed for
students<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.379> classes<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.250> will<00:00:17.400> be<00:00:17.520> tied

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
students in classes so this will be tied

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670 
students in classes so this will be tied
up<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> main<00:00:18.300> server<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> teacher

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
up to a main server that the teacher

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.580 
up to a main server that the teacher
controls<00:00:20.810> one<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.960> main<00:00:22.109> features<00:00:22.140> that

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
controls one of the main features that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.980 
controls one of the main features that
it<00:00:22.859> has<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.279> entire<00:00:23.939> security<00:00:24.420> system<00:00:24.449> so

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
it has is the entire security system so

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.599 
it has is the entire security system so
if<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.380> laptop<00:00:25.590> does<00:00:25.949> get<00:00:26.099> stolen<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.580> lost

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
if the laptop does get stolen or lost

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.490 
if the laptop does get stolen or lost
the<00:00:27.359> main<00:00:27.570> server<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.230> lock<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.670> that

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
the main server can lock it up so that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.010 
the main server can lock it up so that
content<00:00:31.500> can't<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.890> stolen<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:33.020> it

content can't be stolen from this it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.720 
content can't be stolen from this it
also<00:00:34.200> converts<00:00:34.590> around<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.250> turns<00:00:35.460> into<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
also converts around and turns into a

on the top / go the design is again a
university<00:00:46.320> plastic<00:00:46.710> shell<00:00:46.890> design<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
university plastic shell design so it is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.799 
university plastic shell design so it is
very<00:00:47.789> rugged<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:49.700> drop<00:00:50.700> resistant<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
very rugged and drop resistant to up to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.549 
very rugged and drop resistant to up to
6<00:00:52.020> feet<00:00:53.480> talking<00:00:54.480> about<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> touch<00:00:55.140> screen<00:00:55.260> of

6 feet talking about the touch screen of

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.439 
6 feet talking about the touch screen of
the<00:00:55.590> tablet<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.399> capacitive<00:00:56.969> touch<00:00:57.210> gain

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the tablet it's a capacitive touch gain

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.580 
the tablet it's a capacitive touch gain
on<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> 10.1<00:00:58.109> inch

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.280 

and<00:01:03.190> it's<00:01:03.340> very<00:01:03.400> fast<00:01:03.970> responsive<00:01:04.510> but<00:01:05.080> the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
and it's very fast responsive but the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.230 
and it's very fast responsive but the
touch<00:01:05.470> screen<00:01:05.560> also<00:01:06.150> supports<00:01:07.150> a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.560 
makes it really convenient for the
student<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.340> carry<00:02:10.670> around<00:02:10.820> a<00:02:11.209> device<00:02:11.540> like

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
student to carry around a device like

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.590 
student to carry around a device like
this<00:02:11.930> again<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.590> drop<00:02:12.860> proof<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:14.180> if

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
this again it is drop proof and it if

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.330 
this again it is drop proof and it if
it's<00:02:14.780> dropping<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.290> has<00:02:15.410> an<00:02:15.530> accelerometer<00:02:15.770> so

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
it's dropping it has an accelerometer so

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.880 
it's dropping it has an accelerometer so
which<00:02:16.520> protects<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:18.050> locks<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.500> hard<00:02:18.680> drive

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
which protects and locks the hard drive

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.000 
which protects and locks the hard drive
so<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.940> data<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.239> not<00:02:20.420> lost<00:02:20.630> if<00:02:20.900> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
so that the data is not lost if the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.489 
so that the data is not lost if the
machine<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.160> talking
