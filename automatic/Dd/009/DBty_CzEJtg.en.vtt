00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.730
 Hello, good afternoon to everyone, and good afternoon to Tim. 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.460
 good today is 20th and 22nd 2013 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.500
 at 17 30 I'm here doing this 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 video and I will put it in the social networks 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.630
 To see who knows, I had to give a 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.180
 attention to my case and there is 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.210
 many consumers also 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.460
 meet with 3G connection problems 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 reached insists on saying that the connection 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.710
 3g in my area is in perfect condition 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.380
 conditions that the signal is perfect and I 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.989
 I will prove then that it is to connect tim 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.790
 is not providing the 3g signal 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.090
 Ok let's try to be brief connect it goes 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.020
 to say that you are connected 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.710
 I will show that the speed oscillating 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 by 10:30 pps we will open it 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.469
 a google page has already been opened 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.760
 several protocols were opened 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.650
 including anatel 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.560
 Is this problem rolling on? 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.430
 approximately five months and tim 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.979
 does nothing there 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.960
 not open it has been changed Moorish has been 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.159
 change the chip has already been tested in 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.500
 another computer 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.880
 so be the sign of trouble and I 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.520
 I discovered that the problem of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.450
 because we consumers are 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.210
 hiring 3g connection but we are 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.670
 paying for 3g but we're not 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.060
 getting connected 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.479
 so now let's change the configuration 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.479
 to 2 g 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.940
 and that's what I want from a 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.710
 a concise answer and that it respects us 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.630
 consumers not pushing the problem 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.710
 forward because in the time to come to 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.870
 account 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.700
 we have to pay and pay for a 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.370
 thing we're not using 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.920
 Hello I changed to 2gb you are 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.750
 connected to speed no longer if it was 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.830
 bps or that is not 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:11.240
 providing the signal 3g and yes in 2g 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:13.010
 look who knows so by putting this 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.320
 video on social networks 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.770
 tim gives more attention to us 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.490
 consumers who want to continue with 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.430
 the tim 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.240
 but as long as she gives us the service 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.240
 hired 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.640
 now i'm browsing the g connection 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.700
 as a favorite shown on April to 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.000
 page and then there was what you got from me 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.120
 say about why not 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.090
 if you can navigate in connection 3g and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.780
 can change the configuration 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.940
 for 2 g to navigate but with a lightness and 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.840
 also not the whole site that can 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.160
 open all pages with 3g connection 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.010
 due sites and heavy 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.450
 who knows, tim gives a return to 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.850
 we are consumers with a 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.150
 problem is more attention 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.360
 Let's go and wait for authentic boulter. 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.050
 I will wait for the response tim earned 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.860
 people brigade and remember let's run 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.860
 behind our rights 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.130
 thanks
