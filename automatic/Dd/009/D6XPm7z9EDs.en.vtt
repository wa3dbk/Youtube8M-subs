00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
similar design if not same design as the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.089 
similar design if not same design as the
BRE<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.600> taking<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.960> closer<00:00:25.320> look<00:00:25.590> you'll

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
battery indicator here indoors outdoor

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.660 
battery indicator here indoors outdoor
but<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.450> which<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.870> pretty<00:00:43.079> useful<00:00:43.579> as<00:00:44.579> I

but on which is pretty useful as I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.250 
but on which is pretty useful as I
mentioned<00:00:45.000> battery<00:00:45.390> indicator<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.050> turn

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
mentioned battery indicator if we turn

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.670 
mentioned battery indicator if we turn
this<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:47.450> as<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> go<00:00:49.469> your

this on as you can see here you go your

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.880 
this on as you can see here you go your
life's<00:00:49.920> little<00:00:50.250> LEDs<00:00:50.640> you've<00:00:50.789> about<00:00:51.050> 75%<00:00:52.050> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
life's little LEDs you've about 75% you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.310 
life's little LEDs you've about 75% you
know<00:00:53.010> roughly<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> go<00:00:54.960> you're<00:00:55.140> out

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
know roughly there you go you're out

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.099 
know roughly there you go you're out
which<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.800> also<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.309> nice<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.629> handy

when you want to charge you've got 500

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.260 
when you want to charge you've got 500
milliamps<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.460> how<00:01:02.460> our<00:01:02.699> table<00:01:02.969> viously

charged the Bravin you do need to use a
power<00:01:06.600> socket<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.830> charge<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.840> you

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
power socket to charge this and you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.380 
power socket to charge this and you
can't<00:01:10.260> actually<00:01:10.530> charge<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.040> by<00:01:11.159> USB<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
can't actually charge it by USB like the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.230 
can't actually charge it by USB like the
previous<00:01:12.750> smaller<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:14.250> could<00:01:14.400> say<00:01:14.640> sister<00:01:15.119> so

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
previous smaller you could say sister so

let's take a look at the other side this
is<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:16.950> well<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:17.729> px7<00:01:18.720> radius<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.350> gonna<00:01:19.439> get

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
is as well i px7 radius you're gonna get

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.679 
is as well i px7 radius you're gonna get
all<00:01:19.770> your<00:01:20.180> water-resistant<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.299> shockproof

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
all your water-resistant and shockproof

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.010 
all your water-resistant and shockproof
need<00:01:22.380> rubber<00:01:23.070> soles<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> bottom<00:01:24.810> which<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
need rubber soles on the bottom which is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
need rubber soles on the bottom which is
nice<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.650> handy<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> actually<00:01:26.520> actually

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
has this sort of sticky residue to it so

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.270 
has this sort of sticky residue to it so
it<00:01:29.939> actually<00:01:30.030> sticks<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> surface

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
