normally now is what about uh six about
a<00:00:40.710> 6<00:00:41.100> ok<00:00:41.190> we're<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.789> put<00:00:41.909> Johnny<00:00:42.120> open<00:00:42.449> G

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
a 6 ok we're going to put Johnny open G

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.889 
a 6 ok we're going to put Johnny open G
okay<00:00:43.859> now<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.249> the<00:00:44.399> alta<00:00:44.670> g<00:00:44.909> we're<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.749> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
okay now on the alta g we're going to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.049 
okay now on the alta g we're going to
calculate<00:00:47.480> is<00:00:49.399> approximate<00:00:50.399> body<00:00:50.579> weight<00:00:50.819> so

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
calculate is approximate body weight so

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.340 
calculate is approximate body weight so
what's<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.359> to<00:00:51.390> happen<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.749> is<00:00:52.079> we're

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
what's going to happen here is we're

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.459 
what's going to happen here is we're
calculating<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:53.100> body<00:00:53.309> weight<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.469> the

your<00:00:58.920> exact<00:00:59.220> weight<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.240> we<00:01:00.330> can

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
your exact weight and then we can

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.820 
your exact weight and then we can
determine<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:01.020> much<00:01:01.140> percentage<00:01:01.650> of<00:01:01.740> body

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
determine how much percentage of body

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.979 
determine how much percentage of body
weight<00:01:02.040> we're<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.430> take

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
weight we're going to take
