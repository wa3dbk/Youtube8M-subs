00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:14.190
 Thank Hello is the length possible layout reproduced in the Town Hall level 4 this time 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:18.990
 I would like to introduce 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.039
 Every layout has all the facilities that can be installed at Town Hall Level 4 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.039
 It is a prerequisite 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:31.090
 At the town hall level 4, there is often an even number of one facility, so it is symmetrical 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:36.270
 Layout is relatively easy to make 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 In addition, we want to arrange well as anti-aircraft can appear 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.820
 Let 's move on to the layout introduction 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:55.220
 It first appeared in the first it is here in the layout Kameda house look and square layout 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:01:01.290
 The features of this village are to be seen First of all, there is a wave region in the center of Bra 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:04.320
 Be revenue from all directions by Tomari Station ed center dormitory has become to be able to respond 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:11.100
 The third point is around the waveform today 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:17.590
 It is four blocks by putting resource storage facility and defense snow in one block 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:22.479
 Even if some blocks are burned, all resource storage facilities can be destroyed. 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.369
 Of course, if the town hall level was attacked from the player above their own to fully open 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.369
 May be 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:32.340
 When Gurureberu was attacked from the same player after 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.340
 You can reduce as much as possible the risk of born all of the resources 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.530
 Then I want to move on to the next layout explanation 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:46.520
 The next layout is a trapezoidal layout, isn't it? 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.950
 It is also called as a trapezoid layout, but I'm a little poor at English and so the trapezoid is 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.640
 And will be 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:57.390
 This layout is a bit weak for bottom and top earnings 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:02.700
 It is very strong for the profit from the left and right 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:07.740
 A mortar is installed in the center as well as the layered one earlier . 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.910
 In addition, you can be destroyed as much as possible by solidifying the surroundings in a resource storage facility as much as a cake 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.910
 It is so hard to 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.969
 Ta-Bo Bo is placed on the left side of the center, giving the impression that it is very easy to break 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.799
 But 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:28.650
 While earning revenue from the left side and attacking the town hall with the Archer Tower 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:32.230
 If you told me to attack from the left but rather it is possible to pour concentrated attacks from thin ice 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.519
 It is made to be easy to escort 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.840
 This layout is very easy to capture for players who know how to capture 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:44.010
 It is a layout 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.010
 It is a layout that is very difficult to attack from players who do not know how to capture 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.490
 Then I want to move on to the final layout introduction 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.760
 The last layout is here 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.439
 The layout is divided into three blocks on the wall 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.760
 This layout is not the same as the second time I introduced the turn open ball 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:13.230
 We set up bias on one side 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:19.240
 Also it has set up a white liquid product in the center of the back encased in high the needle of the hit point snow 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:25.300
 This layout is designed to be easy to oa when attacking from any direction 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.020
 However when you want to protect the resources of the resource storage facility in the are installed in relatively broke easy to position your 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.620
 Not recommended 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.010
 Recommended for when you want to increase the like trophy 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:38.150
 The anti-aircraft gun has been installed in a very easy to break position 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:43.760
 As the Grand Castle is located in a position where it is difficult to break the mortar 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:49.360
 If you have a unit capable of attacking your head in the air , such as an archer, you need a healer or 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.360
 We can cope with earnings including overhead from the air such as uh-balloon 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:04:00.549
 The town hall level 4 can be reproduced but the layout failure is over 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:05.660
 Town Hall Level Hyunmo Tan Hall Hakkei as in Level 3 You are the cornerstone of defense 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:09.340
 Let's set up firmly in the center of mortars roses 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.340
 Then again next time bye
