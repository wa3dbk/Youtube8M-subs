we're<00:01:06.850> going<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.030> do<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.600> put<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.960> knot<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.500> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
we're going to do is put a knot in the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.120 
we're going to do is put a knot in the
tire<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.820> hole<00:01:13.000> is<00:01:13.119> just<00:01:13.150> up<00:01:13.479> here<00:01:14.040> try<00:01:15.040> and

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
tire the hole is just up here try and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.740 
tire the hole is just up here try and
isolate<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.700> hole<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.030> stop<00:01:16.270> any<00:01:16.479> air

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
isolate the hole and stop any air

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.700 
isolate the hole and stop any air
getting<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.290> particular<00:01:18.190> part<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
getting to that particular part that

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.340 
getting to that particular part that
looks<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:20.950> bit<00:01:20.979> crude<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.869> want<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.080> get<00:01:23.229> that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
looks a bit crude you want to get that

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.800 
looks a bit crude you want to get that
knot<00:01:23.710> as<00:01:24.040> close<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.000> end<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.600> tube

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
knot as close to the end of the tube

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.389 
knot as close to the end of the tube
because<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.350> course<00:01:26.530> you're<00:01:26.680> shortening<00:01:27.280> it

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
because of course you're shortening it

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.070 
because of course you're shortening it
but<00:01:27.850> there<00:01:27.970> is<00:01:28.060> quite<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.299> lot<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.570> stretchiness

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
but there is quite a lot of stretchiness

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.779 
but there is quite a lot of stretchiness
and<00:01:29.350> these<00:01:29.440> inner<00:01:29.619> tubes<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.520> should<00:01:30.670> still

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
and these inner tubes so it should still

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.630 
and these inner tubes so it should still
feel<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.840> entire<00:01:32.320> tyre<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:35.979> simple<00:01:36.490> nut

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
feel the entire tyre this a simple nut

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.880 
feel the entire tyre this a simple nut
will<00:01:36.759> do<00:01:37.200> trying<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.229> get<00:01:38.409> this<00:01:38.500> one<00:01:38.679> up<00:01:40.890> right

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
will do trying to get this one up right

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.690 
will do trying to get this one up right
towards<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.399> end<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:43.720> if<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:43.899> looks<00:01:44.110> crude

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
towards the end now if it looks crude

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.180 
towards the end now if it looks crude
that's<00:01:45.700> because<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.149> is<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.840> idea<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.350> that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
that's because it is the idea is that

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.740 
that's because it is the idea is that
this<00:01:48.310> budge<00:01:48.670> will<00:01:48.880> hopefully<00:01:49.149> get<00:01:49.509> this<00:01:49.569> back

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
this budge will hopefully get this back

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.809 
this budge will hopefully get this back
home<00:01:50.020> let's<00:01:50.380> give<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.649> go<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.610> can<00:01:54.700> see

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
home let's give it a go as you can see

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.730 
home let's give it a go as you can see
that's<00:01:54.970> seated<00:01:55.929> worked<00:01:56.140> okay<00:01:56.409> there's<00:01:56.590> no

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
that's seated worked okay there's no

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.070 
that's seated worked okay there's no
actual<00:01:57.610> air<00:01:57.789> in<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.090> end<00:01:58.330> part<00:01:58.840> where<00:01:58.990> the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
actual air in that end part where the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.410 
actual air in that end part where the
hole<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.440> it's<00:01:59.679> staying<00:01:59.950> up<00:02:00.130> all<00:02:00.940> good<00:02:01.210> so

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
hole is and it's staying up all good so

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:12.010 
hole is and it's staying up all good so
far

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.820 

here<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.110> go<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.740> on<00:02:15.410> now<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.470> don't<00:02:16.590> want<00:02:16.770> to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
here we go it's on now we don't want to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.740 
here we go it's on now we don't want to
put<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.040> up<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.280> 100<00:02:17.700> psi<00:02:17.880> like<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.420> might<00:02:18.570> do

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.110 
put it up to 100 psi like we might do
ordinarily<00:02:19.740> because<00:02:20.310> that's<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.580> weak<00:02:20.820> point

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
now this is simply a bodge job to get

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
do if the single not budge doesn't work

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.900 
do if the single not budge doesn't work
well<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.800> should<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.130> if<00:02:35.220> it's<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.580> small

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
well it should do if it's just a small

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.250 
well it should do if it's just a small
hole<00:02:36.210> but<00:02:36.390> if<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.540> find<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.900> you've<00:02:37.050> got<00:02:37.230> a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
hole but if you find that you've got a

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.710 
hole but if you find that you've got a
rip<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.100> course<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.820> go<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> DC<00:02:39.600> end

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
rip and of course you go on to DC end

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.850 
rip and of course you go on to DC end
budge<00:02:40.350> number<00:02:40.740> 2<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> think<00:02:42.420> I've<00:02:43.410> managed

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
budge number 2 so I think I've managed

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.600 
budge number 2 so I think I've managed
to<00:02:43.950> isolate<00:02:44.130> where<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.850> hole<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.390> my<00:02:46.200> tube

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610

as<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.210> see<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.600> big<00:02:48.930> gas<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.470> that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
as you can see this is a big gas so that

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.620 
as you can see this is a big gas so that
single<00:02:49.890> knot<00:02:50.190> might<00:02:50.460> not<00:02:50.640> work<00:02:50.850> it's<00:02:51.510> more

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
single knot might not work it's more

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.630 
single knot might not work it's more
difficult<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.110> isolate<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.710> hole<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.190> stop

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
the air coming out so what are you doing

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.900 
the air coming out so what are you doing
this<00:02:55.140> situation<00:02:55.830> we're<00:02:56.370> going<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.550> make<00:02:56.640> two

knots

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.270 
knots
first<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.050> all<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:58.530> need<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.740> rip<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.160> inner

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
first of all we need to rip the inner

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.280 
first of all we need to rip the inner
tube<00:02:59.490> into<00:02:59.730> two<00:02:59.940> parts<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.620> aim<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:03.290> rip

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
tube into two parts the aim is to rip

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.470 

there<00:03:12.540> we<00:03:12.660> go

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.589 

now<00:03:16.080> what<00:03:16.230> we're<00:03:16.349> going<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.500> do<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:18.030> now<00:03:18.360> we're

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
now what we're going to do so now we're

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.240 
now what we're going to do so now we're
ready<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.870> make<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.080> two<00:03:19.349> knots<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:19.890> starting

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
ready to make the two knots so starting

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.030 
ready to make the two knots so starting
at<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.519> end<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:20.879> inner<00:03:21.000> tube<00:03:21.860> let's<00:03:22.860> put<00:03:23.010> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
at one end of the inner tube let's put a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.110 
at one end of the inner tube let's put a
simple<00:03:23.610> knot<00:03:23.819> in<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:25.459> now<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.489> want<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.879> knot

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
simple knot in it now you want the knot

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.580 
simple knot in it now you want the knot
to<00:03:27.239> be<00:03:27.360> fairly<00:03:27.720> close<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.319> end<00:03:28.440> but<00:03:28.530> of

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
to be fairly close to the end but of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.670 
to be fairly close to the end but of
course<00:03:28.769> not<00:03:29.069> too<00:03:29.280> close<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:31.230> there's<00:03:31.410> less

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
course not too close so there's less

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.550 
course not too close so there's less
chance<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.780> air<00:03:33.900> came<00:03:34.110> through<00:03:34.380> once

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
chance of the air came through once

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.640 
chance of the air came through once
you've<00:03:34.680> got<00:03:34.800> it<00:03:34.830> roughly<00:03:35.220> like<00:03:35.370> that

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
you've got it roughly like that

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.199 
you've got it roughly like that
around<00:03:37.650> about<00:03:37.800> an<00:03:37.920> inch<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.280> spare<00:03:38.430> at<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:38.940> end

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
around about an inch to spare at the end

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.150 
around about an inch to spare at the end
just<00:03:39.890> pull<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.010> as<00:03:41.910> tight<00:03:42.660> as<00:03:43.049> you<00:03:43.319> can<00:03:43.349> get<00:03:43.590> it

but<00:04:13.920> what<00:04:14.160> do<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.310> do<00:04:14.490> if<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:14.730> single<00:04:15.180> nut

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
but what do you do if this single nut

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.450 
but what do you do if this single nut
doesn't<00:04:15.630> work<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.710> double<00:04:17.100> knot<00:04:17.250> doesn't

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
doesn't work and the double knot doesn't

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.670 
doesn't work and the double knot doesn't
work<00:04:17.730> where<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.480> go<00:04:18.630> on<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.870> DC<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.440> bud

number three which is grass now I always

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.640 
number three which is grass now I always
take<00:04:23.460> some<00:04:23.670> out<00:04:23.790> of<00:04:23.940> me<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.870> my<00:04:25.020> back<00:04:25.200> pocket

could ride home on it but I can feel as

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.430 
could ride home on it but I can feel as
I'm<00:04:45.520> riding<00:04:45.820> along<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.180> bits<00:04:46.450> where<00:04:46.780> I've<00:04:46.930> got

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
I'm riding along the bits where I've got

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.320 
I'm riding along the bits where I've got
that<00:04:47.560> fold<00:04:47.920> over<00:04:48.310> pieces<00:04:48.520> of<00:04:48.730> grass<00:04:48.940> in<00:04:49.150> there

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
that fold over pieces of grass in there

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.210 
that fold over pieces of grass in there
it<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.870> lot<00:04:50.200> more<00:04:50.410> solid<00:04:50.620> I've<00:04:50.890> had<00:04:51.040> more

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
it is a lot more solid I've had more

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.190 
it is a lot more solid I've had more
time<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:51.850> probably<00:04:52.510> more<00:04:52.690> inclination

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
time and probably more inclination

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.080 
time and probably more inclination
because<00:04:53.680> I'm<00:04:53.860> freezing<00:04:54.190> cold<00:04:54.640> here<00:04:54.760> I

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
because I'm freezing cold here I

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.120 
because I'm freezing cold here I
probably<00:04:55.840> could<00:04:56.110> get<00:04:56.260> away<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.740> but<00:04:56.950> it's<00:04:57.070> a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
probably could get away of it but it's a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.980 
probably could get away of it but it's a
last<00:04:57.370> resort<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:57.850> remember<00:04:58.210> if<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.420> do<00:04:58.660> do<00:04:58.870> it

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
last resort and remember if you do do it

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.870 
last resort and remember if you do do it
this<00:04:59.080> way<00:04:59.290> be<00:04:59.830> very<00:05:00.130> very<00:05:00.370> careful<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.790> way

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
this way be very very careful the way

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.460 
this way be very very careful the way
home<00:05:01.090> particularly<00:05:01.630> when<00:05:02.170> you're<00:05:02.320> going

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
home particularly when you're going

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.780 
home particularly when you're going
round<00:05:02.680> corners<00:05:03.190> it's<00:05:03.280> not<00:05:03.400> going<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.580> have<00:05:03.700> the

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
round corners it's not going to have the

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.820 
round corners it's not going to have the
same<00:05:04.030> strength<00:05:04.510> there's<00:05:05.140> a<00:05:05.230> likelihood<00:05:05.590> at

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
same strength there's a likelihood at

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.590 
same strength there's a likelihood at
the<00:05:05.890> time<00:05:06.130> I<00:05:06.310> roll<00:05:06.610> off<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:06.970> rim<00:05:07.150> so<00:05:07.330> just<00:05:07.510> be

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
the time I roll off the rim so just be

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.170 
the time I roll off the rim so just be
very<00:05:07.720> careful<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.350> your<00:05:08.410> way<00:05:08.860> home<00:05:08.950> but<00:05:09.730> if<00:05:10.030> you

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
very careful on your way home but if you

very careful on your way home but if you
do<00:05:10.300> get<00:05:10.480> away<00:05:10.660> of<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:10.900> let<00:05:11.380> us<00:05:11.500> know<00:05:11.680> in<00:05:11.770> the
