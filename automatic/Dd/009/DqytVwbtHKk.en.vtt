this like say your hairs were spread out
that<00:00:27.630> wide<00:00:27.900> you're<00:00:28.769> trying<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> attach<00:00:29.310> up

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that wide you're trying to attach up

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.830 
that wide you're trying to attach up
there<00:00:29.730> you're<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.359> some<00:00:30.539> pulling

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
there you're going to get some pulling

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.690 
there you're going to get some pulling
on<00:00:31.199> each<00:00:31.439> side<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.070> could<00:00:32.279> end<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.520> losing

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
on each side and you could end up losing

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.490 
on each side and you could end up losing
a<00:00:32.940> bottom<00:00:33.210> you'll<00:00:33.780> want<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> make<00:00:34.170> sure<00:00:34.200> that

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
a bottom you'll want to make sure that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.340 
a bottom you'll want to make sure that
those<00:00:34.649> hairs<00:00:34.950> aren't<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.489> close<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:36.000> possible

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
those hairs aren't as close as possible

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.450 
those hairs aren't as close as possible
without<00:00:37.350> any<00:00:37.890> airs

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
without any airs

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
without any airs
no<00:00:39.450> coming<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:39.960> anywhere<00:00:40.320> else

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.580 

so<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.579> sectioning<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.050> does<00:00:49.260> making

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
so when I'm sectioning and does making

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.440 
so when I'm sectioning and does making
sure<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.920> these<00:00:50.070> hairs<00:00:50.430> aren't<00:00:50.820> very<00:00:51.120> close

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
sure that these hairs aren't very close

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.020 
sure that these hairs aren't very close
together<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.040> I'm<00:00:53.040> gonna<00:00:53.220> attach<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:53.970> I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
together here I'm gonna attach to so I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.829 
together here I'm gonna attach to so I
don't<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.329> any<00:00:54.540> pulling

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.219

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.930 
that I don't feel any parents there or a
real<00:01:05.590> wide<00:01:06.659> section<00:01:08.549> intersection<00:01:09.549> that's<00:01:09.790> a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
real wide section intersection that's a

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.030 
real wide section intersection that's a
little<00:01:10.149> bit<00:01:10.360> smaller<00:01:10.840> than<00:01:11.200> my<00:01:11.619> total<00:01:11.920> of

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
little bit smaller than my total of

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.249 
little bit smaller than my total of
extension<00:01:12.610> here<00:01:12.820> now<00:01:13.570> how<00:01:13.750> I<00:01:13.780> do<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.140> back

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
extension here now how I do the back

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.499 
extension here now how I do the back
yeah<00:01:14.799> I<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.830> get<00:01:18.280> my<00:01:18.399> extension<00:01:19.270> ready

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
yeah I will get my extension ready

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.529
