00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
a little to get some more information

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.819 
a little to get some more information
well<00:03:36.840> first<00:03:37.109> of<00:03:37.230> all<00:03:37.290> I've<00:03:37.440> learned<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.739> lot

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
well first of all I've learned a lot

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.830 
well first of all I've learned a lot
about<00:03:37.949> camera<00:03:38.430> camera<00:03:38.880> we<00:03:39.239> actually<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
about camera camera we actually in the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.770 
about camera camera we actually in the
ATP<00:03:40.350> it's

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
ATP it's

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.360 
ATP it's
it's<00:03:40.900> amazing<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.319> see<00:03:41.410> how<00:03:41.709> many<00:03:41.890> people<00:03:42.190> turn

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
it's amazing to see how many people turn

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.670 
it's amazing to see how many people turn
up<00:03:42.400> here<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:42.940> how<00:03:43.060> infused<00:03:43.930> everybody<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.500> in

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
up here and how infused everybody is in

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.350 
up here and how infused everybody is in
doing<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.250> program<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:45.760> think<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.180> was<00:03:46.330> very

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
doing that program I think that was very

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.030 
doing that program I think that was very
eye-opening<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:47.200> thought<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:47.560> nobody<00:03:47.860> really

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
eye-opening I thought that nobody really

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.910 
eye-opening I thought that nobody really
cares<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:49.330> much<00:03:49.390> about<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.810> but<00:03:50.020> it's<00:03:50.200> it's<00:03:50.770> the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
cares so much about it but it's it's the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.820 
cares so much about it but it's it's the
exact<00:03:51.250> opposite<00:03:51.700> well<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.390> is<00:03:52.420> this<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.380> this

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
exact opposite well this is this is this

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.530 
exact opposite well this is this is this
is<00:03:53.890> great<00:03:54.220> fun<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.819> VR<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.150> all<00:03:55.300> together
