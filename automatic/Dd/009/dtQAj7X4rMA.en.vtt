00:01:10.470 --> 00:02:15.900 
clays and sands so you'll see the
scrubbing<00:01:10.830> technique<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.580> talking<00:01:11.939> about

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910

didn't get stuck up in here okay so I
just<00:03:45.420> finished<00:03:45.810> cleaning<00:03:46.640> up<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.790> sluice<00:03:48.060> and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
just finished cleaning up the sluice and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.490 
just finished cleaning up the sluice and
patting<00:03:49.440> out<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.680> two<00:03:49.830> different<00:03:50.190> sections<00:03:50.370> I

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
patting out the two different sections I

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.100 
patting out the two different sections I
separated<00:03:52.500> them<00:03:52.769> out<00:03:53.330> in<00:03:54.330> two<00:03:54.959> different

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
separated them out in two different

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.539 
separated them out in two different
buckets<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.239> could<00:03:57.660> call<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:59.340> could

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
buckets so I could call and you could

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.449 
buckets so I could call and you could
tell<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.910> difference<00:04:00.030> between<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:02.250> front

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
tell the difference between the front

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.369 
tell the difference between the front
and<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.120> back
