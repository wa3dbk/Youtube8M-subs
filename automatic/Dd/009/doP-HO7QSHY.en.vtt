interactive<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.160> you'll<00:00:17.369> end<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:18.090> this

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
interactive and you'll end up with this

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.939 
interactive and you'll end up with this
obviously<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.350> click<00:00:19.560> through<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
obviously you can click through and

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.080 
obviously you can click through and
figure<00:00:20.220> out<00:00:20.279> what's<00:00:20.460> going<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.730> but<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.939> just

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
figure out what's going on but I just

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.630 
figure out what's going on but I just
want<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> show<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.260> coolest<00:00:22.680> part<00:00:22.980> here

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
want to show you the coolest part here

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.400 
want to show you the coolest part here
how<00:00:24.060> when<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.300> zoom<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.170> not<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
how when you zoom in and this is not the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.570 
how when you zoom in and this is not the
coolest<00:00:25.590> part<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.189> want<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.490> it

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
coolest part but I just want to do it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.109 
coolest part but I just want to do it
anyways

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
anyways

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.370 
anyways
so<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.570> can<00:00:27.720> see<00:00:27.869> how<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.050> nephrons<00:00:28.500> are

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
so you can see how the nephrons are

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.420 
so you can see how the nephrons are
situated<00:00:31.380> within<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.830> tired<00:00:32.070> thing<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.399> I

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
situated within this tired thing so I

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.389 
situated within this tired thing so I
talked<00:00:32.700> about<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.239> loops<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.870> onlay<00:00:34.710> dipping

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
talked about the loops of onlay dipping

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.010 
talked about the loops of onlay dipping
into<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> medulla<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.540> see<00:00:36.690> everything

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
into the medulla you can see everything

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.950 
into the medulla you can see everything
right<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.579> but<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:39.420> really

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
right here but this is really really

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
right here but this is really really
cool<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.440> gotta<00:00:40.649> play<00:00:40.920> around<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.579> so

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
cool you gotta play around with this so

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.619 
cool you gotta play around with this so
this<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> whole<00:00:42.210> thing

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
this is the whole thing

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.170 
this is the whole thing
there's<00:00:42.840> your<00:00:43.020> afferent<00:00:43.500> arteriole<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
there's your afferent arteriole the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
there's your afferent arteriole the
efferent<00:00:45.690> arteriole<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> actually<00:00:47.250> thinner

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
efferent arteriole is actually thinner

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.150 
efferent arteriole is actually thinner
right<00:00:48.149> creates<00:00:48.600> high<00:00:48.750> plush<00:00:49.050> high<00:00:49.500> pressure

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
right creates high plush high pressure

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.760 
right creates high plush high pressure
so<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> ultra<00:00:51.750> filtration<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
so this is a ultra filtration is the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.260 
so this is a ultra filtration is the
process<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.190> say<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> happening<00:00:53.699> inside<00:00:54.059> here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
process we say is happening inside here

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.540 
process we say is happening inside here
that's<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> glomerulus<00:00:55.410> inside<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> renal

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that's the glomerulus inside the renal

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.360 
that's the glomerulus inside the renal
capsule<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.570> you've<00:00:58.440> seen<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
capsule but you've seen it as the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.119 
capsule but you've seen it as the
Bowman's<00:00:59.820> capsule<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> capital<00:01:00.870> B

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
Bowman's capsule with the capital B

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.529 
Bowman's capsule with the capital B
anything<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.340> gets<00:01:02.430> squeezed<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
anything that gets squeezed out here is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
anything that gets squeezed out here is
going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> end<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> proximal

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
going to end up going to the proximal

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.580 
going to end up going to the proximal
convoluted<00:01:05.760> tubule<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.990> part<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.409> where<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
convoluted tubule this part is where a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.960 
convoluted tubule this part is where a
lot<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> stuff<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.340> didn't<00:01:08.670> want<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
lot of the stuff we didn't want to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.609 
lot of the stuff we didn't want to
actually<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.450> into<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.020> climber<00:01:10.320> Euler

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
actually get into this climber Euler

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.740 
actually get into this climber Euler
filtrate<00:01:11.130> gets<00:01:11.640> reabsorbed<00:01:11.939> back<00:01:12.510> we're

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
filtrate gets reabsorbed back we're

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
filtrate gets reabsorbed back we're
gonna<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> heads<00:01:13.890> down<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
gonna see that then it heads down the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
gonna see that then it heads down the
sleep<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.700> lay<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.119> purpose<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.570> which<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
sleep of on lay the purpose of which is

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.880 
sleep of on lay the purpose of which is
to<00:01:16.170> make<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.860> area<00:01:17.250> very<00:01:18.000> salty<00:01:18.840> very<00:01:19.560> salty

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
to make this area very salty very salty

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.670 
to make this area very salty very salty
and<00:01:20.810> finally<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> rest<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> filtrate

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and finally the rest of the filtrate

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.130 
and finally the rest of the filtrate
comes<00:01:22.860> down<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.180> where<00:01:24.479> ADH

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
comes down here and this is where ADH

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219 
comes down here and this is where ADH
kicks<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:27.000> need<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.420> save<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
kicks in if we need to save some of that

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.069 
kicks in if we need to save some of that
water<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> what's<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:29.820> cool<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.390> guess

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
water so what's really cool here I guess

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.240 
water so what's really cool here I guess
you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.350> click<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.650> play<00:01:31.770> around<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you can click and play around with it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.819 
you can click and play around with it
but<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.750> we<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:33.990> predictions<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.710> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
but is we can make predictions and you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.499 
but is we can make predictions and you
can<00:01:34.950> follow<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.340> path<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.759> these<00:01:35.939> things<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
can follow the path of these things so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.760 
can follow the path of these things so
and<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.840> becomes<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:37.650> roller

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and it becomes like a little roller

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.929 
and it becomes like a little roller
coaster<00:01:38.159> ride<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.520> these<00:01:38.670> things<00:01:38.820> so

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
coaster ride for all these things so

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
coaster ride for all these things so
let's<00:01:39.119> start<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> urea<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.530> click<00:01:40.740> urea

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
let's start with a urea if I click urea

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.670 
let's start with a urea if I click urea
and<00:01:41.189> start<00:01:41.460> my<00:01:41.850> prediction<00:01:42.360> urea<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and start my prediction urea is the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.649 
and start my prediction urea is the
whole<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.310> whole<00:01:44.460> point<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.060> thing<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
whole the whole point of this thing is

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.870 
whole the whole point of this thing is
to<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:46.049> rid<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.320> urea<00:01:46.829> which<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.280> buzz<00:01:47.700> which

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to get rid of urea which is a buzz which

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.310 
to get rid of urea which is a buzz which
is<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> toxin<00:01:48.979> from<00:01:49.979> protein<00:01:51.320> protein

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
is a toxin from protein protein

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.429 
is a toxin from protein protein
metabolism<00:01:53.100> ok<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.200> really

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
metabolism ok you get you get you really

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.749 
metabolism ok you get you get you really
left<00:01:55.619> over<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:55.979> need<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.189> get<00:01:56.310> rid<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
left over we need to get rid of it and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.340 
left over we need to get rid of it and
that's<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> reasons<00:01:57.509> why<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.750> go<00:01:57.899> pee

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that's one of the reasons why we go pee

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.740 
that's one of the reasons why we go pee
so<00:01:58.649> my<00:01:59.040> prediction<00:01:59.369> well<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.360> should<00:02:00.540> pause

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so my prediction well you should pause

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.179 
so my prediction well you should pause
the<00:02:01.020> video<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.590> make<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.829> prediction

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the video actually make your prediction

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.920 
the video actually make your prediction
play<00:02:02.369> around<00:02:02.549> with<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.149> go<00:02:03.630> play<00:02:03.810> with

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
play around with this but go play with

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.300 
play around with this but go play with
this<00:02:04.020> first<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:04.740> come<00:02:04.950> back<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.219> finish

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
this first and then come back and finish

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.859 
this first and then come back and finish
watching<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.390> prediction<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
watching this so my prediction is that

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.839 
watching this so my prediction is that
urea<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.530> small<00:02:07.740> molecule<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.399> should

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
urea it's a small molecule it should

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.699 
urea it's a small molecule it should
make<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.360> or<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.929> should<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.289> squeezed<00:02:10.560> out

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
make it out or I should get squeezed out

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.320 
make it out or I should get squeezed out
it's<00:02:11.129> got<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.610> into<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.879> pee

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
it's got to go into the pee

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.840 
it's got to go into the pee
otherwise<00:02:12.720> there's<00:02:13.380> no<00:02:13.530> point<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.820> I

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
otherwise there's no point so like I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.940 
otherwise there's no point so like I
predict<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.480> urea<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.320> gonna<00:02:16.500> travel<00:02:16.770> all

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
predict that urea is gonna travel all

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.440 
predict that urea is gonna travel all
around<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.430> shouldn't<00:02:17.730> return<00:02:18.000> back<00:02:18.150> into<00:02:18.210> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
around it shouldn't return back into the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.240 
around it shouldn't return back into the
bloodstream<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.050> would<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.260> weird<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.710> it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
bloodstream that would be weird and it

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190 
bloodstream that would be weird and it
should<00:02:20.460> follow<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.390> ship<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.900> should<00:02:22.050> end

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
should follow it's a ship I should end

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.540 
should follow it's a ship I should end
up<00:02:22.260> all<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> way<00:02:22.620> at<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.740> end<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.220> let's<00:02:23.250> see

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
up all the way at the end so let's see

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.940 
up all the way at the end so let's see
there's<00:02:24.060> urea<00:02:24.330> okay<00:02:25.230> get<00:02:25.470> squeezed<00:02:25.830> out

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
there's urea okay get squeezed out

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.100 
there's urea okay get squeezed out
proximal<00:02:26.700> convoluted<00:02:26.820> tubule<00:02:27.180> running<00:02:28.020> out

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
proximal convoluted tubule running out

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.460 
proximal convoluted tubule running out
of<00:02:28.140> time<00:02:28.380> here

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.710 

it's<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:33.650> fun<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.160> watch<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.610> that's<00:02:35.510> like<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
it's so fun to watch this that's like a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.460 
it's so fun to watch this that's like a
little<00:02:36.490> roller<00:02:37.490> coaster<00:02:38.000> set<00:02:38.270> okay<00:02:38.959> great

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
little roller coaster set okay great

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.440 
little roller coaster set okay great
how<00:02:39.770> about<00:02:39.890> glucose<00:02:40.430> remember<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.000> don't<00:02:41.120> want

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
how about glucose remember I don't want

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.510 
how about glucose remember I don't want
glucose<00:02:41.810> in<00:02:41.990> my<00:02:42.110> urine<00:02:42.500> if<00:02:42.650> my<00:02:42.800> kidney<00:02:43.490> is

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
glucose in my urine if my kidney is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.190 
glucose in my urine if my kidney is
actually<00:02:43.880> functioning<00:02:44.300> normally<00:02:44.420> slow<00:02:44.810> but

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
actually functioning normally slow but

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.290 
actually functioning normally slow but
glucose<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.680> small<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.520> expect<00:02:47.090> it's

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
glucose is small so I expect it's

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.090 
glucose is small so I expect it's
probably<00:02:47.720> going<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.080> squeeze<00:02:48.410> out<00:02:48.590> here<00:02:48.920> when

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
probably going to squeeze out here when

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.770 
probably going to squeeze out here when
I<00:02:49.130> don't<00:02:49.340> really<00:02:49.489> want<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.850> but<00:02:50.270> thank

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
I don't really want it to but thank

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.300 
I don't really want it to but thank
goodness<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.170> proximal<00:02:51.560> convoluted<00:02:51.590> tubules

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
goodness the proximal convoluted tubules

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.460 
goodness the proximal convoluted tubules
should<00:02:52.550> reabsorb<00:02:53.060> all<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.450> glucose<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:53.959> go

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
should reabsorb all the glucose and go

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.900 
should reabsorb all the glucose and go
back<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.830> tissues<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.489> when<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.819> goes

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
back to the tissues and when it goes

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.309 
back to the tissues and when it goes
back<00:02:56.060> on<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.180> tissues<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.600> jump<00:02:56.930> back<00:02:57.080> into

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
back on the tissues that jump back into

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.920 
back on the tissues that jump back into
the<00:02:57.410> bloodstream<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.950> return<00:02:58.640> black<00:02:58.970> well<00:02:59.720> we

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
the bloodstream and return black well we

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.759 
the bloodstream and return black well we
turned<00:03:00.140> back<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.620> my<00:03:00.860> actual<00:03:02.500> blood<00:03:03.500> stream

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
turned back to my actual blood stream

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.430 
turned back to my actual blood stream
and<00:03:03.950> bought<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.790> here<00:03:04.940> we<00:03:04.970> go<00:03:05.120> glucose<00:03:05.870> and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
and bought it so here we go glucose and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.430 
and bought it so here we go glucose and
my<00:03:06.650> prediction<00:03:07.100> is<00:03:07.600> right<00:03:08.600> it's<00:03:08.780> small<00:03:09.110> okay<00:03:09.410> I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
my prediction is right it's small okay I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.810 
my prediction is right it's small okay I
made<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.709> through<00:03:09.830> here<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.310> then<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:10.640> goes<00:03:10.790> to

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
made it through here and then it goes to

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.430 
made it through here and then it goes to
the<00:03:11.000> proximal<00:03:11.450> convoluted<00:03:11.570> tubule<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.230> should

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the proximal convoluted tubule it should

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.949 
the proximal convoluted tubule it should
get<00:03:12.530> oh<00:03:12.709> boom<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.550> gets<00:03:13.730> reabsorbed<00:03:14.030> back<00:03:14.900> into

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
get oh boom it gets reabsorbed back into

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.479 
get oh boom it gets reabsorbed back into
the<00:03:15.470> blood<00:03:15.680> stream<00:03:16.420> all<00:03:17.420> right<00:03:17.630> water<00:03:18.620> water

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
the blood stream all right water water

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.770 
the blood stream all right water water
is<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> little<00:03:19.760> bit<00:03:19.940> complex<00:03:20.300> start<00:03:20.540> with<00:03:20.630> let's

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
is a little bit complex start with let's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.059 
is a little bit complex start with let's
look<00:03:20.810> at<00:03:20.989> proteins<00:03:21.410> proteins<00:03:21.830> should<00:03:22.010> be

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
look at proteins proteins should be

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.710 
look at proteins proteins should be
really<00:03:22.370> big<00:03:22.640> they<00:03:22.819> shouldn't<00:03:23.150> be<00:03:23.209> able<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.450> fit

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
really big they shouldn't be able to fit

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.600 
really big they shouldn't be able to fit
outside<00:03:24.080> here<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.590> should<00:03:24.800> just<00:03:24.950> go<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.340> very

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
outside here so it should just go a very

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.850 
outside here so it should just go a very
boring<00:03:26.330> journey<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.080> just<00:03:27.410> come<00:03:27.590> back<00:03:27.709> and

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
boring journey and just come back and

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.670 
boring journey and just come back and
stay<00:03:28.069> in<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.220> bloodstream<00:03:28.519> let's<00:03:28.730> see<00:03:28.850> boom

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
stay in the bloodstream let's see boom

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.530 
stay in the bloodstream let's see boom
hormones<00:03:30.730> yes<00:03:31.780> yes<00:03:32.780> fantastic<00:03:33.700> wonderful<00:03:34.700> all

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
hormones yes yes fantastic wonderful all

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.210 
hormones yes yes fantastic wonderful all
right<00:03:35.780> water<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.530> sodium<00:03:36.739> gonna<00:03:37.010> be<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.100> little

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
right water and sodium gonna be a little

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.250 
right water and sodium gonna be a little
more<00:03:37.400> tricky<00:03:37.579> water<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.329> should<00:03:38.390> expect<00:03:39.049> that

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
more tricky water I should expect that

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.920 
more tricky water I should expect that
some<00:03:39.530> water<00:03:39.880> will<00:03:40.880> get<00:03:41.450> into<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.690> urine

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
some water will get into the urine

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.470 
some water will get into the urine
otherwise<00:03:42.320> that'd<00:03:42.650> be<00:03:42.769> gross<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.370> have<00:03:44.090> just

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
otherwise that'd be gross to have just

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.660 
otherwise that'd be gross to have just
solid<00:03:44.750> urine<00:03:45.230> okay<00:03:45.650> some<00:03:45.950> animals<00:03:46.280> actually

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
solid urine okay some animals actually

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.979 
solid urine okay some animals actually
have<00:03:47.120> semi-solid

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
have semi-solid

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.199 
have semi-solid
you're<00:03:48.560> in<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.860> should<00:03:49.160> expect<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.730> water<00:03:49.910> of

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
you're in I should expect the water of

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.699 
you're in I should expect the water of
course<00:03:50.480> really<00:03:50.870> small<00:03:51.200> someone<00:03:51.530> will

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
course really small someone will

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.289 
course really small someone will
probably<00:03:51.799> stay<00:03:52.280> at<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.459> blood<00:03:52.640> stream<00:03:52.790> yes<00:03:53.150> I

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
probably stay at the blood stream yes I

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.050 
probably stay at the blood stream yes I
hope<00:03:53.420> so<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.870> someone<00:03:54.530> will<00:03:54.709> get<00:03:54.860> out<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.280> lot

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
hope so that someone will get out a lot

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.490 
hope so that someone will get out a lot
of<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.239> will<00:03:56.360> get<00:03:56.450> reabsorbed<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.230> then

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
of it will get reabsorbed and then

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.960 
of it will get reabsorbed and then
something's<00:03:58.070> gonna<00:03:58.190> happen<00:03:58.430> here<00:03:58.850> to

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
something's gonna happen here to

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.640 
something's gonna happen here to
remember<00:03:59.090> which<00:03:59.390> side<00:03:59.660> is<00:03:59.989> permeable<00:04:00.500> to

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
remember which side is permeable to

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.650 
remember which side is permeable to
water<00:04:00.799> it<00:04:01.250> should<00:04:01.519> be<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.820> descending<00:04:02.480> loop

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
water it should be the descending loop

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.080 
water it should be the descending loop
so<00:04:02.810> let's<00:04:02.870> take<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> look<00:04:03.380> at<00:04:03.500> water<00:04:03.859> here<00:04:04.579> oops

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
so let's take a look at water here oops

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.349 
so let's take a look at water here oops
I've<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:06.260> want<00:04:06.859> to<00:04:06.920> start<00:04:07.070> over<00:04:07.190> okay<00:04:07.790> here<00:04:08.269> we

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
I've I want to start over okay here we

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.770 
I've I want to start over okay here we
go<00:04:08.500> so<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:10.070> water<00:04:10.310> there<00:04:10.700> we<00:04:10.790> go<00:04:10.970> there<00:04:11.630> we<00:04:11.750> go

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
go so the water there we go there we go

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.240 
go so the water there we go there we go
hi<00:04:12.650> come<00:04:12.950> on<00:04:13.040> in

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
hi come on in

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.220 
hi come on in
that's<00:04:13.459> okay<00:04:13.730> see<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.390> water<00:04:14.720> there<00:04:14.959> we<00:04:15.140> go

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
that's okay see the water there we go

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.719 
that's okay see the water there we go
it's<00:04:15.410> heading<00:04:15.650> back<00:04:15.769> in<00:04:16.010> it's<00:04:16.250> permeable<00:04:16.609> here

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
it's heading back in it's permeable here

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.890 
it's heading back in it's permeable here
but<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:16.940> shouldn't<00:04:17.120> be<00:04:17.150> jumping<00:04:17.329> out<00:04:17.510> here<00:04:17.720> and

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
but it shouldn't be jumping out here and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.940 
but it shouldn't be jumping out here and
it's<00:04:18.019> going<00:04:18.140> back<00:04:18.289> to<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.470> blood<00:04:18.620> stream<00:04:18.739> it's

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
it's going back to the blood stream it's

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.560 
it's going back to the blood stream it's
going<00:04:19.190> back<00:04:19.340> up<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.700> little<00:04:19.789> up<00:04:20.000> you<00:04:20.329> got<00:04:20.479> to

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
going back up a little up you got to

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.120 
going back up a little up you got to
check<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:20.750> out<00:04:20.989> yourself<00:04:21.680> one<00:04:21.829> more<00:04:21.950> time

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
check this out yourself one more time

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.159 
check this out yourself one more time
and<00:04:22.610> then<00:04:22.729> finally<00:04:23.030> we're<00:04:23.720> gonna<00:04:23.780> look<00:04:23.990> at

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
and then finally we're gonna look at

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.500 
and then finally we're gonna look at
sodium<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.220> let's<00:04:25.400> look<00:04:25.550> at<00:04:25.669> sodium<00:04:26.030> one<00:04:26.360> more

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
sodium so let's look at sodium one more

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.000 
sodium so let's look at sodium one more
time<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.110> sodium<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.680> should<00:04:27.830> find

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
time and the sodium you should find

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.529 
time and the sodium you should find
sodium<00:04:28.370> is<00:04:28.430> really<00:04:28.640> really<00:04:28.789> small<00:04:29.060> I'm<00:04:29.330> almost

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
sodium is really really small I'm almost

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.320 
sodium is really really small I'm almost
done<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:29.990> low<00:04:30.410> sodium<00:04:30.620> it<00:04:31.250> should<00:04:31.490> be<00:04:31.610> some<00:04:32.300> of

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
done and low sodium it should be some of

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.000 
done and low sodium it should be some of
it<00:04:32.510> gets<00:04:32.810> reabsorbed<00:04:33.110> back<00:04:33.500> but<00:04:33.740> somebody

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
it gets reabsorbed back but somebody

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.219 
it gets reabsorbed back but somebody
stays<00:04:34.190> inside<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.520> blood<00:04:34.760> stream<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.240> some

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
stays inside the blood stream and some

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:37.960 
stays inside the blood stream and some
of<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.440> will<00:04:36.560> come<00:04:36.800> out<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.160> do<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.430> ascending

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
of it will come out and do the ascending

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.640 
of it will come out and do the ascending
loop<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.330> make<00:04:38.479> this<00:04:38.600> area<00:04:38.840> really

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
loop to make this area really

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.560 
loop to make this area really
and<00:04:39.949> if<00:04:40.130> it's<00:04:40.250> really<00:04:40.430> really<00:04:40.760> salty<00:04:41.000> that's

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
and if it's really really salty that's

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.300 
and if it's really really salty that's
gonna<00:04:41.750> help<00:04:41.990> if<00:04:42.470> we<00:04:42.680> need<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.860> bring<00:04:43.100> water

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
gonna help if we need to bring water

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.490 
gonna help if we need to bring water
back<00:04:43.430> here<00:04:43.790> for<00:04:43.970> very<00:04:44.180> dehydrated<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.290> check

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
back here for very dehydrated so check

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.070 
back here for very dehydrated so check
out<00:04:45.650> this<00:04:45.770> animation<00:04:46.130> on<00:04:46.400> your<00:04:46.550> own<00:04:46.669> and<00:04:47.080> let
