00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
milled so it's hardly noticeable but it

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.039 
milled so it's hardly noticeable but it
does<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.700> illuminating<00:02:28.540> effect<00:02:28.870> on

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
more tan without actually adding a

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.570 
more tan without actually adding a
bronzer<00:02:35.110> as<00:02:35.260> well<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:36.069> really<00:02:36.370> nice

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
bronzer as well so that is a really nice

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.280

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
actually adding any bronze the next one

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.680 
actually adding any bronze the next one
is<00:02:41.950> actually<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> favorite<00:02:42.730> that's<00:02:42.970> also<00:02:43.329> purse

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
through it which I'm guessing by the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.319 
through it which I'm guessing by the
point<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:36.069> this<00:03:36.160> video<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:36.669> you<00:03:36.790> know<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.000> like

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
point of this video that you know I like

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
just because I like my blushes to be a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.250 
just because I like my blushes to be a
bit<00:03:39.489> illuminating<00:03:40.209> as<00:03:40.359> well<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.810> didn't

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
bit illuminating as well I didn't

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.990 
bit illuminating as well I didn't
include<00:03:41.349> that<00:03:41.620> many<00:03:41.919> cream<00:03:42.310> blushes<00:03:42.579> in<00:03:42.760> this

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
include that many cream blushes in this

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.610 
include that many cream blushes in this
video<00:03:43.269> but<00:03:43.389> I<00:03:43.450> wanted<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.810> include<00:03:43.989> these<00:03:44.380> too

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
video but I wanted to include these too

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.379 
video but I wanted to include these too
because<00:03:45.010> they<00:03:45.280> haven't<00:03:45.549> risen<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.150> top<00:03:46.180> of

steer a bit away from cream blush I find

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.349 
steer a bit away from cream blush I find
them<00:03:50.709> quite<00:03:51.160> intimidating<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.120> they<00:03:52.180> don't
