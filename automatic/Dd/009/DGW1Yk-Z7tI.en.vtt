00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.360 

okay<00:00:01.110> I'm<00:00:01.500> going<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.709> show<00:00:01.800> you<00:00:01.860> how<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.070> use

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
okay I'm going to show you how to use

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay I'm going to show you how to use
jmeter<00:00:04.790> so<00:00:05.790> step<00:00:06.240> number<00:00:06.270> one<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.720> create<00:00:06.930> a

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
jmeter so step number one is create a

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.299 
jmeter so step number one is create a
test<00:00:07.140> plan<00:00:07.319> which<00:00:07.740> when<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.069> load<00:00:08.220> the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
test plan which when you load the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.730 
test plan which when you load the
program<00:00:08.429> up<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:08.790> does<00:00:08.910> automatically<00:00:09.590> next<00:00:10.590> is

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
program up it does automatically next is

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.910 
program up it does automatically next is
to<00:00:10.980> create<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> thread<00:00:11.910> group<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> you

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
to create a thread group so you

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.689 
to create a thread group so you
right-click<00:00:14.099> go<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.639> add<00:00:15.320> thread<00:00:16.320> users

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
right-click go to add thread users

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.029 
right-click go to add thread users
thread<00:00:17.699> group<00:00:17.990> this<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.439> actual<00:00:19.740> amount

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
thread group this is the actual amount

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.250 
thread group this is the actual amount
of<00:00:20.189> connections<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.570> jmeter<00:00:22.140> will<00:00:22.350> use<00:00:24.260> next

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
of connections that jmeter will use next

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.800 
of connections that jmeter will use next
is<00:00:25.590> create<00:00:25.949> an<00:00:26.130> HTTP<00:00:26.820> request<00:00:27.000> sampler<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
is create an HTTP request sampler and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.810 
is create an HTTP request sampler and
what<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.650> will<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.130> imitate<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.699> your

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
what this will do is imitate what your

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.930 
what this will do is imitate what your
browser<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.269> doing<00:00:30.539> whenever<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> visits<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
browser is doing whenever it visits a

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.010 
browser is doing whenever it visits a
website<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.660> jmeter

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
website so you can see that jmeter

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.569 
website so you can see that jmeter
supports<00:00:37.440> multiple<00:00:37.710> request<00:00:38.070> types<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.460> can

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
supports multiple request types you can

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.110 
supports multiple request types you can
do<00:00:38.730> FTP<00:00:39.829> SMTP<00:00:40.850> soap<00:00:41.850> RML<00:00:43.430> exbc<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.030> do

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
do FTP SMTP soap RML exbc so you can do

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.029 
do FTP SMTP soap RML exbc so you can do
many<00:00:45.239> types<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.260> should<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.620> HTTP

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
many types for now should we do HTTP

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.290 
many types for now should we do HTTP
requests<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> first<00:00:50.850> thing<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> do

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
requests so first thing you going to do

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.090 
requests so first thing you going to do
is<00:00:51.449> define<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.870> host<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.039> I'm

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
is define the host so for this one I'm

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.750 
is define the host so for this one I'm
going<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.140> BCC<00:00:55.140> our<00:00:56.809> website<00:00:58.609> this<00:00:59.609> is

the data you're getting and look at them

00:01:38.759 --> 00:02:00.830 
the data you're getting and look at them
different<00:01:39.000> ways

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170 

okay<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:01.979> we're<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.250> save<00:02:02.549> our<00:02:02.850> test

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
okay now we're going to save our test

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:20.090 
okay now we're going to save our test
plan

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.059 

hit<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.940> Run<00:02:21.090> button

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
hit the Run button

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.490 
hit the Run button
now<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.269> see<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.689> HTTP<00:02:25.079> requests<00:02:25.409> are

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
now you can see is the HTTP requests are

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.410 
now you can see is the HTTP requests are
sent<00:02:27.799> so<00:02:28.799> this<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.069> only<00:02:29.219> one<00:02:29.549> thread<00:02:30.180> one

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
sent so this is only one thread one

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.849 
sent so this is only one thread one
request<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.439> you<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:31.620> see<00:02:31.709> all<00:02:31.799> the

request so you can see all the

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.649 
request so you can see all the
information<00:02:32.189> we<00:02:32.280> see<00:02:32.489> HTTP<00:02:33.329> headers<00:02:33.540> that

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
information we see HTTP headers that

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.199 
information we see HTTP headers that
were<00:02:33.750> sent<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:35.069> can<00:02:35.189> see<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.459> response<00:02:35.819> from

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
were sent you can see the response from

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.300 
were sent you can see the response from
the<00:02:36.359> server<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.829> can<00:02:37.950> see<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.129> actual

the server and you can see the actual
data<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.790> case<00:02:38.969> we<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.209> see<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.329> HTML

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
data in this case we can see the HTML

and CSS if you want to do an actual load
test<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:44.519> number<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.819> threads<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.329> five

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
test to number of threads to five

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.399 
test to number of threads to five
ramp-up<00:02:48.000> period<00:02:48.030> ten<00:02:48.629> now<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.109> reason<00:02:49.379> you

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
ramp-up period ten now the reason you

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.199 
ramp-up period ten now the reason you
set<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:49.859> is<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.609> it<00:02:50.700> gives<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> Apache

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
set this is that it gives the Apache

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.050 
set this is that it gives the Apache
server<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.780> MySQL<00:02:52.170> database<00:02:52.260> time<00:02:52.739> to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
server and the MySQL database time to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.849 
server and the MySQL database time to
precache<00:02:54.090> some<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.689> data<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.739> way

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
precache some of the data so this way

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:56.750 
precache some of the data so this way
your<00:02:56.010> server<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.430> getting<00:02:56.639> hammered

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
your server is not getting hammered

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.099 
your server is not getting hammered
immediately<00:02:57.239> it's<00:02:57.359> actually<00:02:57.599> giving<00:02:57.780> time<00:02:57.930> to

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
immediately it's actually giving time to

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.199 
immediately it's actually giving time to
cache<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.590> data<00:02:58.739> behind<00:02:59.010> so<00:03:00.000> I'm<00:03:00.060> going<00:03:00.180> to

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
cache the data behind so I'm going to

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.780 
cache the data behind so I'm going to
loop<00:03:00.450> count<00:03:00.659> of<00:03:00.780> 100<00:03:02.989> now<00:03:03.989> go<00:03:04.139> back<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.790> play

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
loop count of 100 now go back to play

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.869 
loop count of 100 now go back to play
button<00:03:06.950> now<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.159> see<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.370> requests

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
button now you can see the requests

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.750 
button now you can see the requests
getting<00:03:09.269> sent<00:03:09.480> right<00:03:09.629> now<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.019> dev<00:03:10.169> server

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.929 

here's<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.909> threads<00:03:15.180> eat<00:03:15.689> as<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> table<00:03:16.939> and

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
here's the threads eat as a table and

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.550 
here's the threads eat as a table and
here's<00:03:18.329> interesting<00:03:18.450> one<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.049> graphing

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
here's interesting one this is graphing

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.979 
here's interesting one this is graphing
the<00:03:19.650> results<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.329> have<00:03:21.419> multiple<00:03:21.780> graph

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
the results so we have multiple graph

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.619 
the results so we have multiple graph
types<00:03:22.230> we<00:03:22.439> have<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.430> data<00:03:23.760> itself<00:03:24.090> we<00:03:24.480> have

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
types we have the data itself we have

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.680 
types we have the data itself we have
the<00:03:24.780> average<00:03:25.139> which<00:03:25.409> is<00:03:25.439> the<00:03:25.590> blue<00:03:26.510> we<00:03:27.510> have

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
the average which is the blue we have

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.949 
the average which is the blue we have
the<00:03:27.720> median<00:03:28.169> per<00:03:28.799> Blair<00:03:29.389> deviations<00:03:30.389> which<00:03:30.659> is

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the median per Blair deviations which is

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.289 
the median per Blair deviations which is
the<00:03:31.139> server<00:03:31.349> gets<00:03:32.099> overloaded<00:03:32.459> you'll<00:03:33.060> start

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
the server gets overloaded you'll start

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.550 
the server gets overloaded you'll start
seeing<00:03:33.419> more<00:03:33.569> deviations<00:03:34.049> happening<00:03:34.379> and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
seeing more deviations happening and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.530 
seeing more deviations happening and
then<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.579> overall<00:03:35.790> throughput<00:03:36.120> which<00:03:36.419> you

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
then the overall throughput which you

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.449 
then the overall throughput which you
can<00:03:36.659> see<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.470> ramp<00:03:37.650> up<00:03:37.799> time<00:03:37.979> here<00:03:38.010> so

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
can see is the ramp up time here so

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.309 
can see is the ramp up time here so
eventually<00:03:38.639> this<00:03:38.849> will<00:03:38.970> plateau<00:03:39.209> after<00:03:39.840> 10

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
eventually this will plateau after 10

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.039 
eventually this will plateau after 10
seconds<00:03:41.449> so<00:03:42.449> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.690> see<00:03:42.810> we're<00:03:42.959> already

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
seconds so you can see we're already

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.610 
seconds so you can see we're already
having<00:03:43.349> some<00:03:43.440> deviations<00:03:43.919> here<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:46.530> go

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
having some deviations here so we go

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.569 
having some deviations here so we go
back<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.919> the<00:03:46.979> results<00:03:47.280> tree<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:50.459> what's

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
back to the results tree so what's

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.860 
back to the results tree so what's
happening<00:03:50.879> is<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.030> lot<00:03:51.120> these<00:03:51.299> deviations<00:03:51.750> are

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
happening is a lot these deviations are

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.170 
happening is a lot these deviations are
probably<00:03:52.290> once<00:03:52.949> the<00:03:53.220> Apache<00:03:53.699> server<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
probably once the Apache server the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.960 
probably once the Apache server the
MySQL<00:03:54.569> database<00:03:54.659> are<00:03:55.500> starting<00:03:55.979> to<00:03:56.040> cache<00:03:56.220> so

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
MySQL database are starting to cache so

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.430 
MySQL database are starting to cache so
deviations<00:03:57.569> can<00:03:57.750> be<00:03:57.840> good<00:03:57.930> or<00:03:57.989> can<00:03:58.199> be<00:03:58.290> bad

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
deviations can be good or can be bad

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.939 
deviations can be good or can be bad
depends<00:03:59.069> on<00:03:59.159> the<00:03:59.220> context<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:04.470> we<00:04:04.590> can<00:04:04.709> see<00:04:04.859> how

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
depends on the context so we can see how

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.199 
depends on the context so we can see how
many<00:04:05.010> requests<00:04:05.519> are<00:04:05.579> actually<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:05.970> through

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
many requests are actually going through

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.240 
many requests are actually going through
so<00:04:06.810> we<00:04:07.019> every<00:04:07.169> day<00:04:07.199> we<00:04:07.349> have<00:04:07.439> 120<00:04:07.949> per<00:04:08.040> minute

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
so we every day we have 120 per minute

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.420 
so we every day we have 120 per minute
which<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.370> pretty<00:04:08.549> good<00:04:10.040> number<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.099> samples

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
which is pretty good number of samples

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.509 
which is pretty good number of samples
done<00:04:11.639> so<00:04:11.790> far<00:04:11.939> we<00:04:12.150> have<00:04:12.269> over<00:04:12.449> 230<00:04:13.229> so<00:04:13.379> far<00:04:16.519> so

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
done so far we have over 230 so far so

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.180 
done so far we have over 230 so far so
here's<00:04:17.729> a<00:04:17.789> really<00:04:17.940> simple<00:04:18.030> breakdown<00:04:19.190> tell

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
here's a really simple breakdown tell

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.050 
here's a really simple breakdown tell
the<00:04:20.250> request<00:04:20.519> sent<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.239> average<00:04:21.570> media<00:04:21.900> etc

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.129 

so<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.150> can<00:04:28.270> see<00:04:28.389> here<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.660> dev<00:04:28.810> server<00:04:28.840> is

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
so you can see here the dev server is

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.420 
so you can see here the dev server is
able<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.350> handle<00:04:29.590> all<00:04:29.710> these<00:04:29.830> requests<00:04:30.310> so

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
able to handle all these requests so

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.360 
able to handle all these requests so
basically<00:04:30.700> right<00:04:30.880> now<00:04:31.060> we're<00:04:31.210> imitating<00:04:31.690> is

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
basically right now we're imitating is

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.430 
basically right now we're imitating is
five<00:04:33.370> people<00:04:33.850> looking<00:04:34.810> at<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.990> site<00:04:35.230> and

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
five people looking at the site and

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.879 
five people looking at the site and
browsing<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.550> moderately<00:04:37.510> aggressively<00:04:37.960> so

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
browsing it moderately aggressively so

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:39.990 
browsing it moderately aggressively so
if<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.010> wanted<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.310> imitate<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.610> real<00:04:39.790> server

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
if you wanted to imitate a real server

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.940 
if you wanted to imitate a real server
load<00:04:40.240> which<00:04:40.510> you<00:04:40.630> can<00:04:40.750> do<00:04:40.840> is<00:04:41.020> crank<00:04:41.770> this

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
load which you can do is crank this

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.850 
load which you can do is crank this
number<00:04:42.130> up<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:43.139> three<00:04:44.139> hundred<00:04:44.290> four<00:04:44.800> hundred

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
number up to three hundred four hundred

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.580 
number up to three hundred four hundred
five<00:04:45.100> hundred<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.700> this<00:04:46.660> will<00:04:46.870> imitate<00:04:47.230> what

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
five hundred and this will imitate what

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.290 
five hundred and this will imitate what
the<00:04:47.710> site's<00:04:47.919> being<00:04:48.190> done<00:04:48.460> with<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.120> site's

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
the site's being done with the site's

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.120 
the site's being done with the site's
having<00:04:49.540> to<00:04:49.630> handle<00:04:49.900> as<00:04:50.080> it's<00:04:50.770> actually<00:04:50.860> being

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
having to handle as it's actually being

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.610 
having to handle as it's actually being
used<00:04:51.220> day<00:04:51.730> to<00:04:51.790> day<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.410> get<00:04:53.410> those

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
used day to day and you get those

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.500 
used day to day and you get those
results<00:04:53.770> as<00:04:54.310> far<00:04:54.370> as<00:04:54.610> how<00:04:54.669> many<00:04:54.730> simultaneous

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
results as far as how many simultaneous

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.690 
results as far as how many simultaneous
users<00:04:55.630> we<00:04:55.780> have<00:04:55.960> from<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.980> Google<00:04:57.580> Analytics

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
users we have from the Google Analytics

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.720 
users we have from the Google Analytics
website<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.590> can<00:04:59.650> see<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.040> throughput

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
website so you can see the throughput

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.890 
website so you can see the throughput
here<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.000> starting<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.300> level<00:05:01.480> off<00:05:01.660> a<00:05:01.720> little

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
here is starting to level off a little

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.240 
here is starting to level off a little
bit<00:05:02.080> so<00:05:02.290> we've<00:05:02.770> already<00:05:02.919> reached<00:05:03.130> that

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
bit so we've already reached that

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.520 
bit so we've already reached that
10-second<00:05:03.730> mark

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
10-second mark

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.690
