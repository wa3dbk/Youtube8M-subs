00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
that I wouldn't put in the work for it
but<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> end<00:01:08.869> when<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.990> concerns<00:01:10.140> at

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
but in the end when it concerns at

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.429 
but in the end when it concerns at
University<00:01:11.070> comes<00:01:11.310> first<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.170> things

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
University comes first and the things

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
University comes first and the things
that<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:14.070> want<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.640> channel<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.240> just

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that I really want on my channel is just

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.200 
that I really want on my channel is just
high<00:01:15.540> scoring<00:01:15.900> game<00:01:15.990> play<00:01:17.210> entertaining

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
high scoring game play entertaining

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.030 
high scoring game play entertaining
gameplay<00:01:18.630> more<00:01:18.840> than<00:01:19.049> anything<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.710> think

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that's probably the most important thing

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.070 
that's probably the most important thing
but<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.189> if<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.909> relationship<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.900> the

because<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.140> know<00:03:31.230> sometimes<00:03:31.650> i'm<00:03:31.920> looking

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
because you know sometimes i'm looking

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.520 
because you know sometimes i'm looking
around<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.880> they<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:33.900> never<00:03:34.110> really<00:03:34.380> had

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
around that they we never really had

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.570 
around that they we never really had
UAVs<00:03:35.100> not<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.269> many<00:03:36.420> UAVs<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:38.010> was<00:03:38.220> pretty

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
UAVs not that many UAVs so it was pretty

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.610 
UAVs not that many UAVs so it was pretty
difficult<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.239> find<00:03:39.450> anyone<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.470> know<00:03:40.560> I

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
difficult to find anyone and you know I

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.440 
difficult to find anyone and you know I
didn't<00:03:40.950> really<00:03:41.100> want<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.340> get<00:03:41.430> caught<00:03:41.700> out<00:03:41.880> so

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
didn't really want to get caught out so

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.180 
didn't really want to get caught out so
I<00:03:42.480> was<00:03:42.810> just<00:03:42.989> sort<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.260> making<00:03:43.530> my<00:03:43.739> way<00:03:43.920> around
