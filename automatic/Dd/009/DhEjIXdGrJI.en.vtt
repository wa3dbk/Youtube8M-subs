00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.340
 hello people I 'm just following me 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.439
 the training 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.150
 coconut pure water and that here now 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.010
 no product idea but now 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:43.350
 that's just what we can do 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.820
 From time to time we can do that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.050
 I would like to say goodbye in advance 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.680
 times shopping and the way of thinking 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.019
 get that for your own 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.059
 lifestyle all that you like yes for 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.100
 a lifestyle is and not somehow 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.750
 will you try more out of that 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.890
 head this way of thinking rauszukriegen that 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.739
 if I can do something that that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.449
 somehow fits there or in wages 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.820
 even when it comes to vegan tÃ¶nis or 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.380
 dry and try the times 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.030
 maybe you can look then 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:16.650
 a papaya or coconut water or 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.570
 no idea melon sowas for example 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.900
 yes I think you know what I'm 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.580
 want 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.960
 as I said I'm just now pulling 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.520
 the coconut water rhine drive on youth 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.320
 I've done the link below in 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.700
 which we have in the description 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.159
 in fact the colleagues are coming out 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.799
 Berlin 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.350
 coconuts are from Thailand where else where 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.179
 Otherwise they should come here and be horny 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.990
 is so I have already many 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.850
 things tried out, for example 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 Coconut what a tetra packs 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.990
 or from plastic bottles and so on 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.609
 First , it tastes best now 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.090
 Second, I'm not a big fan of 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.679
 I taste plastic and purely subjective 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.600
 it also we both could taste 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:06.399
 Subjectively, many others think it 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.860
 I also taste so slightly cooled on the 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.360
 best so here we have almost directly 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.850
 us a whole rod brought directly from 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.740
 the carton and the cool is just that is 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.590
 really only coconut water no 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.090
 preservatives no sugar and the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.440
 just tastes really cool come 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.590
 really holiday 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.090
 high proportion of example and me 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.570
 This is really just for you 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.970
 People like you so much daddy 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.680
 treat yourself to such sun rises and 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.360
 every two days to the summer or 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.650
 maybe even every day you can 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.990
 then pull something like that is that 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.510
 hottest ever and as I said 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.970
 have tried many things now and 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.350
 this tastes best with distance 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.860
 Tasting distance tastiest possible 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.690
 to and I can say something and you 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.880
 what you like to do for one 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.690
 to be lighter so as not to be against 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.010
 work so that is the message today 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.340
 That's the way people think it's good 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.340
 then
