00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 still a place where entry is 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.160
 really granted to a few but how 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:18.210
 you will understand I have a lot of knowledge 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:20.789
 at the top and so thank you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.699
 here I am that I told you we are 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.080
 really in the heart of the ship is from here 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.869
 that you check all the air 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.140
 conditioning and electricity so i 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.660
 lifts the propellers naturally water 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.030
 really drinking anything here 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.590
 in fact there is really a system of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.829
 check how you can see them all 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.780
 these panels and has a power 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.690
 immense we could compare it we say to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.710
 one to a town of about 40 thousand 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.570
 inhabitants 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.250
 think are six engines that produce 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.020
 this is the electrical energy then comes 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.260
 distributed in the various parts of the ship 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.750
 this is an old system of 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.930
 telecommunication with the bridge is a bit 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.430
 what was also on the titanic for 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.350
 it is clearly still clear today 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.000
 mandatory on this ship though they are 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.189
 so precisely sophisticated from the point of 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.810
 electronic view however it is clear that 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.350
 you must have it for any eventuality 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.350
 and here it is the system from which it is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 really command the propellers and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.640
 it is even from here that everything starts 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.350
 precisely because the captain of the ship 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.869
 must go through the manager of 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.610
 machine to have control and to 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.280
 have freedom in short of movement 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.720
 with the very fascinating propellers from here 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.009
 instead the three propellers are checked 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.960
 of the ship 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.740
 then let's see if I understood correctly here 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.979
 we have the two us pods that move to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.990
 360 degrees then give a big e 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.140
 controllability to the ship in the moment 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.320
 of the maneuvers and here we have the yes 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.299
 can central here it is fix the pods that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.299
 what stands still
