00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
windows logo I thought that was really

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.270 
windows logo I thought that was really
cool<00:05:18.270> how<00:05:18.480> it<00:05:18.600> has<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:19.020> windows<00:05:19.290> logo<00:05:19.500> but<00:05:20.160> it

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
cool how it has the windows logo but it

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.430 
cool how it has the windows logo but it
has<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.730> ten<00:05:20.970> obviously<00:05:21.480> for<00:05:21.660> ten<00:05:21.840> deep<00:05:22.020> then

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
has the ten obviously for ten deep then

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.530 
has the ten obviously for ten deep then
it's<00:05:22.590> got<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:22.890> like<00:05:23.100> dial-up<00:05:23.580> browser<00:05:24.180> logo

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
it's got this like dial-up browser logo

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.090 
it's got this like dial-up browser logo
right<00:05:24.690> here<00:05:24.750> with<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.170> arrow<00:05:25.380> on<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.710> globe

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
right here with the arrow on the globe

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.710 
right here with the arrow on the globe
on<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.490> other<00:05:26.730> side<00:05:26.970> it<00:05:27.060> says<00:05:27.090> world<00:05:27.450> wide

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
on the other side it says world wide

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.870 
on the other side it says world wide
wave<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.440> then<00:05:28.770> on<00:05:28.890> the<00:05:28.980> back<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.250> says<00:05:29.610> ten

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
wave and then on the back it says ten

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.030 
wave and then on the back it says ten
deep<00:05:30.120> with<00:05:30.450> some<00:05:30.480> kanji<00:05:31.020> which<00:05:31.050> also<00:05:31.410> says<00:05:31.740> ten

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
deep with some kanji which also says ten

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.710 
deep with some kanji which also says ten
deep<00:05:32.250> I<00:05:32.400> believe<00:05:32.760> it's<00:05:33.210> got<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.480> green

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
deep I believe it's got the green

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.570 
deep I believe it's got the green
underbrim<00:05:34.230> with<00:05:34.440> ten<00:05:34.650> stitched<00:05:35.160> into<00:05:35.490> the

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
underbrim with ten stitched into the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.770 
underbrim with ten stitched into the
bottom<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.000> yeah<00:05:36.300> I<00:05:36.330> don't<00:05:36.450> really<00:05:36.570> have<00:05:36.750> a

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
bottom and yeah I don't really have a

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.270 
bottom and yeah I don't really have a
story<00:05:37.080> with<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:37.470> snapback<00:05:37.710> I<00:05:37.920> just<00:05:38.160> think

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
story with the snapback I just think

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.470 
story with the snapback I just think
it's<00:05:38.370> really<00:05:38.580> dope<00:05:38.760> and<00:05:38.970> I<00:05:39.000> really<00:05:39.210> wanted<00:05:39.390> to

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
it's really dope and I really wanted to

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.090 
it's really dope and I really wanted to
include<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:39.930> in<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.140> video<00:05:40.230> because<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:40.710> loved

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
include it in the video because I loved

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.070 
include it in the video because I loved
the<00:05:41.250> design<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.640> snapback<00:05:41.910> I<00:05:42.330> really<00:05:42.960> do

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
the design of the snapback I really do

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.510 
the design of the snapback I really do
wish<00:05:43.170> it<00:05:43.320> was<00:05:43.410> curved<00:05:43.620> brim<00:05:43.830> I<00:05:43.950> am<00:05:44.100> going<00:05:44.370> to

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
wish it was curved brim I am going to

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.400 
wish it was curved brim I am going to
curve<00:05:44.820> it<00:05:45.000> but<00:05:45.540> it's<00:05:45.660> still<00:05:45.960> not<00:05:46.080> gonna<00:05:46.290> be

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
curve it but it's still not gonna be

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.870 
curve it but it's still not gonna be
quite<00:05:46.560> as<00:05:46.680> nice<00:05:46.860> just<00:05:47.010> because<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.370> crown<00:05:47.640> is

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
quite as nice just because the crown is

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.250 
quite as nice just because the crown is
kind<00:05:48.090> of<00:05:48.120> mental<00:05:48.450> for<00:05:48.630> a<00:05:48.660> flat<00:05:48.870> rim<00:05:49.050> so<00:05:49.170> when

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
kind of mental for a flat rim so when

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.020 
kind of mental for a flat rim so when
you<00:05:49.350> curve<00:05:49.620> flat<00:05:50.310> brims<00:05:50.610> you<00:05:50.760> see<00:05:50.880> how<00:05:50.970> the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
you curve flat brims you see how the

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.390 
you curve flat brims you see how the
crown<00:05:51.300> like<00:05:52.050> kind<00:05:52.350> of<00:05:52.440> folds<00:05:52.800> out<00:05:52.950> like<00:05:53.190> that

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
crown like kind of folds out like that

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.550 
crown like kind of folds out like that
that<00:05:53.700> just<00:05:54.360> tends<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:54.840> happen<00:05:55.050> when<00:05:55.320> you<00:05:55.440> do

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
that just tends to happen when you do

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.200 
that just tends to happen when you do
like<00:05:55.740> major<00:05:55.950> curves<00:05:56.340> and<00:05:56.610> then<00:05:56.910> it<00:05:57.000> doesn't

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
like major curves and then it doesn't

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.270 
like major curves and then it doesn't
look<00:05:57.420> as<00:05:57.510> good<00:05:57.540> but<00:05:57.900> still<00:05:58.200> it's<00:05:58.770> gonna<00:05:59.010> feel<00:05:59.250> a

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
look as good but still it's gonna feel a

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.250 
look as good but still it's gonna feel a
lot<00:05:59.460> better<00:05:59.670> than<00:06:00.030> it<00:06:00.360> would<00:06:00.630> is<00:06:00.780> a<00:06:00.810> flat<00:06:01.050> brim

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
lot better than it would is a flat brim

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.660 
lot better than it would is a flat brim
so<00:06:01.470> I'm<00:06:01.590> still<00:06:01.770> going<00:06:01.890> to<00:06:01.920> do<00:06:02.010> it<00:06:02.130> anyways<00:06:02.460> that

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
so I'm still going to do it anyways that

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.300 
so I'm still going to do it anyways that
