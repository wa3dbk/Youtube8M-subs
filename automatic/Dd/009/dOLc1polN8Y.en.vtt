is<00:01:50.810> publicity<00:01:51.810> trying<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.039> it<00:01:53.159> closer<00:01:53.429> to

is publicity trying to get it closer to
make<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> fight<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.390> interesting<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.619> think

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
make the fight more interesting I think

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.029 
make the fight more interesting I think
that<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:57.319> Margarito<00:01:58.319> is<00:01:58.380> probably<00:01:58.860> in

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
that you know Margarito is probably in

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.649 
that you know Margarito is probably in
the<00:01:59.130> best<00:01:59.280> shape<00:01:59.429> that<00:01:59.789> he's<00:02:00.030> ever<00:02:00.210> been<00:02:00.420> in

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the best shape that he's ever been in

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.510 
the best shape that he's ever been in
and<00:02:01.200> everybody<00:02:01.560> knows<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:02.009> he's<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.190> hard

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and everybody knows that he's a hard

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.139 
and everybody knows that he's a hard
hitter<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:04.350> know<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.069> be<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> should

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
hitter you know it's gonna be a should

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.479 
hitter you know it's gonna be a should
be<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.360> good<00:02:06.690> fight<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.799> think<00:02:08.070> that<00:02:08.250> more

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
be a good fight and I think that more

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.910 
be a good fight and I think that more
people<00:02:08.519> are<00:02:08.940> realizing<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.500> truoc

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
people are realizing that the truoc

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.560 
people are realizing that the truoc
should<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.370> been<00:02:11.489> probably<00:02:11.760> seven<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.329> one

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
should have been probably seven to one

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.890
