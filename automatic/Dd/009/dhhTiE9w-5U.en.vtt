00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
technique or the lik here is it's a G

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
technique or the lik here is it's a G
chord<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.620> little<00:01:19.950> triad<00:01:20.510> ok<00:01:21.510> but<00:01:22.260> really

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
if you can master that technique in that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.480 
if you can master that technique in that
lit<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.930> can<00:02:03.140> use<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.740> in<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.310> many

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
lit you can use that in so many

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.430 
lit you can use that in so many
different<00:02:04.760> songs<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.480> approaches<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.140> feels

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
so in this particular feel I'm playing

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.880 
so in this particular feel I'm playing
this<00:02:10.580> G<00:02:10.850> chord<00:02:11.120> I'm<00:02:11.600> also<00:02:12.230> alternating

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
this G chord I'm also alternating

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.670 
this G chord I'm also alternating
between<00:02:13.150> taking<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.300> third<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.960> leaving<00:02:15.590> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
between taking the third and leaving the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.480 
between taking the third and leaving the
open<00:02:16.070> string<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.840> open<00:02:18.290> G<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:19.100> kind<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.370> get

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
open string the open G to kind of get

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.380 
open string the open G to kind of get
like<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> banjo<00:02:20.240> feel

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.790 

play<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.450> right<00:02:24.630> up<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.050> fore<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.740> to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
play it right up to the fore and I go to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.520 
play it right up to the fore and I go to
the<00:02:25.980> C<00:02:26.220> chord<00:02:26.490> here<00:02:26.820> up<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> 7th<00:02:28.200> fret<00:02:28.320> and

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530

the C chord here up on the 7th fret and
do<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.800> same<00:02:28.980> thing

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.080 

and<00:02:32.250> I'll<00:02:32.370> even<00:02:32.610> leave<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:33.030> open

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.850 

and<00:02:36.930> then<00:02:37.080> on<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.319> 5<00:02:37.560> i'm<00:02:38.069> doing<00:02:38.459> an<00:02:38.550> inversion

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
and then on the 5 i'm doing an inversion

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.470 
and then on the 5 i'm doing an inversion
over<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.010> d<00:02:41.220> which<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.519> really<00:02:41.849> just<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.150> d

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
over the d which is really just to d

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.900 
over the d which is really just to d
with<00:02:42.840> an<00:02:42.959> f-sharp<00:02:43.140> here's<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.920> cord

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:54.880 

can<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.720> pull<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.250> G<00:02:49.250> open

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.809 

and<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.069> cruel<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> there<00:02:59.489> there's

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
and that cruel is that so there there's

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.309 
and that cruel is that so there there's
the<00:02:59.910> lickin<00:03:00.330> plane

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.800 

I<00:03:04.379> played<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.549> with<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.909> track<00:03:06.239> in<00:03:06.599> two

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
I played it with the track in two

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.239 
I played it with the track in two
different<00:03:07.019> fields<00:03:07.590> because<00:03:07.859> I<00:03:07.950> wanted<00:03:08.159> to

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:08.249 
different fields because I wanted to

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:10.399 
different fields because I wanted to
