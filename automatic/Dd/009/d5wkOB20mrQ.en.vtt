00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
snack so I usually have like a little

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.720 
snack so I usually have like a little
mini<00:01:00.780> mid-morning<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> an<00:01:02.160> afternoon

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
mini mid-morning one and an afternoon

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.329

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.160 
snack and then a nighttime snack and I
think<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.790> by<00:01:05.939> kind<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.360> eliminating<00:01:06.990> some

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
think just by kind of eliminating some

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.480 
think just by kind of eliminating some
of<00:01:07.260> those<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.619> reducing<00:01:08.130> them<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> think

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
of those and reducing them so I think

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.219 
of those and reducing them so I think
I'm<00:01:08.640> gonna<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.939> no<00:01:09.150> mid-morning<00:01:09.570> snack<00:01:09.780> I'm

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.090 
which does add up my third strategy is
to<00:01:26.790> walk<00:01:27.119> yes<00:01:27.630> I'm<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> CrossFit<00:01:28.560> girl<00:01:28.829> I'm

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
to walk yes I'm not a CrossFit girl I'm

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.530 
to walk yes I'm not a CrossFit girl I'm
not<00:01:29.130> into<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> high-impact<00:01:30.060> exercise<00:01:30.509> I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
not into the high-impact exercise I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.749 
not into the high-impact exercise I
don't<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.049> injured<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.490> know

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
don't want to get injured but I do know

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.280 
don't want to get injured but I do know
that<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.970> need<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.329> more<00:01:33.479> active<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.140> my

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
that I need to get more active so my

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.649 
that I need to get more active so my
goal<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.740> walk<00:01:34.890> 10,000<00:01:35.700> steps<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:36.299> least

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
goal is to walk 10,000 steps at least

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.050 
goal is to walk 10,000 steps at least
four<00:01:36.960> times<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.380> week<00:01:37.530> now<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.100> may<00:01:38.790> sound

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
four times a week now that may sound

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.640 
four times a week now that may sound
easy<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.720> certainly<00:01:40.020> isn't<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
easy but it certainly isn't in this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
easy but it certainly isn't in this
polar<00:01:40.950> vortex<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.640> I'm<00:01:41.729> living<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.090> right

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
polar vortex that I'm living in right

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
polar vortex that I'm living in right
now<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:42.899> I'm<00:01:43.020> super<00:01:43.350> grateful<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.860> my

to<00:02:35.840> skin<00:02:36.260> brush<00:02:36.530> now<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.160> isn't<00:02:37.460> actually<00:02:37.550> a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
to skin brush now this isn't actually a

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.670 
to skin brush now this isn't actually a
weight<00:02:38.030> loss<00:02:38.240> tip<00:02:38.570> but<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.870> does<00:02:39.020> complement

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
weight loss tip but it does complement

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.500 
weight loss tip but it does complement
it<00:02:39.890> because<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.490> kind<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.730> smooths<00:02:41.090> out<00:02:41.330> any

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
it because it kind of smooths out any

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.990 
it because it kind of smooths out any
lumps<00:02:41.930> or<00:02:42.050> bumps<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.680> feels<00:02:43.130> really<00:02:43.400> good<00:02:43.670> well

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
lumps or bumps it feels really good well

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.700 
lumps or bumps it feels really good well
maybe<00:02:44.390> not<00:02:44.570> always<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:44.990> good<00:02:45.020> but<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:45.560> good

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
maybe not always so good but it's good

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.500 
maybe not always so good but it's good
for<00:02:45.980> me<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.430> good<00:02:46.610> for<00:02:46.640> my<00:02:46.820> skin<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.209> it

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
for me and it's good for my skin and it

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.570 
for me and it's good for my skin and it
kind<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.690> makes<00:02:48.140> everything<00:02:48.290> tighter<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
kind of makes everything tighter and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.340 
kind of makes everything tighter and
firmer<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.090> it's<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.810> good<00:02:50.930> practice<00:02:51.050> to
