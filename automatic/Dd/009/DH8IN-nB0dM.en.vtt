00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.080
This is the most common way that I have been
wearing my hair lately...my hair over to one

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.429
side and then I use usually a hair fork, sometimes
I use a scrunchie to keep it in place.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.080
..and I do use that one sometimes here, sometimes
the teeth will be pointing the other way,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.190
sometimes it will be pointing this way or
like different directions, I'll put it...

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.750
This is a lot larger than the one that's in
my hair right now.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.230
I do want to get one that is right about,
another that is right about this size and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.000
then that way I can wear two buns, two low
buns here with um similar or hopefully very

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.870
similar sized forks.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.610
I will put a hat on.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.899
I'll put silk underneath the hat.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.751
I have a couple of these in different colors
and then I also have different hats too that

00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:56.399
I, I wear.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.960
This is like a convertible hat.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:08.200
Um it can turn into a visor, like that, and
then it can stay as a hat so I use these a

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.729
lot and luckily I can wear them at work as
well.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.160
This is one of the ways I love to wear my
hair it's really easy.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.460
It just takes a few seconds to put my hair
up I'll show how I do it.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.299
I do a twist.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.479
Do just a twist here, a loop.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.960
I create a bun, and then I fasten it with
a fork and it stays and sometimes I will make

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.390
little adjustments around.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.110
This is an easy way; and then when I comb
my hair out dry, which I usually comb it,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.369
detangle it when it is wet..when I dry detangle,
I will sometimes wear a day with um, like

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.020
I try, I've been trying new hairstyles, there
just like the same hairstyles that I've been

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.909
using I just do them with my hair combed out
so I get a higher volume result so the bun

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.850
will end up a lot larger and it'll just be
fuller all over.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.979
Um but usually my hair is defined and I keep
it flat, I love to um add weight to my hair

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.950
by adding butters and oils.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.830
I love hair weighed down, and then I just
put it away; and often times with a hat, sometimes

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.450
without a hat but I love using the hat.
