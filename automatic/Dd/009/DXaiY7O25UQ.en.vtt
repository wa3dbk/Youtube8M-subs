00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.630 

I<00:00:04.350> think<00:00:05.350> what<00:00:05.500> I'd<00:00:05.620> say<00:00:05.830> is<00:00:05.980> that<00:00:06.190> there's<00:00:06.550> a

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:06.640 
I think what I'd say is that there's a

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.950 
I think what I'd say is that there's a
number<00:00:06.970> of<00:00:07.060> different<00:00:07.240> kinds<00:00:07.569> of<00:00:07.630> threads

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:07.960 
number of different kinds of threads

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
number of different kinds of threads
that<00:00:08.109> are<00:00:08.170> running<00:00:08.410> through<00:00:08.500> this<00:00:08.740> year's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.040 

what<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> feel<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.120> best<00:01:00.300> about<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.719> terms<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
what I feel the best about in terms of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
what I feel the best about in terms of
what<00:01:01.230> we've<00:01:01.350> selected<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.949> we've<00:01:02.129> cut<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.489> into

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
what we've selected is we've cut it into

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.640 
what we've selected is we've cut it into
two<00:01:02.730> programs<00:01:03.329> live<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.170> state<00:01:04.379> theater

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
two programs live for the state theater

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.340 
two programs live for the state theater
one<00:01:05.580> has<00:01:06.000> three<00:01:06.299> different<00:01:06.450> samples<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.259> his

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
one has three different samples of his

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.430 
one has three different samples of his
choreographic<00:01:07.979> work<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.580> takes<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.940> from

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
choreographic work and it takes you from

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.920 
choreographic work and it takes you from
his<00:01:10.440> most<00:01:10.680> recent<00:01:10.770> world<00:01:11.340> premiere<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.940> space

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
his most recent world premiere I space

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.370 
his most recent world premiere I space
to<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:14.040> remake<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.060> piece<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.659> 1950s

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
to a remake of a piece from the 1950s

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
to a remake of a piece from the 1950s
essentially<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.149> then<00:01:18.330> you're

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
essentially and so and then you're

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
essentially and so and then you're
seeing<00:01:18.720> another<00:01:19.380> project<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.159> truly

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
seeing another project which is truly

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.639 
seeing another project which is truly
biped<00:01:21.060> considered<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.930> most<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
biped considered the most one of the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:34.850 
biped considered the most one of the
most<00:01:22.710> seminal<00:01:23.130> pieces<00:01:23.399> that<00:01:23.700> he's<00:01:23.820> made

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.400 

in<00:01:35.610> program<00:01:36.150> B<00:01:36.390> you're<00:01:36.810> looking<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.260> two

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
in program B you're looking at two

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.490 
in program B you're looking at two
different<00:01:37.590> pieces<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.340> choreography<00:01:39.000> that

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
different pieces of choreography that

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.870 
different pieces of choreography that
really<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.950> emphasis<00:01:41.340> certainly<00:01:41.760> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
really I think the emphasis certainly is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.180 
really I think the emphasis certainly is
on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.540> collaboration<00:01:43.140> between<00:01:43.320> visual<00:01:43.740> arts

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
on the collaboration between visual arts

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.520 
on the collaboration between visual arts
and<00:01:44.400> music<00:01:44.910> sigur<00:01:45.510> rós<00:01:45.690> is<00:01:45.900> performing<00:01:46.350> live

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and music sigur rós is performing live

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380

sculpture<00:01:49.070> program<00:01:50.070> B<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.430> reflective<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
sculpture program B is reflective of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.640 
sculpture program B is reflective of
work<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.690> he's<00:01:51.810> made<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> past<00:01:52.320> three

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:07.550 
work that he's made in the past three
years<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.880> either<00:02:06.510> one<00:02:06.840> you're<00:02:07.170> gonna<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
years so either one you're gonna get a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
years so either one you're gonna get a
great<00:02:07.830> hit<00:02:08.040> across<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.240> both
