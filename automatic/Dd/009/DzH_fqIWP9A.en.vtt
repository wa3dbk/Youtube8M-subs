00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.910
 what's up friends 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.950
 I am nemesis and today I bring you a new 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.600
 glitch and well well friends already had 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.250
 time it does not bring them a clips of 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.859
 minecraft and here I bring you one 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.710
 totally new and good this glitch is 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.119
 how to hide our chests for 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.849
 that our friends can not find them 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.919
 but our led will survive m if you already 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.169
 You have previously made a video about 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.909
 how to hide chests but good friends 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.409
 this is a totally new way and 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.469
 As I said, it's a cliché 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.539
 the other one was very very easy and good 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.239
 it's a little more complex and more 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:42.329
 cash and good I hope you like it and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.890
 let's start with this glitch and good 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.199
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 have any kind of material in this 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.469
 case I like to use always 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 stone bricks, I'm going to do it 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.640
 of stone bricks but you what 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.499
 They can be made of wood and other things etc 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.539
 no and well let's start with the 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.980
 structure that we have to do and good 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.320
 this structure is going to be this way 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.449
 although we will not start with a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.260
 column of three so as such as 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.730
 I facilitate 1 2 3 and another here 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.860
 I'm going to do a little bit fast because it's 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.750
 a little easy to do this and another here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.940
 of three tall we will be this 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.100
 how you see it is not very difficult to do 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.410
 this and good now what are we going to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 need is a normal piston not 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.220
 sticky normal that we will put 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.100
 the following way we are going to put 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 here looking down 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.490
 ok as you can see we will be staying 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.890
 so go see here I'm going to do 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.660
 some shots so they do not get lost if not 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 if they did not understand it very well you know 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.470
 they return to life and point and good 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.110
 Now once this is done we are going to 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.640
 need again our rods 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.170
 of stone or whatever they are 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.150
 building and we 're going to put it here 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.240
 let's put a block exactly here 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.580
 there's now on top of that block we're going to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.800
 put a rail a rail detector or 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.080
 any other type of rail do not force 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.200
 is a detector can be a normal or a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.000
 of expulsion but I 'm going to use this ok 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.680
 they can be anyone not on top of 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.800
 block that we put we are going to put the area 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.229
 and the raid we're going to put there ok 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.290
 once done that we're going to need a 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.760
 wagon with chest ok as it was in the 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.170
 another tutorial that we also need 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.090
 a heel layer 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.830
 in this case it's going to be the same we're going to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.410
 put the trolley with chest we're going to 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.330
 put on top of the real king and he's going to 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.400
 remain as you can see it remains as a 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.410
 little delicate as you can see and the chest 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.450
 follow milk with him with the piston but 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.520
 So far we go well once 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.440
 let's have this we just remove the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.620
 block that we put the bottom one what 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.120
 we removed and as they see the kyle wagon that 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.850
 there it is there as you can see 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.190
 exactly well accommodated now over 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.050
 of the car we are going to put a block 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.019
 of what we have already built 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.720
 that we put the block in a little 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.450
 piston and now we're going to need a 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.489
 lever ok the lever we put it to the side 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.290
 of the piston to activate it and a 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.569
 Once we have everything already as they can 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.120
 see this is already completely finished 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.660
 now it's just to pull the lever or 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.420
 can put a button and activate and as 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.239
 come here give us the detector rail and the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.459
 chest is totally eclipsed in 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.140
 our material as you see gets there the 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.120
 only defect that he wants is that as 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.069
 can see there stays a little 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.959
 come out of the chest but I'm seeing 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.950
 no problem because I know why 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.260
 We can do this 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.900
 We put a block up and ready and no 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.900
 it looks we can remove all this 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.459
 where there is a chest, who knows and who knows 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.250
 the chest as we know I'm down here 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.680
 that it was like that combined with our 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.079
 material we simply give as if 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.120
 we were to open a chest we give 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.400
 left trigger to this block that is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.799
 here and as you see, it opens the chest and 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.329
 we can save what we want here I'm going 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.900
 to keep these vacancies that I have of 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.129
 We can keep and leave and good 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.019
 our friends are not going to know 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:56.390
 obviously there is something there they are going to say 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.390
 it is a wall we can not make it a wall 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.610
 and we can not make a wall anymore and there 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.489
 is going to see that there is nothing exactly 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.379
 nothing and good let's repeat again 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.629
 in case you do not understand it or we're going to 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.590
 destroy everything and then it came out as you see 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:14.090
 burst the chest we will remove everything ok 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.579
 you know the first thing we have to 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.650
 do the structure ok we do the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.109
 structure here I'll repeat it we're going to 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.760
 put our blog that after the blog 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.190
 that there is forgiveness I was wrong sorry 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.740
 sorry we put the piston that goes towards 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.770
 down this way ok we put our 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.650
 blog is above the block a rail and 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.979
 On top of the rail a car we remove the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.690
 block the wagon falls and now on top of 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.229
 the van we are going to put a block 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.190
 we put a lever next to the piston 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.590
 we pull 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.420
 and how they see there is now left of another 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.580
 way sometimes it looks good and sometimes 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.190
 it is wrong that is a defect as you see there 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.230
 appears somewhat black but hey sometimes you 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.300
 It may look good and sometimes it does not depend 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.670
 of the occasion although, but when 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.890
 it stays like that, just break it and come back 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.690
 to the sidewalk ok and good this is still 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.070
 the cliché is very easy to do as 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.580
 you can see here I'm going to break it again 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.710
 very easy to do very very very effective 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.170
 as you can see here I'm going to go back to 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:17.729
 make fast young he hides very well 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:19.690
 the chest and the chest we put 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.860
 fly 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.780
 We hid totally copper as 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.470
 I had said sometimes it comes out and sometimes nothing and 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.380
 again it did not come out we broke everything and there's no 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.020
 chest equal to already we can keep everything 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.060
 that we want in our chest and nine 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.310
 robert and good friends I hope that you 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.840
 have liked this cliché that is very 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.569
 very interesting how can you see very 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.300
 easy to do and they can hide their 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.220
 chests with a lot of security so that 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.610
 we troll them in their friends that they 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.020
 they remove their things or things like that ok and good 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.419
 I hope you liked friends leave
