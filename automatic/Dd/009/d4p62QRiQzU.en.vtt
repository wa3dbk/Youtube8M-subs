description box so that you can know i

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.549 
description box so that you can know i
basically<00:00:33.059> use<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> same<00:00:33.540> method<00:00:33.960> except<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
basically use the same method except the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.340 
basically use the same method except the
braids<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.130> i<00:00:35.280> use<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.149> braids<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.079> did

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
braids that i use the braids that I did

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.170 
braids that i use the braids that I did
underneath<00:00:38.090> underneath<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.660> wrap<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:41.180> made

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
underneath underneath the wrap I made

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
underneath underneath the wrap I made
fairly<00:00:42.660> fairly<00:00:42.870> skinny<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.829> knew<00:00:44.070> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
fairly fairly skinny because I knew that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.459 
fairly fairly skinny because I knew that
I'd<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.520> wrapping<00:00:44.940> hair<00:00:45.420> around<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.079> braids

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I'd be wrapping hair around the braids

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.150 
I'd be wrapping hair around the braids
as<00:00:46.850> really<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.879> only<00:00:48.120> difference<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> I'm

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
as really the only difference so I'm

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
as really the only difference so I'm
going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.370> show<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.520> today<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:50.850> i<00:00:51.559> refresh

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.860 

and<00:02:13.260> we've<00:02:13.980> wrapped<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.730> don't<00:02:15.240> know<00:02:15.360> three<00:02:15.840> or

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and we've wrapped I don't know three or

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.660 
and we've wrapped I don't know three or
four<00:02:16.080> times<00:02:16.290> enough<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.280> nice<00:02:17.610> and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
four times enough so that it is nice and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.290 
four times enough so that it is nice and
tight<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.239> start<00:02:18.569> rapping<00:02:19.670> down<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.150> get

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
tight you start rapping down you get

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.309 
tight you start rapping down you get
closer<00:02:23.209> start<00:02:24.209> rapping<00:02:24.900> down<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
closer start rapping down so it's the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.160 
closer start rapping down so it's the
exact<00:02:28.709> opposite<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.280> what<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.640> did<00:02:30.170> actually

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
exact opposite of what you did actually

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.720 
exact opposite of what you did actually
those<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> exact<00:02:31.680> same<00:02:31.920> as<00:02:32.190> what<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.370> did

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
those the exact same as what you did

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.180 
those the exact same as what you did
before<00:02:33.480> when<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.260> were<00:02:34.410> wrapping<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.950> braids

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
before when you were wrapping the braids

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.449 
before when you were wrapping the braids
initially<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:37.709> you're<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:37.920> wrapping<00:02:38.370> a

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
initially so you're just wrapping a

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.920 
initially so you're just wrapping a
little<00:02:38.700> bit<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.060> use<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.239> little<00:02:39.780> bit

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
little bit here and I use a little bit

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.380 
little bit here and I use a little bit
of<00:02:39.989> hair<00:02:40.230> because<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.530> don't<00:02:40.769> want<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.040> change

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
of hair because I don't want to change

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.160 
of hair because I don't want to change
the<00:02:42.390> thickness<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.709> braids<00:02:43.980> and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
the thickness of the braids and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.210 
the thickness of the braids and
depending<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.230> how<00:02:46.319> many<00:02:46.500> times<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.830> do<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.100> I

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
depending on how many times I do this I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.620 
depending on how many times I do this I
want<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.519> wanted<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.940> top<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.480> all

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
want to wanted the top to be all

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.540 
want to wanted the top to be all
superfat<00:02:49.170> with<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.860> hair<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.370> then<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
superfat with with hair and then the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.550 
superfat with with hair and then the
bottom<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:51.989> thin<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:54.140> since<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.230> plan<00:02:55.440> on

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
bottom to be thin and since I plan on

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.050 
bottom to be thin and since I plan on
keeping<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.130> for<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> while<00:02:56.580> because<00:02:56.850> they

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
keeping this in for a while because they

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.670 
keeping this in for a while because they
took<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.450> long<00:02:57.660> that's<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.170> that's<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.530> real

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
took so long that's a that's a real

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.430 
took so long that's a that's a real
possibility<00:02:59.330> so<00:03:00.330> anyway<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.720> keep<00:03:00.959> wrapping

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
possibility so anyway you keep wrapping

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.340 
possibility so anyway you keep wrapping
