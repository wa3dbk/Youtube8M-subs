00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.870
 video with iphoneitalia.com today vi 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.750
 I say nanny it's a new one 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.849
 tweak for jailbroken devices there 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.559
 allows you to take full advantage of the icons 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.900
 that we find in the upper part of the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.580
 device by moving them to be 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.550
 simple with and for your favorite contacts 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.680
 to real toggles like those 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.720
 that we find in the control center but 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.580
 also customizable let's see immediately 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.580
 all the features of this tweet 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.600
 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.160
 video as I told you today we are seeing 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.680
 kobalia it is a new tweak for 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.079
 jailbroken devices that allows us 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.539
 to give up togos in the center of 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.610
 check by simply viewing there 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.460
 above instead of favorite contacts 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.860
 or recent ones introduced by apple in ios 8 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.589
 more than the control center e 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.030
 compared to other similar tweaks this one 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.570
 kobalia also allows us to 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.789
 customize the number the type and also 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.039
 the individual toggle functions for the 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.780
 control center moved precisely 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.789
 at the top of the device is 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.039
 accessible through the call of 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.560
 so much multitasking 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.069
 simple directly from the settings 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.750
 beyond this we can clearly 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.700
 press the individual keys 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.009
 to go to act on the single ones 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.720
 functions regulated by the latter 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.640
 so for example we will find buttons 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.560
 to adjust the data connection you don't 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.690
 there were before and then from the settings 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.929
 of customization we can also 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.420
 choose to view the pressure 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.969
 of a button or display also 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.710
 the relative text therefore what there is 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.420
 lets you make a button though 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.219
 with this view active 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.509
 it's not really the best because some 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.670
 texts are superimposed 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.740
 as you can see there is also a lot button 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.149
 comfortable respring so if you do a lot 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.460
 changes on your jailbroken iphone 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.890
 you will always have available in this 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.659
 way a respring button to run 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.759
 a reboot of the device when it is 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.399
 you will consider it more appropriate or necessary 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.329
