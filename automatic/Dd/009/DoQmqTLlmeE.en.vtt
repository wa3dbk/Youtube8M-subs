00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello, I would like to give you a review today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.389
 and a foundation routine to the max 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.550
 factor facility all day foundation 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.650
 It is now a new drugstore 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.020
 assortment available in several colors 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.560
 its so the cut is not 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.660
 new but the new colors are new and new 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.150
 be a factor, he is very good too 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.220
 I think I review the bubbles 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.380
 foundation times for you you will find max 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.949
 Factor everywhere in game 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.370
 drogerien at dm rossmann mÃ¼ller budni 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.000
 probably also and there it costs 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.420
 Foundation regular between 13 and 14 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.360
 Euro 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.190
 I have now bought as a posse by 20% 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.129
 on max factor had for around ten 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.469
 euro for it not in the price appropriate 13 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.079
 14 are already quite right I have half 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.579
 color since the last assortment 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.489
 Changeover has come in the assortment 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.579
 namely the color library fits right 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.340
 good to my light skin for reference 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.110
 I have at mccann to 15 at bobbi 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.240
 Brown ikb post at patrice suits me 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.840
 the half color of the upper class 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.600
 foundation very well and this is one 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.700
 techno mhra is the most splendid place with 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.189
 a light sting in the pink so the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.390
 arranges that is neutral in the shade 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.159
 but when you applied, however, 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.229
 it does not stand out too much and if you do 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.369
 she looks well with her neck blinded 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.710
 quite natural and quite good from the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.210
 foundation claims to delete a 3 1 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.810
 to be as the primer concealer 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.150
 remove 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.899
 I think we all know it 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.520
 nonsense a primer I use myself 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.200
 every day you can get a hammer there is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.670
 Definitely use but you need 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.950
 She does not necessarily let her go 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.280
 so very good at, however, wear wear 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.439
 I like her with the ebeling 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.329
 because she has and she loses it 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.960
 fact that here stands concealer in 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.549
 one quite a good hiding power so me 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.009
 think you can almost do it 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.250
 achieve full opacity what a 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.540
 drug was not good but that is 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.099
 I try a little bit to be held 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.860
 Prevent this by making this makeup 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.739
 suppose that leaves a good one 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.810
 hiding the lew suspected force 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.880
 but you do not look great at the end 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.800
 the result was simple 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.370
 will be better incorporated into the skin 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.110
 the transitions are better blinded it 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.730
 is easy for a good cover the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.190
 foundation in my opinion the best 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.330
 method 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.130
 but I still use one 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.030
 Concealer for the eyes, however 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.100
 blemishes or cement disorders 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.739
 she already covers pretty little things 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.780
 well off you did not have factor of 20 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.600
 I like that very much for everyday life 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.519
 if you will, of course photographed 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.930
 I would not wear it 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.510
 sun protection factor 20 is already pretty 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.430
 that could make sure that their 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.290
 wise face he had with lightning 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.970
 will be photographed and that is 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.920
 then light-reflecting pigments the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.810
 then of course not only the sunlight 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.890
 reflected by the skin but also 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.340
 the lightning thing that is relative 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.380
 matte but not great mathis I am 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.269
 still brother to it, however, is 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.040
 My skin is also very greasy if you 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.720
 it could be that dry skin 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.650
 the foundation too dry for you too 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.420
 dry out 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.859
 You have to try that yourself 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.260
 I just do not say that because I am 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.660
 with my greasy home no problems 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.430
 I think the durability is there 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.049
 really two hours shelf life 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.600
 managed to be worthy for much longer 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.540
 Foundation anyway do not want to wear 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.680
 So I am very satisfied for that 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.549
 The drugstore is really one 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.890
 enrichment in the fair-skinned segment and 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.510
 Now I want to show you 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.880
 if the fondation looks routine though 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.940
 I use this foundation I wish 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.470
 Have fun with the routine and before 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.790
 I start with the routine I do 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.590
 I still have my hair out of the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.390
 I just do not use a face for it 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.000
 hair gum and for the claims 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.860
 a normal hairclips and strands 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.410
 then I prepare my skin for the 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.470
 in which I make my bio the 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.350
 apply day cream and a thin one 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.260
 layer on the entire face becomes like that 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.870
 my skin matted and also donates 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.640
 this cream moisture because the make 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.919
 up can be a bit dry out 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.140
 if you are prone to dry skin 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.660
 I also still wear my core 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.810
 soon go eye cream under the eyes 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.160
 because then the concealer sits better and 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.010
 does not slip so fast in the wrinkles 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.960
 and of course I do that too 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.810
 both eyes and I do not use one 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.050
 ring finger and then it's time for 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.240
 the max factor facility foundation that 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.210
 it is a strongly covering foundations 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.970
 unite primer concealer and foundation 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.640
 should and I have the brightest color and 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.169
 I wear the opacity of something 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.580
 is mitigated and the whole is not so 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:04.250
 looks like a mask with evelyn make up 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:06.169
 and just give and there I do 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.550
 just such little jumping movements 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.780
 over with the sponge over my 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.330
 I do not know how to do that 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.310
 better describe and blinded 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.169
 the foundation is as good as it gets 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.720
 takes a few minutes but after that 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.060
 The result looks very natural 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.070
 as if you were doing the whole thing by hand 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.200
 or with a brush and forget 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.570
 not the transition between neck and 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.200
 face because you do not want a make-up 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.600
 have fires 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.700
 and that's what it looks like when you go 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.919
 only the foundation wears but I wear 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.510
 now under the eyes still the mobile 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.220
 fit with concealer on that is mine 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.800
 favorite concealer for under the eyes 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.780
 has a medium opacity and slips 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.130
 not so old strong in the wrinkles 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.419
 that always looks very funny when 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.610
 one does not yet blind the concealer 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.010
 That's why I use it here too 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.600
 again the ebeling megabyte user of 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.690
 I really like that moment because I think so 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.789
 just crazy is natural and so 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.030
 blindfold my concealer then take 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:01.360
 I overdress from make-up 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.220
 concealer cream and wear it on mine 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.160
 impurities on this concealer is 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.930
 waterproof and really covers it all 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.520
 there is actually suitable for tattoos 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.230
 and if you're the one for impurities 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.420
 then you only need a tiny one 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.760
 little bit so that the 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.880
 investment of 28 euros for this doll 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.010
 already worth it because you consume so little 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.170
 that you hold each other for a long time and so on 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.250
 looks my foundation routine then 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.860
 when I'm done 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.690
 Now all I have to do is go with it 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.530
 fix powder to make it durable 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.720
 and he uses i the prime account 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.820
 waterproof brother of patrice under 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.000
 in the eyes and in the tz I wear the 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.520
 with the real technics export facemash 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.170
 because he was still working on his brother 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.670
 better into the skin and that are 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.460
 the places where I either special 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.930
 strong shine or under the eyes 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.380
 I just my concealer again 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.720
 Fix better and then I'll take 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.540
 Just a kabuki brush and wear 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.670
 the rest of the face up and that was 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.200
 it already 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.790
 So that was the foundation routine 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.980
 I hope you liked it all 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.480
 because something is helpful for you in yours 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.190
 favorite foundation i would say 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.260
 my place time favorite is still 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.380
 which arranges place of patrice which is 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.980
 just a price star 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:21.800
 can really be very much for the money and 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.510
 what is your favorite foundation if 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.310
 saw her my last of people 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.170
 would I have with the assigned space 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.590
 foundation I moved you the 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.450
 here and I would say I wish 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:36.070
 Have a nice day and see you 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.070
 in the next video bye
