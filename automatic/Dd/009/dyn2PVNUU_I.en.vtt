00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
video a while back I think it was like a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
video a while back I think it was like a
year<00:01:04.769> ago<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.220> how<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.790> live<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.450> income

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
year ago on how we live on one income

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
year ago on how we live on one income
and<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.290> something<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.979> we're<00:01:08.100> really

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and that's something that we're really

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340 
and that's something that we're really
big<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.090> know<00:01:09.330> our<00:01:09.450> budgets<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.110> know

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
big on is we know our budgets so we know

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
big on is we know our budgets so we know
what<00:01:11.040> our<00:01:11.159> limit<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.909> we're<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.150> always

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
what our limit is so we're not always

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
what our limit is so we're not always
going<00:01:12.600> crazy<00:01:12.930> spending<00:01:13.409> money<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.890> we

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
going crazy spending money because we

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
going crazy spending money because we
know<00:01:14.130> exactly<00:01:14.490> how<00:01:14.670> much<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.509> how

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
know exactly how much we have and how

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
know exactly how much we have and how
much<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.990> need<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.229> save<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.979> second<00:01:17.400> tip<00:01:17.490> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
much we need to save the second tip I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.230 
much we need to save the second tip I
think<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.869> big<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.650> huge<00:01:19.979> don't<00:01:20.850> just

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
think is so big and so huge don't just

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.380 
think is so big and so huge don't just
buy<00:01:21.509> an<00:01:21.840> item<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.159> sale<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
buy an item because it's on sale you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.910 
buy an item because it's on sale you
don't<00:01:24.570> necessarily<00:01:24.689> need<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.650> fall

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
don't necessarily need it and I fall

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.649 
don't necessarily need it and I fall
into<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.250> trap<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:26.970> especially<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
into this trap a lot especially when I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.480 
into this trap a lot especially when I
