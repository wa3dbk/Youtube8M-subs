traditionally with me it seems that
every<00:00:24.039> time<00:00:24.250> I<00:00:24.720> leave<00:00:25.720> my<00:00:25.779> tarp<00:00:26.320> up<00:00:26.439> overnight

I<00:00:27.250> will<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.619> considerable<00:00:30.250> amount<00:00:30.640> of

I will have a considerable amount of

I<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.910> can't<00:00:37.089> account<00:00:37.300> for<00:00:37.449> it<00:00:37.720> unless<00:00:37.890> what

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
I just can't account for it unless what

I just can't account for it unless what
do<00:00:38.949> you<00:00:39.010> call<00:00:39.160> that<00:00:39.190> stuff<00:00:39.550> saying<00:00:39.910> it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
do you call that stuff saying it

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.910 
do you call that stuff saying it
stretches<00:00:40.660> overnight<00:00:41.110> or<00:00:41.530> something<00:00:41.830> like

stretches overnight or something like

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.799 
stretches overnight or something like
that<00:00:41.980> relaxes<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:42.940> little<00:00:43.000> or<00:00:43.300> something<00:00:44.160> so

that relaxes a little or something so
this<00:00:46.809> is<00:00:46.960> also<00:00:47.140> a<00:00:47.350> way<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.589> get<00:00:47.829> around<00:00:49.199> my<00:00:50.199> wife

with<00:01:12.610> this<00:01:12.820> little<00:01:13.540> chunk<00:01:13.750> of<00:01:13.930> bungee<00:01:14.320> you

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
with this little chunk of bungee you

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.620 
with this little chunk of bungee you
just<00:01:15.250> run<00:01:15.939> it<00:01:16.060> through<00:01:16.229> bener<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.220> prusik

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
just run it through bener and a prusik

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.719 
just run it through bener and a prusik
mm-hmm<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:19.979> she<00:01:20.979> doesn't<00:01:21.159> have<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.490> tie<00:01:21.670> the

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
mm-hmm and she doesn't have to tie the

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.100 
mm-hmm and she doesn't have to tie the
prusik<00:01:22.030> so<00:01:22.270> I'll<00:01:22.360> put<00:01:22.540> them<00:01:22.689> on<00:01:22.780> her<00:01:22.869> line<00:01:23.080> and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
prusik so I'll put them on her line and

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.510 
prusik so I'll put them on her line and
then<00:01:23.380> they're<00:01:23.500> always<00:01:23.710> there<00:01:24.070> that<00:01:24.280> you<00:01:24.490> just

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
then they're always there that you just

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.690 
then they're always there that you just
slide<00:01:24.999> them<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.479> fit<00:01:25.899> the<00:01:26.829> scenario<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:29.700> pull

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
slide them to fit the scenario and pull

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.480 
slide them to fit the scenario and pull
it<00:01:30.850> set<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:31.929> tight<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.409> know<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.770> set<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.399> and

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
it set it tight you know to set it and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.169 
it set it tight you know to set it and
forget<00:01:33.579> it

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
forget it

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.929 
forget it
sort<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.570> sort<00:01:35.109> of<00:01:35.170> event<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:36.310> that's<00:01:36.789> what

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
sort of sort of event so that's what

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.550 
sort of sort of event so that's what
we're<00:01:37.030> gonna<00:01:37.119> do<00:01:37.390> we're<00:01:38.109> gonna<00:01:38.200> give<00:01:38.380> this<00:01:38.499> a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
we're gonna do we're gonna give this a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.819 
we're gonna do we're gonna give this a
try<00:01:38.799> for<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:39.069> little<00:01:39.219> while<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:40.689> if<00:01:40.719> see<00:01:41.649> if<00:01:41.740> I

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
try for a little while see if see if I

00:01:41.829 --> 00:02:43.009 
try for a little while see if see if I
like

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:03:22.250 

that's<00:02:44.019> pretty<00:02:44.349> tight

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.230 

all<00:03:23.260> right<00:03:23.410> now<00:03:23.560> here<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:24.040> with<00:03:24.520> a<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:25.120> know

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
all right now here it is with a you know

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.670 
all right now here it is with a you know
under<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.540> load<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:26.080> suppose<00:03:27.990> another<00:03:28.990> prusik

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
under a load I suppose another prusik

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.030 
under a load I suppose another prusik
just<00:03:30.370> going<00:03:30.610> right<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> tarp<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.620> cross

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
just going right to the tarp on a cross

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.870 
just going right to the tarp on a cross
the<00:03:33.760> same<00:03:34.030> deal<00:03:34.240> on<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.480> other<00:03:34.630> side<00:03:35.880> there's

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
the same deal on the other side there's

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.790 
the same deal on the other side there's
a<00:03:36.940> little<00:03:37.060> deflection<00:03:37.720> in<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.500> original

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
a little deflection in the original

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.390 
a little deflection in the original
position<00:03:39.930> probably<00:03:40.930> no<00:03:41.530> more<00:03:41.560> than<00:03:41.800> I<00:03:42.010> used<00:03:42.280> to

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
position probably no more than I used to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.330 
position probably no more than I used to
get<00:03:42.610> when<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:44.620> would<00:03:44.860> use<00:03:45.010> some<00:03:45.220> other

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
get when I would use some other

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.320 
get when I would use some other
tensioning<00:03:45.850> device<00:03:46.120> here<00:03:47.880> also<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:49.090> might<00:03:49.270> add

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
tensioning device here also I might add

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.970 
tensioning device here also I might add
you<00:03:49.690> don't<00:03:49.900> necessarily<00:03:50.050> need<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.620> have<00:03:50.740> it

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
you don't necessarily need to have it

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.680 
you don't necessarily need to have it
doubled<00:03:51.370> like<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.760> do<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:52.120> could<00:03:52.270> probably<00:03:52.450> get

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
doubled like I do you could probably get

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.350 
doubled like I do you could probably get
away<00:03:52.810> with<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:53.140> single<00:03:53.620> but<00:03:53.830> I<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:55.120> like<00:03:55.270> the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
away with a single but I just like the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.790 
away with a single but I just like the
tension<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.780> gives<00:03:55.960> me<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.770> way<00:03:57.450> and<00:04:00.330> so<00:04:01.800> now

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
tension to gives me that way and so now

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.900 
tension to gives me that way and so now
I'll<00:04:02.980> take<00:04:03.160> this<00:04:03.370> tarp<00:04:03.940> down<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:05.700> we'll<00:04:06.700> see

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
I'll take this tarp down and we'll see

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.390 
I'll take this tarp down and we'll see
what<00:04:07.090> happens<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.690> ridgeline<00:04:08.400> after

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
what happens to the ridgeline after

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.580 
what happens to the ridgeline after
we've<00:04:11.610> taken<00:04:12.610> it<00:04:12.850> apart<00:04:13.470> traditional<00:04:14.470> right

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
we've taken it apart traditional right

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.210 
we've taken it apart traditional right
so<00:04:14.890> here<00:04:15.190> it<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.370> after<00:04:15.730> taking<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.420> tarp<00:04:16.690> down

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
so here it is after taking the tarp down

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.860 
so here it is after taking the tarp down
and<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.430> would<00:04:18.580> say<00:04:18.790> it<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.120> little<00:04:19.480> looser

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
and I would say it is a little looser

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.660 
and I would say it is a little looser
than<00:04:20.020> it<00:04:20.200> was<00:04:21.840> beforehand<00:04:23.160> what<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.190> didn't<00:04:24.550> do

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
than it was beforehand what I didn't do

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.030 
than it was beforehand what I didn't do
was<00:04:24.880> put<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.780> mark<00:04:26.080> on<00:04:26.260> here<00:04:26.470> yesterday<00:04:26.920> I<00:04:26.950> was

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
was put a mark on here yesterday I was

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.530 
was put a mark on here yesterday I was
playing<00:04:27.310> with<00:04:27.460> this<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.730> I<00:04:27.820> was<00:04:27.940> marking<00:04:28.270> the

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
playing with this and I was marking the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.690 
playing with this and I was marking the
line<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:29.470> make<00:04:29.650> sure<00:04:29.800> my<00:04:30.010> prospects<00:04:30.430> weren't

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
line to make sure my prospects weren't

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.240 
line to make sure my prospects weren't
slipping<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:32.440> doesn't<00:04:32.800> have<00:04:32.920> a<00:04:32.980> lot<00:04:33.220> of

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
slipping this doesn't have a lot of

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.710 
slipping this doesn't have a lot of
tension<00:04:33.520> on<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:34.020> but<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.970> would<00:04:36.970> say<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.510> it's

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
tension on it but I would say that it's

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.690 
tension on it but I would say that it's
tighter<00:04:38.200> than<00:04:38.500> what<00:04:38.560> I<00:04:38.800> normally<00:04:38.950> end<00:04:39.430> up<00:04:39.520> with

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
tighter than what I normally end up with

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.020 
tighter than what I normally end up with
after<00:04:40.030> an<00:04:40.120> overnight<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.440> like<00:04:42.370> I<00:04:42.460> said<00:04:42.520> it's

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
after an overnight so like I said it's

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.250 
after an overnight so like I said it's
something<00:04:43.240> were<00:04:43.980> experimenting<00:04:44.980> with<00:04:45.010> and

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
something were experimenting with and

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.010 
something were experimenting with and
we're<00:04:47.260> going<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.440> keep<00:04:47.530> trying<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:48.660> you'll<00:04:49.660> see

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
we're going to keep trying it you'll see

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.170 
we're going to keep trying it you'll see
what<00:04:50.140> happens
